 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Theodore M. Sperry Herbarium at Pittsburg State University houses approximately 65,000 specimens of plants, which help document the relatively rich plant diversity of southeast Kansas and adjacent areas. It is the third largest herbarium in Kansas and a seat of active research in plant systematics regionally and globally. The herbarium has fully implemented modern curatorial standards in the past five years and involved students in all aspects of this transition, including curatorial techniques such as specimen preparation, data basing, and digital imaging. The newly created Kansas and Regional Reference Collection is a stand-apart collection used to expedite and confirm tentative identification of specimens by students and other users of the herbarium. The Sperry Herbarium also houses important historical collections of past curators, voucher specimens of previous regional, national and international research projects, and research material of the present curator. Specimen usage internally and externally has increased in recent years following internal efforts to digitize information. The availability of data online significantly augments the value of specimens for current and future uses in systematics, ecology, land-use management, and other disciplines that rely on the distributional data of plants.\r\n \r\nThis project provides support for infrastructure upgrades and expansion for the T.M. Sperry Herbarium. The acquisition of 67 new full and 12 half-sized herbarium cabinets will expand its specimen capacity significantly, enhance the long-term security and preservation of collections, and allow for moderate but sustained expansion for approximately thirty years.  It also supports moving the Sperry Herbarium next door to the Hartman Building into a larger and more suitable location, which will increase overall workspace and enhance work-flow efficiencies.  The project plant includes data basing, georeferencing, and digital imaging of specimens and the accessibility of all data online through the NSF-funded iDigBio project (idigbio.org) and other portals such as The Consortium of Northern Great Plains Herbaria. Support for student training includes funding for a Masters student and four undergraduate students to assist with curation and move of the herbarium to its new facilities.  As a regional state-supported rural university, Pittsburg State University serves many first-generation college students and many from economically disadvantaged backgrounds.  Overall, the project will significantly enhance teaching, research, and outreach of the T.M. Sperry Herbarium and provide numerous experiential learning opportunities in one of the STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Sperry Herbarium at Pittsburg State University was funded by NSF Grant No. 1756276 for the proposal entitled ?CSBR: Natural History: Expansion and Curatorial Support of the T.M. Sperry Herbarium at Pittsburg State University to Enhance Teaching, Research and Outreach in the 21st Century?. The project ran from 2019-2022. The main curatorial objectives all were met successfully, including: moving the Sperry Herbarium to newly renovated facilities with more space in Hartman Hall; obtaining 79 new cabinets to expand the holdings capacity from ca. 45,000 to 100,000 specimens; and processing large numbers of backlogged specimens. Support also enabled the purchase of supplies needed to process backlogged and incoming specimens of a current MS degree. It also supported the creation of a new herbarium logo featuring the Willow-leaf sunflower, a regionally endemic species that is most common in southeast Kansas. Routine curatorial work during the grant identified 126 county and 3 state distribution records. Rounded to the nearest 100, curatorial totals for vascular plants included: 32,100 specimens newly databased; 10,300 specimens mounted; 1600 specimens digitally imaged. Over 16,300 (40%) of the vascular plants are georeferenced. Approximately 1400 specimens were deaccessioned, mostly for gifting to other herbaria. For bryophytes, 3200 specimens were curated and approximately 1500 set aside for gifting. Presently the Sperry Herbarium houses 48,800 specimens representing 59 countries, 48 of the 50 US states, and most Canadian provinces. Specimens from the USA represent 78.1% of the holdings, whereas those from Kansas represent 43.0%. Relatively large holdings from foreign countries, which reflect the research interests of present and past curators, include Peru, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, and New Caledonia. Approximately 87% of the specimens are vascular plants, whereas 13% are mosses, liverworts, or hornworts. Specimens were separated geographically into color-coded, acid-free folders: plain for Kansas, green for the remainder of North America north of Mexico, yellow for the Americas from Mexico southward, and red for the Old World and Pacific regions. Specimen data are available from the Consortium of Northern Great Plains Herbaria (<a href=\"https://ngpherbaria.org/portal/collections/misc/collprofiles.php?collid=177\">https://ngpherbaria.org/portal/collections/misc/collprofiles.php?collid=177</a>) or Consortium of North American Bryophyte Herbaria (<a href=\"https://bryophyteportal.org/portal/\">https://bryophyteportal.org/portal/</a>). The grant significantly bolstered broader impacts of the Sperry Herbarium. Sixteen students participated in curatorial activities. Of these, two were graduate students and fourteen were undergraduate students; twelve were female and four were male; two were international students (China and Paraguay); and two were from under-represented (LatinX) ethnic groups in the STEM fields. The herbarium participated in the 2019 WeDigBio digitization event. The grant supported the master?s degree thesis research of one graduate student entirely and a second student for one academic year. Over 800 specimens in the Sperry Herbarium are used routinely across a two-year teaching cycle for courses in Taxonomy of Vascular Plants, Grass Taxonomy, Wetland Plants, and irregularly offered advanced courses in plant taxonomy and grass taxonomy. The Kansas and Regional Reference Collection, a stand-apart collection within the herbarium to expedite identifications, expanded its holdings based on the intense levels of curation during the grant. The Sperry Herbarium now is a fully modernized, well-curated facility with significant holdings. It is an important teaching, research, and outreach facility of the Department of Biology at Pittsburg State University and is capable of absorbing specimens from routine and focused collecting activities for at least two decades.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/09/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Neil&nbsp;Snow</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1756276/1756276_10571897_1660071175635_Curatingathome2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1756276/1756276_10571897_1660071175635_Curatingathome2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Curating during COVID lockdown\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1756276/1756276_10571897_1660071175635_Curatingathome2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Curating during COVID lockdown\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Curating specimens at home during COVID lockdown at PSU, April 2022.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Neil Snow</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Neil&nbsp;Snow</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Curating during COVID lockdown</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1756276/1756276_10571897_1660070094760_LOGO_SperryHerb_CMYK--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1756276/1756276_10571897_1660070094760_LOGO_SperryHerb_CMYK--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Sperry Herbarium Logo\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1756276/1756276_10571897_1660070094760_LOGO_SperryHerb_CMYK--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Sperry Herbarium Logo\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The newly created logo, featuring Willow-leaf Sunflower, of the T.M.
