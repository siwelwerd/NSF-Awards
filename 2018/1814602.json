 "awd_abstract_narration": "Authorship attribution techniques identify the author of an unsigned document such as an e-mail, memo, or social media post by analyzing candidate authors' writing styles for tell-tale \"fingerprints\" such as distinctive words and sentence structure. Everyone leaves these fingerprints in his or her writing.  This creates a problem for people who have a need to remain anonymous, people including whistleblowers and journalists working in states hostile to their work. Because a small sample of prose risks exposing the identity of a writer, guarantees of anonymity and confidentiality offered by government-sponsored whistleblower programs are difficult to sustain.  Many strategies have been proposed for protecting writers from attackers who want to discover their identities. This research compares the effectiveness of these methods and develops software to help individuals write documents in ways that minimize information revealed about their identities.\r\n\r\nThis project characterizes the effectiveness of known defenses against authorship attribution attacks, including a novel defense which requires a source to write using a widely-used simplified variant of English. The project develops software which provides interactive feedback to sources who need to write prose which does not reveal their identity. This software tool supports automatic, non-interactive rewriting of English prose that preserves the semantic content of a document while removing identifying stylistic fingerprints. The research translates into deliverables which are of practical use to organizations and corporations running anonymous and confidential whistleblower programs to better protect the identities of sources and, in doing so, make reporting suspected wrongdoing less risky. The project will involve graduate and undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

People are known to have highly individual ways of expressing themselves, many of which they are not even consciously aware of. This kind of attribution, then, can be very helpful to learn who wrote a given document, but could also be a nightmare in the hands of a despotic government trying to track down a whistleblower.\r\n\n\nWe used a collection of essays written by people in their natural style, and also written using different masking techniques, including obfuscation (trying to write in a different style from one's normal one), imitationon (trying to write in the specific style of a well-known author [Cormac McCarthy]), or simplification (writing in a version of English with reduced complexity and vocabulary). We then looked at this corpus using hundreds of thousands of machine learning techniques using JGAAP (the NSF-funded Java Graphical Authorship Attribution Program), to see if documents could be attributed to their correct authors despite possible stylistic changes.\r\n\n\nUnfortunately, we were unable to find any reliable ways to determine authorship or even reliably to detect the presence and type of modification that might have been used. In light of the potential importance of authorship attribution, and of the potential injuries of unreliability if used in a high-stakes environment like legal proceedings or academic integrity violation, further research in this area is important.\r\n\n\nWe have identified and started two new project to help address this.
