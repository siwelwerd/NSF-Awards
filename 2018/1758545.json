 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will research and develop new functional materials for advanced additive manufacturing. The goal of this project is to develop high performance materials for light activated 3D printers. If successful, this will enable new tools for manufacturing and research. Applications of this project would enable affordable, waste-free, and energy-efficient manufacturing with the goal of lowering barriers to innovation. Specifically, this project has the potential to improve the quality of healthcare around the world, by dramatically lowering the costs of designing and manufacturing biomedical devices.\r\n\r\npolySpectra has developed a new class of modular 3D printing resins, capable of manufacturing production-quality parts with tailored geometry and chemical functionality in a single step. This process is called ?functional lithography,? and it unlocks the ability to simultaneously define the form and function of advanced materials. The application of functional lithography to additive manufacturing enables production-ready parts to be directly 3D-printed, whereas existing materials can only make prototypes, mock-ups or toys. The goal of this project is to develop new advanced manufacturing processes using functional lithography, towards direct additive manufacturing of high-fidelity polymer components, devices and hardware.",
