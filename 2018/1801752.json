 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geoscientists work on the front lines of issues affecting human communities worldwide, requiring an educated public positioned to help decision-makers understand Earth's complex workings and ensure the safety of its billions of inhabitants. Expanding diversity and inclusivity in the geosciences is critical as decision-making informed by geosciences is a matter of both social justice and critical national need. Recent research on social vulnerability, particularly the vulnerability of communities to extreme natural events based on social factors such as income, race, ethnicity, and housing, finds that communities of color are often among those most vulnerable to these natural events. To address this challenge head-on, the Ambassadors for STEM Training to Enhance Participation (A-STEP) program will provide a transformative seagoing experience to cohorts of students from underrepresented communities who will be equipped with both solid science background and science communication skills. This experience will broaden perspectives on the role of the oceans as a driver of global and environmental change and is expected to empower ambassadors to communicate that change within their own diverse communities. The project will leverage transits of U.S.-operated marine research vessels to train diverse STEM and non-STEM students in science communication. Under the guidance of instructors and science mentors, these students will become effective ambassadors to disseminate exciting and relevant geoscience information across broad audiences.  \r\n \r\nThe goals of the A-STEP project are to: (1) Raise the profile of geosciences and geoscience-related careers among under-represented groups nationwide; (2) Produce a series of engaging multimedia products to contribute towards this goal; (3) Draw from scientific ocean drilling and related research to develop educational storyboard modules aimed at K-12 audiences showing the impacts of global change on marine and terrestrial systems; and (4) Contribute to increased diversity of knowledge across geoscience-related fields and career choices by drawing greater attention to the relevance of climate and environmental change for all citizens.\r\nTo achieve these goals, cohorts of 16 students annually from talented pools of STEM and non-STEM majors will join scientists and science education/communication professionals on short transit cruises on the JOIDES Resolution and UNOLS vessels. Students will learn first-hand in the scientifically-rich environment of an oceanographic cruise the significance of data gleaned from marine sediments, marine organisms, marine pollution, water chemistry, weather and climate patterns, and seafloor dynamics. Subsequently, these newly-minted ambassadors will be deployed across their communities and the nation to transmit the importance and relevance of geoscience information and careers, create innovative products and presentations about their experiences, and make linkages between climate and environmental change and people's daily lives. A-STEP cohorts will become a rich nationwide resource for inspiring the next generation of geoscientists. As ambassadors tasked with promoting STEM knowledge and careers, program participants will bring meaning and value to information, demonstrating how climate and environmental change is affecting all citizens, urban and rural. Citizens with few direct connections to science and scientists, who unfortunately are disproportionately African American, Latino, and Native American communities, are often more vulnerable to misinformation and will especially benefit from interactions with A-STEP students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In addition, the project facilitated many students participating in scientific conferences, truly serving as ambassadors for the geosciences as they worked at conference exhibit booths to share their experiences and made oral and poster presentations. Furthermore, the project hosted a student summit at the IODP Gulf Coast Repository at Texas A&amp;M University in January 2024. The summit provided students not only with an opportunity to reconnect with their peers, go on field trips and lab tours, and learn about graduate school, but also to present to high school students just a few years behind them. Project evaluation data indicates that the project was successful in making students more aware of geoscience careers, drawing them deeper into marine and environmental careers. Most students indicated that the project helped them achieve greater self-confidence, direction, communication skills, and motivation to apply for other STEM experiential programs. Given the diverse demographics of our students across gender, race, ethnicity, income, and family college history, the project is confident that we have achieved our goal of producing a national cohort of geoscience ambassadors with the skills to grow into an outstanding next generation of geoscientists and science communicators.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 10/31/2024<br>\nModified by: Lisa&nbsp;D&nbsp;White</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
