The past decade has seen the beginning of a major transformation in the field of forensic science. This postdoctoral fellow's research program will advance scientific understanding at the nexus of the behavioral sciences and forensic sciences, with a goal to improve how forensic science is developed, conducted, and communicated. \r\n\r\nThis project will support a postdoctoral scholar who will be engaged in a number of research areas at Arizona State University?s Forensic Science Initiative Program and Law and Behavioral Science Program for two years. The research will involve developing ways to test the validity and reliability of forensic techniques, investigating the human side of forensic judgment, and helping non-scientists such as jurors, lawyers, and judges understand and evaluate the quality of forensic science by improving how it is communicated. The postdoctoral fellow will receive consistent and ongoing mentorship from a team of scholars with established research records in the area of the fellow?s work. The goal of this interdisciplinary postdoctoral fellowship is to facilitate the growth of a scholar working in a critically-understudied area at the intersection of the behavioral and forensic sciences, in order to advance scientific understandings of convergence of these important areas of study.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
