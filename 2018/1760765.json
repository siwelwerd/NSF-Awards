 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions.  Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational culture and climate.  ADVANCE \"Adaptation\" awards provide support for the adaptation and adoption of evidence-based strategies to academic and non-academic non-profit organizations.\r\n\r\nCalifornia State University, San Bernardino (CSUSB) will implement an ADVANCE Adaptation project named the Diversity and Equity in Promotion, Tenure and Hiring (DEPTH).  The DEPTH project will implement comprehensive policy changes concerning recruitment, hiring, and promotion and tenure.  In addition, the project will result in new processes and systems for data tracking and monitoring at the institution. CSUSB identified these areas of need through by reviewing institutional data and conducting surveys of faculty.  The CSUSB DEPTH project will adapt activities and strategies from the University of Arizona, University of Wisconsin, and University of Michigan's past ADVANCE Institutional Transformation projects to address CSUSB issues related to recruitment, hiring, promotion and tenure.  \r\n\r\nThe CSUSB project will result in: 1) A DEPTH Center at CSUSB; 2) A new data collection system to track applicant and faculty data; 3) Policies and trainings aimed at ensuring diverse applicant pools, effective faculty searches, and avoiding biases; and 4) More standardized faculty evaluation processes across the institution that promote equitable decision-making.   CSUSB is in an ideal position for the implementation of systematic change to address the issues of diversity in STEM faculty. CSUSB has undergone recent changes in administration and rapid student growth, and is about to enter a period of increased tenure-line faculty hires. A diverse faculty at CSUSB will reflect the student body which is primarily comprised of underrepresented and underserved populations in STEM including racial and ethnic minorities, women, and low SES students. In addition, CSUSB is part of the California State University 23 institution system, which is the largest university system in the USA and will be able to share and disseminate the content of its successful initiatives system-wide, potentially influencing the outcomes of over 13,000 faculty members.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This overarching aim was demarcated by four primary goals, which served as the framework for the ADVANCE-DEPTH objectives and activities.\n\nGoal 1: Establish a center for Diversity and Equity in Promotion, Tenure, and Hiring (DEPTH).\n\nActivities: The DEPTH Center was established in Year 1 of the grant.\n\nObjectives: Centralize, develop, and deliver empirically based faculty diversity, equity, and retention initiatives to a) increase and retain greater diversity in the faculty body, particularly in STEM departments and b) institutionalize successful ADVANCE-DEPTH initiatives.\n\nKey Accomplishments: The DEPTH Center has been instrumental in developing and delivering a Best Practices in Faculty Searches training program, forming and facilitating retention, promotion, and tenure faculty learning communities, and generating policy and practice changes that incorporate best practices in faculty hiring and evaluation.\n\nGoal 2: Develop comprehensive and sustainable data tracking systems.\n\nActivities: In collaboration with Faculty Affairs and the Office of Institutional Research, the DEPTH team tracked diversity in tenure-line faculty hiring, equity in faculty compensation packages, and equity in faculty retention, promotion, and tenure outcomes (e.g., tenure and promotion decisions; salary increases).
