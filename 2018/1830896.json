 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to leverage textile materials to create soft and compliant wearable robots that are lightweight and nonrestrictive, and can deliver valuable levels of assistance. This will be achieved by studying how to model, manufacture and control textile-based robotic systems. The outcomes from this project will highlight the benefits of textiles as a materials platform for new components that enable wearable robot systems that can be worn like clothing. When people suffer neurologic and musculoskeletal injuries, they often cannot perform even the simplest activities of daily life. The innovative new devices and systems that result from this project will offer the potential to provide additional strength by applying forces to a wearer's limb to mitigate disability and augment the natural abilities of the human body. This will simultaneously open avenues for independence, societal participation, and return-to-work, while reducing healthcare costs. This project will also promote interdisciplinary research and teaching, and facilitate interactions between roboticists, applied mathematicians, computer scientists, biomedical engineers, material scientists, and functional apparel designers. \r\n \r\nThis project will create, analyze, and evaluate a new class of textile-based, conformal, and compliant wearable robots in the form of garments. Embedded textile strain and pressure sensors will monitor the state of the actuators and the underlying limb, while integrated air-impermeable and conductive pathways for fluid power and data transfer will enable manipulation of the limb through simultaneous online estimation and control. This transformative, interdisciplinary research program will address fundamental questions aimed at increasing our understanding of how to leverage the mechanical and electrical properties of advanced textile materials to achieve flexible and distributed actuation, sensing, and information/power transfer for textile-based robots. The project will develop new computational and analytical modeling tools that account for the inherent material and geometric nonlinearities to guide the parametric design of both individual actuators, sensors and their distributions on a limb; model-based and data-driven control and estimation algorithms that account for the nonlinear actuator properties and inherent uncertainty in positioning a textile-based robot on a limb and finally novel material constructions and their manufacturing processes spanning the nanoscale to wearable garments. This project will integrate the activities at all stages of the research through highly collaborative interactions and demonstrate and validate the benefits of this approach through multiple experimental testbeds.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We exploit the mechanical anisotropy of knit and woven textiles with laminated air impermeable barriers to create textile-based actuators that are lightweight, low profile, compliant, flexible and capable of achieving a variety of motions suitable for wearable applications. Efforts were made in hardware and algorithm development and in human subject testing. We iterated over the design and fabrication of textile-based soft actuators and strain/pressure sensors to improve robustness and function. These components were integrated into a number of different testbeds.</p>\n<p>One of the testbeds was a portable inflatable shoulder wearable robot for assisting industrial workers during shoulder-elevated tasks. The robot is worn like a shirt with integrated textile actuators, inertial measurement units and a portable actuation unit. It included a kinematics state machine controller to determine user intent. From human subject evaluations during simulated industrial tasks the robot reduced agonist muscle activity by up to 40% with slight changes in joint angles of &lt;6% range of motion, while not increasing antagonistic muscles activity. Finally, automotive factory workers wore and qualitatively evaluated the robot in a production line training area, finding sufficient perceived support and comfort, paving the way towards extended evaluations in real use cases. Another testbed was a lightweight, fully portable, textile-based, soft inflatable wearable robot for shoulder elevation assistance that provides dynamic active support to the upper limbs for people with disabilities. The technology is mechanically transparent when unpowered, can quantitatively assess free movement of the user, and adds only 150 grams of weight to each upper limb. In 10 individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with different degrees of neuromuscular impairment, we demonstrated immediate improvement in the active range of motion. We also showed that this robotic wearable can improve functional activity without any training, restoring performance of basic activities of daily living. These results represent a further step toward everyday use of assistive, soft, robotic wearables for the upper limbs.</p>\n<p class=\"float-left\"><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> We explored new bladderless actuator concepts that could have excellent airtightness under operating pressure (up to 25 psi) via coating fabrics. A bromobutyl rubber (BIIR) formulation was created and a blade coating approach was used to prepare different rubber coatings on commercial nylon fabrics. We also have successfully investigated a new way to fabricate a soft strain sensor filament for detecting elongational strains in textile applications. Using textile-based capacitive sensors, we demonstrate a soft sensing shirt for tracking shoulder kinematics of both cyclic and random arm movements in 3 DOFs: adduction/abduction, horizontal flexion/extension, and internal/external rotation. We developed a computational optimization pipeline for wearable pneumatic textile actuators that allows efficient exploration of the vast design space of possible actuator geometries to determine which will yield the most desirable performance. The optimization scheme consists of four modules: design parameterization, modeling, objective function(s), and optimization. We also developed a new methodology to measure torques delivered to the shoulder via a soft wearable robot directly in-situ on the body, which involves suspending the arm on a cable (from ceiling) and measuring the degree of offloading (via a load cell) to quantify cable tension and line of action of the cable via optical motion capture. These quantitative, lab-based torque measurements can aid in interpreting biomechanical data from studies.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> Under this award, we were the recipient of REM funding in collaboration with Prof Holly Golecki at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and Prof Erik Siggelkoe at Bunker Hill Community College (BHCC) to run a multi-institution, co-curricular undergraduate research experience across three institutions. Students at UIUC and Bunker Hill Community College were selected to participate in a paid research opportunity six hours per week during the academic year at their home institution. Both virtually and in person they collaborated and are mentored by faculty and trainees at Harvard, UIUC, and BHCC. We had good gender diversity in our cohort: 45% female and 55% male. Lastly, 100% of research participants (RPs) were from groups underrepresented in engineering (by first generation status, gender, race or ethnicity). The field of soft robotics relies on a wide range of expertise to address healthcare technology solutions and this group represents the diversity of technical specialties and identities necessary to advance the field and strengthen the national STEM workforce. We have also continued to use workshops and outreach events to expose participants to the field of soft robotics as well as pilot test the quality of the instructional materials for improving further workshops. Apart from the field of soft robotics, this work will have significant impact in the area of rehabilitation, and occupational therapy and worker protection devices. In addition, we expect that the new designs will open up new possibilities for human machine interaction &ndash; not currently possible using traditional rigid robotic systems.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 02/11/2024<br>\nModified by: Conor&nbsp;Walsh</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1830896/1830896_10581189_1707682292941_Figure_2_--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1830896/1830896_10581189_1707682292941_Figure_2_--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"2.
