 "awd_abstract_narration": "While pollen is emitted from the Earth's surface in large quantities from vegetation, these emissions are typically excluded from inventories due to the large size of pollen grains.  However, recent studies have shown that pollen grains easily rupture when wet, forming smaller sub pollen particles (SPP); these SPP have not been well-studied.  The central goal of this study is to accurately establish the amount of SPP produced by pollen rupture and to determine its cloud formation properties.\r\n\r\nThis study will include a series of experiments utilizing a plant chamber and atmospheric modeling simulations.  The laboratory measurements will (1) Quantify the number of SPP emitted from a single pollen grain and from a plant under atmospheric conditions, (2) Determine the supersaturation required for cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation, and (3) Determine the temperatures and relative humidities required for ice nucleating particles (INP) activation.  These results will provide critical input for an online pollen emissions model that will be used with the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry model (WRF-Chem) to (1) Implement the pollen emission rupture mechanism in WRF-Chem, (2) Utilize measured rupture data to improve simulations of pollen rupture, and (3) Conduct new simulations that account for the indirect effects from both warm and cold clouds using CCN and INP activation measurements.\r\n\r\nThis interdisciplinary project uses laboratory and modeling components to maximize the value of the measurements for improving model estimates of pollen effects on cloud formation.  The work will also be integrated in an undergraduate course that will introduce pollen sampling equipment and instruct students on the basics of aerosol and climate modeling.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nLarge quantities of pollen grains can be emitted from vegetation to the atmosphere to transport reproductive material.  Once in the atmosphere, little is understood about the fate of pollen; specifically, how large pollen grains may rupture to create smaller, \"subpollen particles\" (SPP).  These particles may have implications for climate and the formation of clouds, as well as health impacts. This collaborative project included an experimental laboratory component to understand pollen processes, and a modeling component to understand the impact of pollen on the cloud formation.  Laboratory experiments determined the number of SPP generated by whole pollen grains and the ability of both pollen and SPP to act as ice nucleating particles (INP). We incorporated these results within a three-dimensional atmospheric modeling framework to understand  the conditions under which pollen and SPP can influence cloud formation.\nLaboratory experiments to understand the pollen grain rupture were conducted in a newly-designed laboratory pollen chamber.  Experiments quantified the amount of SPP produced under different environmental conditions.  We tested three types of vegetation (ryegrass, giant ragweed, and live oak) and determined SPP emission factors of  4.9x1013 ? 4.3x1013, 1.3x1015 ? 1.1x1015, and 1.1x1015 ? 1.6x1015 SPPs m-2 for the three vegetation types, respectively.  In this chamber study, the concentration of  SPPs produced per pollen grain were up to two orders of magnitude higher than previously reported emission factors which were not conducted under typical environmental conditions. Variations between the species and conditions in this study highlight the importance of characterizing additional pollen under a wider range of conditions to more accurately quantify SPP emission factors.\nSPPs and pollen grains were examined for their impact on ice cloud formation by determining the number of ice nucleation active sites for all three species. When the number of ice nucleation active sites was extrapolated out over a square meter, we found that pollen grains could contribute significantly to the INP population. Ice nucleation results indicated that pollen grains are more efficient than SPPs as INPs. The mean ice nucleation temperature for SPPs was -30.6? and the mean ice nucleation temperature for pollen grains in contact mode was -23.7?C, indicating they could act as INPs and contribute to ice cloud formation above ~6km. At altitudes below 6 km, both SPPs and pollen grains can activate as CCN and contribute to warm cloud formation.  SPPs have either little or no ability to initiate ice nucleation, indicating their role as CCN is likely more important. Variations between the sample types emphasize the importance of more broadly characterizing the ice nucleating properties of pollen grains and SPPs.\nWe modeled the impact of pollen emissions and these experimental results.  We updated a spatial pollen emissions model and used future climate simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 6 (CMIP6) to estimate the role of climate change on future pollen emissions.  Warmer end-of-century temperatures (4-6K) shift the start of spring tree emissions 10-40 days earlier and summer and fall weeds and grasses 5-15 days later, typically leading to longer pollen season durations with reduced daily pollen maxima (5-50%). In some locations such as the Northeastern US, spring seasonal shifts increase the overlap of different vegetation taxa, increasing maximum daily pollen emission up to 20%. Increasing atmospheric CO2 may increase the production of pollen, and doubling pollen production increases end-of-century continental pollen emissions by 10-120%. These simulations indicate that increasing pollen amounts and longer pollen seasons will increase the likelihood of seasonal allergies.  \nWe included these emissions in a three-dimensional modeling framework (the Weather Research Forecast model with Chemistry; WRF-Chem)  to comprehensively simulate the emission, transport, and rupturing of pollen and its impacts on clouds.  We revised the ice nucleation parameterizations in the model to include aerosol-aware methods in both convective and cirrus clouds.  We updated these schemes to reflect the laboratory findings from pollen, and tested these parameterizations in model simulations over the Central United States.  From these results, we simulate that SPP can shift the timing and spatial distribution of convective events.  When including the ice nucleating potential of pollen, more ice formation occurs in the upper atmosphere.\n\nTwo graduate students and five undergraduates were trained as part of the project, which resulted in 5 published manuscripts with an additional 3 in preparation, and 19 presentations.  One publication (Zhang and Steiner, 2022) was highlighted in over 50 media reports after its release.  This work has led to collaborations with other scientists in the atmospheric modeling community and the health community, and the sizes and concentrations of SPPs and pollen grains measured in this study emphasize the potential impact of these aerosol on human health.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/17/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Allison Steiner"
