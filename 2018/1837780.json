 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) proposes a project, called Supporting Computing Access, Leadership, and Equity in California (SCALE-CS), that will create a Networked Improvement Community (NIC) to scale teacher professional development, build the capacity of education leaders for local implementation, and contribute to the research base on expanding equity-minded computer science (CS) teaching and learning opportunities across the state. California is the sixth largest economy in the world and a \"majority minority\" state with over 60% of its six million public school students identifying as students of color. The state's size and diversity require a systemic approach to increasing CS opportunities for low-income students, LatinX, African American and Native American students, English language learners, and students with special needs. The focus of this project is to build leadership capacity to ensure that equity is kept at the core of CS education expansion efforts and those efforts involve interventions that are scalable and sustainable.  \r\n\r\nSCALE-CA will use a three-pronged strategy that includes interlocking interventions at the classroom, district and state levels. The NIC will collect data that supports continuous improvement of the following resources and activities: \r\n\r\n1)\tOffer a prototype CSPDWeek for teachers, counselors, and administrators including equity-minded curricula and PD from Exploring Computer Science, Computer Science Principles, and Counselors4Computing that can be replicated and customized at the regional level.\r\n2)\tDesign and develop a state-wide district implementation toolkit and accompanying workshop for administrators to consider the equity implications of district-wide CS education implementation. This will include the co-design of equity indicators for implementation of CS education.\r\n3)\tCollect evidence from the field that can be used to inform policy makers regarding statewide expansion that responds to the challenges of scalability, equity and long-term sustainability.\r\n\r\nThe NIC founding partners include 5 local education agencies (LEAs) representing the demographics, geography and size of California's diverse school system -- Sacramento, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Riverside, and Compton -- along with the Alliance for California Computing Education for Students and Schools (ACCESS, which serves as the backbone organization for CSforCA), UCLA researchers and American Institutes for Research (AIR). The NIC will expand to include 5 additional districts relatively new to CS education who will be mentored by the founding 5 districts, potentially reaching a total of 650,000 high school students. The LEAs will engage with SCALE-CA over a four year period learning and sharing data-driven practices while collaboratively addressing challenges of broadening participation in computing such as teacher preparation and support, credentialing, developing college and career pathways, and funding.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The partnership also collaborated with American Institutes for Research evaluators. The partnership worked together over four years to: (1) expand teacher professional development opportunities with computing, (2) build capacity of education leaders to bring computer science (CS) into their schools, and (3) collaboratively engage in research about how to expand equity-minded CS education. In order to increase CS learning opportunities for those who have had the least access (e.g., low-income students, students of color, English learners, and students with special needs), the partnership accomplished the following. First, the partnership created the </span><a href=\"https://csforca.org/csequityguide\"><span>CS Equity Guide</span></a><span>, which is a handbook written by administrators, for administrators. It addresses key questions and issues of equity that school leaders may have regarding how to bring CS education into schools (e.g., how to choose the best curricula and professional development opportunities for their schools, how to engage industry partners and families, etc.). The Guide also has case studies describing real-world examples of CS implementation in California school districts, accompanied by discussion questions to support leadership reflections on the Guide chapters. Secondly, the partnership developed the CS Equity Workshop for School Leaders, a community of practice of K12 education administrators who tackle problems of practice together while engaging with the Equity Guide. This workshop was part of a replicable professional learning model for teams of teachers, administrators, and school counselors that the SCALE-CA partnership also developed, called Summer of CS. This model was then expanded beyond the initial NSF grant through a Educator Workforce Investment Grant funded by the California Department of Education, and became </span><a href=\"https://www.seasonsofcs.org/\"><span>Seasons of CS</span></a><span>, a year-round professional learning experience. In the 2023-24 school year, 633 educators participated in 3-hour orientation workshops in the Fall, Winter, and Spring, and 709 educators participated in intensive Summer professional learning, with 489 educators participating in 47 virtual, hybrid, or in-person professional development workshops in their regions. Ten Summer workshops were hosted together in-person and included 220 middle and high school California educators in Anaheim, California in July 2024.&nbsp;The Seasons of CS work was recognized by Code.org when the Seasons of CS project received the &ldquo;Innovation Award&rdquo; at CSEdCon 2023.&nbsp;Findings from the project have been shared with California&rsquo;s governor towards informing plans for how to build teacher CS certification pathways.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/07/2024<br>\nModified by: Jean&nbsp;J&nbsp;Ryoo</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1837780/1837780_10582181_1731019341674_Screenshot_2024_11_07_at_2.41.18_PM--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1837780/1837780_10582181_1731019341674_Screenshot_2024_11_07_at_2.41.18_PM--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Seasons of CS\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1837780/1837780_10582181_1731019341674_Screenshot_2024_11_07_at_2.41.18_PM--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Seasons of CS\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Seasons of CS professional learning program for teachers, counselors, and school administrators</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Roxana Hadad</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jean&nbsp;J&nbsp;Ryoo\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Seasons of CS</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1837780/1837780_10582181_1731019002665_Screenshot_2024_11_07_at_2.35.39_PM--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1837780/1837780_10582181_1731019002665_Screenshot_2024_11_07_at_2.35.39_PM--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"CS Equity Guide\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1837780/1837780_10582181_1731019002665_Screenshot_2024_11_07_at_2.35.39_PM--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"CS Equity Guide\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Cover of the CS Equity Guide for school administrators/leaders created by the SCALE-CA partnership</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Roxana Hadad</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jean&nbsp;J&nbsp;Ryoo\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">CS Equity Guide</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1837780/1837780_10582181_1731018864997_Screenshot_2024_11_07_at_2.32.34_PM--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1837780/1837780_10582181_1731018864997_Screenshot_2024_11_07_at_2.32.34_PM--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"SCALE Flyer\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1837780/1837780_10582181_1731018864997_Screenshot_2024_11_07_at_2.32.34_PM--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"SCALE Flyer\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Description of SCALE partnership features shared at ICERI 2023 Conference</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Flapan, Ryoo, Hadad, Mendoza, Choi</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jean&nbsp;J&nbsp;Ryoo\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SCALE Flyer</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1837780/1837780_10582181_1731019222978_Screenshot_2024_11_07_at_2.38.23_PM--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1837780/1837780_10582181_1731019222978_Screenshot_2024_11_07_at_2.38.23_PM--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"SCALE-CA Partnership Photo\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1837780/1837780_10582181_1731019222978_Screenshot_2024_11_07_at_2.38.23_PM--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"SCALE-CA Partnership Photo\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Photo taken during one of many SCALE-CA partnership meetings</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jean Ryoo</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jean&nbsp;J&nbsp;Ryoo\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SCALE-CA Partnership Photo</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
