 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principal Investigator will conduct research on the classification of algebraic varieties. Algebraic Geometry concerns the study of polynomial equations. The subject started with the work of the ancient Greeks, who considered sections of a cone; these are circles ellipses, parabolas and hyperbolas. Algebraically conic sections correspond to quadratic equations. The PI will consider the problems of finding the most convenient way to describe surfaces in four dimensional space. Is it always possible to use only two equations? How can one describe the geometry intrinsically, without reference to equations.\r\n\r\nThe PI will work on Hartshorne's conjecture on smooth codimension two subvariety of projective spaces being a complete intersection.  By work of Serre this is equivalent to the statement that every rank two vector bundle on a projective space having  dimension greater or equal than seven splits as a direct sum of line bundles.  Vector bundles come in two types, unstable and stable and the PI will work on each piece separately.  The PI will also work on a conjecture of Shokurov to do with the ascending chain condition for the log discrepancy and which is a big step toward proving termination of flips.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nTogether with Christopher Hacon and Chenyang Xu, I wrote a surveypaper on boundedness of the moduli functor of varieties of generaltype. This was based on a series of lectures that Christopher Haconand I gave at a meeting at the University of Utah of all algebraicgeometers. These meetings are held once every ten years and theyattract algebraic geometers from all over the world.\nAlgebraic varieties, the zeroes of polynomials, come in many differentshapes. The easiest examples are curves in the plane, which Newtonshowed describe all possible motions of satellites orbiting the earthor the sun. For quadratic polynomials we group all possible curvesinto four basic types or shapes; circles, ellipses, parabolae andhyperbolae. Hacon, Xu and I were able to show in much more generalitythat if one bounds the degree of the polynomials then there are stillonly finitely many different shapes. Our results deal with curves,surfaces and geometry in all dimensions.\nChristopher Hacon and I gave some expository lectures at theUniversity of California, Berkeley, in Spring of 2019.\nI helped to organise a series of eight conferences at the SimonsFoundation in New York City and the Simons Centre, at Stony BrookUniversity. The purpose of these conferences was to bring togetherexperts on birational geometry. Each conference was focused on sometopic and the conferences attracted early career mathematicians. \t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/08/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JamesMckernan\n"
