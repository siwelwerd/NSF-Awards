 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evolution of genes and genomes is responsible for the immense biological diversity on our planet.\r\nHowever, despite its central role as the most fundamental property of life, the process of evolution\r\nremains poorly understood, and current models have typically been unable to span the diversity of\r\nscales at which evolution can act. This work addresses this fundamental shortcoming by developing new\r\nmodels and algorithms that simultaneously account for the most prevalent processes in eukaryotic gene\r\nfamily evolution: gene duplication, loss, and coalescence. The new computational framework and\r\nmethods will enable researchers to systematically interpret data sets, make substantially more reliable\r\nand robust inferences, and improve our understanding of genome evolution. Because these histories\r\nform the basis of many genomic studies, these results will, in turn, benefit many areas of biology.\r\nAdditionally, the PI is committed to educating the next generation of scientists. As part of this project,\r\nthe PI will provide compelling research experiences for a substantial number of undergraduates, develop\r\nundergraduate courses in Data Science, and continue engaging in several college-wide and external\r\ninitiatives aimed at broadening participation in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis research develops models and algorithms in the field of phylogenetic reconciliation, which\r\ncompares a gene tree with its species tree to infer the evolutionary events that link them. For\r\neukaryotic organisms, the most popular reconciliation methods allow for gene duplications and gene\r\nlosses, which is appropriate only for species sampled at large evolutionary distances, or allow for\r\ncoalescences, which is appropriate only for species sampled at close evolutionary distances. That is,\r\neach model provides only a partial view of evolution, limiting their applicability and accuracy. By\r\nbridging these two models, this research will impact how gene family evolution is represented and how\r\nreconciliations are inferred and analyzed. Specifically, this work addresses three key problems in the\r\nfield: algorithmic challenges of scaling to large datasets, statistical challenges of distinguishing biological\r\nsignal from noise, and modeling challenges of generalizing across genomes. Expected contributions\r\ninclude novel algorithms and heuristics for the reconciliation problem, methods for resolving\r\nmultifurcating trees, and models that can account for multiple samples per species and for species\r\nhybridization. In addition, the joint evolutionary models and inference algorithms developed here may\r\nmotivate further unified approaches in the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
