 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for a combined annual meeting of the Society for Economic Botany and the Society of Ethnobiology, held at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. The Society for Economic Botany fosters and encourages scientific research, education, and related activities on the past, present, and future uses of plants, and the relationship between plants and people. The Society of Ethnobiology promotes the understanding of past and present relationships between humans and their biological worlds. The theme of the 2018 conference will be Food Security, Sovereignty, & Traditional Knowledge. Bringing these two groups together around this theme will permit the exchange of information and opportunities for resolution of differences that may exist between Western scientific and indigenous knowledge perspectives and create new interdisciplinary collaborations for future research. This  effort is important because having access to indigenous knowledge is critical for ensuring the development of future sustainable foods, pharmaceuticals, and other resources that will benefit all Americans. \r\n \r\nTo ensure future food and plant security, researchers from universities, governmental, and non-governmental organizations are working to conserve seeds of crops in germplasm banks. At the same time, indigenous nations are working to protect their food, water, and seeds. Inadequate communication between these two groups risks creating unnecessary barriers and the loss of important information. The conference will provide the opportunity for scholars, practitioners, and advocates to share their understandings of issues that are critical to the wellbeing and survival of people around the world. Conference outcomes will also further social science theories of how different cognitive understanding of the natural world lead to critical differences in human behavior in relation to nature. Funds will support the participation of invited speakers at the plenary symposium, professional development of students through travel scholarships and a mentoring lunch, and broadened participation of underrepresented groups in social and biological sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant supported the combined annual meeting of The Society for Economic Botany (SEB) and The Society of Ethnobiology (SoE), which was held in Madison, Wisconsin from the third to seventh of June, 2018, in the Memorial Union building on the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nThe theme of the conference was \"Food Security, Sovereignty, &amp; Traditional Knowledge,\" which was highlighted by the morning plenary session on the first day of the conference. Speakers in this plenary session comprised three Indigenous speakers (Valerie Segrest, Muckleshoot, Jessika Greendeer, Ho-Chunk, and Sean Sherman, Oglala Lakota, author and founder of The Sioux Chef) and two USDA researchers (Katlyn Scholl and Candice Gardner).  This plenary session allowed for exchange of ideas between germplasm researchers and Indigenous scholars concerned about food and seed sovereignty.\n\nThe opening reception went beyond a simple land acknowledgement to provide more cultural information about our location on homelands of the Ho-Chunk nation, with cultural presentations on Ho-Chunk history, culture, and music.  An explanation of Ho-Chunk history and culture was presented by Janice Rice (Ho-Chunk Clan Mother), followed by Jon Thundercloud and the Thundercloud singers, who explained and performed traditional Ho-Chunk drumming and singing.\n\nA final banquet featuring Indigenous foods was prepared under the guidance of guest chef Sean Sherman (founder of The Sioux Chef), who also explained the meal to the attendees.\n\nStudent participants got to know each other in a student mixer (funded by the two societies), and could participate in a mentoring lunch in which senior researchers discussed their career trajectories with students and postdocs. \n\nThe funding provided by the grant enriched the conference program by paying travel expenses of some of the plenary speakers, as well as other invited speakers:  Distinguished Economic Botanist awardee Gary Paul Nabhan (University of Arizona), Distinguished Ethnobiologist awardee Gail Wagner (University of South Carolina), and Filmmaker Meg Hanrahan, who premiered her film about an outstanding Midwestern botanist and early woman in science: \"A Force for Nature: Lucy Braun.\"  In addition to these presenters, the grant allowed us to provide complementary registration for other invited presenters and volunteers.\n\nFunding for participant support for students, members of Indigenous nations, and International participants allowed us to provide financial support to help defray the expenses of registration, travel, and lodging for selected participants.  A committee of judges from both societies selected sixteen participants from among 47 applicants for travel support.  In addition to those who received travel support, additional Indigenous participants received complementary registrations and tickets to the Indigenous foods banquet. The grant support significantly increased participation by members of Indigenous nations at the conference.\n\nImpacts:\n\nBy having a joint meeting with both the Society for Economic Botany (SEB) and the Society of Ethnobiology (SoE), this conference encouraged more exchange of ideas across the entire ethnobiology-ethnobotany-economic botany spectrum than would be possible with meetings of each society separately.  More importantly, the conference theme of \"Food Security, Food Sovereignty, and Indigenous Knowledge,\" especially during the plenary session on the first morning of sessions, highlighted the value of Food Sovereignty and put this issue into the consciousness of all attendees, as well as others in this broad, inter-disciplinary field. \n\nWe are proud of the inclusion of more members of Indigenous communities than previously at these meetings, through funding to subsidize their registration, indigenous foods banquet tickets, and in some cases, their travel expenses.  We believe that their participation fostered greater dialog among native and non-native attendees, and that this meeting set a precedent for future meetings to work harder to include more Indigenous participants in our meetings.  The funds also allowed us to support a larger number of international participants (especially from developing countries) and other student participants as well.\n\nThe greater Indigenous participation in this meeting helped to disseminate the research results reported at the conferences to a broader audience than normally attends our scientific conferences, and we hope that the members of Indigenous communities who were in attendance will feel welcome to attend future meetings as well.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/18/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eve Emshwiller"
