 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides travel support to ten student at U.S. instructions, enabling them to participle at the 1st U.S. Semantic Technologies Symposium (US2TS), held March 01-02, 2018 in Dayton, Ohio (http://www.us2ts.org). Semantic Web is an inherently multi-disciplinary field. Yet, the division between computer science, natural science and social science limits the formation of a coherent research agenda for exploring emerging trends in Semantic Technologies. There is a need to bring together the U.S. Semantic Web community and begin forming a research network among Semantic Web practitioners in different domains. The increasing demand of data-intensive research and the multidisciplinary characteristics of Semantic Web applications make it crucial to maintain and expand the existing workforce through outreach to students to foster future scientific innovation across disciplines. Several activities will be organized for the student participants during the symposium. The students, including underrepresented groups (women and minorities) and undergraduates will have the opportunity to network with each other and the experienced researchers attending the symposium, gaining valuable experience that will enable them to foster long-lasting interdisciplinary and national-wide collaborations among a new generation of Semantic Web practitioners who will ultimately shape the future of Semantic Web research and applications at all levels. \r\n\r\nCross-disciplinary and cross-sectoral communication and networking among Semantic Web researchers, students and practitioners is the core of the US2TS. With an ever-growing dependence on the web, and the continuously increasing importance of large-scale data sharing, integration, and reuse, researchers in various disciplines, there is a need to connect these efforts. US2TS has goal to stimulate community consolidation and the building of a U.S.-based community research network. The symposium will provide a forum by which participants can share information and ideas, coordinate ongoing or planned research activities, foster synthesis and new collaborations, develop community standards, and advance science and education through communication and the sharing of ideas. Student participation in US2TS is expected to improve understanding and skills of open data and open science among the next generation scientists, as Semantic Web technologies are closely relevant to those topics.",
