 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many tasks in scientific computing involve either data or operators that are inherently multidimensional: for example, a database of gray-scale images constitutes a three-dimensional array when each image is stored in a standard two-dimensional array format. Yet many standard numerical methods treat the data and associated operators as two-dimensional arrays, or matrices. This suggests that additional structure that could be leveraged for computational gain may be going undiscovered and underutilized. Recent research has shown that tensors (multidimensional arrays) and several types of corresponding decomposition methods can be instrumental in revealing latent correlations of both data and operators residing in high-dimensional spaces. Indeed, tensor decompositions can be provably superior to matrix-based counterparts in representation of certain types of data. This research project tackles two important questions: (1) how to uncover latent structure in data and operators using multidimensional tensor factorizations, and (2) how to use these revealed structures to develop a powerful computational framework that can harvest the benefits of this structure. Hands-on teaching material for graduate courses will be developed on randomized matrix methods and tensor decompositions. This teaching material, in the form of Python notebooks, along with the code developed as a part of this project, will be freely available as a software library under an open source license.\r\n\r\nThe investigators aim to answer these questions in the context of two applications in scientific computing of major importance and far-reaching consequences: model reduction, a mathematical framework for reducing the computational cost associated with high-fidelity simulations of complicated physical phenomena, and structured matrix approximation, which is important in applications such as parametric partial differential equations and image deblurring. The work will approach these questions through an entirely new, multidimensional lens with the advantages of providing new computational efficiencies and structure that can only be obtained by moving to a higher-dimensional regime. Two signature features of the project are: (1) design and analysis of structured tensor decompositions that are efficient in terms of computations and memory accesses, by using randomized matrix methods and the algebraic structure of tensor decompositions; and (2) use of tensor models, and a corresponding suite of structured decompositions, to exploit latent multidimensional structure in model reduction and structured matrix approximations. The research is expected to benefit numerous other applications in science and engineering as well.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe goal of this project was to identify latent correlations of both operators and data residing in high dimensional spaces through tensor (a.k.a. multiway array) decompositions and to exploit this discovered information to achieve computational gain in a range of problems in scientific computing and data science. Many standard numerical methods unwrap the multiway data or operators and treat them as matrices (i.e. two-way arrays). This approach is increasingly problematic given the explosion in the size of todays datasets and the desire to solve increasingly large modeling problems. Our tensor-based techniques often performed much better with respect to storage costs and accuracy thanks to their ability to better exploit multidimensional structure.\n\n\nWhen combined with our new randomized numerical linear algebra algorithms, our tensor-based approach proved successful at dramatically reducing the computational costs over state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, we provided analysis and theoretical properties that govern the balance of computational cost and approximation properties.\n\n\nThis collaborative research project resulted in several outcomes. Highlights include:\n\n\n-Development of efficient algorithms for storing and representing structured matrices by using invertible matrix-to-tensor mappings together with (randomized) tensor compression in the CP and Tucker formats.\n\n\n-Development of (randomized) tensor-based algorithms for subspace system identification.\n\n\n-Development of tensor-based algorithms for function and kernel approximations with an application to rank-structured matrices.\n\n\n-Development of randomized algorithms for tensor decompositions in the Tucker format.\n\n\n-Development of new randomized and tensor algorithms for projection-based nonlinear model reduction for partial differential equations.\n\n\n-Development of new tensor decomposition algorithms using the tensor BM-product.\n\n\n-Development of generative models for video data showing low BM-product-rank decompositions are capable of significant compression and superior separation of spatio-temporal surveillance video data relative to the state-of-the-art.\n\n\nWe demonstrated the success of our algorithms on a range of test problems: we considered both synthetic and real-world data across a range of applications and disciplines.
