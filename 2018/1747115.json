 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to vastly improve broadband access to the home across The Nation using true full duplex technology. By bringing full duplex communications to wireline and wireless systems, this proposed effort aims to improve connectivity, enhance coverage and enable new applications for both dense urban and sparse rural communities. This effort benefits first responders, law enforcement and other essential services by providing more reliable, higher bandwidth access to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will further develop an existing framework for full duplex communications, taking it from early stage prototype to a more mature proof of concept, while simultaneously enabling the company to understand the commercial impact of this technology on multiple communication industry segments. This Phase 1 project will begin by device fabrication for tunable filters, then progress to proving its technical applicability for wireline and wireless communication links. The primary milestones include: device characterization, integration, testing and yield analysis. This process will validate assumptions on both the technical and business fronts, enabling disruptive materials and fabrication processes to emerge from an academic environment into the commercial world.",
