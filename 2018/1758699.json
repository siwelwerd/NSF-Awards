 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to develop low-power, low-cost and small\r\nform factor wireless connectivity solutions, facilitating the deployment of inexpensive and long-lived\r\nwireless sensors and devices for a diverse set of applications. For instance, it is infeasible to place\r\nconventional sensors or wireless connectivity on low-cost or disposable items due to the high cost and\r\nshort battery life of wireless communication devices. With the successful completion of this project,\r\nitems ranging from consumer packaged goods to medical consumables and pill bottles could be\r\nconnected to the Internet. Brands and manufacturers could gain previously inaccessible market and\r\nproduct insights based on the way products are used, while consumers could enjoy benefits ranging\r\nfrom new services and features (such as automated product reordering) to better-designed products\r\nwhich more closely fit their needs. By enabling new use cases for wireless connectivity, this technology\r\ncan prompt innovation across many industries.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project introduces a new long-range\r\nbackscatter-based communication technology based on Chirp Spread Spectrum, a wireless protocol\r\nwhich can be detected at extremely low signal levels. The low-power wireless system prior to this\r\nproject is comprised of three elements: A passive backscatter-based radio, a first gateway device which\r\nprovides an illumination signal, and a second gateway device which receives the resulting\r\nbackscattered data and forwards data to the Internet. In this project, the passive backscatter-based\r\nradio will be implemented in an integrated circuit form, realizing the low power and low cost possible\r\nwith this technology. The two gateway devices will be combined into one full-duplex radio device, to\r\naddress the needs of the majority of deployment scenarios. Techniques to localize the backscatter\r\nradios within the field of the gateway device will be explored. Finally, security challenges will be\r\naddressed and the system will undergo extensive evaluation and testing.",
