 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics (KITP), at the Santa Barbara campus of the University of California (UCSB), serves the diverse goals of theoretical physics via a unique mode of operation and structure. The visiting researcher programs, associated conferences, and various outreach activities form a resource for theoretical physicists at all stages in their research careers.  The primary goal is to promote scientific progress by bringing together accomplished researchers for sufficient time to form new collaborations and to carry out substantive research that will lead in new directions.  With essential input in the planning and implementation of its research programs from the community, the KITP responds to new scientific opportunities, encourages transformational research, and promotes diversity by ensuring broad representation. The programs, which attract select groups of participants from institutions worldwide, are designed to enhance interaction and collaboration among participants in order to stimulate the vibrant, creative thinking that leads to insight and significant scientific progress.  This award is cofunded by the Division of Physics, the Division of Materials Research, and the Division of Astronomical Sciences within the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
