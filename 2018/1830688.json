 "awd_abstract_narration": "Viruses infest (or parasitize) every organism on Earth. In most cases, viruses peacefully co-exist with their hosts, but some viruses produce disease. Researchers from different disciplines study viruses at specific levels of biological organization. Initially, a virus expresses its genes and kidnaps the cellular machinery to produce its own proteins. Subsequently, the virus can be transmitted and spread in the host populations and, ultimately, to diverse ecosystems. This conference will bring together virologists, ecologists, epidemiologists and theoreticians working to develop a predictive, multi-level theory of virus evolution. The participants will discuss the latest next-generation sequencing technologies and how they can be used to characterize virus changes across these levels of selection. A better understanding of virus changes will allow predictions of viral population behaviors, including the development of new approaches to manage infectious diseases and thus, advance national health and welfare. The workshop products may be of value for training advanced undergraduates, Masters or PhD students in virology, ecology and evolution of infectious diseases, and epidemiology.\r\n\r\nThe recent advent of microfluidic techniques coupled with high-throughput, next-generation sequencing (NGS) allows for the characterization of selection dynamics across all levels of biological organization. Single-cell infection dynamics, both in terms of virus replication and host responses makes it possible to get a precise picture of the evolutionary dynamics of a virus spreading among cells within tissues. NGS allows for characterization dynamics of viral populations and chains of transmission at the entire individual host level (e.g., recent responses to Chikungunya, Ebola and Zika outbreaks). Finally, NGS allows one to explore the virome of entire ecosystems through metaviromics and metatranscriptomics. To make use of these methodological advances, there is a need for a complete theory linking these levels of selection. Understanding basic dynamics across levels of biological hierarchy may further allow prediction of viral population behaviors at higher levels.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nViruses parasitize every organism on Earth: from other viruses, bacteria, archaea, and unicellular eukaryotes up to large multicellular plants and animals.  In many cases, viruses peacefully coexist with their hosts but often induce diseases that negatively impact the host's fitness.  Hence, viruses are essential agents in regulating populations and ecosystems.  Viruses are not only pathogens, but in some well described cases, they contributed to evolutionary innovations in their hosts.\n\nResearchers from different disciplines are studying viruses at their focal level of biological organization (Figure 1).  At the lowest scale, molecular virologists are interested in the mechanisms of viral replication and mutation and how cells respond to infection by triggering defense mechanisms.  At the highest scale, ecologists and epidemiologists describe the incidence of viruses in their reservoir and novel hosts, and their spread among host populations and at the global level.  At each scale, what is considered as a \"host\" is different: single cells or tissues for molecular virologists, populations and ecosystems for ecologists and epidemiologists.  Likewise, the \"virus\" unit upon which selection operates also differs among levels of biological organization being studied: mutant swarms within individuals, infected individuals in ecological studies or viral lineages in epidemiological studies.  But the ultimate host for any virus is always an individual cell.  It is inside the cell wherein the virus expresses its genes, kidnaps the cellular resources and structures to build the replication factories wherein its own proteins are produced and its genome replicated, and uses these proteins to interact with a number of cellular factors in order to ensure reproduction, encapsidation and spread to neighboring cells, from there to colonize tissues and organs, then be transmitted to other susceptible hosts, to spread in the host populations and, ultimately, to reach diverse ecosystems.  At each level, different selective pressures operate on viruses.  For example, whereas at the cellular and within-organism levels fast replication provide competitive advantages, at the population level such strategy may not be optimal, as it jeopardizes transmission between hosts.  Therefore, while the general connection between levels is widely acknowledged, the fact is that communication between scientist working at different levels is not fluid at all.\n\nDespite all recent technical and theoretical advances that allow for the first time to describe virus? diversity at different scales with great detail, we still miss a complete theory linking all these levels that allows to predict the behavior of viral populations at higher levels by understanding basic dynamics at the lower levels and back.  We have tackled all these problems in the 2018 Workshop Integrating Critical Phenomenon and Multi-Scale in Virus Evolution and the 2019 working group Critical Phenomena and Phase Transitions in the Viral World.  Both activities were attended by molecular virologists, viral ecologists, epidemiologists, and theoreticians that shared recent experimental and theoretical advances, trying to come out with basic principles that can pave down the way to a predicting multi-level theory of virus diversity and evolution.\n\nFour main outcomes resulted from these activities.  (1) A list of scientific and methodological questions that need to be addressed in the near future to set the basis for developing a new Integrative Virology.  (2) A special issue of the journal Virus Evolution (available online at academic.oup.com/ve) with contributions from the different participant groups.  (3) New collaborations between different participants.  (4) The creation of a consortium that would apply in the near future to other NSF funding programs to strength collaborations and to start doing real work with an integrative perspective in mind.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/06/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Santiago F Elena"
