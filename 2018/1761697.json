 "awd_abstract_narration": "Portland cement concrete remains the most widely used construction material in the world, and improvements in its properties have the potential for significant benefit in the design and longevity of civil infrastructure. Incorporating nanoparticles to concrete can significantly enhance specific properties, for example strength and durability. However, real applications of nanoparticles in concrete are very limited because of low benefit-cost ratio of using nanoparticles induced by the high manufacturing cost, and difficulty of dispersing nanoparticles. This research studies the in-situ production of nanoparticles in fresh concrete to enhance the engineering performance. A two-step mixing process will be used to produce calcium carbonate nanoparticles in fresh concrete at low cost, as well as to provide well dispersion. Concrete made by this process will have significantly higher strength and better durability due to mechanisms triggered by the nanoparticles. The potential benefit to civil infrastructure, national economy and environmental benefits can be substantial.  An aggressive educational plan is designed to complement the research activities, with an emphasis on involving a group of traditionally underrepresented (woman, minority and/or socio-economically disadvantaged) students and high school teachers in the research activities. A series of course modules and special topics lectures will be developed to integrate the research endeavors into classroom teaching at both institutions.\r\n\r\nIn-situ production of calcium carbonate nanoparticles overcomes the major barriers preventing practical applications of nanoparticles in concrete. Three hypotheses have been identified for revealing the working mechanisms of this method: 1) the in-situ produced calcium carbonate nanoparticles promotes cement hydration and tunes the local packing and growth of hydration products, 2) the phase change of nanoparticles from amorphous or metastable to a stable one creates a binding mechanism in concrete, and 3) concrete with calcium carbonate nanoparticles exhibit lower porosity and higher strength due to changing in mineralogy of hydrated cement. A comprehensive experimental and numerical approach will be applied to test these hypotheses. Especially, molecular dynamics simulations will be used to explain the effects of the method on the early hydration of cement; thermodynamic modeling will be employed to quantify the effects on the mineral phase assemblage; advanced material characterization techniques (x-ray diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance, backscattered electron imaging, etc.) will enable validation of the simulations and quantification of the microstructure. The engineering performance will be determined by the evaluation of mechanical properties and durability testing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In the first step, CO<sub>2</sub> from any source (such as high-concentration flue gases and CO<sub>2</sub> captured from point sources or the air) is aerated into a solution or suspension of calcium-rich materials (such as lime and cement) to produce CaCO<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles. Depending on the CO<sub>2</sub> aeration parameters (i.e., temperature, CO<sub>2</sub> flow rate, CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, etc.) and the chemical environment (i.e., presence of siliceous ingredients and chemical additives), CaCO<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles of various sizes, shapes, and polymorphs (vaterite, aragonite, and calcite) can be obtained. For instance, Fig. 1 shows spherical CaCO<sub>3</sub> particles at sub-micron scale, and Fig. 2 shows spindle-shaped CaCO<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles with a length of 200-300 nanometers. It is also found that selected solid wastes such as coal fly ashes can be used as the calcium source to produce such nanoparticles. Fig. 3 shows calcite nanoparticles formed in a suspension and precipitated on a fly ash particle. In the second step, the prepared suspension containing CaCO<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles is used as mixing water to produce cement-based materials (i.e., cement paste, mortar, and concrete). The incorporation of such nanoparticles tends to reduce the flowability of cement-based materials and this negative effect can be mitigated by using a superplasticizer. In general, the nanoparticles in mixing water can increase the early-age strength of cement-based materials due to a filler effect, and the metastable CaCO<sub>3 </sub>phases do not have better reactivity than the stable calcite in early ages. However, in the long term, the metastable vaterite has a higher potential to densify the microstructure, resulting in higher strength and superior durability than plain cement-based materials. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>The broader impact of this project is represented by its potential influences on other disciplines and various industrial sectors.
