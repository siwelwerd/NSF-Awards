 "awd_abstract_narration": "Paragraph 1\r\nThe celestial sphere is perhaps the only realm of the natural world that has not been significantly altered by humans and is one of the few constants that social scientists have to work with across all world cultures. The Northern Dene provides one of the best remaining opportunities in North America to document and describe an Indigenous astronomy system. However, the proposed research is particularly time sensitive as recent rapid language shift combined with modern technology has replaced nearly every aspect in which astronomy was traditionally utilized, leading to the disuse and erosion of traditional astronomy knowledge systems. Documentation of Northern Dene astronomy provides a baseline for comparison of Indigenous astronomical knowledge across cultures, and is thus fundamental to understanding Dene conceptualization of the cosmos. Dene astronomy also provides insights into broader aspects of culture, life-way, and cosmology; hence, this research will be useful by scholars in related disciplines, including linguistics, cognition, geography, and astronomy. Astronomy also arouses natural curiosity among Northern Dene communities and the broader public, and thus can be readily integrated in school curricula and education outreach programs.\r\n\r\nParagraph 2\r\nThis project supports dissertation research with Northern Dene collaborators in order to better understand Indigenous concepts of astronomy. Although astronomy is a fundamental component of all Dene cultures, there has so far been no systematic effort to document Dene knowledge of the sky. Rapid change in traditional land use has led to this astronomical knowledge being even more endangered than the Indigenous languages themselves. This study builds on initial research with the Alaskan Gwich'in to include additional ethnolinguistic groups within the Northern Dene region. Field work will be conducted in several communities in Alaska and Canada, working with Northern Dene tradition bearers who have specialized astronomy knowledge. This study will provide much needed baseline documentation on Northern Dene knowledge of the sky, while also seeking to understand how celestial objects and atmospheric phenomena are utilized by the Northern Dene in cultural contexts, such as in navigation, time-reckoning, weather forecasting, and cosmology. Specific areas of inquiry related to the uses of Dene astronomy include: knowledge about stars and constellations, the northern lights, meteors, comets, atmospheric halos and sun dogs (parhelia), the sun and moon. All research will be conducted collaboratively with community members. The results of the research will be incorporated into ongoing community school curricula development and public planetarium programming.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

However, the doctoral research supported by this award to learn with and from Dene Elders, speakers, and tradition bearers across Alaska and Canada has shown that astronomical knowledge is deeply rooted in practical and spiritual ways of knowing, being, and relating. Drawing from an experience-based and comparative approach, this research explored the ways in which Northern Dene peoples perceive, conceptualize, and integrate the sky and its contents into systems of knowledge, practices, worldview, cosmology, and spirituality.</p>\n<p>At the center of these knowledge systems is a principal constellation identified as the incarnated spirit of a Traveler-Transformer figure who journeyed around the world in ancient time. Although this Traveler is widely known in Dene stories as the one who instilled balance and order in the world, his enigmatic transformation to the sky is known by few remaining Dene Elders. The Traveler constellation is not only a world custodian but also a teacher, ally, gamekeeper, and the embodiment of the world. These large constellations composed of numerous smaller groups of stars named after body parts have deep antiquity in the Dene family and account for a large inventory of previously undocumented star names. In at least four Dene languages these constellations cover the entire sky and provide a single unifying system for mapping the celestial sphere. Even when clouds, thick forest vegetation, or the horizon partially obscure these large constellations, the recognition of one part allows an observer to infer the locations of other parts based on an existing mental map of the human body. This utility is testament to the ingenuity of a single unified whole-sky constellation uniquely adapted to a Subarctic forest environment.</p>\n<p>Through comparative and multi-sited research, the investigators also learned that Dene Traveler constellations have remarkable continuity across the Northern Dene region as fundamental epistemologies for knowing, being, and relating to the world and universe. While Northern Dene are guided by the Traveler?s stories, teachings, and metaphorical path through life, his Milky Way trail unites the cosmos as a path to the afterworld. Taken together, the Traveler on Earth and in the sky integrate into a more holistic cosmology, worldview, and spirituality than previously described in Northern Dene studies.</p>\n<p>Other areas of traditional astronomical knowledge that this research focused on are: 1) general concepts of stars, minor constellations, and the use of stars in time-reckoning, weather forecasting, and wayfinding, 2) the sun and moon as personified beings that also embody fundamental models for behaviors and actions, and 3) socio-cosmic relationships between the Dene and a host of highly sentient atmospheric phenomena (northern lights, meteors, atmospheric halos and sundogs, rainbows, the thunderbird, practices for deterring unfavorable weather, and colors of the sky) that bridge the divide between the upper cosmos and the lived world of humans.</p>\n<p>The results of this work have had a greater impact beyond academia, especially regarding education and partnerships with Dene communities to reclaim Indigenous knowledge and language relating to the sky. The results of this work led to the completion of the Co-PI?s doctoral dissertation and have been integrated into an inhouse healing and wellness workshop in a Dene community, a Gwich?in star chart co-published with a Gwich?in Elder, a museum exhibit, and two episode of the children?s television series, ?Molly of Denali? (produced by WGBH for PBS Kids and CBC Television). The Co-PI has also presented this work in Dene communities, schools, universities, museums, and at festivals such as the annual Naka (Northern Lights) Festival in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories and the Thebacha and Wood Buffalo Dark Sky Festival in northern Alberta.</p>\n<p>Taken together, this work demonstrates that astronomical knowledge is a much greater part of Dene life, language, heritage, and culture than previously known in academia. The experiential-approach used in this research also demonstrates that when we devote time to learning and employing an Indigenous epistemology for investigation, we establish the contexts most conducive to advanced learning that may inform and reveal deep systems of knowledge such as those embodied in the Northern Dene sky. The investigators hope that this research will lead to greater interest in the sky as a fundamental part of the human experience that is deeply integrated into Indigenous worldviews, cosmology, and spirituality in addition to other more widely recognized uses such as wayfinding, time-reckoning, and weather forecasting.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/31/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Chris&nbsp;M&nbsp;Cannon</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1753650/1753650_10547863_1661968672221_IMG__12--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1753650/1753650_10547863_1661968672221_IMG__12--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Lower Porcupine River\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1753650/1753650_10547863_1661968672221_IMG__12--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Lower Porcupine River\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The lower Porcupine River in interior Alaska.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Chris Cannon</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Chris&nbsp;M&nbsp;Cannon</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Lower Porcupine River</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1753650/1753650_10547863_1661968434140_IMG_4590--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1753650/1753650_10547863_1661968434140_IMG_4590--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Northern lights in central interior Alaska\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1753650/1753650_10547863_1661968434140_IMG_4590--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Northern lights in central interior Alaska\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Northern lights in central interior Alaska</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Chris Cannon</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Chris&nbsp;M&nbsp;Cannon</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Northern lights in central interior Alaska</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1753650/1753650_10547863_1661968586887_IMG__99--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1753650/1753650_10547863_1661968586887_IMG__99--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cache at Rampart House\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1753650/1753650_10547863_1661968586887_IMG__99--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cache at Rampart House\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Cache at Rampart House on the Alaska-Yukon border.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Chris Cannon</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Chris&nbsp;M&nbsp;Cannon</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Cache at Rampart House</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1753650/1753650_10547863_1661967798978_FinalGwich'inPosterv3_compressed--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1753650/1753650_10547863_1661967798978_FinalGwich'inPosterv3_compressed--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Gwich'in star chart\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1753650/1753650_10547863_1661967798978_FinalGwich'inPosterv3_compressed--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Gwich'in star chart\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Gwich'in star chart is co-authored with a Gwich'in Elder and was produced as an outreach publication for Gwich'in communities and the public.
