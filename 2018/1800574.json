 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Division of Chemistry, Dr. David Berkowitz of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln is developing new reactions to help chemists in the industrial and pharmaceutical sectors and in academia.  The target molecules have applications in drug discovery and the synthesis of new materials.  The reactions that he and his team explore incorporate aspects of biology to get information on how fast reactions are going.  These reactions also incorporate biology to make a large array of specific products.  Dr. Berkowitz is actively engaged in outreach activities that promote the engagement of students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. These activities, which include undergraduate research internships in Dr. Berkowitz's laboratory, and open house presentations to high school students and their parents from a four-state area, are exposing students to STEM research early in their educational development.\r\n\r\nDr. Berkowitz and co-workers develop a catalyst screening process, termed In Situ Enzymatic Screening (ISES). The method utilizes \"reporting enzymes\" to provide real time information on relative rate, stereoselectivity and substrate scope for a set of parallel organic/organometallic reactions of interest. Dr. Berkowitz is studying the first catalytic asymmetric allylic amination reaction with Ni and promising new chiral salen ligands that derive from beta-pinene- and beta-D-(carba)fructopyranose-derived-1,2-diamines. A promising new formal thiocyanopalladation/carbocyclization transformation has been discovered and is being applied to the construction of densely functionalized and polycyclic libraries for diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS). Throughput is addressed with the development of alternative spectroscopic read-outs and screening arrays.  Temperature variation is being expanded via the development of \"thermal-ISES\" through the introduction of thermophilic \"reporting enzymes.\" New transition metal-ligand combinations are explored toward the stereocontrolled construction of quaternary, beta,gamma-unsaturated amino acid targets of interest to synthetic chemists, medicinal chemists, and chemical biologists. In support of the broader impacts of the project, Dr. Berkowitz mentors female students and members of traditionally underreperesented groups in his laboratory. The interdisciplinary training that students receive at the chemistry/biology interface includes significant exposure to spectroscopy and kinetics.  These skills is equiping these students for  careers in both modern industrial and academic chemistry settings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project has been dedicated to research at the interface of synthetic organic chemistry and biocatalytic chemistry.  On the one hand, enzymes serve as reporting enzymes to allow the investigators to rapidly screen metal-ligand-base combinations for platform reactions of interest.   This allows for the discovery of new useful catalytic combinations and advances the development of fundamental chemistry of relevance to both academia and industry.  The platform transformations under study in this project are particularly those that provide ready access to beta,gamma-unsaturated amino acids in enantiomerically enriched form.  Such compounds are of value as tools for chemical biology as they can act to inactivate vitamin B6-depend enzymes.  On the other other hand, the reporting enzymes under study in this project were also examined for their ability to serve as chiral catalysts for hybrid biocatalytic/organic synthesis.  In a particularly notable example arising out of this grant cycle, dehydrogenase enzymes serve as highly selective catalysts for a hybrid biocatalytic/sigmatropic rearrangement entry into the core of the important and widely used anti-influenza drug, oseltamivir (Tamiflu; see attached image). \n\nThe use of such hybrid biocatalytic/synthetic organic approaches in pharmaceutical process chemistry represents the cutting edge of the technology and opens up potentially new, more sustainable approaches to stereo-controlled chemical synthesis.  This result is expected to draw the attention of chemists in the synthetic chemistry, process chemistry and medicinal chemistry sectors. This project involved the training of postdoctoral reseach associates, graduate students and undergraduates, including several women and members of underserved groups in STEM.  Two of the graduate students (ACS Division of Organic Chemistry GRS selectees) and two of the undergraduate students (ACS Division of Organic Chemistry SURF awardee and NCESR Summer Fellowship awardee) conducting this research were recognized with highly competitive awards.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/28/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David S Hage"
