 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organisms are presumed to maintain a high accuracy of translation to ensure that little variation occurs in proteins involved in essential cellular functions.  However, a relaxed translational stringency has recently been observed across all branches of life, suggesting that under certain circumstances organisms may tolerate higher translation error rates than previously estimated.  Indeed, a decrease in translation stringency has the potential to yield new proteins that provide short- or long-term survival benefits.  The overall objective of this project is to understand the connections between tRNA base modifications, changes in translation accuracy and cellular fitness.  Graduate and undergraduate students will receive interdisciplinary training through their work on this project.  An evolution-in-action module (EvolvingSTEM) has been implemented in New Hampshire and Pennsylvania high schools and will be introduced to biology students in two Winston-Salem, North Carolina public high schools.\r\n\r\nThis project will test the hypothesis that modification of the tRNA wobble base is a tunable component of translation rather than a toggle switch that when turned off leads to error catastrophe. This proposal has three objectives.  Molecular dynamics and enzyme kinetics approaches will be used to characterize evolved BcTilS:tRNAIle2 variants in vitro and in silico in order to understand the catalytic and conformational changes that occur in these variants.  The in vivo effects of TilS:tRNAIle2 dysfunction such as which amino acid is inserted at AUA codons, which amino acid is present at the 3'-end of tRNAIle2, and what is the metabolic mechanism of enhanced fitness will be investigated.  Finally, noncanonical cellular partners of TilS and tRNAIle2 that may play alternative or additional roles in enhanced bacterial fitness will be identified.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Occasionally, growth under stressful or foreign conditions selects viable mutants in one of these genes, enabling comparisons between variant genes that lead to greater understanding of their essential roles. This project focuses on a set of mutants of the soil bacterium <em>Burkholderia cenocepacia</em> that were selected in an evolution experiment designed to study adaptation to rapid growth in simple laboratory conditions. Each mutant acquired a mutation in the essential gene <em>tilS</em>, which encodes the enzyme tRNA-isoleucine lysidine synthetase known only for its role in modifying tRNA-isoleucine (tRNA-ile2) to ensure accurate protein translation. Mutants in tRNA-ile2 were also selected, suggesting that selection acted to disrupt this enzyme-tRNA activity. The major goal of our project was to understand how and why these mutations were beneficial for bacterial fitness under the conditions of the evolution experiment, with the aim of broadening understanding of the function of TilS itself.</p>\n<p>In collaboration with the collaborating PI Alexander&rsquo;s laboratory, we discovered that nonsynonymous mutations in TilS reduced or eliminated the main catalytic function, no longer modifying tRNA-ile2 with a lysine. Altered lysine metabolism proved to be a source of the growth advantage of the mutants, because rapid growth in the evolution environment containing galactose created metabolic imbalances in the ancestral strain that could be remedied by lysine supplementation. Mutants in <em>tilS</em> did not require this supplementation. One possible cause of lysine demand may be acidification of the growth medium. <em>Burkholderia</em> secretes lactic acid to restore redox balance during growth on galactose using the DLD pathway, and they may use lysine to produce the acid-buffering compound cadaverine. We learned that both tilS and tRNA-ile2 mutants outcompete the ancestral strain by reducing their lag phase prior to exponential doubling, and this advantage was specific to galactose and not other sugars metabolized by the different Leloir pathway. In conclusion, we found that Burkholderia <em>tilS</em> mutants are selected to restore metabolic balance during rapid growth using the DLD pathway, presumably to re-route some lysine consumption, but this comes at the expense of systematic mis-translation of all proteins encoded by AUA codons that specify isoleucine via tRNA-ile2. More broadly, bacteria may therefore be selected to trade off translational accuracy against metabolic balance to enable continued growth on sugars, risking the cost of misfolded proteins.</p>\n<p>Numerous questions remain, including why the relatively small amount of lysine used by TilS to modify tRNA-ile2 would become limiting for growth, and whether lysine is indeed being used to combat acidification of the growth medium. Efforts to measure levels of these amino acids and polyamines that buffer acid were suggestive of this model but inconclusive. In addition, analysis of the transcriptomes of <em>tilS</em> mutants indicated hundreds of changes in gene expression, suggesting that the TilS protein may have other functions beyond its known enzymatic role.
