The principles of quantum physics are being applied towards developing new kinds of computers, sensors, and simulators, that can surpass in performance their classical analogs. Superconducting quantum circuits are a leading candidate for making quantum computing elements because of fast processing speeds and their ability to preserve quantum information from environmental interference for long times. They are also excellent testbeds for fundamental quantum and condensed matter physics because they can be precisely controlled and measured. This PI and his group will advance theoretical investigations of these systems together with experimental collaborators. The research team will investigate the possibility of chaotic behavior emerging during the operation of these quantum systems. Chaos in this case is characterized by sensitive dependence of the system's dynamics to small changes to the system's initial conditions. Another problem that will be tackled is how to make measurements of system parameters as precisely as possible, a topic important for quantum sensing. A final research topic concerns how to transfer energy and light between spatially distant superconducting circuits.  \r\n\r\nThe educational component of the grant will provide training for graduate students, as well as a summer class for high-school students that will include teaching quantum physics at a qualitative level using minimal mathematics. In addition, the PI will write a book based on his previous experience teaching that class, presenting basic quantum phenomena at a high-school level. \r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis award supports theoretical research and education to advance fundamental understanding of quantum control, chaos, and measurement with superconducting quantum circuits.\r\n\r\nAt the interface of quantum and condensed matter physics there has been fruitful recent activity utilizing superconducting quantum circuits. This award funds several research topics in this frontier field. The PI and his research team will apply the stochastic path integral theory of continuous quantum measurements, developed in the PI's group, to research dynamical chaos of continuously measured, driven quantum systems. The most likely paths of the monitored quantum system are described by a set of nonlinear, deterministic, equations of motion. By considering a time-dependent Hamiltonian, chaos in the most likely paths is predicted to occur in relatively simple quantum situations. Quantum enhanced metrology for superconducting circuits will also be developed, building on recent demonstrations of a scaling-law improvement in the precision of frequency measurements. Limitations of decoherence for metrology may be overcome with methods such as dynamical decoupling. The PI's group will investigate more complicated cases where the parameter itself is a quantum one, so the measurement disturbance of the parameter must be considered. As a third topic, the research team will investigate energy and photon transfer with entanglement creation between superconducting cavities and circuits. The theoretical research will be pursued in collaboration with groups of experimental colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe educational component of the grant will provide training for graduate students, as well as a summer class for high-school students that will include teaching quantum physics at a qualitative level using minimal mathematics. In addition, the PI will write a book based on his previous experience teaching that class, presenting basic quantum phenomena at a high-school level.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this research grant, we have made several discoveries concerning quantum systems, concerning on condensed matter realizations of these effects, mostly in the context of superconducting quantum circuits.\n\nWe have discovered a new kind of quantum chaos for monitored quantum systems.  Measurement induces intrinsic randomness into the quantum system, and we consider measurements that are continuous in time.  By considering the most likely path of this quantum system between two states in time, we found that the dynamics are described by a set of nonlinear, deterministic, equations of motion. We found situations when the most likely paths become chaotic, in the sense of exponential sensitivity to a small change in initial (or final) conditions.\n\nWe also investigated new methods of making precise measurements in condensed matter systems.  By investigating models of strongly interacting systems, we found examples of models that give the estimation precision of model parameters that scale in ways that exceed that of even highly entangled states.  This quantum advantage comes from the highly correlated nature of the model.\n\nNew methods of creating and preserving entangled quantum states have also been discovered.  The methods used involve the detection of a photon emitted from one of two artificial atoms, whose radiation is channeled into waveguides and jointly detected.  We found that common detection methods for superconducting systems can be used to create entanglement if the appropriate phase relationship is established between the two detectors.  The entanglement can be created between arbitrarily far away artificial atoms. In addition, the entanglement can be indefinitely preserved using only local operations, with a combination of local unitary feedback control, together with local fast pulses to create a limit cycle where entanglement is frozen in place.\n\nThis result of work demonstrating the creation and preservation of entangled states between remote parties is quite important because it shows that it is possible to maintain remote entanglement even when there is dissipation in the system.  This local feedback and control method can be used to establish entangled links between distant parties.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/27/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew N Jordan"
