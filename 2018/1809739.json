 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop a cross-layer cyber-physical security framework for the smart grid. The proposed research will improve the quality of real-time monitoring of the smart grid through anomaly analysis. This will lead to more reliable data for control, situation awareness to first responders and other improved applications to smart grids. The proposed research will improve the resilience of smart grids to cyber-attacks in meters, parameters, topology and communication infrastructure and large physical disturbances by developing new techniques for distributed control of large complex systems that guarantees secure and reliable performance. The project will foster education through enhancement to curriculum by building bridges among communications, machine learning, power and control systems. The PIs plan to teach short courses on smart grid security at conferences.  In addition, they plan to engage under-represented minority students in their project. \r\n\r\nThe project aims at developing a distributed nonlinear controller for transient stability enhancement. The new control layer will actuate on distributed energy storage systems, be robust to uncertainties in modelling and capable of compensating input time-delay while independent of operating conditions. Furthermore, the robust controller will not require exact knowledge of the system dynamics. Second, bad data analytics based on the innovation approach and cross-layered information provided by distributed software-defined network will be developed. The bad data analytics will consider the inherent interdependencies of the physical processes while providing a countermeasure. Third, an adaptive distributed robust machine learning approach will be developed. The overwhelming majority of supervised machine learning methods require large amounts of carefully labeled training data that is representative of the data distribution to be seen under test. However, in security applications, novel threats and malicious attacks are continuously being developed and attempted. Thus, approaches that rely on prior training data are unlikely to be robust in the case of behaviors never seen before, as would be the case in a rapidly changing threat environment. The novel distributed machine intelligence method that will be developed will be focused on being rapidly adaptive to identifying and distinguishing novel threats given even only one example of an anomalous novel threat.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Towards such, we have developed &nbsp;a cross-layer cyber-physical security framework, composed by physical and cyber domains. The cyber domain is composed by analysis and management layers. The physical layer represents the low-level applications such as data-collection and existing control and protection systems. On the cyber domain, high-level functions take the input from data acquired at the physical layer and implement distributed state estimation, robust control and machine intelligence (DMI) actions that require interactions between the subsystems on the physical layer.&nbsp;The model structure is presented in Fig. 1.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>The top layer is the management layer where a Distributed Software-Defined Network (D-SDN) leverages data and statistics from communications and machine intelligence to detect abnormal behavior of the communication network and prompt the analysis layer to take corrective actions.

The output of each distributed controller modulate the power output of grid-connected DESS to stabilize rotor angle oscillations. The DESS are comprised of fast-acting storage devices, such as batteries and flywheels, which can absorb or inject power into the local bus under the command of the control signal.
