 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microbial mats are found throughout the McMurdo Dry Valleys where summer snowmelt provides liquid water that allows these mats to flourish. Researchers have long studied the environmental conditions microbial mats need to grow. Despite these efforts, it has been difficult to develop a broad picture of these unique ecosystems. Recent advances in satellite technology now provide researchers an exciting new tool to study these special Antarctic ecosystems from space using the unique spectral signatures associated with microbial mats. This new technology not only offers the promise that microbial mats can be mapped and studied from space, this research will also help protect these delicate environments from potentially harmful human impacts that can occur when studying them from the ground. This project will use satellite imagery and spectroscopic techniques to identify and map microbial mat communities and relate their properties and distributions to both field and lab-based measurements. This research provides an exciting new tool to help document and understand the distribution of a major component of the Antarctic ecosystem in the McMurdo Dry Valleys.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to establish quantitative relationships between spectral signatures derived from orbit and the physiological status and biogeochemical properties of microbial mat communities in Taylor Valley, Antarctica, as measured by field and laboratory analyses on collected samples. The goal wioll be met by (1) refining atmospheric correction techniques using in situ radiometric rectification to derive accurate surface spectra; (2) collecting multispectral orbital images concurrent with in situ sampling and spectral measurements in the field to ensure temporal comparability; (3) measuring sediment, water, and microbial mat samples for organic and inorganic carbon content, essential biogeochemical nutrients, and chlorophyll-a to determine relevant mat characteristics; and (4) quantitatively associating these laboratory-derived characteristics with field-derived and orbital spectral signatures and parameters.  The result of this work will be a more robust quantitative link between the distribution of microbial mat communities and their biogeochemical properties to landscape-scale spectral signatures.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Outcomes from this study demonstrated the importance of spatially explicit landscape-scale measurements of mat distributions, and how they can be used to inform our understanding of the dynamics that maintain biodiversity in the MDV.\n\nOur four stated objectives have all been accomplished.  We are currently expanding our efforts beyond those originally proposed for Objective #4 by analyzing the remainder of our samples for additional ancillary pigment data and correlating these with other collected field data.  This work is being led by Co-PI Lee Stanish with help from NAU graduate student Schuyler Borges and Virginia Tech graduate student Sarah Power.  This additional work will specifically investigate the correlation between spectral signatures and specific pigment abundances and assemblages.  We are planning to continue expanding this work because of the identified complexity of minor pigment assemblages and the diversity of collected data for comparison.  We are confident that this additional work will help us to better understand the full capabilities of remote sensing data in the investigation of photosynthetic microbial and bryophyte ecosystems, which would not have been possible without all of the earlier elements of this project.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/10/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark R Salvatore"
