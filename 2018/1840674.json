 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will determine whether formal musical training is associated with enhanced neural processing and perception of sounds, including speech in noisy backgrounds. Music forms an important part of the lives of millions of people around the world, and it is one of the few universals shared by all known human cultures. Yet its utility and potential evolutionary advantages remain a mystery. This project will test the hypothesis that early musical exposure has benefits that extend beyond music to critical aspects of human communication, such as speech perception in noise. In addition, the investigators will test whether early musical training is associated with less severe effects of aging on the ability to understand speech in noisy backgrounds. Degraded ability to understand speech in noise is a common complaint among older listeners and hearing loss has been shown to be associated with social isolation and more rapid cognitive and health declines. If formal musical training is shown to affect improved perception and speech communication in later life, the outcomes could have a potentially major impact on quality of life,\r\n\r\nEarlier studies have suggested relationships between early musical training and improved auditory neural processing and perception, but the studies' impact has been limited by small sample numbers and inconsistent methods between different studies. This project will test a large number of participants (N=360) with uniform recruitment criteria and testing protocols across six different sites. Measures will include the neural frequency following response (FFR) to speech sounds, behavioral frequency selectivity, speech perception in noise, speech perception against a background of competing talkers, pitch discrimination, and auditory masking. The participants will also complete other assessments, including a personality inventory questionnaire, a profile of musical perception skills, a spatial reasoning test to assess general cognitive ability, as well as a background questionnaire to determine socio-economic status, education, and musical background. Participants will be selected to span a wide range of ages and musical experience. The neural data and the speech perception measures will be related to factors of musical training, such as the number of years of musical training and the age at which musical training began. Scientific rigor will be assured by preregistering the study and the analyses and by making the data and analysis code publicly available via a dedicated website.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Previous research has suggested that musical experience may improve people&rsquo;s hearing abilities, including how sound is encoded in their brains, which may make them better at hearing speech in noise. Specifically, we carried out many different behavioral experiments to measure how sensitive people&rsquo;s hearing is and how good they are at understanding speech when there is background noise. We also measured a property of the brain&rsquo;s sensitivity to sound called the &ldquo;frequency following response&rdquo; that may be tuned by musical experience. This research was conducted as part of a multi-site collaboration including scientists from six different universities across the United States and Canada. By working together, this project could study a much larger number of people than any one lab could by itself. The data we collected (and the data collected at the other sites) were sent to our colleagues at the University of Minnesota to be analyzed all together. The data will not be analyzed until data collection is complete at every research site. (At the time of this Outcomes Report, data collection was still ongoing at some of the other sites. To read more about the scientific discoveries made by this project, please see the Project Outcomes Report for NSF Award Number 1840818, PI: Andrew Oxenham.) Through this project, we developed straightforward and robust strategies for insuring the integrity of auditory psychophysics and auditory neuroscience data across multiple research sites. These procedures will help future researchers be able to conduct projects across multiple sites, which will help improve the reliability and replicability of research in auditory neuroscience. This is important because conclusions about music, aging, hearing, and the brain depend on studying large and diverse samples of people, which can be difficult to do at only one research site. Furthermore, this project connected a broad and diverse sample of participants to auditory neuroscience research. We collected data from people across a wide age range (18 to 80 years old) and across a wide range of musical abilities (from no musical experience to professional musicians). This is important because previous work has not adequately considered the continuous relationship between musical abilities and hearing, nor whether the effects of musical experience differ as people age and experience differences in age-related hearing loss. Understanding how (and how much) music has positive effects on hearing ability has important implications for how we prioritize musical experiences in society, including in schools and for children. It also can help tell us about how musical experiences can affect our hearing and speech communication as we get older.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/29/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Tyler&nbsp;Perrachione</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
