The grant funds will provide student scholarships (undergraduate and graduate students from groups underrepresented in computing) and faculty from Minority Serving Institutions.  This is a continuing conference effort which the PI has led for a number of years.  \r\n\r\nThe Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing Conference is the main conference for\r\ncelebrating the diversity that exists in computing. The conference mission is to bring together\r\nundergraduate and graduate students, professionals, and faculty in computer science and computer engineering from all backgrounds and ethnicities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
