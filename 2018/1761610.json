 "awd_abstract_narration": "Glassy polymers are some of the most important engineering materials in use today.  They are used in a wide variety of products ranging from the matrix resin in aerospace composites to high impact transparent materials used in aerospace, automotive and home applications to numerous consumer goods.  Notwithstanding the commercial importance of these materials, a fundamental understanding of the glassy state remains one of the outstanding questions in science and engineering.  The design of products made from glassy polymers requires a fundamental understanding of how these materials respond when deformed.  This award supports research to uncover the mechanisms that control the deformation behavior of glassy polymers and then incorporate this understanding in quantitative models that describe the relationship between the deformation and the forces required to cause that deformation.  This research is a major step towards developing the constitutive models that describe the material response to complex deformation ? models that are at the heart of the computer codes that are used to design products made from glassy polymers.  Because of the economic importance of products made using these materials, this research will eventually benefit the U.S. economy, and thus, advance national health, prosperity, and welfare. The award will also support undergraduate research through supervision of honors thesis, and motorsports-based STEM outreach to middle and high schools in partnership with the IndyCar racing community.\r\n\r\nThe current state-of-the-art in modeling the deformation behavior of glassy polymers does not incorporate one of the key molecular concepts of polymer physics.  Specifically, although glassy polymers may appear to be spatially uniform, on the nanometer size scale glassy material exhibits significant dynamic heterogeneity, where neighboring spatial regions can have order-of-magnitude differences in local mobility.  This award supports research that will continue development of a new class of models that explicitly incorporates dynamic heterogeneity.  In addition, when materials are deformed they exhibit both deformation behavior and a thermal response; however, existing models ignore the thermal response which can contain up to half of the overall deformation energy.  A major objective of this research grant will be to unify the deformation and thermal response to provide a more physical description of the deformation process in glassy polymers.  Finally, researchers supported by this award will participate in a major STEM program, where high school students design, build and test electric go-karts that they then race as part of the Indy500 festivities.  Material properties are a key component of the classroom aspects of this STEM program, where mechanical properties of polymers are explicitly analyzed.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary objective of this research project was to develop a fundamental understanding of how glassy polymer deform.  Glassy polymers are one of the major classes of engineering materials used in a variety of commercial and industrial products, where their mechanical behavior is typically the key property determining their use.  A partial list of the application area of glassy polymers are: the matrix resin used in aerospace and automotive composite materials; transparent, shatter resistant materials for automotive and home applications (e.g. automotive head/tail lights); encapsulants for micro-electronic circuits; a variety of health care devices; and, many other applications.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nDuring the course of this research five major findings were reported:\n\n(1) The temperature dependence of a series of epoxy resins was experimentally measured, where it was determined that the relaxation behavior well above the glass transition, Tg, had two branches.  Once branch was for tightly crosslinked networks with a steep temperature dependence and the second was for loosely crosslinked, linear polymers and small molecules with a milder temperature dependence.  The surprising feature was that instead of a smooth transition with changes in molecular architecture, there is an abrupt transition between the two branches for all materials investigated.\n\n(2) For polymers well below Tg it is typically assumed that the material is frozen; however, it was shown that an epoxy polymer well below Tg does exhibit relaxation over relative short timescales, i.e. the polymer is alive deep in the glassy state.  This indicates that there are additional relaxation processes for glassy polymers that have not been accounted for to-date in constitutive models for glassy polymers.\n\n(3) The nonlinear relaxation response of a crosslinked epoxy as well as a linear polymer was investigated for a complex loading history involving loading-unloading-creep-reloading.  All of the existing constitutive models for describing the relaxation behavior of glassy polymers are inherently incapable of describing the experimental data, indicating that something important is missing in these models.  A toy model was constructed that included a structural variable related to packing efficiency that directly effects the modulus in addition to the traditional temperature and deformation dependence of the relaxation time, where this toy model is able to qualitatively capture the stress response for these more complex deformation histories.\n\n(4) The key feature of glassy polymers is that with decreasing temperature the relaxation time is orders-of-magnitude greater than would be expected - this is called super-Arrhenian behavior.  A fundamental understanding of the origin of super-Arrhenian behavior in glassy materials is considered one of the outstanding challenges in condensed matter physics.  As part of this project a new model was developed that connects super-Arrhenian relaxation response to the thermodynamic state of the material, where it was shown that the model was valid over up to 16 orders-of-magnitude of relaxation time for 21 small molecule glass forms and 16 polymer glass formers, which are all the materials for which sufficient experimental data are available.\n\n(5) Molecular simulations of the small molecule ortho-terphenyl were performed.  The simulation data were quantitatively connected to experimental data, where the model connecting the super-Arrhenian relaxation behavior to the thermodynamic state developed in 4) above was observed.  The simulations were able to reach higher temperature and much higher pressures than can be achieved experimentally thereby extending the range of the model.  \n\nThese findings have significant intellectual merit ? results that can change how scientists and engineers think about the glassy materials and their application in engineering applications.\n\nBroader Impact\n\nTwo results of the research are (i) an improved understanding of how glassy polymers deform and (ii) the origin of glassy behavior, where both these results have significant technological impact.  First, since glassy polymers are one of the major classes of materials used in modern technology, the development of models that describe how polymer glasses deform is an essential prerequisite to developing computer codes for the rational design of engineering components, devices and structures using these important materials.  The research results from this project provide a significant advance in the description of the deformation behavior of polymers in the glassy state.  Second, one of key challenges of 21st century science is to develop new and improved materials for current and emerging applications.  Glasses are an important class of materials, where the rational design of new glassy materials (either polymeric, inorganic or small molecules) requires an understanding of the physio-chemical processes that control the formation of the glassy state.  In this project a new model of how the mobility in glass forming materials depends upon the state of the glass was developed, which provides the fundamental relationship describing the formation of the glassy state ? a relationship that can be used to guide the design of new, engineering materials.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/31/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James M Caruthers"
