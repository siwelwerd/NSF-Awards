 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gravity Waves (GW) in the Earth's atmosphere exhibit highly diverse dynamics and they have multiple effects throughout the atmosphere.  These waves are believed to be the main driver of the Mesosphere and Lower Atmosphere (MLT) region, which is why they are a subject of active research and debate by the Aeronomy community in the U.S.  The GW also influence a wide range of other physical processes ranging from tidal and planetary wave structures and dynamics to minor species transport and plasma dynamics in the ionosphere.  Therefore, the need to describe such effects accurately also has broader implications for modeling climate variations, responses to variable solar forcing, and space weather, among others.  The main purpose of this three-year project is to investigate in great detail the three-dimensional structure and dynamics of GW by means of state-of-the-art numerical simulations.  The research project will also provide a significant research opportunity for a graduate student in Aeronomy.  The research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.\r\n\r\nIt is well established that GW play an important role throughout the upper atmosphere of the Earth.  These waves, however, are very difficult to model directly due to their small spatial scales.  That leads to the use of GW parameterization in global models.  This three-year project will utilize a finite-volume simulation code to solve the compressible, or an-elastic three-dimensional non-linear Navier-Stokes equations in simulations of GW.  The project team will investigate numerically the following critical scientific questions: (i) how does GW's spatial and temporal distribution influence GW's self-acceleration instability, dissipation, mean forcing, and penetration to thermosphere ionosphere?; (ii) what role do wave-wave interactions, mean wind, and stability play in GW evolution?; and, (iii) what are the key dynamics in GW-tidal interactions influencing MLT and Thermosphere-Ionosphere dynamics?\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSummary\nThis project focused on high-resolution numerical simulations of gravity wave (GW) dynamics in the atmosphere, from the surface to the lower thermosphere.  Specific topics include self-acceleration dynamics associated with GW packets, GW/small scale interactions, GW/tidal wind interactions, and secondary wave generation.  All of these topics are non-linear in nature and thus cannot be analyzed fully with approximate techniques.  High-resolution numerical simulation properly accounts for non-linearities and thus provides clear insight into some of the more complex GW processes found in the atmosphere.  All of the simulations performed and analyzed are highly novel and provide the first numerical databases for many of the configurations studied.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe self-acceleration studies focused on the differences between packetslocalized in either two or three spatial dimensions.  The two cases couldbe realized by time-varying winds blowing over either an extended mountainridge, or over an isolated mountain peak.  While both cases exhibitpronounced self-acceleration dynamics leading to turbulence, the tendency forinstability is less in the 3D case due to the lateral spreading of the packetas it propagates upward.  Likewise, the strength of both the emittedacoustic and secondary gravity waves is reduced in the 3D case.  Thesecondary waves are also highly 3D in the 3D case and appear as ifgenerated by a point source when observed on a plane well above theturbulent zone (see the bottom row in Figure 1).\n\n\nThe GW/fine scale interaction studies focused on small-scale (1/80th of theGW vertical wavelength) variations in the mean wind and mean temperatureprofiles.  Perhaps surprisingly, these seemingly insignificant structuresalways resulted in more rapid instability and turbulent breakdown ofthe underlying GW packet, even when the perturbations enhancedthe background stability! (See Figure 2).  Careful analysis of theresults indicated that baroclinic generation of additional vorticity wasresponsible for the increased tendency for instability, irrespective of thedetails of the temperature perturbation.  This finding is especiallyimportant since ubiquitous small-scale variations in the atmospheric windand temperature fields are likely to trigger turbulence in waves thatare predicted to be stable by linear theory.\n\n\nThe GW/tidal wind interaction studies focused on simulations of mountainwaves generated by strong wintertime winds blowing over the Southern Andesrange.  These waves propagate into the mesosphere where they overturnand produce a large turbulent zone.  Emitted secondary waves thenpropagate into the thermosphere.  Careful analysis of the results showsthat instability occurs initially at two distinct levels where the tidal windfields produce critical levels for the mountain waves.  As time goes on,however, the turbulence zone spreads vertically and ultimately coversa region at least 50 km deep.  The secondary waves generated in the lowerbreaking zone propagate freely through the upper critical level sincethey have non-zero ground-based frequency (see Figure 3). Strong acousticwaves are also generated in the turbulent zones and these propagate freelyinto the thermosphere.\n\n\nAll of our simulations that produce turbulence also produce secondary gravitywaves as well as acoustic waves.  While secondary waves appear to be anintrinsic byproduct of GW breaking, their characterization is quite complex.Figures 4 and 5 show a set of remarkable results where turbulence generatedin the lee of the Sierra-Nevada range generates secondary waves that thenpropagate and break at an altitude in excess of 100 km.  As Figure 5 shows,the location and orientation of the secondary waves is radically differentfrom the primary waves.  The secondary waves are also inherentlythree-dimensional since they are generated by 3D turbulence.  Thus even aquasi-2D wave packet will launch a fully-3D secondary wave field.  While mostof the secondary wave energy is at larger scale than the incident wave, thespectrum is rather full.  The wavelength of the most energetic secondarywaves does not appear to scale very well with the observed extent of theturbulent zone or with the extent of the zone where the mean wind is alteredby wave momentum deposition.  Additional research will be required toparameterize the secondary waves.\n\n\nBroader Impacts\nGravity waves play a critical role in transporting momentum and energyfrom the troposphere to the upper levels of the atmosphere.  While theseeffects have significant impacts on the global circulation they arenotoriously difficult to understand and to model.  The high-resolutionnumerical simulations completed here provide novel insight into thesecomplex dynamics and provide a rich numerical database for future studyby the atmospheric community at large. This work also resulted in several published peer-reviewed journal articles.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/26/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ling Wang"
