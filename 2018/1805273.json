 "awd_abstract_narration": "Laminar separation bubbles are prevalent in many practical systems including aircraft wings, rotorcraft blades and gas turbine blades among others. This relatively small region of the flow plays a dominant role in the governing physical processes, yet it remains poorly understood. This research project will drastically advance the current understanding of laminar separation bubbles by thoroughly evaluating the interplay between relevant flow instabilities. In doing so, this will foster new strategies for the control of laminar separation bubbles leading to improvements in performance and efficiency across many aerodynamic platforms. The project will partially support one post-doctoral researcher, one PhD student and one undergraduate student. Existing outreach programs will be expanded to include experimental and numerical flow visualizations targeting underrepresented minority groups. The outreach program is buoyed by the rich cultural diversity of Tucson, AZ and surrounding areas as well as the importance of aerospace to the state economy. \r\n\r\nThe primary objective of the proposed research is to investigate competition between the shear layer instability and the 3D (Klebanoff) mode as it relates to active flow control of laminar separation bubbles. Previous direct numerical simulations performed at the University of Arizona have shown that it is possible to eliminate a laminar separation bubble (even if it has transitioned to turbulence downstream of separation) by 2D periodic forcing at a frequency related to the shear layer instability of the time-averaged flow field. The efficacy of this approach is dependent on the level of freestream turbulence in the simulation, and it has been shown numerically that even small levels render this technique less effective. Recent successful demonstrations at the University of Arizona suggest the technique is feasible, but effectiveness is influenced by pressure gradient and local Reynolds number, which further complicate the fundamental physics. This work will employ the latest instrumentation and a state-of-the-art low-speed wind tunnel capable of various levels of freestream turbulence to investigate the competition between flow instabilities as they pertain to active flow control. Freestream turbulence will be modeled in high-fidelity direct numerical simulations using experimental data thus quantifying the influence of pressure gradient and Reynolds number. Active flow control in the form of dielectric barrier discharge plasma will be employed in the experiment and modeled in the simulation. This synergistic research approach will strengthen established outreach and international exchange programs all while producing a breakthrough in this rich and important field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

With enough development length, an initially laminar boundary layer will \"transition\" to turbulent. Furthermore, if the boundary layer is subjected to a strong adverse pressure gradient (an increase in pressure along the wall), it may not follow the contour of the wall and the flow can \"separate\" from the surface. Separation and transition are encountered on numerous aerodynamic systems and its prediction and/or avoidance is often crucial.</p><p>The layer of flow above a separated region is bounded on one side by a fast moving free-stream and on the other by nearly stagnant fluid. Due to the velocity differences on either side, this region is called a shear layer. Shear layers are highly unstable and often transition from laminar to turbulent over a short streamwise distance. Small disturbances grow along the shear-layer, causing wave like fluctuations and ultimately roll up into spanwise two-dimensional structures. The growth of numerous other disturbances will eventually lead to a breakdown of these structures and transition to turbulence. The roller structures and the turbulence move fluid with higher momentum towards the wall and allow the flow to reattach to the wall as a - now chaotic - turbulent boundary layer. The pocket enclosed by the detached fluid layer, between separation and reattachment, is called a laminar separation bubble (LSB). The presence of such a bubble and the subsequent turbulent boundary-layer downstream can drastically affect aerodynamic performance and efficiency on systems such as aircraft wings, helicopter rotors and turbine blades.</p><p>The goal of this project was to understand the instability of the shear layer and exploit its ability to generate organized 2-D laminar \"roller\" structures. Computer simulations have shown that with the right disturbance input, the roller structures are amplified and become more robust compared to other disturbances in the flow field. In a best-case scenario, these rollers can move enough high momentum fluid towards the wall to reattach the flow, without transitioning to turbulence. We wanted to know if this was possible not just in ideal conditions in the simulation; but also, in wind tunnel experiments which, like all other real-world applications, inherently possess some level of uncontrollable disturbances.</p><p>The Arizona Low Speed Wind Tunnel (ALSWT) provides a test environment with very low disturbance levels but to match the experimental conditions, random disturbances still had to be generated at the inflow in the direct numerical simulations (DNS). Through a close collaboration, our experimental and computational groups were able to establish an almost identical LSB allowed us to understand the precise details of the separation and transition processes as well as their control.</p><p>It was shown that introduction of small disturbances upstream of the LSB at the appropriate frequency strengthens the characteristic roller structures in both the experiments and DNS. The flow field is more organized, but transition to turbulence still occurs near the reattachment location. The DNS revealed that another instability modulates the roller structures, destabilizing them and causing transition. To increase the efficacy of the forcing input, it is moved closer to the separation location. In this case, we observed strong two-dimensional rollers in the experiment and the flow field appears well-organized. However, another 3-D periodic pattern appears downstream of reattachment alongside the rollers. Similar three-dimensional structures were observed in the DNS when random disturbances were introduced in the freestream to approximate the ALSWT environment. However, simulations without random disturbances in the freestream are able to significantly delay transition. Thus, the presence of FST in experiments and DNS causes interaction between the periodic forcing (2-D rollers) and the 3-D disturbances. This reduces the efficacy of the forcing and prevents laminar \"rollers\" flow from persisting downstream. Based on our DNS results, we believe that fine tuning of the forcing amplitude, location and direction in the experiment can allow us to achieve further delay of turbulent breakdown.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/29/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jesse&nbsp;C&nbsp;Little</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1805273/1805273_10549007_1635480618830_LSB_Schematic--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1805273/1805273_10549007_1635480618830_LSB_Schematic--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Laminar separation bubble\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1805273/1805273_10549007_1635480618830_LSB_Schematic--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Laminar separation bubble\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Schematic of flow phenomena in a laminar separation bubble (LSB)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">David Borgmann</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jesse&nbsp;C&nbsp;Little</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Laminar separation bubble</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porColContainerHR\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\">\n<h2>Addendum # 1</h2><p><span>To support the understanding of the report we are providing additional images.</span></p><br>\n<p>Added: 12/02/2021<br>Submitted by: Jesse&nbsp;C&nbsp;Little</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery1\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount1\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto1\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls1\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow1\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation1\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs1\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1805273/1805273_10549007_1638473400926_POR_Picture3_resized_V2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1805273/1805273_10549007_1638473400926_POR_Picture3_resized_V2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Dominant Structures in the Forced LSB\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1805273/1805273_10549007_1638473400926_POR_Picture3_resized_V2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Dominant Structures in the Forced LSB\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Dominant Structures in the Laminar Separation Bubble (Experiment, top), and an instantaneous view (DNS, bottom), showing the rollers and spanwise modulation by the second most dominant mode (with free-stream turbulence and active flow control).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Shirzad Hosseinverdi, David Borgmann</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jesse&nbsp;C&nbsp;Little</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Dominant Structures in the Forced LSB</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1805273/1805273_10549007_1638473082773_POR_Picture2_resized_V2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1805273/1805273_10549007_1638473082773_POR_Picture2_resized_V2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Active Flow Control Without Free-Stream Turbulence\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1805273/1805273_10549007_1638473082773_POR_Picture2_resized_V2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Active Flow Control Without Free-Stream Turbulence\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Instantaneous vorticity in the laminar separation bubble, showing the effect of active flow control without free-stream turbulence (Direct Numerical Simulations)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Shirzad Hosseinverdi, David Borgmann</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jesse&nbsp;C&nbsp;Little</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Active Flow Control Without Free-Stream Turbulence</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
