 "awd_abstract_narration": "The manipulation of monomer sequence as a means to produce structure and function in a polymer is well established for natural polymers, such as DNA and proteins.  However, for synthetic polymers it is prohibitively difficult, if not impossible, to precisely control the sequences of their building blocks. For applications in which low fidelity in sequence control is sufficient, a useful alternative to specific sequence control is to take a statistical approach, which may be preferable from a cost-benefit standpoint. The proposed research aims to use statistical sequence control to develop polymeric materials for drug delivery applications with improved biodegradation and drug release properties.  \r\n\r\nThe focus of the proposed research is to develop poly(D,L-lacticco- glycolic acid) (PLGA) copolyesters having improved biodegradation and drug release properties.  PLGA is the most prevalent polymeric material used in drug delivery applications. Currently, commercial PLGA polymers are produced by batch-type copolymerization reactions, which typically produce non-sequence-controlled \"Gradient PLGA\" copolymers because of the disparate reactivities of lactide (LA) and glycolide (GL) monomers toward polymerization. The proposed research will aim at advancing the fundamental understanding of ring-opening polymerization to control monomer sequence distribution along random copolymer PLGA, and developing a framework to understand how monomer sequence distribution affects drug encapsulation and release properties of the polymer. A set of structure-property studies is proposed to investigate the relationship between sequences and drug delivery. The scope of work is fundamental, and if successful, could have impact in both pharmaceutical and polymer research. The research project will provide integrated training for graduate and undergraduate students in a multidisciplinary environment and teach them skills that are necessary for developing the future generation of chemical engineering and polymer science researchers. Hands-on modules will be developed to demonstrate controlled release processes in outreach events. A Summer High School Research Experience Program is proposed and curriculum development is planned in the field of polymer, colloid and interface science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In this FRCP method, the comonomer mixture is continuously fed into the copolymerization at a sufficiently slow rate so that the disparity of the reactivities of the comonomers does not bias the monomer sequence distribution of the copolymer product, and as a result, monodisperse uniform copolyester products with non-gradient sequence characteristics can easily be produced. In this research, the FRCP method was used as a tool to address the gap that exists in this field, namely, the lack of understanding regarding the role that statistical monomer sequence plays in producing structural, degradation and drug encapsulation/release properties in PLGA materials. We found that when drug molecules are loaded into a matrix formed by uniform copolyester chains, the sequence uniformity forces the drug molecules to be more homogeneously distributed within the polymer matrix, which significantly suppresses the burst release of the drug and overall causes the release process to be more predictable, simple and uniform. Therefore, the FRCP method also offers a facile and scalable route for the production of non-gradient (precisely but) statistically monomer sequence-controlled uniform aliphatic copolyesters, such as uniform PLGA, for enhanced controlled release applications.</p>\n<p><strong>BROADER IMAPCTS</strong></p>\n<p>Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) is a biodegradable, FDA-approved biocompatible, copolymer of lactide (LA) and glycolide (GL).
