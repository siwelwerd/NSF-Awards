 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past decade, two major trends have reshaped data science: (i) a growing tidal wave of imaging and sensing devices and (ii) the rapid adoption of break-through machine learning technologies. From autonomous vehicles to medical devices, the ability to collect and analyze large quantities of data is changing the world. The goal of this research project is to create a new mathematical and computational framework for integrating distributed and multimodal sensor data into multiple types of emerging models in data science and machine learning so as to extract more information from data. The project team includes researchers from diverse disciplines who will address problems ranging from physical science and medicine to consumer imaging and industrial inspection. The research will result in theories, algorithms, and open software that can be used to integrate information from heterogeneous sensing systems to estimate and reconstruct signals and images.\r\n\r\nThe framework for model-data integration is based on a new theory of Multi-Agent Consensus Equilibrium (MACE). MACE allows for modular integration of multi-modal physical sensor information with information derived from data science models. At the core of this approach is the computational solution of the consensus equilibrium equations. These equations balance distributed sensor information with prior knowledge provided by machine learning models. The MACE framework is a generalization of the more traditional Bayesian or regularized inverse approach, but it allows for the use of non-traditional data science models such as deep convolutional neural networks in the solution of sensing and imaging problems. This project's contributions are in four areas: Thrust 1: Foundational Theoretical Methods; Thrust 2: Robust Sensor and Data Model Integration; Thrust 3: Multimodal and Networked MACE; and Thrust 4: Automated Experimentation. The project also includes integrated educational activities, engaging both graduate and undergraduate students in this research, as well as the development of new courses on consensus equilibrium and nonlinear optical imaging.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "This   Purdue-led NSF CIF-Medium project created a  coherent theoretical,  algorithmic, andcomputational framework, called  Multi-Agent Consensus  Equilibrium (MACE), that enables the modular  integration of multi-modal  physical sensor information with information  derived from data science  models. The team of 4 co-PIs published  several dozen results and  applications of MACE covering a wide a variety  of scientific fields.\n\n\nMACE   reformulates the optimization approach widely used for many scientific   problems into the idea of a consensus equilibrium among agents. In  the MACE  framework, an agent is an input-output operator that takes a  candidate  solution and produces a solution that better fits the   criteria of that agent. An example would be an agent that better fits a   solution to some measured data. In an optimization approach, all of   the information used to constrain a solution must be written as a   function to minimize. But in practice, solution methods for  optimization  methods also proceed one step at a time in search of the  lowest cost  solution, so MACE is a natural generalization of this  approach.\n\n\nHowever,   MACE is able to use information that is not easily encoded via a cost   function. Neural network image denoisers are one example of an agent   that is not easily written using a cost function. Such denoisers encode   a great deal of information about the statistics of natural images, so   much so that they form the foundation of the recent success of   generative methods used to create images and videos. MACE is able to   use these denoisers as one kind of agent to serve as a regularizer to   balance the information from noisy measured data. This balance is   achieved when each agent has the same output (they are in consensus) and   the update steps of all the agents sum to 0 (they are in  equilibrium).\n\n\nThe   generality and flexibility of MACE lends itself to a wide variety of   scientific applications. The PIs have investigated many applications in   collaboration with government and industry labs. A few examples   include ptychography, in which X-ray lasers are used to image at the   scale of a few nanometers; digital holography, in which lasers are used   to estimate in real time the turbulence around a jet; photon counting  CT  scanners, which promise increased resolution and material   identification in soft tissue; and electronic structure determination,   in which multiple models of molecular structure are reconciled using   MACE to produce results better than any model individually.\n\n\nAs  evidence of the effects of this grant, it has partially supported  over  a dozen PhD students who have gone on to research careers in  industry  or the national labs.
