 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a large collection of open-source software for robotics that has, over the past decade, allowed more rapid progress in the field than was possible in the past.  The ROS software includes all of the low-level \"plumbing\" that roboticists used to write for themselves to make motors turn, to get data from their sensors, and to implement basic competences like moving around the world.  It supports a wide array of robot hardware, and is increasingly being used by companies across the country.  ROS is written and maintained by a large collection of volunteers from around the world and, like any large open-source project, has some management challenges.  Under this award, we will identify these challenges, and come up with concrete solutions for them, to ensure that ROS remains as useful over the coming decade as it was in the past.\r\n\r\nThis planning award will survey the ROS community to identify the areas of the ecosystem and management best practices that need improvement, with the goal of writing a Community Research Infrastructure proposal to implement these changes.  We will deploy on-line surveys to the community, and hold focused workshops at both the ROS Developers Conference and more general robotics conferences.  We will analyze the data from these surveys and workshops, alongside more concrete data from the existing infrastructure (wiki, Q&A site, etc) to determine what the most pressing community needs are, and then propose strategies to directly address them in a sustainable manner that continues to engage the community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Robot Operating System (ROS) is a collection of software that enables the development of advanced robot applications.  It is an open source collection of software that people all over the planet contribute to, and it has become the de facto standard in universities and companies.  Over the years, the ROS community has struggled with keeping the software up to date, attracting new community members to help with the work, and with making the software robust and reliable.  This award focused on identifying fixes that would address these three problems.\n\nOver the course of the award, we talked to members of the ROS community to understand where the \"pain points\" are, and what could be done to help them.  What was preventing them from maintaining the software, recruiting and retaining new team members, and applying rigorous software engineering techniques.  We held workshops at major robotics conferences, carried out surveys of the community, and talked to community leaders.\n\nWe found that there was no single cause of problems.  The online collaboration tools and resources were good, but not great.  There was sufficient guidance from the Open Source Robotics Foundation, but more would be appreciated.  More transparency in the decisions that guided the core development of ROS would be good.  One key point that came up again and again was the lack of a strong, focused, interactive community where people could swap ideas, software, and results.  While there is an annual conference, called ROSCon, this was not seen as frequent enough to tie the community together.\n\nThe key finding of this award is that, while additional tools and resources would be welcomed, the best way to make an impact is to have a more focused, regular, structured interaction between members of the ROS community.  This needs to be facilitiated by an organization that will coordinate online and in-person meetings, make connections between people, help with recruiting and software maintenance management, and hold people socially accountable for the code they maintain.\n\nThe findings from this award were incorporated into our successful proposal to the CCRI program.  In this, we proposed to build approximately 50 social robots, powered by ROS, and to build a community of researchers around this common hardware platform.  As part of this we will host regular meetings, both online and in-person, provide guidance and best practices for the community, and address the other problems identified we identified in out planning award.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/17/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William D Smart"
