 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gamma-rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation. Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe and can be used to test fundamental physics.  The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS), located in southern Arizona, is a ground-based observatory designed to study high energy gamma-rays.  VERITAS has unique capabilities, providing high sensitivity pointed observations of both galactic and extragalactic sources.  This award supports scientists at Barnard College to carry out research with VERITAS.  The group will participate in both technical operations in support of the observatory and in scientific investigations with a focus on studying emission from active galaxies, pulsar wind nebulae, and unidentified gamma-ray sources.  The Barnard College group is heavily engaged in education and outreach efforts.  They involve undergraduate students in astrophysics research with an emphasis on broadening the participation of women.  They are also involved in outreach efforts to high-school students in the New York City area.\r\n\r\nVERITAS has embarked upon a broad program of galactic and extragalactic source observations, as well as studies of signatures for new physics such as dark matter.  With this award the Barnard College group will participate in VERITAS observing campaigns and carry out scientific data analysis with a focus on the extragalactic physics of active galaxies and cosmology.  Their scientific program will also include the study of galactic sources such as pulsar wind nebulae, investigating the nature of unidentified gamma-ray sources, and using multi-messenger approaches to investigate the origin of cosmic rays.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

To date, more than 200 sources have been discovered above 100 GeV, representing ten different classes of astrophysical objects. VERITAS is an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope that continues to provide high-quality gamma-ray observations with excellent sensitivity, with detailed measurements of the morphology and spectra of sources. The Barnard group is also engaged in the development of a dual-mirror prototype Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope (pSCT), a novel and potentially transformative next-generation instrument, that has recently demonstrated proof-of-concept with the detection of the Crab Nebula. The principal objective of this proposal was to carry out particle astrophysics research at Barnard College with VERITAS and the pSCT (Attachment 1).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This grant supported the work of the PI and postdoctoral scholars carrying out research on blazars, a class of active galactic nuclei: objects powered by supermassive black holes, with ultra-relativistic jets (outflows of particles) pointed close to our line of sight. Gamma-ray blazars often exhibit episodic and dramatic flares. A significant outcome of the grant was the study of gamma-ray and multiwavelength emission from the blazar VER J0521+211 during an elevated TeV gamma-ray state. A leptonic model was used to describe the observed spectral energy distribution from VER J0521+211, allowing information about the jet to be inferred. The possibility of neutrino production at energies up to 20 PeV in the source from the magnetic confinement of protons within the emitting region in the jet was not ruled out. (Attachment 2: Adams, C. B., et al., \"Multiwavelength Observations of the Blazar VER J0521+211 during an Elevated TeV Gamma-Ray State,\" DOI: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ac6dd9\">https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ac6dd9</a>.).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This grant supported the work of graduate students carrying out research on gamma-ray blazars. A key outcome of this project was an in-depth study of the light curves of three flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) with VERITAS and Fermi-LAT to explore the variability and spectral characteristics&nbsp;of blazars flaring at GeV energies. FSRQs are the most luminous blazars at GeV energies, but are rare at TeV energies. This study made it possible to strongly constrain the jet Doppler factors and gamma-ray emission region locations during the flaring episodes. Theoretical constraints on the potential production of PeV-scale neutrinos during these VHE flares were also placed. Observations of blazars at TeV energies probe the innermost regions of these powerful accelerators where the bulk of their luminosity is emitted. (Attachment 3: Adams, C. B., et al., VERITAS and Fermi-LAT Collaborations, \"Variability and Spectral Characteristics of Three Flaring Gamma-ray Quasars Observed by VERITAS and Fermi-LAT,\" DOI: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ac32bd\">https://</a><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ac32bd\">doi.org</a><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ac32bd\">/10.3847/1538-4357/ac32bd</a>).</p>\n<p>This grant supported the work of graduate students carrying out an archival analysis of VERITAS data. A significant outcome was the results of a search for transient events in very-high-energy gamma rays using archival observations from VERITAS to look for coincidences with sub-threshold binary neutron star merger candidates identified in Advanced LIGO?s first observing run (O1). LIGO/Virgo gravitational-wave detectors and the IceCube Neutrino Observatory record many candidate signals that fall short of the detection significance threshold. The &nbsp;recent discovery of electromagnetic signals in coincidence with neutron star mergers has solidified the importance of multi-messenger campaigns in studying the most energetic astrophysical events. Eight hours of archival VERITAS observations coincident with seven binary neutron star sub-threshold merger candidates were identified. A search for TeV emission found no detectable gamma-ray emission but such searches in the future during the era of CTA could be promising. (Attachment 4: Adams, C. B., et al., \"An Archival Search for Neutron-Star Mergers in Gravitational Waves and Very-High-Energy Gamma Rays,\" DOI: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ac0623\">https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ac0623</a>.)</p>\n<p>A major activity of scientists at Barnard in the multi-messenger astronomy program was in carrying out follow-up observations of astrophysical sources associated with neutrino events announced by IceCube. The Barnard group successfully triggered a NuSTAR target-of-opportunity proposal to carry out follow-up observations of the blazar PKS 0735+178 located immediately outside the 90% error region of &nbsp;a neutrino event. A scientific report will be published shortly.</p>\n<p>This research grant enabled the Barnard group to advance the commissioning of the prototype Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope, in particular in activities related to the upgrade of the pSCT camera and simulation studies with the SCT array added to the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA).</p>\n<p><span>A significant outcome of the research grant was to engage in education at all levels, from K-12 (three students) to the training and mentoring of seven undergraduate students, two graduate students and two postdoctoral research scientists at Barnard College and Columbia University.
