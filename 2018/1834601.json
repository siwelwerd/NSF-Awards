 "awd_abstract_narration": "Developing and maintaining a diverse, innovative workforce in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math (known as STEM) is critical to American competitiveness in the world, but national surveys report a current and future shortage of highly qualified STEM professionals in the US. One problem creating this shortage is that more than half of all college students who declare a major in STEM fields drop out or change their majors in the first two years of their post-secondary education.  This problem is particularly acute for first generation college students.  If we could increase the STEM degree completion rate by just 25%, we would make up 75% of the additional workforce needed over the next decade.  This project assembles undergraduate students, K-12 educators, college faculty and policy makers in West Virginia to form the First2 STEM Success Alliance.  The Alliance aims to improve the college enrollment rate and success of undergraduate STEM students, with emphasis on rural first generation students through their first 2 years of college. At the core of our shared vision to improve student STEM success is the assumption that the students themselves should be co-creators of the solutions.  The First2 Alliance will engage over 350 undergraduate FG students in the NICs, research internships, peer-mentoring activities, and the FIRST Ambassador Program. As FIRST Ambassadors, students are guided to explore the disconnect between home life and STEM study, and conduct outreach to hometown students and K-12 stakeholders, their collegiate institutions, and their state legislators to illuminate the disconnect and suggest policy/practice changes to better support rural first generation STEM student success.  \r\n\r\nOur change strategy is to implement the proven methodologies of Networked Improvement Communities (NICs) to  study, improve and replicate promising programs that impact STEM persistence. Specifically, First2 Improvement teams will: 1) improve preparation for and transition to college; 2) replace ingrained institutional practices that stifle the development of STEM self-efficacy with 3) connect rural home culture and college STEM culture.  As a rural state, West Virginia lags behind in the development of networks, alliances and  long-term collaborations.  The First2 Student Success Alliance will execute a comprehensive plan to build organizational capacity for a long-term Alliance, which includes a permanent hub organization and in so doing we will learn how to collaborate effectively and will document what we learn. The First2 Alliance model can be disseminated  to assist other rural states in developing their own STEM-capable workforce.  Finally, the First2 Alliance will advance our knowledge of  barriers to and solutions that increase  the success of first generation students in STEM. There are many studies that inquire into the factors that correlate with post-secondary retention in general, and with STEM attrition specifically but few that focus on rural students.  The First2 Alliance will conduct a rigorous educational research study aimed at advancing understanding of the factors affecting rural students' entry into and persistence in STEM career pathways.  From an improvement science and research perspective, we hypothesize that our work will apply to improving the persistence of all first generation STEM students, not just rural students.\r\n\r\nThis NSF INCLUDES Alliance is co-funded by the NSF Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) program. EPSCoR enhances research competitiveness of targeted jurisdictions (states, territories, commonwealth) by strengthening STEM capacity and capability.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

One third of our members are first-generation, rural or low income STEM students. The aim of First2 Network is to double the graduation rate for undergraduate STEM students, by changing systems within higher education. When we started out, the persistence rate of first generation STEM students in West Virginia was about 30%. This was the number of first-generation students who graduated with a degree in STEM after declaring a STEM major as a freshman. Why is this percentage so low?  First2 research has uncovered that math entry point matters for our students.&nbsp; Seventy percent of STEM students who come in calculus ready graduate with a STEM major.  In our region, only  47% of non-first gen students come in calculus ready, and only 31% of first gen and  rural students start college calculus ready. The main culprit is lack of opportunities for students at rural high schools-- including fewer certified STEM teachers and fewer AP courses. First2 has also learned that, while these obstacles can be overcome, first-generation students in particular, may not know how to navigate campus resources once they enter college to get the help they need. They are morel likely to have &ldquo;imposter syndrome&rdquo; and be reluctant to seek the help they need.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Cambria, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><span style=\"background: transparent;\">First2 Network members work to change this narrative.

High impact change ideas involve, for example, changes to the ways resources are allocated to better support STEM students, changes in course curricula or procedures, academic advising and new ideas to build faculty-student relationships or create internships for students. All teams use common metrics to measure success or failure of these change ideas and share what they learn with each other. </span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Cambria, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><span style=\"background: transparent;\">First2 Network works in true partnership with student leaders &ndash; not to, not for, but with students.&nbsp; A deep understanding of the obstacles to success for first-generation, rural, low income and other underrepresented STEM students in higher education (who we collectively refer to as First2 students) requires the input of students currently in the system.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n The First2 Network is a two-state Networked Improvement Community that engages nine higher education institutions in WV and Kentucky and partners with 30 other groups including non-profit organizations, state and federal government, and industry. One third of our members are first-generation, rural or low income STEM students. The aim of First2 Network is to double the graduation rate for undergraduate STEM students, by changing systems within higher education. When we started out, the persistence rate of first generation STEM students in West Virginia was about 30%. This was the number of first-generation students who graduated with a degree in STEM after declaring a STEM major as a freshman. Why is this percentage so low?  First2 research has uncovered that math entry point matters for our students. Seventy percent of STEM students who come in calculus ready graduate with a STEM major.  In our region, only  47% of non-first gen students come in calculus ready, and only 31% of first gen and  rural students start college calculus ready. The main culprit is lack of opportunities for students at rural high schools-- including fewer certified STEM teachers and fewer AP courses. First2 has also learned that, while these obstacles can be overcome, first-generation students in particular, may not know how to navigate campus resources once they enter college to get the help they need. They are morel likely to have imposter syndrome and be reluctant to seek the help they need.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nFirst2 Network members work to change this narrative.  Campus teams made up of students, faculty and student success staff  iteratively test high impact practices aligned with a simple theory of change. The First2 theory of change is organized around  four categories or drivers will improve the retention of all STEM students: (1) academic success, (2) fit and belonging, (3) workplace experiences, and (4) student leadership.  High impact change ideas involve, for example, changes to the ways resources are allocated to better support STEM students, changes in course curricula or procedures, academic advising and new ideas to build faculty-student relationships or create internships for students. All teams use common metrics to measure success or failure of these change ideas and share what they learn with each other. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nFirst2 Network works in true partnership with student leaders  not to, not for, but with students. A deep understanding of the obstacles to success for first-generation, rural, low income and other underrepresented STEM students in higher education (who we collectively refer to as First2 students) requires the input of students currently in the system. Not only do students lived experiences inform the Network; students are at the table helping to co-create solutions that will have the highest impact \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n First2 Network has made significant progress in changing campus systems, while providing transformational leadership experiences for students and faculty at all First2 campuses.  Students who are highly connected to and/or take leadership roles in the network are significantly more likely to persist in STEM majors. Students who participate in First2 interventions likewise show evidence of greater success and retention than their peers. First2 asks its campus teams to provide aggregated data on the overall impact of its change ideas and has compiled the results for each partner school Across all campuses for which we have data, students who participated in First2 change ideas last year, ( 1,000 STEM majors, at WVU alone persist at a significantly greater percentage than similar groups of students who did not participate in First2 change ideas.  There is clearly an impact on persistence for those students who have participated or been impacted by a First2 Network instigated change idea. To date, thirty-three papers and conference proceedings have been published. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n First2 has also accomplished meaningful policy changes in the state of WV. The first of these is the AmeriCorps tuition waiver law which provides college tuition waivers for students who serve as AmeriCorps members while they are taking classes or even if they have to stop out of college for a period of time. First2 secured another significant win during the 2024 legislative session: a re-entry pathway to the Promise Scholarship  a key merit-based financial aid program for West Virginia high school graduates. Prior to passage of this bill, students who fell below a 3.0 grade point average or were unable to complete 30 credit hours per year as an undergraduate would permanently lose the scholarship. Now, once they re-qualify, they can reapply for the aid.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/21/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: SueAHeatherly\n"
