 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineers' decisions drive the design of our ever-changing world and influence our quality of life.  When making decisions, everyone, including engineers, uses at least three distinct forms of reasoning:  rational, intuitive and emotive.  Each reasoning pattern plays a valuable role in decision-making, and people's underlying beliefs about different forms of reasoning informs their approach to decision-making.  Since our society relies on engineers to make robust decisions, a critical part of the professional formation of engineers is development of beliefs about different reasoning strategies.   However, we do not know much about engineering students' beliefs in this area.  What we do know is that undergraduate engineering students typically receive little formal instruction on how to make complex decisions. What instruction they do receive is often limited to analysis in contexts of abundant information or the introduction of rational decision-making tools. Typical engineering instruction may convey to students, who make decisions rationally, intuitively, and emotionally, that rational approaches alone are valuable.  The sole focus on rational forms of reasoning may discourage some students from continuing in engineering. This project will investigate the beliefs that engineering students hold about decision-making and how these beliefs are influenced by their experiences with the engineering curricula.  Findings from this project will be leveraged to change how decision-making is taught so engineering curricula will be more inclusive and realistic.\r\n\r\nTo characterize engineering students'  beliefs about different forms of reasoning for decision-making near the end of undergraduate engineering formation, this qualitative, exploratory study will: (i) develop and validate interview and reflection protocols, (ii) collect and analyze data using these protocols through semi-structured, one-on-one interviews and written reflections both during a capstone design experience and one year later, and (iii) engage capstone design instructors in translating the findings to recommendations for practice.  The research team will utilize a framework for decision-making that values at least three different forms of reasoning:  rational, intuitive, and emotive to guide their investigation.  The pilot study in Year 1 will validate the data collection protocols before performing a larger study in Year 2.  In both studies, written reflections will be submitted by participants at regular intervals to capture their beliefs about decision-making in the context of a capstone design experience. Also, interviews will be conducted both before and after participants receive formal instruction on decision-making in their capstone design courses.  After written reflections and interview data have been analyzed, findings from the study are expected to shed light on students' beliefs. The findings will then be translated to concrete recommendations for the teaching and learning of decision-making in engineering through the engagement of capstone design practitioners with backgrounds; including industrial design, engineering industry, and entrepreneurship. The purpose is to change how engineering decision-making is taught and to hopefully change students' beliefs about engineering decision-making and their commitment to engineering.  This work could be instrumental in transforming engineering education to be more inclusive though improving the ways in which undergraduates develop their beliefs about different forms of reasoning.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Engineering design decisions are complex and do not have a single right answer or single metric for success. Therefore, engineers need to be able to use different approaches to making engineering design decisions. However, the normative ways for teaching undergraduate engineers foster a belief that technical or \"objective\" approaches are alone valuable in the work that engineers do. If undergraduate education produces engineers that don\u2019t recognize the value of empathic or intuitive approaches to decision making, we are limiting the effectiveness of those who have an impact on the design of our world and perpetuating the status quo in which engineers remain predominantly male and white. \n\n\nThis project's purpose was to study the beliefs engineering students held about different approaches to making engineering design decisions at the end of their undergraduate education. We interviewed students at both the beginning and end of their capstone design course, which is typically expected to help engineers transition from school to work by teaching design. We also had them submit written reflections, and we spoke with their instructors to understand the course context. As we advanced through the research, we collaborated with capstone instructors from several different departments to help us translate our findings into real changes in their classrooms that mattered to them. They changed things like the language they used in class (e.g., they began to talk directly about the role of empathy in engineering design), the content of the slides they presented, the way they used their class time (e.g., allowing for more time to build empathy within a team and talk about engineering design decisions explicitly), and the assessment for the course. \n\n\nThe first outcome of this research project included a framework for studying undergraduate students\u2019 beliefs about different approaches to engineering design decisions. The framework included both effortful (technical, empathic) and automatic (experienced-based, guess-based) approaches. We also identified a range of beliefs held by the students. Not surprisingly, students believed that technical approaches are the dominant approach used within engineering, and they valued this approach most in a hierarchy of approaches. Students shared a belief that technical approaches are not only the dominant approach used for engineering design decisions, but also the focus of their experiences in engineering. At the same time, students did convey a belief that technical approaches are limited; they believed that they cannot really be used exclusively because engineers would run out of time, or not have enough data to make decisions with technical approaches alone. Therefore, students believed that automatic approaches (experienced-based and guess-based approaches) may come in to fill the gap when technical approaches reach their limit. Experience-based approaches were understood as available to engineers only with relevant technical expertise. Guess-based approaches were interpreted as a last resort to make engineering design decisions. We also found that students and faculty believed that using empathic approaches is valuable when making engineering design decisions, but it can be difficult to teach and assess. Students shared a belief that empathic approaches can serve to enhance decision making but are not necessary for all engineering contexts. In terms of how the students\u2019 experiences in their capstone design course influence their beliefs, our findings provided almost no evidence of change in students\u2019 beliefs. Specifically, we found that the small shifts in students\u2019 beliefs were mostly to do with guess-based approaches, and the ways in which those beliefs changed was not consistent across students such that it would seem to be a result of their capstone experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/01/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Emily A Dringenberg"
