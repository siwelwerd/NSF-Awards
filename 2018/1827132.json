 "awd_abstract_narration": "In much of the world, including sub-Saharan Africa, people lack safe drinking water and adequate sanitation. Although there have been a number of efforts to develop low-cost, efficient methods to treat water and wastewater, many of them fail in practice due to the lack of understanding of social and economic factors, and the lack of community engagement. This project will engage fifteen (15) IRES participants and three (3) graduate assistants from STEM, STEM education, public health and social sciences in carrying out research to develop, test and implement the technologies, such as biosand filters and decentralized sanitation systems, while uncovering and addressing social factors that limit their use in the field. The project will take place in collaboration with students and faculty at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), as well as teachers and pupils in a local secondary school in Kumasi, Ghana.  US students will experience real on-the-ground water and sanitation situations that will enhance their research skills as they develop the global competence needed to work effectively in developing countries.  Specific objectives are to: 1) increase the number of US students engaging in global water and sanitation research, 2) enhance student understanding of the complexity of water and sanitation challenges and increase their global competency, 3) engage secondary school teachers and pupils in Ghana in authentic science and participatory action research, and 4) develop strong collaborations between USF and KNUST for water and sanitation research and education.\r\n\r\nThe participating research teams will advance research and development of: 1) biosand filters that simultaneously address infectious disease and dental/skeletal health risks that are prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, and 2) decentralized ecological sanitation technologies, such as constructed wetlands, urine diverting dry toilets and biodigesters, which recover valuable resources (water, nutrients, energy) from human wastes.  Each team will work on technology development, appropriate financing mechanisms and effective behavioral and educational approaches to improve WASH practices. \r\n\r\nIRES participants will directly experience WASH research in the geopolitical, socioeconomic and cultural context of Ghana.  These experiences will enhance their understanding of WASH challenges and build their global competency.  We will recruit female and underrepresented minority students through programs and clubs that emphasize diversity, community colleges and minority serving institutions.  Extensive professional development and mentoring programs are planned for IRES participants.  Results will be integrated into courses taught by the PIs and outreach to the Tampa Bay community, K12 science teachers and students.  The project will strengthen the partnership between USF and KNUST and create opportunities for future collaborations, particularly in WASH research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

However, many WASH interventions in developing countries are unsuccessful due to an overemphasis of technological solutions, lack of community ownership, underestimation of WASH component linkages, and lack of human and financial resources. The objectives of this project were therefore to: 1) increase the number of US students engaging in global WASH research, 2) enhance student understanding of the complexity of WASH challenges and increase their global competency, 3) engage secondary teachers and pupils in Ghana in authentic science research focused on WASH solutions, and 4) develop strong collaborations between USF and two partner universities in Ghana for WASH research and education.</p>\n<p>The project engaged US students with students and faculty in two universities in Ghana, and with Ghanaian secondary school teachers and pupils, in research on sustainable WASH solutions. Our hosts for this project were Dr. Richard Buamah from the Department of Civil Engineering at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) and Dr. Kofi Acheaw Owusu from the Department of Science Education at University of Cape Coast (UCC). The collaborating secondary schools were Kumasi Academy (Kumaca; 2019) and Ghana National College (GNC; 2022, 2023).&nbsp; A multidisciplinary group of US graduate and undergraduate students participated in the project, including fifteen (15) IRES participants (five in each summer of travel) and three (3) graduate assistants (1 per year). Ten of the IRES participants were female and five were male. Eleven of the 15 were from underrepresented minorities. All the graduate assistants were women from underrepresented groups. The IRES participants were engaged in the project for seven weeks each summer. This included: 1) an initial series of online and in-person workshops to learn about life and culture in Ghana and WASH and science education research methods, 2) five weeks at KNUST (2019) or UCC (2022, 2023), and 3) a final week at USF for data analysis and research dissemination. Several of the IRES participants continued to work with the PIs on research dissemination and outreach activities throughout the year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Each summer, IRES participants and PIs worked closely with our hosts, their graduate students and local science teachers to set-up after school science clubs at the collaborating secondary schools.&nbsp; The clubs met four days per week over five weeks. &nbsp;Under the guidance of the IRES participants, the Ghanaian HS pupils: 1) constructed small-scale models for treatment of drinking water (biosand filters) and organic wastes (biodigesters), 2) asked research questions, 3) designed experiments, 4) made measurements (e.g., water quality, methane production), 5) analyzed data and 6) communicated their results through oral presentations, posters and reports. IRES participants also engaged Ghanaian HS pupils in a range of WASH related activities, such as evaluating, mapping and photographing WASH infrastructure at their schools. IRES participants used quantitative (e.g., pre- and post-tests) and qualitative (e.g., interviews) methods to assess the impact of engagement in this project on the pupils. Their findings showed that Ghanaian HS pupils advanced their understanding of WASH practices and careers, their understanding of science and engineering research and their identity as scientists. Such an approach has the potential to become a model for scale-up and implementation in other regions to help achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals.</p>\n<p>As a result of the project the IRES participants directly experienced WASH research in the geopolitical, socioeconomic and cultural context of Ghana. These experiences enhanced their understanding of WASH challenges and built their global competency. The PIs, graduate assistants, and IRES participants presented results from this project at several workshops and conferences. Three peer reviewed papers were published and a fourth is in preparation. IRES participants were involved as co-authors and co-presenters, which was important for their professional development. The project enriched the research experiences of undergraduates through working directly with graduate students. The information and process from the project was used by several of the IRES participants for their graduate work, such as for independent study or part of their PhD dissertation.</p>\n<p>In addition to our work in Ghana, the PIs and IRES participants engaged in outreach activities in the Tampa Bay area through programs such as Engineering Expo and the Florida Water Festival. Presentations and workshops at local and international conferences have spread the results beyond the Tampa Bay region. Finally, the project strengthened the partnership between USF, KNUST and UCC and created opportunities for new research and teaching collaborations, particularly in WASH fields.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/07/2024<br>\nModified by: Sarina&nbsp;J&nbsp;Ergas</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1827132/1827132_10564676_1704657350282_2_GNC_2022_biodigesters--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1827132/1827132_10564676_1704657350282_2_GNC_2022_biodigesters--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Building the Biodigesters\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1827132/1827132_10564676_1704657350282_2_GNC_2022_biodigesters--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Building the Biodigesters\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">High School pupils from Ghana National College build model biodigesters to carry out research on sustainable energy production from wastes.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Elizabeth Vicario</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sarina&nbsp;J&nbsp;Ergas\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Building the Biodigesters</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1827132/1827132_10564676_1704657506312_3_Kumaca_2019_Aubry_Tara--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1827132/1827132_10564676_1704657506312_3_Kumaca_2019_Aubry_Tara--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Building the biosand filters\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1827132/1827132_10564676_1704657506312_3_Kumaca_2019_Aubry_Tara--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Building the biosand filters\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Pupils at Kumasi Academy work with IRES participants to build model biosand filters for drinking water treatment.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Itzy Kenney</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sarina&nbsp;J&nbsp;Ergas\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Building the biosand filters</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1827132/1827132_10564676_1704657052385_1_GNC_2022_Group_Photo--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1827132/1827132_10564676_1704657052385_1_GNC_2022_Group_Photo--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Ghana National College Group Photo\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1827132/1827132_10564676_1704657052385_1_GNC_2022_Group_Photo--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Ghana National College Group Photo\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">IRES participants, UCC grad students, science teachers and pupils at Ghana National College summer 2022.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nicholas Stuart</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sarina&nbsp;J&nbsp;Ergas\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Ghana National College Group Photo</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
