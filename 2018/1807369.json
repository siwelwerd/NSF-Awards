 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large, three-dimensional cell colonies grown inexpensively using simple raw materials could be made into cheap, energy-efficient computers. A fundamental challenge in using living cells for computing is that computation by cells is error prone, and cells divide, die and reorganize inside a cell culture, making it difficult to maintain a defined architecture. This research will explore the design of yeast cell-based computing systems inspired by how computing is performed by the animal brain cells. To develop new knowledge at the intersection of electronics, computing and biology will require a new generation of students familiar with each of these areas who can work in collaborative teams. Building on work with organizations including the Freshman Research Initiative at UT Austin and Women in Science and Engineering at JHU, the PIs will develop programs to allow groups of undergraduate researchers to engage in long term research programs in which students have the opportunity to perform independent investigations as part of collaborative, inter-university teams.\r\n\r\nThis project will combine ideas from computer architecture and systems neuroscience with new tools from synthetic biology to develop yeastons - Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells that can collectively emulate a feedforward neural network through engineered cell-cell communication processes and programmable transcriptional logic. Crucially, yeaston networks will be designed to tolerate the inherent noisiness of single-cell biomolecular information processing and require no specific higher order spatial organization or patterning. The project members will build new protein receptors for small molecule signals and genetic logic systems that will enable single yeastons to emulate nodes in a feedforward neural network. The input-output behavior of single yeastons and yeaston networks will be quantitatively characterized, making it possible to evaluate the potential for scalable computation in yeaston systems. High-level models from neuroscience will be used to develop design principles for assembling robust yeaston networks and to derive scaling laws for yeaston computing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThere are interesting possibilities for computing with biology.  Our brains are an example of neural nets, which have now been implemented on computers in the rapidly advancing field of machine learning.  We attempted to develop a yeast-based system that would mimic a neural net, and potentially prove to be a powerful, scalable method for biological computation.  In order to generate yeast-based neural net a team composed of the John Hopkins University, the University of Texas at Austin, and the University of Washington attempted to:  (1) establish individual yeast that could serve as ?neurons? in the network, by implanting a variety of receptors in the yeast that would enable chemical communication between them; 2) use genetic circuits embedded in the yeast to compute the strengths of chemical inputs and subsequently propagate signals to other yeast; and 3) develop a microfluidics device for monitoring and characterizing the behavior of the neural net as a whole.  Our portion of this bold project was to to expand the number and type of biological ?parts? that could be used for complex communication, primarily by adapting human G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), one of the prime ways that human cells communicate with one another, to yeast.  We ultimately showed that a number of GPCRs could be successfully implanted, and that the engineered yeast could in turn be activated by peptides and small molecules, closing the loop required for cell-to-cell communication.  These efforts were important in understanding how biological computation could be scaled, since the efforts revealed both the opportunities inherent in creating new channels for communication in parallel, and the limitations of having to engineer each channel to be optimally functional.  These results also potentially have implications for the field of synthetic biology in general, as we began to understand that the differences between human and yeast membranes impacted receptor function, but that these differences could be overcome for the first time through engineering the membrane itself.  Overall, this is one of the first significant efforts in the now burgeoning field of synthetic neurobiology.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew D Ellington"
