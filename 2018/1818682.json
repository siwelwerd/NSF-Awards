 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate program provides support to design, implement, study and assess comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the numbers of students and the quality of their preparation by strengthening science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and research. This project at Clark Atlanta University provides a strategic approach to redesigning  foundational STEM courses to increase student success. The project is guided and informed by an on-going evaluation, as well as by an  internal advisory committee.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the project are to improve students' mastery and use of foundational STEM concepts, improve student learning outcomes, and increase the number of students matriculating in graduate programs after graduation.  Evidence-based activities are designed to improve retention, persistence, and graduation rates of STEM majors. The strategies employed are:  adaptive learning technologies and supplemental instruction; workshops for students on self-efficacy and growth mindset pedagogy; faculty development workshops on mentoring undergraduate students and teaching differently, self-efficacy and growth mindset pedagogy; and early research experiences for students. School of Education faculty will assess and study which of these interventions or combinations thereof are most effective.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
