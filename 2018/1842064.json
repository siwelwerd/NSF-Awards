 "awd_abstract_narration": "Considerable uncertainty remains in projections of future ice loss from West Antarctica. A recent decadal style U.S. National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report entitled: A Strategic Vision for NSF Investments in Antarctic and Southern Ocean Research (2015) identifies changing ice in Antarctica as one of the highest priority science problems facing communities around the globe. The report identifies Thwaites Glacier as a target for collaborative intense research efforts in the coming years. This project contributes to that effort by deploying an instrument on board airborne surveys that will help to constrain the unknown terrains beneath the Thwaites Ice Shelf and in the region of the grounding line where the inland ice goes afloat.  By improving the accuracy and resolution of these data, which are fed into predictive numerical models, the team will help to constrain the magnitude and rate of increase in the contribution of ice from Thwaites Glacier to the global ocean.\r\n\r\nThe team will enhance the capabilities of the already planned British Antarctic Survey aerogeophysics survey of Thwaites Glacier during the 2018/19 field season.  Their Inertial Measurement Unit will be paired with a state-of-the-art commercial gravity meter to acquire high-quality and significantly enhanced resolution data both over the ice shelf and at the grounding line. Data will be processed immediately following collection and raw and observed data will be released six months after collection.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Thwaites Glacier is a major source of ice loss from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and understanding the scale and pace of its future changes has vital significance for global coastal communities. The shape of the seafloor in front of the glacier is an essential input to models of ocean-ice interactions that are used to predict future change, but this region is difficult to access for direct measurements. In collaboration with the British Antarctic Survey, Columbia University?s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) deployed a new strapdown gravimeter as part of the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC) airborne surveys to map the seafloor bathymetry near the glacier grounding zone.\n\nHigh-resolution gravity data are widely used to model the shape of the seafloor under otherwise inaccessible regions of floating ice.  Gravimeters are highly sensitive instruments that can measure changes in the acceleration due to gravity caused by the distribution of mass in the landscape beneath the survey area.  Measurements of the gravity field in Antarctica can also be used to understand the geological structure of the continent.  Previously, aerogravity surveys were restricted in both accuracy and tolerable flight conditions by the constraints of available technology.  Traditional gravimeters require straight and level flight, but this limits the available range of other instruments (e.g., radars) that are ideally flown at a constant elevation above the undulating ice surface (draped flight).  This project allowed high-quality gravity data from a new strapdown gravimeter to be collected on all 14 flights of the January-February 2019 ITGC surveys, flown from a Twin Otter aircraft based from a camp on Thwaites Glacier.  The strapdown gravity system provided higher resolution, accuracy and data coverage than could have been accomplished with a traditional meter.

Final accuracy of the gravity product by crossover analysis was 1.6 mGal.  This project has developed the LDEO strapdown gravimeter as a resource for the US aerogeophysics community.\n\nBathymetry models produced from these data incorporated gravity inversion and direct constraints, including multibeam echo sounding data acquired as part of the ITGC, to produce a consistent and comprehensive new bathymetry grid with an accuracy of ~100 m.  The model confirms the presence of an 800 m deep marine channel in front of Thwaites Glacier, as well as revealing the complex bathymetry of surrounding ice shelves.  The new bathymetry model presents a key dataset to be used as a boundary condition for ocean-ice models of the Thwaites Glacier system.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/23/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kirsteen J Tinto"
