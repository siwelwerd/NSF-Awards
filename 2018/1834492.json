 "awd_abstract_narration": "The uptake of anthropogenic CO2 by the ocean will eventually be mitigated by the dissolution of CaCO3 on the sea floor. Dissolution is an important component of the carbon cycle in models used for climate projections though the relative importance of where it occurs (water column versus sediments) and the rates and processes involved are not fully understood. This ambitious field and laboratory study is designed to advance our knowledge of the important factors that control carbonate dissolution/ preservation in deep ocean sediments. Using a novel tracer approach and multiple in situ sampling strategies, the project will investigate sea floor dissolution rates, their kinetic controlling factors, the depth in sediments at which dissolution occurs, the role that oxidation of particulate organic carbon plays, and the ramifications of solid phase alteration for the use of geochemically-based paleoceanographic proxies. The project will foster further development of benthic lander technology and yield key information relating sea floor conditions to carbonate dissolution rate, thereby helping to constrain the rate at which the ocean can neutralize the impacts of ocean acidification. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained and the research team will use film and animation to bring this work to a broader audience through a collaboration with the Los Angeles Natural History Museum.\r\n\r\nThe research team has developed a new approach to quantify calcium carbonate dissolution rates based on 13-C labeled carbonate substrates, a technique which is significantly more sensitive than traditional approaches based on alkalinity and/or calcium measurements. This has opened a range of new opportunities and insights into the governing mechanisms and rates of calcium carbonate dissolution, a challenging and long-standing geochemical problem. Carbonate dissolution rates on the sea floor will be directly assessed by benthic chamber flux measurements of alkalinity and calcium as well as pore water models of TCO2 and alkalinity and their isotopic composition. The potential impacts of organic carbon remineralization will be measured through oxygen and nutrient flux determinations, pore water gradients and modeling. Labeled 13C-enriched calcite will serve as a tracer of near surface dissolution processes when added to benthic chambers and of down-core dissolution processes using 13C-labeled rods inserted into the sediment column. These in situ experiments of labeled carbonate dissolution will be the first of their kind. To complement these measurements, the team will continue development of a rhizon-based pore water sampler that works on a multi-corer at all ocean depths. Field experiments will be conducted at sea at 4-6 sites in a transect through water column supersaturation to undersaturation between Panama and the Galapagos. Dissolution rate measurements, coupled with analyses of cation/Ca ratios in CaCO3 foraminiferal shells will help calibrate the impact of dissolution on paleo-proxy interpretations. Further, analyses of sediment calcite and aragonite fractions will help explain net dissolution and sediment response with time. The results from this study should help to better parameterize sediment variables in ocean-climate models (GCMs), which has important implications for predicting the consequences of ocean acidification and the modeling of paleoceanographic records. The methodologies and new techniques will surely be adopted by other researchers, therefore impacting the larger geochemical community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAs oceanographers and geochemists we know what will happen to fossil fuel CO2 in the atmosphere.  Over tens of thousands of years it will be taken up by the ocean and then neutralized by the reaction with CaCO3 sediments at the seafloor.  This \u2018carbonate compensation\u2019 process has worked to keep earth\u2019s climate equitable for billions of years, but the seafloor chemistry is not well understood.  As part of our efforts to better understand the dissolution rate of CaCO3 in the ocean, we built a new seafloor lander to sample water from the upper 20-30 centimeters of sediment that would not have the pressure artifacts that have influenced previous efforts of water sampling from sediments on board a ship after the mud is returned to the surface.\n\n \n\nOur new SIPR device filters extracted pore waters at the seafloor and stores them in glass tubes.  Our chemical profiles from the Cocos Ridge off of Costa Rica show artifact free data when compared to sampling cores of the same mud but sampled on board the ship.  Comparison of the alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon profiles shows that the artifact is due to CaCO3 precipitation during the depressurization of the samples still in contact with sediment as they were returned to the ship.  Using isotope labels on CaCO3 we put in the SIPR, we measured the in situ dissolution rate of CaCO3 in pore waters for the first time.  Preliminary results show that the rate law as a function of offset from equilibrium has the same shape in pore waters as it does in the water column and in the lab. Our full data set shows that the production of acid by respiring organic carbon in the sediment is an important part of the CaCO3 dissolution process that buffers CO2.  This respiration driven dissolution has been hypothesized since 1982 but conclusively demonstrated in our work for the first time.  The rapid increase in alkalinity as a function of depth into the pore waters shows a faster than expected timescale of CO2 buffering by ocean sediments, likely due to the respiration driven dissolution itself and will cause us to rethink how quickly the climate system recovers from perturbations to the level of CO2 in the atmosphere.\n\n \n\nThis project supported the PhD work of two female graduate students and the post-doc work of one female scientist.  We exposed a new generation of marine scientists to research at sea on two cruises, one off the coast of Southern California and the other to the Cocos Ridge with a Costa Rican scientist onboard as an observer and new collaborator.  The project created a new movie by African American animator Jerome Braxton that is in its final stages of post-production.  It is based on his experience of being at sea and probing the chemical processes at the bottom of the ocean.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/20/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jess F Adkins"
