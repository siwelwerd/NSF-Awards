 "awd_abstract_narration": "With a vision to establish novel molecular programming rules for engineering for developing synthetic systems inside or outside of living cells, the annual International Conference on DNA Computing and Molecular Programming has been one of the premier interdisciplinary forums where scientists with diverse backgrounds (e.g., in computer science, physics, chemistry, biology and mathematics) come together to present their highest quality research and discuss new ideas.  This proposal aims to provide student travel support for the 24th International Conference on DNA Computing and Molecular Programming (DNA24), to be held at Jinan, China during October 8-12, 2018.  By funding travel for U.S.-based students, the organizers are actively encouraging and incentivizing a new generation of researchers to benefit from participating in the conference, fostering the development of the next generation of molecular programmers, by encouraging students to attend, present their work, and interact with other important players in the field. Up to 15 successful student applicants will be supported, by providing assistance to women and underrepresented minorities who are delivering oral or poster presentations at the conference, and to graduate students who are otherwise unable to afford attending this conference.  The availability of the awards to US citizens and students at US institutions will be included in conference announcements, soliciting applications.  \r\n\r\nThis highly interdisciplinary conference emphasizes topics that bridge computation, biology, and nanotechnology and attracts researchers in the fields of computer science, mathematics, chemistry, molecular biology, and nanotechnology. The scope includes control of molecular folding and self-assembly to construct nanostructures; demonstration of switches, gates, devices, and circuits with biomolecules; molecular motors and molecular robotics; computational processes in vitro and in vivo; studies of fault-tolerance and error correction; synthetic biology and in vitro evolution; software tools for analysis, simulation, and design; a range of applications in engineering, physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
