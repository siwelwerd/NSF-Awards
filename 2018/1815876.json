 "awd_abstract_narration": "One does not need to look beyond many real-world advertising campaigns to appreciate that naming is one of the foundational elements upon which most higher layer Internet services are built. For example, we use names as rendezvous points between users and services: www.twitter.com, www.youtube.com, www.google.com, to name a few. Yet, names are not directly used to move traffic across the Internet; rather, names are turned into Internet addresses via the Domain Name System (DNS). Internet addresses are then used to direct traffic around networks around the world. A DNS lookup is therefore a prerequisite for most Internet transactions. This means that the DNS is not only crucial to the operation of the Internet, but DNS is in fact a single point of failure for most Internet transactions. Unfortunately, the DNS ecosystem has slowly evolved from a simple system at its inception to a vastly distributed, complex, brittle and at times insecure system today. When the DNS does not respond to a query due to overload, or returns incorrect data, this can impact large amounts of Internet traffic. This project aims to address this critical problem by (i) developing a stronger empirical understanding of the operation of the current DNS ecosystem and (ii) developing new mechanisms to harden the system against both benign issues that inevitably crop up and malicious attacks on the DNS. If successful, this research would significantly improve the robustness of the DNS system, and thus the resilience of the Internet. \r\n\r\nThis project will accelerate the process of hardening the DNS ecosystem in several ways. First, it will make use of the wealth of DNS data collected at myriad points in the system, from the clients to the authoritative DNS servers, to concretely understand the weaknesses of the system. For example, this project has access to DNS-Operations Analysis and Research Center data, DNS Scanning Data, and CCZ traffic (Case Western's Case Connection Zone of 100 homes). As with much Internet technology, measurement is key to driving the evolution of protocols, services and operations.  The second thrust involves proactively adding robustness to the DNS. The approach in this thrust is to design innovative mechanisms that anticipate problems by identifying where and when to share more information with more actors in the ecosystem.   The final thrust leverages insight from previous measurement efforts and design mechanisms to improve intrinsic system robustness. As an example, the project considers restructuring the ecosystem by removing reliance on recursive DNS resolvers.   New mechanisms developed in this project will be released to the community as extensions to current DNS tools (e.g., the bind DNS server).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Domain Name System (DNS) is an integral part of the Internetlandscape as it is charged with turning human-readable hostnamessuch as \"amazon.com\" into the numeric IP addresses required totransmit data across the network.  The correct and efficientoperation of the DNS is crucial to the Internet's everydayoperation.  While the task of turning a hostname into an IP addressis seemingly simple, in reality the DNS ecosystem has developed intoa complex---and often mysterious---collection of components.  Thisproject had two basic dimensions.  First, we used a variety ofempirical measurements to better understand the configuration andoperation of the DNS ecosystem.  Second, we used our empiricalunderstanding to design DNS extensions that aid the security,robustness and performance of the overall system.  We detail major accomplishments under this project below.\n\nOur first thrust involved conducting and using a variety of DNSmeasurements to develop a better understanding of the ecosystem.This took many forms.  A first example is developing an empiricalunderstanding of the robustness of popular domains (e.g., ebay.com).The standards documents that define the DNS contain recommendedstrategies for deploying robust DNS servers.  We were able todetermine that at least 10%---and likely many more---of the onemillion most popular domains are not deployed using properrobustness mechanisms.  One strategy companies and organizations useto deal with the complexity of DNS deployments is to outsource theoperation of their DNS domains to a third party provider (e.g.,Cloudflare, Dyn, Google, etc.).  There are benefits to thisarrangement, but a downside is that the DNS gets concentrated in thehands of a few major players.  This can have security and robustnessimplications.  As a second aspect of our empirical study of the DNS,we investigated this phenomenon and found that more than 20% of thetop one million web sites depend on DNS servers in just 18 edgenetworks.  This level of concentration leaves these sites vulnerableto shared failure---either from an attack or a more benign issuelike a power failure.  A final measurement effort we highlight hereis on quantifying the role of DNS in the performance of Internettransactions.  We were able to use observations of actual usertraffic to establish that the role of DNS in performance isinsignificant most of the time.  For instance, we find DNS lookupstake no more than 20msec and/or less than 1% of the overallapplication transaction time for 96.4% of transactions.  This islargely due to effective DNS caching.  This result shows that DNSperformance is quite high and further effort in this space will notyield large gains.\n\nOur second thrust involved designing mechanisms to enhance the DNSsystem.  A first example of the work we conducted was a mechanism toallow DNS servers to ensure they were not unwittingly taking part ina DDoS attack.  We built a challenge-response mechanism out ofstandard DNS messages such that a DNS server can be sure a requestis not spoofed before transmitting a potentially large message tothe supposed requester.  Our scheme does not involve any changes tothe DNS protocol itself, but rather only changes the servers toreact differently to incoming requests---making the scheme fairlystraightforward to operationally deploy without help from clients orother servers.  A second example project we conducted under thisgrant is studying the efficacy of eliminating root nameservers.Every hostname in the Internet depends on a root nameserver to startthe lookup process.  We developed the notion that instead of usingexplicit servers we could simply distribute the root nameserver'sconfiguration widely to all DNS resolvers.  This removes an attackvector from the system because there are no root nameservers toattack.  Further, having configuration information locally enhancesperformance by removing a network transaction to gain the sameinformation.  Our study shows that this is arrangement is easilyfeasible.\n\nIn addition to developing technology and writing papers as part ofthis project, we were able to help mentor a number of graduate andundergraduate students.  Further, we also released a dataset withroughly 604M DNS transactions over the course of nine years.  Thishas and will continue to enable the research community to study DNSin the context of ultra-broadband networks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/21/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark Allman"
