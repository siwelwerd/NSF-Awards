The project aims to synthesize polymer-functionalized spherical magnetic nanoparticles known as \"polymer-grafted nanoparticles\" by growing polymers with asymmetric composition onto these nanoparticles.  A special feature of their molecular architecture is the presence of ion-containing molecules in the end of the polymer chains. These functional, particle-based nanomaterials will be studied as solid-state electrolytes, which can be used in fuel-cell electrolyte membranes. The PI aims to understand the relationship between nanoparticle structures in \"ionic liquids\" (which are salts in a liquid state) and ionic conductivity.  The resulting nanomaterials are leak- and vapor-free and non-flammable solid electrolytes with ion-conducting network structures. Furthermore, they also hold various advantages such as high mechanical stability since the material is composed of inorganic particles; they also have low ionic content in the polymer chains and low water uptake. The nanomaterials are designed so as to control ion aggregation, enable study of confinement of ionic liquids within nanostructured particles, enhance ionic mobility, and unravel ion transport mechanisms. The project will train graduate and undergraduate students and schoolteachers in the broad area of materials for energy applications.  A Nanoscience Educator Workshop will be organized for high-school science teachers in the New Jersey/New York area, aiming to help teachers to integrate nanoscale science concepts and applications into their courses.\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis project aims to explore ion transport in nanoparticle-based polyelectrolytes. The PI proposes a comprehensive research plan to underpin the fundamental mechanism of conductivity in the nanoparticles grafted with poly(methyl methacrylate-b-styrenesulfonate) chains with low sulfonation amounts in ionic liquids. It is hypothesized that ionic aggregation and ionic cluster sizes can be controlled by the organization of ion-containing copolymer-grafted nanoparticles into strings, percolated and dispersed systems. The PI will study segmental chain dynamics and ion transport of the synthesized grafted nanoparticle films using the quasi-elastic neutron scattering experiments. The measured chain and ion mobility will be combined with the structural information obtained from X-ray scattering, transmission electron microscopy, and tomography. The major objectives of the project are to understand the assembly of poly(methyl methacrylate)-grafted iron oxide nanoparticles in various solvents and ionic liquids under confinement; and to determine the effect of styrenesulfonate chain end groups on the assembly of poly(methyl methacrylate)-grafted particles and measure its impact on chain dynamics and conductivity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Ionic liquid-based electrolytes have many advantages of non-flammability and electrochemical stability for long time uses in next-generation energetic devices such as batteries, fuel cell membranes, supercapacitors and electroactive actuators. This project investigated how addition of polymer-grafted nanoparticles at minimal amounts into ionic liquids enhanced the ionic transport (diffusion and conductivity) of the system. Polymers and ion-containing polymers with asymmetric compositions were synthesized, and interactions between polymers and ionic liquids were used to mediate the ion dynamics and transport. The nanostructures created by these interactions helped us to understand the transport mechanisms in hybrid electrolytes. Specifically, non-conducting poly(methyl methacrylate) chains grafted on magnetic nanoparticles with low particle size distribution in 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (HMIM-TFSI) and 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazole-2-ylidene borane (BMIM-BH<sub>3</sub>) were studied using quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS). We found that polymer chains interact with anion groups (TFSI<sup>-</sup>) and this dynamic coupling process influences diffusion of cation groups (HMIM<sup>+</sup>). Dispersion of grafted nanoparticles determine the nanostructures in ionic liquids. We demonstrate that with well-dispersed nanostructures in ionic liquids, the diffusivity of cations enhances at long-range and dynamics is not restricted at local range. With close packed particles, the localized cation diffusion is found to be much higher. This verifies that spatial arrangement of cations in confined spaces dictates the local dynamics, and the effective transport mechanism happens by a hopping process, whereas the vehicular process dominates the long-range dynamics. When polymer does not interact with the ionic liquid (sustainable zwitter ionic liquid, BMIM-BH<sub>3</sub>), the local and long-range dynamics is not affected. Further neutron scattering experiments on poly(methyl methacrylate)-grafted Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles in HMIM-TFSI showed that the confinement radius of ionic liquid aggregates decreases with the addition of particles. When particle concentration is increased, the confinement created by the grafted chains shrinks the restricted volume of HMIM-TFSI. The confinement of ionic liquids directly improves the cation diffusion. The very fast motions of ionic liquids measured using QENS is also linked to the microscopic dynamic measurements in electrochemical impedance spectrometer. Series of synthesized samples, poly(methyl methacrylate) and poly(methyl methacrylate)-<em>b</em>-poly(styrene sulfonate) copolymer samples were tested and the ionic conductivities were explained with the structures, polymer grafts and &nbsp;with the solvation of ionic liquids. These findings showcase the importance of polymer-coupled dynamics and the solvation of ionic liquids in hybrid electrolytes.
