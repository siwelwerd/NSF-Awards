 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will fund the annual summer CEDAR (Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions) workshop for the three summers of 2018 to 2020.  CEDAR is a broad-based, community-initiated, upper atmospheric research program with the targeted goal of understanding the behavior of atmospheric regions from the middle atmosphere upward through the thermosphere and ionosphere into the exosphere in terms of coupling, energetics, chemistry, and dynamics on regional and global scales. These processes are related to the sources of perturbations that propagate upward from the lower atmosphere as well as a result of solar radiation, particle inputs and electric fields from above. Traditionally the CEDAR meeting has been regarded as the foremost workshop for the CEDAR community of over 1,850 people worldwide. The activities supported within this program combine observations, theory and modeling. Additional services are provided throughout the year to keep the database of names, addresses and emails current, as well as supporting community unity through wiki web pages and community emails.\r\n\r\nThe CEDAR Workshop and associated community services would be managed by the UCAR Cooperative Programs for the Advancement of Earth System Science (CPAESS). The mission of CPAESS is geared toward preparing and training the next generation of weather and climate scientific leaders and workforce by supporting effective and collaborative fellowships, visitor, and workshop programs that meet emerging training and research needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
