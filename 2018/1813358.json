 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the project is to develop the theory, techniques, and mechanical designs needed for robots to rapidly build large, rigid structures from blocks that geometrically interlock, without the need for fasteners, cement, or glue. The work is motivated by the desire to quickly assemble structurally strong buildings, furniture, and devices, in such a way that the structure may later be disassembled and the parts re-used. Fabricating in parts presents many advantages: for instance, individual components may be fabricated efficiently, packed for storage and transport, repaired or replaced as needed, and design changes can be made readily in response to changing customer needs. Design of smooth surface finishes allows applications such as modular furniture and packaging of delicate parts for shipping, and embedding mechanical or electrical components will allow rapid construction of robots and other devices.\r\n\r\nThe problem to be studied is how structures may be designed to rigidly interlock, using cycles of geometric constraints imposed by blocks to reinforce, support, and immobilize other blocks. Goals for the project include: 1) the design of joint geometries that allow a connection process that is robust to assembly and fabrication errors; 2) mechanical block designs that allow incremental construction of interlocked structures; and 3) layout algorithms that tailor assembly sequences to allow construction of desired shapes. Methods and approaches include mechanical design, development of layout algorithms, and analysis of assembly processes to ensure structural stability during construction. Experimental work includes robot assembly to validate the approach for complex structures involving hundreds of blocks.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
