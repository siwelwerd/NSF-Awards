 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to investigate the commercial potential of a developed power system for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with a high potential impact on military operations and commercial industries. Ultimately, the technology simply produces ultra-long endurance energy, and after proving the safety and reliability of the power system, can be expanded to other industries. For example, the power system could be used in an ultra-long endurance unmanned undersea vehicle, to power a desalination plant, or even just as a power source for buildings. As the miniaturization of the technology improves, the power system could also be used in consumer devices- providing ultra-long endurance power for cell phones, tablets, and laptops.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is commercializing a power system design that will produce 300W of electric power and weigh under 150 lbs. Detailed studies have supported the feasibility of the design of the power system. The power-to-weight ratio of this power system's design is similar to current unmanned aerial systems having proven flight capability. This comparison also supports the feasibility of the power system being used for powered flight, and potentially increasing UAV endurance to over one year.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
