 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will support the research that will create new knowledge relevant to soft robotics and active structures that are widely used in biomedical, manufacturing and energy sectors and will serve to advance our national health and prosperity. The grant allows the design and investigation of artificial muscle fibers fabricated from electrospinning technique. Artificial muscle materials can generate an active deformation and force when subjected to external stimuli, behaving like real muscle.  Previously developed artificial muscle materials have often suffered from poor scalability and slow response, which greatly limit their applications. Consequently, performance of artificial muscle has been increasingly recognized as one of the bottlenecks in designing novel soft robots and active structures. The artificial muscle material in this grant will have superior mechanical properties, a faster response rate, diverse actuating modes and excellent scalability. These new materials will contribute to the rapidly developing fields of soft robotics, novel actuators and energy conversion systems. The project will also provide interdisciplinary education and training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students and seeks to attract underrepresented groups into science and engineering. Short disseminated demonstrations of artificial muscles to be developed will serve as an attractive education and research platform for disadvantaged, first generation high school and college students.\r\n\r\nThe artificial muscle assembled from electrospun polymer fibers can be easily fabricated into different shapes with various actuating modes, scaled up and down to various sizes, made to respond to different stimuli. A comprehensive understanding of processing-structure-property relationship for the electrospun polymer fibers is essential for the rational design of the artificial muscle fibers. The research team will electrospin three different types of polymer fibers: semicrystalline polyamide, polyelectrolyte and liquid crystal polymer, conduct systematic chemo-thermo-mechanical characterizations of these individual fibers using novel electrospinning tools, and design artificial muscle with diverse actuating modes by assembling these polymer fibers into different patterns.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The size effect is arise from the intrinsic length scale of LCE . Because of the small diameter of the electrospun LCE fiber,&nbsp; it can spontaneously oscillate in a steady temperature field. We have discovered that such self-motivated oscillation occurs when the response time of the electrospun LCE fiber and its inertial time scale are close to each other. We have further constructed microdevices using electrospun LCE artificial muscle fibers, such as a microtweezer, microswimmer and soft impedance micropump.</p>\n<p>Thermal transport is important for the speed and capacity of thermal actuation of the fibers. To better understand it, we have measured thermal conductivity of individual LCE microfibers as well as other related fibers. &nbsp;Figure 1(a) shows a photograph of a suspended microdevice we used for the thermal conductivity measurement of single LCE fibers. A fiber is bridging two suspended pads that serve as a heater and a sensor. Figure 1(b) shows the temperature rise of the heating and sensing sides. Figure 1(c) shows the measured thermal conductivity of two LCE fibers, one is stretched&nbsp; and the other unstretched . The measured thermal conductivity of both samples is similar to that of bulk LCE. This result indicates that there is no size or confinement effect on the thermal conductivity of the fibers in this size range. Therefore, it suggests that when using the microfibers as thermal actuator materials, the mechanical properties will be enhanced due to the size effect for better actuation performance while the thermal properties will not be compromised in the small-size microfibers.</p>\n<p>In addition to LCE fibers, we also measured thermal conductivity of another type of polymer fibers that undergoes phase transition at around 430 K: polyethylene (PE) nanofibers. Bulk PE undergoes structural phase transition&nbsp; from orthorhombic phase with a highly ordered all-trans configuration below the transition temperature to rotationally disordered hexagonal phase with combined trans and gauche conformations. In bulk PE, however, the impact of the phase transition on thermal conductivity is not pronounced because the thermal conductivity is low in both phases (~ &lt; 1 W/m-K). In nanofibers with diameter less than 100 nm, the molecular chains in the PE fibers are well aligned, leading to significantly higher thermal conductivity in the ordered all-trans configuration than the bulk value, thereby amplifying the difference caused by the phase transition. Figure 2 shows that for a ~100 nm diameter PE nanofiber, the thermal conductivity before and after the phase transition around 430K is ~25 W/m-K and ~0.8 W/m-K, respectively, leading to a ratio of ~30:1 in thermal conductivity change around the phase transition. This large and reversible thermal conductivity ratio could be utilized to make thermal switches [1]. The same phase transition mechanism has also been leveraged to make thermal diodes&nbsp; [2], where the strong and reversible temperature dependent thermal conductivity of the nanofibers is used to rectify the heat flux.</p>\n<p>Our investigations of PVC gel actuators have revealed that the electro-actuation of the gel is essentially an electrowetting process. Using electro-indentation tests and JKR model, we have successfully obtained the voltage-dependent adhesion energy between the PVC gel and an electrode (Figure 3). The dependence can be described by Young-Lippman equation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project has supported several graduate students to conduct research, learn different techniques and collaborate with different researchers. One of the graduate students, Ms. Sunmi Shin, was partially supported by this grant. Her doctoral thesis, which is partially based on the work from this project, won UCSD's Chancellor's Dissertation Medal in 2020 (one of the six recipients for the entire UCSD campus). She was also named MIT Tech Review's Innovators under 35 (Asia Pacific) in 2021. She is now an assistant professor in the Mechanical Engineering Department at National University of Singapore. &nbsp;Moreover, supported by the grant, our lab has hosted numerous high school students to conduct research from different program such as Enlace binational program and Guided Engineering Apprenticeship in Research (GEAR) program at UCSD; we have also integrated some of the research results into our teaching materials.</p>\n<p>[1] R.
