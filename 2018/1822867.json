 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project would carry out research primarily aimed at the study of the production and effects of secondary gravity waves (SGWs). The main objective is to understand how breaking gravity waves produce SGWs and then to assess the subsequent effect of SGWs on the mesosphere and lower thermosphere region. Studying the process of developing SGWs is necessary because these waves would potentially transport momentum to higher altitudes than the primary GW. The science plan of this project would also consider whether some of these SGWs could propagate even through a critical layer. These are important aspects of the coupling processes between different atmospheric layers. This question of energy transfer between atmospheric regions is a potentially transformative area of research and is an active topic in atmospheric research now that observations and models have recently become available. This project would help support two early career researchers with the lead Principal Investigator (PI) being a woman thus improving the gender diversity within the space physics community.\r\n\r\nWhile theory and modeling demonstrate the presence of secondary gravity waves, there are few observational, statistical, and combined modeling and observational studies on SGW generation and associated momentum flux and influences within the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) region. The research aims to answer the following questions: 1) How do stratospheric and mesospheric conditions play a role in the evolution and propagation of gravity waves into the MLT and the progression of breaking conditions leading to SGW generation? 2) What are the implications of gravity wave breaking and resulting secondary gravity waves on momentum transport in the MLT? 3) What is the correlation between strong orographic gravity wave activity observed in the Northern hemisphere and observations of different gravity wave spectra in the MLT?\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAtmospheric gravity waves (GWs) are waves that are created in the Earth's atmosphere.  These are waves in the air that we breathe!  They are created by thunderstorms, by tornadoes, by the wind blowing over mountains, by the polar vortex in the stratosphere, by volcanic eruptions, and by tsunamis, for example.  These are the so-called \"primary\" GWs. Once created, they move upward higher and higher into the Earth's atmosphere.  As they do, their amplitudes get larger and larger until eventually they break, similar to how an ocean wave breaks just before it hits land.  After they break, they deposit momentum and energy into the atmosphere over a localized region which is roughly the size of the wave packet.  (Here, the momentum of a car is its mass times its velocity, and its energy is 1/2 times its mass times its velocity squared).  That deposition accelerates the atmosphere horizontally in that localized region, similar to the transference of momentum that occurs when a billiard ball hits another billiard ball \"head on\", thereby causing the first ball to stop and the second ball to move off in the same direction as the first ball (and with the same velocity as the first ball if the masses of the balls are the same).  In the atmosphere, this transference of momentum causes the air to create another set of so-called \"secondary\" GWs; one-quarter of these secondary GWs travel upward and forward, another one-quarter travels upward and backward, another one-quarter travels downward and forward, and the final one-quarter travels downward and backward. Primary and secondary GWs comprise the first 2 steps of the so-called \"multi-step vertical coupling\" (MSVC) process.  MSVC is a process by which momentum and energy is transferred via GWs from the lower atmosphere to the middle and upper atmosphere (at approximately 90-600 km=55-380 miles above the surface of the Earth).   \n\nIn this research project, we saw MSVC occur during the wintertime over Europe from the polar vortex and mountain waves, and from the volcanic eruption at Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai (Tonga).  We found that GWs were created/amplified by the polar vortex in the stratosphere over Europe on 12-14 January 2016.  When they broke, they created upward and downward-propagating secondary GWs which traveled northwestward more than 1000 km (620 miles) horizontally, and were observed in the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere by a lidar operating at ALOMAR in northern Norway. Thus energy and momentum were transferred from the polar vortex to the upper stratosphere and mesosphere over large distances horizontally and vertically through MSVC.\n\nWe also modeled the GWs that were created from the volcanic eruption at Tonga on 15 January 2022.  The first of many eruptions occurred at around 4:15 UT. We found that the first-step GWs (the primary GWs) didn't propagate very far from Tonga---only 600 km (375 miles).

We looked at the large-amplitude Tonga waves from 4 of ICON's orbits, and compared them to the model results.  We found that the model agreed reasonably well with the MIGHTI data.  Thus we concluded that the secondary GWs from Tonga were very important in determining the waves seen in the thermosphere from the Tonga volcanic eruption.  Thus energy and momentum were transferred from the Tonga eruption to GWs in the thermosphere via 2 separate steps in the MSVC process.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sharon L Vadas"
