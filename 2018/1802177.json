 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flowering time is an important biological phenomenon, affecting human societies through its effects on agricultural crops, pollinators, pests, and biodiversity.  Given the sensitivity of flowering times to climatic conditions, a thorough understanding of how plants respond to changing environments is necessary for predicting the consequences for pollinators, herbivores, parasites, and plant populations.  A record of historical flowering times is found within the nation's herbaria.  This award establishes a thematic collection network (TCN) dedicated to understanding flowering time shifts in the California flora.  California has the most diverse native flora of any state in the U.S., containing more than one-third of all U.S. plant species.  The state is a biodiversity hotspot due to the high number of endemic species that are also threatened.  The Capturing California's Flowers (CCF) TCN will record flowering times from and create images of over 900,000 herbarium specimens from the oldest records, the most diverse families, and most threatened families in California.  Twenty-two institutions spanning the state, including public universities, state agencies, museums, and botanic gardens, will participate in these efforts.  This project will generate data that will increase our understanding of flowering time shifts - a critical need for agriculturalists, conservation biologists, plant taxonomists, land managers, and wildlife biologists.\r\n\r\nDigitization of each specimen in the CCF TCN will result in a high-resolution image, a databased record of collection metadata, a georeferenced point, and the reproductive status of the specimen.  New tools will be developed for the public to search and display phenological data through a Symbiota portal interface.  The CCF TCN will develop novel data standards for capturing and sharing trait data from specimens.  Building on already successful national and regional programs, the CCF TCN will partner with schools, universities, botanical clubs, and the general public to crowd source phenological measurements through online expeditions, workshops, new college courses, and K-12 educational programs.  The CCF TCN will provide a historical record of plants currently being monitored through the National Phenology Network and other regional programs.  Finally, this award will expand efforts to train the \"next generation\" of museum curators, collectors, and researchers.  This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program, and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
