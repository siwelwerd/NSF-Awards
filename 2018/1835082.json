The two-day national summit on broadening participation of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs) in STEM Education Research will commence early Spring 2019, in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The proposed Summit will create a platform for new collaborations within the NSF INCLUDES National Network, so participating institutions can cultivate shared goals, common metrics, and mutually reinforcing activities. The Summit's overall goal is to synthesize current knowledge of, and stimulate further collaborative research on, broadening participation of HBCU/TCU students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The Summit's key objectives will be to Convene, Connect, Collect, and Convey results (Quad-C) to reinforce the NSF INCLUDES National Network and the HBCU/TCU BPR Community of Practice.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
