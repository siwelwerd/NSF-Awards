 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientists are faced with an ever increasing array of options for data publication and a growing set of requirements to meet grant and journal directives. General purpose data repositories, data archives with journals or university libraries, domain-specific data repositories or broader project management and collaborative environments that provide some data publication services (e.g., issuing DOIs) are just a few of the options available. How should scientists choose among these options? How effective are these alternatives in meeting the multiple objectives for data publication, including discoverability, recording of sufficient metadata for reliable re-use, reproducibility of scientific results, convenience for data provider, and persistence. The investigator proposes to organize a workshop that brings together key stakeholders in data reuse.  The workshop targets research carried out in the geosciences and is an activity connected with the South Big Data Regional Innovation Hub.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
