 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for the \"2018 Data Science Innovation Lab: Mathematical Challenges of Single Cell Dynamics\" held June 25-29, 2018 in Bend, Oregon.  The goal of the Data Science Innovation Lab is to foster new interdisciplinary collaborations among quantitative and biomedical researchers to address data science challenges arising from the use of data from single cells.  Mathematical modeling of single cell dynamics aims to facilitate understanding of biological complexity in the context of the modular organization of the living cell. The three-dimensional structure of the cell gives biological systems the ability to sequester, tightly regulate, and increase the efficiency of many cellular systems. However, this structure is not static. The organelles, specialized domains, and macromolecular machines inside the cell are extremely dynamic, responding both to the internal state of the cell and to external stimuli. Systems and cell biology can study the origins and dynamics of organelles to elucidate the networks that underlie cellular function and dysfunction over time and space. This Innovation Lab entails participation in an intensive five-day residential workshop.  Through a real-time and iterative mentoring process, the workshop aims to facilitate the development of new teams of early-career biomedical and quantitative investigators who generate multidisciplinary cooperative projects in this important research area.\r\n\r\nThe computational complexity of models of single-cell dynamics is significant; the analysis requires modern mathematical, computer science, statistical, and data visualization methods.  Bringing mathematicians, statisticians, and computer scientists together with biologists, physicians, and other data-aware scientists to develop joint research projects via this Data Science Innovation Lab is expected to have impact beyond the workshop itself.  It will introduce mathematical, statistical, and quantitative researchers to the challenges in addressing biomedical \"big data\" and applying them to large-scale bioscience research.  The Data Science Innovation Lab is expected to cultivate a new multi-disciplinary community built around rich biomedical data sets.   Further information about the 2018 Data Science Innovation Lab may be found at https://bigdatau.ini.usc.edu/innovationlab2018\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
