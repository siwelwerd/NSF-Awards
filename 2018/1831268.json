 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project targets the fabrication of devices capable of focusing X-rays with high energy (from 10 keV to above 100 keV) to spot sizes as small as 7 nanometers.  This capability is critical for imaging, microtomography, and elemental and structural analyses of materials and will permit imaging in spectral ranges and at resolutions unavailable today. These devices will enable scientists to better image the interplay of structure and functionality for a wide variety of applications, including the development of life-saving drugs, the creation of materials for high-tech devices, and for a number of important basic scientific purposes. The devices? primary use will be in high-end synchrotron radiation facilities and in X-ray microscopes with in specialized industrial and research environments. These devices form a special class of high-value consumables, addressing a global market segment worth about $7 million today with the potential to increase to more than $14 million in the near future. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project is threefold. First, the innovative method of fabrication explores and exploits the ultimate capability of atomic layer deposition (ALD) for achieving nanometer-scale smoothness in very thick, multilayer films. Unlike related methods that rely on deposition onto wires and slicing, this method uses ALD to deposit sequences of low and high refractive index materials onto batch-fabricated cylindrical silicon precursors, with well-controlled layer thicknesses varying from a few nanometers to tens of nanometers. Subsequently, polishing the wafer will yield membranes with hundreds of high-value focusing devices on a single wafer, minimizing the processing costs per device. Second, the envisioned wafer-level processing method allows for a necessary tilt control of the precursors, not possible with wires, for better focusing properties. Third, the method is extendable towards depositing sequences of more-than-two material layers, which enables the fabrication of step-wise graded index diffractive devices with single foci and featuring ultimate diffraction efficiency. Phase I qualified the individual key processes and proved their integration capability into a complete fabrication sequence, while Phase II will deal with the fabrication and testing of prototypes and preparation for production, using long runs of atomic layer deposition processes, as is necessary for functional devices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Their primary use is in high-end synchrotron radiation facilities and in X-ray microscopes with X-ray tubes sources in specialized industrial and research environments. They form a special class of high-value consumables, with a functional life time of ~2.5 years. Fresnel zone plates are special focusing devices, based in principle on changing the direction of light by passing through circular concentric gratings towards focus. They use diffraction rather than refraction (like regular lenses) for changing the propagation direction of light. Given that in high-photon-energy X-rays the refraction index of materials is not much different from air or vacuum (differing from unity by 10<sup>-6</sup> values), regular lenses are not a good option for focusing, while zone plates are a simple and affordable way to achieve focusing and lensing.</p>\n<p>The project concerned the development of an innovative and proprietary method of fabricating Fresnel zone plates for focusing high-photon-energy X-rays with unprecedented performances and low cost. Two patents cover the development. In this method, cylindrical columns are etched in a Si wafer, the column sidewalls are smoothened, and a sequence of low and high absorption and refraction index materials are deposited using atomic layer deposition (ALD) to form concentric layers with a calculated thickness of each layer. ALD is a new addition to chemical vapor deposition techniques (CVD), in which films are constructed by flushing sequentially certain gasses over the sample and growing a single molecular layer with each cycle of surface driven chemical reactions of adsorbates. By counting the cycles, one can control very precisely the thickness of the layers, to atomic dimensions. In this project, for constructing the consecutive layers, combinations of materials such as Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/HfO<sub>2</sub>, and SiO<sub>2</sub>/Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> were used. The best results were obtained with the latter, as deposited with a new ALD process that combines plasma enhanced deposition with rotating the substrates on a platen under slit-nozzles flushing the substrates with the reaction gasses at each passing. &nbsp;This technique allowed 8 to 10 cycles per second, corresponding to the rotation rate of the platen. The plasma enhancement of the process took care of lowering the stress in the deposited films and allowed depositing up to four 4?-diameter substrates at a time, in about one work shift. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The ALD deposited layers varied in thicknesses from tens of nm down to few nm to satisfy the Fresnel zone-width rules. 5 nm layers were demonstrated in trials, while 7 nm minimum thickness layers is used in one of the prototypes. Lastly, the wafers get polished and membranes are formed with X-ray focusing devices embedded in them, using standard processes as common in micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) fabrication technology and microelectronics, such as chemical-mechanical polishing, wafer bonding and deep Si reactive etching. The resulting zone plates show up in combinations of 45 devices per die of 5 mm x 5 mm, while a 4? Si wafer can host up to 145 dies. Finally, a device trimming process using focus ion beam milling was proven efficient in customizing the devices by adapting the thickness of the zone plates to specific demands in the photon energy range as needed by various applications. Demonstrated axial thicknesses of the zone plates vary from 3 mm to 15 mm, covering a range of focusable X-rays from 6 keV to 30 keV, but the fabrication permits going up to hundreds of keV in future devices.</p>\n<p>The program involved step-wise increases in processing experience by developing four prototypes of increased device performance. The resulting devices underwent advanced characterization methods such as focused ion beam cross sectioning and high-resolution imaging in scanning electron microscopes, as well as functional testing on X-ray beam lines.

Additionally, with the advent of powerful X-ray sources in development at different companies, high photon energy, high brilliance X-rays will become available as table top sources, greatly expanding the domain of use for these zone plate devices and dramatically reducing material research analyses costs.</p>\n<p>The figures bellow show image excerpts of the resulted zone plates.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/29/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Nicolaie&nbsp;A&nbsp;Moldovan</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1831268/1831268_10583093_1638226605300_ZP33intransmittedpolarizedlight--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1831268/1831268_10583093_1638226605300_ZP33intransmittedpolarizedlight--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig.3.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1831268/1831268_10583093_1638226605300_ZP33intransmittedpolarizedlight--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig.3.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fig.3.
