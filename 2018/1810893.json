 "awd_abstract_narration": "Humanity has been interested in the geometry of three-dimensional spaces since long before recorded history; since Einstein's work on general relativity, the geometry of four-dimensional spaces has also been of central importance, with applications now as ubiquitous as the global positioning system. Mathematicians have divided the study of spaces into two parts: qualitative questions (like whether a space has a hole in it), which is the field of topology, and quantitative questions (like the diameter of the hole), which is the field of geometry. Most, though not all, applications require quantitative answers, but before one can start on quantitative answers---the geometry---one needs to understand the qualitative behavior---low-dimensional topology, the focus of this National Science Foundation funded project. Indeed, in four-dimensions, even many of the most basic topological questions remain unanswered---questions about how many different simple spaces there are, how spaces can be cut up into simpler pieces, and what kinds of surfaces one can fit in given four-dimensional spaces. By using relations with other parts of mathematics and high-energy physics, this proposal seeks to advance human understanding by developing tools to answer some of these basic questions.\r\n \r\nThis project, which focuses on applications of symplectic topology, algebraic topology, and representation theory to low-dimensional topology, has four interrelated goals. The first goal is to extend Lipshitz-Ozsv\u00e1th-Thurston's \"bordered Heegaard Floer homology\" invariant of three-manifolds with boundary from the \"hat\" variant to the richer \"minus\" variant, for three-manifolds with torus boundary. The second goal is to prove a higher naturality result for Heegaard Floer homology, giving a functor from an appropriate quasi-category of decorated cobordisms to the quasi-category of chain complexes. The third goal is to prove new localization results relating the Heegaard Floer homology of a space with the Heegaard Floer homology of its branched covers. The fourth is to extend Lipshitz-Sarkar's stable homotopy refinement of Khovanov homology to cobordisms between knots and to other variants of Khovanov homology, including Lee homology. These tools are expected to have applications to concordance, homology cobordism, and other problems at the interface of three- and four-dimensional topology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Here, a *knot* means a closed curve in 3-space that does not intersect itself. For example, Figure 1 shows&nbsp; two views of the (3,-3,-3) pretzel knot: a 3-dimensional render and a *knot diagram*, the way topologists usually represent knots. As these pictures make clear, the (3,-3,-3) pretzel knot has several symmetries: rotating the picture by 180 degrees gives the same picture. This particular kind of symmetry is called a *strong inversion*. If you take half of the picture and glue it together using the symmetry, you get a new knot, the *quotient knot* (Figure 2).<br /><br />A main way topologists study knots is by associating certain algebraic objects to them, in ways that reflect properties of the knots. One such invariant that has received a lot of attention recently is called *Khovanov homology*. In one project supported by the grant, Sucharit Sarkar and the PI showed that, for any knot with a strong inversion, there is a specific relationship between the Khovanov homology of the knot and its quotient. Surprisingly, this has implications about 4-dimensional space. The pretzel knot is not the boundary of a disk in 3-space, but it is in 4-space. Specifically, consider the disk in Figure 3. In 3-space, it intersects itself in two line segments. In 4-space, you can push one sheet near each intersection into the fourth dimension, to remove the intersection, without changing the boundary. (A disk like this is called a *ribbon disk*, for obvious reasons.) In fact, this knot bounds two essentially different ribbon disks: the one shown, and the result of rotating it by 180 degrees. The fact that these are fundamentally different disks in 4-space follows from the result about Khovanov homology mentioned above. (This particular case was already known by other methods.) The proof of the result about Khovanov homology uses techniques from high-dimensional topology. (Three and four dimensions are considered low in this field, because of a qualitative shift in behavior between dimensions four and five.)<br /><br />In a different project, Sucharit Sarkar and the PI used Khovanov homology to give examples of non-orientable surfaces (surfaces containing Mobius bands) in 4-space which are topologically but not smoothly equivalent. That is, one can be deformed into another, but only if the surface is allowed to become non-smooth in the process. Figure 4 shows one of the pair of surfaces; a symmetry of a knot again plays a role in this result. The distinction between non-smooth and smooth topology has been a major theme in the study of four-dimensional spaces since the 1980s; this and other related recent results are among the most concrete examples of the difference. The proof is also simpler than many previous methods, representing progress in our understanding. These results build on recent work of many other researchers, including Anthony Conway, Kyle Hayden, Mark Powell, and Isaac Sundberg.<br /><br />Khovanov homology is closely tied to algebra. Another tool with similar properties, but which is more closely tied to calculus, is called Heegaard Floer homology. The PI has been working with Peter Ozsvath and Dylan Thurston to develop new tools for computing this invariant. These involve fitting it into new algebraic frameworks. For example, Figure 5 hints at how a torus gives rise to a kind of multiplication. Unlike the usual multiplication, where you multiply numbers together two at a time, this multiplication often requires you to multiply more than two elements at once; the figure shows an example of a 4-input operation. The general algebraic structure was discovered, in a totally different context, by James Stasheff in the 1960s; this example is new.<br /><br />Other results supported by the grant include a new algebraic structure for studying non-associative algebraic structures (related to the previous paragraph) and properties of a refinement of Khovanov homology, called the Khovanov stable homotopy type, including further computations of it and more relationships to surfaces in 4-space.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/06/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Robert&nbsp;Lipshitz</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1810893/1810893_10542592_1667096497548_Fig1_946Diags--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1810893/1810893_10542592_1667096497548_Fig1_946Diags--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1.
