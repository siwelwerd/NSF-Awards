 "awd_abstract_narration": "The GlueX experiment at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab) searches for evidence of a new class of particles called hybrid mesons, which are expected to exist based on the Standard Model of particle physics. The best existing theory calculations for hybrid mesons predicts that 27 such mesons should exist within the mass between 1.8 and 2.5 GeV/c. GlueX has been built to study this full mass region with excellent sensitivity, using a high-intensity polarized photon beam and a state-of-the-art detector capable of identifying these new particles from the momentum distributions of their decay products. The GlueX group at University of Connecticut consists of the PI, one PhD student, and two undergraduate student researchers. This team is responsible for producing the diamond targets that generate the polarized high-energy photon beam from electrons accelerated in the Jefferson Lab accelerator, making sure they meet the stringent requirements in terms of crystal quality and flatness. The group also constructed and maintains the tagging \"microscope\" detector that is used to measure the photon beam energy. Support received under this grant enables the UConn team to travel to Newport News to support the operation of the GlueX experiment over the next three years, and to work on the analysis of GlueX data.\r\n\r\nExperimental searches for hybrid mesons over the past 20 years have mostly come up empty, except for one or two outstanding candidates. One plausible reason for this is that prior searches have focused on the wrong mass region, guided by older model calculations which indicated that the masses of the lightest hybrids might be less than 1.5 GeV. Within the past decade, improved predictions have emerged, pointing to a higher mass region 1.8 - 2.5 GeV for the lightest 3 hybrid nonets. GlueX has been built to study this full mass region, with excellent mass resolution and high statistics, in photo production by polarized 9 GeV photons. During the past three years, GlueX has completed commissioning and initial physics data-taking phases. Over the next three years, the experiment will collect a major part of the full dataset required to complete its primary physics mission, and will complete an initial survey of the resonance landscape over the mass range of interest, focusing initially on a small number of exclusive final states that are favored for hybrid decays. The UConn group supports the analysis effort by authoring and maintaining the physics simulation package for GlueX, managing shared computer resources for physics simulation, and participating in the shared data analysis effort.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The principal research effort is focused on the Gluonic Excitations experiment (GlueX) at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Newport News, Virginia. The experiment generates its own beam of polarized high-energy photons and collides them with protons in a fixed target of liquid hydrogen to produce a broad spectrum of energetic unstable hadrons. Surrounding the target is a high-acceptance detector capable of identifying the decay products of these unstable particles, and identifying their common point of origin in the target. Putting together all of the information from the various detector elements and the beam photon, the presence of massive parent particles appearing early in the decay cascade are deduced, and their properties measured. UConn is one of 32 universities and research institutes from 10 countries that are collaborating on the GlueX experiment. The UConn group has primary responsibility for the design and operation of the polarized photon beam for the GlueX experiment, and for the detector physics simulation software.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The question of the role played by gluons in the excitation spectrum of hadrons has hung over the field of nuclear physics ever since quantum chromodynamics (QCD) replaced the picture of the strong nuclear force as a short-distance binding force between protons and neutrons with a long-range force between quarks and gluons, in which protons and neutrons are bound states of quarks and gluons (hadrons). The explanation of how a short-distance force between hadrons emerges from a long-distance force between quarks and gluons is still not completely clear, but significant progress has been made using a numerical approach known as Lattice QCD (LQCD). One increasingly firm prediction coming from LQCD calculations is the existence of a new class of hadron known as a ?hybrid meson?, with a large fraction of its mass coming from internal gluonic excitations. The principal goal of the GlueX experiment is to test this prediction, and if such exotic mesons exist, to measure their properties.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The critical component of the polarized photon source is the diamond radiator that generates the high-energy photon beam for GlueX. High-energy electrons from the Jefferson Lab accelerator passing through a thin diamond crystal radiate polarized photons at particular energies when the crystal is oriented at specific angles nearly perpendicular to the electron direction. Fig. 1 (see below) shows a photograph of a diamond radiator after it has been used in the GlueX source for several weeks. The discolored area shows where the electron beam went through it, gradually damaging the crystal and degrading its ability to emit polarized photons. Because of this degradation, a regular supply of fresh diamond radiators is needed by GlueX, in order to collect the large sample of measurements needed to achieve its physics goals. To accomplish this, the UConn group ordered high-quality single crystal diamonds from an international vendor, had them cut and polished down to final thickness and flatness specifications by specialists in the diamond industry, and then mounted them on a thermally conducting support for insertion into the electron beam. Cutting, polishing, and mounting the thin crystal are all highly specialized tasks, any one of which may damage the crystal beyond the limits of its usefulness for GlueX. To verify the quality of the finished radiators, they were assessed using monochromatic X-rays at a synchrotron light source. During the most recent grant period, diamond X-ray assessments were carried out at the Canadian Light Source in Saskatchewan. Fig. 2 (see below) shows the results for one of the new radiators tested at CLS in December, 2021.
