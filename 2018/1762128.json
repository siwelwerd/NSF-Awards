 "awd_abstract_narration": "1762128 (Hellweg). The Gordon Research Conference on Industrial Ecology (GRC-IE) will be held May 20 - 25, 2018. A companion meeting for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, the Gordon Research Seminar on Industrial Ecology (GRS-IE), will be held in conjunction with the GRC-IE (May 19 - 20). This is a grant for participant support: conference fees and travel for U.S. researchers, including PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty members. The conference theme, \"The Role of Industrial Ecology in Reaching Sustainable Development Goals,\" addresses multiple emerging research, including sustainable food provision (as related to the food-energy-water nexus), smart, sustainable and connected communities, clean and renewable energy, infrastructure innovations, and a focus on integrated assessments across multiple human and environmental impacts (land, water, climate, biodiversity, economy & wellbeing). The GRS and the GRC play a critical role in advancing the intellectual frontier in environmental science and engineering, in fostering international collaborations, advancing research and networking opportunities, and mentoring of young researchers.\r\n\r\nBy providing financial support to young scholars who would not otherwise be able to participate, the conference will help promote the development of a robust and diverse industrial ecology research community. The GRS-IE held immediately prior to the GRC provides a forum for graduate students and post-doctoral researchers to present their work, discuss cutting edge aspects of their research, and build collaborative relationships with their colleagues at a critical time in their careers. Participants in the GRS-IE will be welcome at the associated GRC-IE and encouraged to present posters at the GRC.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
