 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drinking water distribution systems (DWDSs) store and transport treated drinking water to millions of customers across the country. Bacteria colonize and coat the inside pipe surfaces in DWDSs to form biofilms that are responsible for a multitude of problems, including corrosion, taste and odor issues, formation of carcinogenic disinfection-by-products (DBPs), loss of the chlorine residual that protects the water from pathogenic microorganisms. All of these problems have serious financial and public health ramifications for the United States. This project aims to develop a fundamental mechanistic understanding of how biofilms attach to pipes, how strong they are, and how easily they can become detached from the pipe surfaces. This research will be used to develop strategies for removal of biofilms from the DWDSs to address the national goal of ensuring safe drinking water to the citizenry. The broader impacts of this research for society include the development of new technological solutions for water utilities and water plant operators. The project also aims to engage Alaska Native undergraduate students in engineering research, with the long-term goal of increasing the number and broadening the participation of Alaska Native students and graduates in engineering.\r\n\r\nThe research goal of this CAREER project is to enhance the understanding of biofilm mechanical properties, with specific application to biofilms in drinking water distribution systems (DWDSs). To meet this overall goal, the proposal has three objectives: (1) investigate the correlation between the biofilm exopolymeric substance (EPS) matrix components and biofilm strength in the DWDS; (2) test novel biofilm weakening strategies and examine the impact of these weakening strategies on the contribution of biofilms to DBP formation in the DWDS; and (3) evaluate the impact of distribution system hydraulics and disinfection on biofilm detachment, biofilm cluster formation and reattachment in the DWDS. A primary educational objective of this project is to involve Alaska Native undergraduate students in engineering research.  Biofilms will be grown in special bench-scale biofilm growth reactors that provide controlled and well-defined environmental conditions simulating distribution systems. Advanced microscopic and spectroscopic techniques (e.g., nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, confocal scanning laser microscopy and atomic force microscopy) and biofilm-specific micro-cantilever methods will be employed for determination of EPS compositional analysis and mechanical properties. The PI will also investigate a novel strategy for biofilm weakening by targeting the biofilm EPS, instead of the traditional approach of inactivating biofilm bacteria by using biocides. For that purpose, a suite of strength modifiers and detachment promoting agents for biofilms in DWDSs will be evaluated. The mechanistic study of biofilm cohesive strength will identify the role of various EPS macromolecules in providing strength and structure to biofilms, which will be helpful in designing effective strategies for biofilm control. The insights into the mechanistic basis of biofilm strength and detachment will increase our ability to control and manipulate biofilms in various environmental systems (e.g., biofilters, wastewater treatment, DWDSs) and beyond (e.g., medical biofilms). Understanding biofilm dynamics and detachment in DWDSs will help design better strategies to provide improved drinking water quality, significantly benefitting public health.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

However, maintaining the quality of water as it travels through miles of distribution pipelines is an ongoing challenge. One persistent issue is the formation of biofilms&mdash;complex communities of microorganisms that attach to the inner surfaces of pipes and form protective layers. Biofilms are not just harmless accumulations. They can harbor pathogens, interfere with disinfection processes, and influence the taste and safety of water. Despite the routine use of disinfectants like chlorine, biofilms are difficult to fully eliminate because of their structural complexity and resistance to conventional cleaning methods.</p>\r\n<p>Our research aimed to better understand the structure and mechanical properties of biofilms in drinking water systems and explore novel, safer strategies to weaken and remove them without relying on excessive chemical treatments. In particular, we focused on three main questions:</p>\r\n<p>1. What holds biofilms together, and how can we weaken their structure?</p>\r\n<p>2. Can we identify 'detachment-promoting agents' (DPAs) that facilitate biofilm removal more effectively and safely?</p>\r\n<p>3. What happens to biofilm fragments and bacteria once they detach&mdash;do they survive, regrow, or pose new risks downstream?</p>\r\n<p><strong>Understanding Biofilm Structure and Weak Points</strong>. We used tools like atomic force microscopy (AFM) and rheometry to investigate how biofilms behave mechanically&mdash;how sticky, elastic, and resistant they are under different conditions. These properties help explain why biofilms remain firmly attached to pipe surfaces. We tested a variety of agents that could target the molecular components of biofilms, such as proteins, polysaccharides, and extracellular DNA. These components act as a 'glue' that holds the biofilm matrix together. Our results showed that certain mild chelating agents and acids, such as EDTA and citrate, could effectively weaken these bonds and disrupt the biofilm structure&mdash;making them promising candidates for biofilm control.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Promoting Detachment Without Harsh Chemicals</strong>. One of the key innovations in this project was the exploration of DPAs&mdash;chemicals that help loosen biofilms from surfaces without relying solely on disinfection. While disinfectants like chlorine kill bacteria, they don&rsquo;t always remove the physical biofilm mass, which can continue to harbor microbial activity and affect system performance. We evaluated various DPAs on different pipe materials (e.g., copper, steel, plastic) commonly used in drinking water systems. We also tested whether these agents formed any harmful byproducts when combined with disinfectants. Encouragingly, the DPAs we identified were not only effective in enhancing biofilm removal but also showed minimal reactivity with disinfectants, supporting their potential for safer, more sustainable use.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Tracking Biofilm Fragments After Detachment</strong>. We also studied what happens when biofilms detach&mdash;either naturally or due to interventions. Using lab-scale pipe systems, we monitored water flow, temperature, and chlorine levels to see how these factors influence biofilm reattachment and bacterial regrowth. Our findings suggest that traditional flushing methods&mdash;such as increasing flow rates to dislodge biofilms&mdash;often fall short of complete removal. Detached fragments can remain viable and reattach elsewhere, potentially allowing biofilms to reestablish quickly if not managed comprehensively.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Impact and Future Directions</strong>. Beyond generating new scientific insights, this project helped train the next generation of environmental engineers. Two PhD students and two undergraduate researchers gained valuable experience, and we integrated findings into our university-level engineering courses. By advancing our understanding of biofilm behavior and developing smarter, safer removal strategies, this work contributes to long-term improvements in drinking water infrastructure. Water utilities and engineers can benefit from these findings to reduce chemical usage, minimize microbial risks, and maintain high water quality from source to tap.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 04/11/2025<br>\nModified by: Srijan&nbsp;Aggarwal</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1752601/1752601_10537760_1744359804299_CDC_Reactor_Setup--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1752601/1752601_10537760_1744359804299_CDC_Reactor_Setup--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Biofilm CDC reactor setup\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1752601/1752601_10537760_1744359804299_CDC_Reactor_Setup--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Biofilm CDC reactor setup\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A laboratory reactor setup for growing biofilms under shear conditions, housed in Prof. Srijan Aggarwal's laboratory at University of Alaska Fairbanks.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Md Ibnul Hasan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Srijan&nbsp;Aggarwal\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Biofilm CDC reactor setup</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1752601/1752601_10537760_1744359697478_Biofilm_flow_cell_Setup--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1752601/1752601_10537760_1744359697478_Biofilm_flow_cell_Setup--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Biofilm Flow Cell Setup\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1752601/1752601_10537760_1744359697478_Biofilm_flow_cell_Setup--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Biofilm Flow Cell Setup\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A capillary flow cell setup used to grow and observe biofilms in-situ under a microscope in Prof. Srijan Aggarwal's laboratory at University of Alaska Fairbanks.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Fayzul Kabir</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Srijan&nbsp;Aggarwal\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Biofilm Flow Cell Setup</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1752601/1752601_10537760_1744359912182_Biofilm_EPS_Disintegration--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1752601/1752601_10537760_1744359912182_Biofilm_EPS_Disintegration--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Biofilm EPS Disintegration\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1752601/1752601_10537760_1744359912182_Biofilm_EPS_Disintegration--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Biofilm EPS Disintegration\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Schematic showing the novel biofilm control approach by disintegrating biofilm EPS components instead of traditional disinfection.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Srijan Aggarwal</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Srijan&nbsp;Aggarwal\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Biofilm EPS Disintegration</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1752601/1752601_10537760_1744359564157_Biofilm_sampler--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1752601/1752601_10537760_1744359564157_Biofilm_sampler--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Biofilm Sampler in Water Mains\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1752601/1752601_10537760_1744359564157_Biofilm_sampler--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Biofilm Sampler in Water Mains\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">PI Aggarwal observing a novel in-situ biofilm sampler designed for this project and installed in water distribution mains of University of Alaska Fairbanks.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Md Ibnul Hasan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Srijan&nbsp;Aggarwal\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Biofilm Sampler in Water Mains</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
