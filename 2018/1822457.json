 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 16th annual Graduate Student Topology and Geometry Conference is to be held at The University of Illinois at Chicago on April 7-8, 2018. It is specifically aimed at graduate students, and many of the talks will be delivered by student participants. The conference will represent a large body of students in different stages of their Ph.D., and will provide a venue for students from a diverse collection of institutions and geographic regions to come together and interact. It aims to create a highly collaborative environment that will stimulate research and foster lasting connections between researchers at particularly crucial moments early in their careers. The conference will also provide a venue for students to hear about cutting edge research from established senior leaders and early career faculty.\r\n\r\nThe principal goal for this conference is to give graduate students the opportunity to present their research. Particular attention will be paid to ensure that a broad collection of topics are represented, so that rising generations of mathematicians are aware of the current frontiers of geometry and topology. To this end, there will also be talks by distinguished plenary speakers Ian Agol (University of California, Berkeley), Natasa Sesum (Rutgers University), and Shmuel Weinberger (University of Chicago), and early career faculty speakers Justin Curry (University at Albany, SUNY), Priyam Patel (University of California, Santa Barbara), Andrew Sanders (Heidelberg University), Jenya Sapir (Binghamton University), and Caglar Uyanik (Vanderbilt University). These presentations will cover a range of topics in topology and geometry including topological data analysis, homotopy theory, low dimensional topology, geometric group theory, geometric analysis, geometric topology, and dynamics. The talks provide opportunities for early career researchers to personally engage with experts outside of their home university, expanding and consolidating the network of mathematical scientists. \r\n\r\nThe conference website is: https://www.math.uic.edu/gstgc2018/",

This annual conference, now in its 17th year, focuses on giving graduate students in topology and geometry a place to present their work (whether completed research, or work in progress) and to learn about new developments in their field.  One of the distinguishing characteristics of GSTGC in comparison to other meetings with a similar topic is the emphasis on inclusion of graduate students in every aspect of the conference, from organization to participation.\nThe 2018 GSTGC brought together over 130 participants (primarily graduate students and postdocs in mathematics) for a meeting consisting of plenary lectures by Ian Agol, Natasa Sesum, and Shmuel Weinberger, early-career faculty lectures by Justin Curry, Robin Neumayer, Priyam Patel, Andrew Sanders, Jenya Sapir, and Caglar Uyanik, and twenty-eight talks by graduate student participants.\nThe main outcomes of the project included strengthening of a community of graduate students interested in topology and geometry, professional development for the graduate student speakers, and dissemination of recent research developments to all conference participants.  A secondary outcome was the training of the team of graduate student conference co-organizers in the process of setting up and running a large scientific meeting, applying for and managing funding, and reporting on the results, all of which are useful and important skills in academia.\nThis award has also contributed to the sustainability of the GSTGC as an annual event, and hence to the graduate student community in geometry and topology, through the current organizing committees\u2019 development of conference planning materials, participant application forms, and web site templates to pass on to future organizing committees.  During the support period for this award, the organizers recruited a team of graduate students to organize a 2019 GSTGC at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and provided materials to assist in that process.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/13/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David A Dumas"
