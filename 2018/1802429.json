 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this I-Corps project is to potentially reduce significantly the number of deaths of premature babies in low to middle income countries. Premature birth is globally the number one cause of death in children under the age of 5, with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) being the leading cause of these deaths. RDS is usually addressed by using a bCPAP (bubble continuous positive airway pressure) machine that provides the baby with a humidified blend of air and oxygen at a controlled temperature and pressure. The goal of this project is to develop a state-of-the-art, low-cost bCPAP machine that aids preterm babies in low to middle income countries. While bCPAP devices are standard in wealthy nations, their $8-10k cost often makes them unaffordable for countries with fewer resources.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project will explore the commercial potential of a novel bubble continuous positive airway pressure (bCPAP) machine.  Some of the innovative features of this device include a cassette format for ease of maintenance and repair, a battery backup for uninterrupted care, robust component selection for extended lifetime use and a drug delivery add on for potential treatment of comorbidities. If successfully implemented, this product would potentially help provide quality affordable healthcare to underserved populations and reduce premature deaths due to respiratory distress syndrome.",
