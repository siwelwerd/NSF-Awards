 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Connecticut is located in Storrs, CT. The principal investigators are Jose Gascon and Alfredo Angeles-Boza. The site supports the training of 9 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2019-2021. This site, supported by the Division of Chemistry in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, provides students with a diverse set of research projects in chemical sciences. Students also take part in in technical workshops and professional development seminars, which emphasize the development of communication skills and ethical behavior in research settings. This program culminates in oral and poster presentations, which is open to the University community, parents and faculty from the students' home institutions. Participants obtain a foundation for making informed choices about future careers in chemistry and establish networks with peers from a range of disciplines and experiences. In the recruitment of students, an emphasis is placed on women, underrepresented groups and students from the nearby Central Connecticut State University (CCSU). \r\n\r\nThis program introduces participants to a full breadth of research-related activities, a number of ancillary technical workshops and professional development seminars. The research projects span across all divisions of the University of Connecticut's chemistry department, including projects related to organic, inorganic, analytical, physical, biological, and polymer chemistry. In addition to the research conducted in the host laboratories, students participate in two hands-on workshops: one on computational chemistry and the other on single crystal X-ray crystallography held at CCSU. These activities introduce an intellectually challenging technical component to the program that involves the entire cohort and provides a deeper understanding about techniques that are instrumental to all fields of chemistry. Overall, the program enhances students' enthusiasm for chemistry and prepares them for post-graduate success in the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
