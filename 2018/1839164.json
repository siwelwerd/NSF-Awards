 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum principles of coherence and entanglement augur transformative capabilities for computation, sensor technologies and information processing. While proof-of-principle demonstrations of quantum-enhanced performance have shown promise in simple systems, their extension to scalable, integrated platforms have been stymied by decoherence, dissipation and other deleterious environmental influences. Intensive efforts have been made to further isolate these quantum platforms from such environmental interactions, but this approach grows increasingly formidable with growing complexity of the quantum system. An alternate paradigm of \"reservoir engineering\" has suggested that artificially imposed forms of dissipation can, counter-intuitively, lead to robust forms of quantum behavior. Recent theoretical and experimental studies by the PIs have identified forms of reservoir-engineered open quantum systems that exhibit novel dynamical quantum states with robust, finite temperature entanglement. This project seeks to build upon these studies to demonstrate reservoir engineering techniques for state preparation, manipulation and quantum control of a multifunctional hybrid system that interfaces ultracold atoms and silicon carbide defect qubits within a MEMS-based optomechanical resonator. In addition to elucidating universal principles governing reservoir-engineered open quantum systems, this multifunctional hybrid system will also be used to demonstrate quantum-enhanced metrology in a scalable, integrated platform. \r\n\r\nThe multifunctional hybrid quantum system leverages unique capabilities of this team including (i) fundamental conceptual advances in the use of reservoir-engineering techniques to create topologically protected forms of entanglement in an open quantum system, (ii) expertise in strong coupling of ultracold quantum spins to MEMS-based optomechanical resonators for spin-mediated control and sensing, (iii) expertise in fabrication of high quality single crystal silicon carbide optomechanical resonators, (iv) expertise in the deterministic placement and control of silicon carbide defect centers. The achievement of augmented strain coupling between defect qubits and optomechanical MEMS devices will enable the stabilization, state readout and dissipation control of the hybrid system. As part of this program, this team will also demonstrate the high quality devices with strong optomechanical and strain coupling between ultracold spin qubits, SiC defect qubits and microtoroidal optomechanical resonators. This multifunctional hybrid system is a novel laboratory for the demonstration and validation of reservoir-engineering paradigms for quantum state preparation, control and metrology. In addition, it also enables the study of universal principles of open quantum systems including dynamical states with novel broken symmetries, driven dissipative phase transitions and critical behavior that have no counterpart in equilibrium systems. Education and outreach efforts to augment the quantum science and technology communities are important components of this program. Student researchers will be provided with interdisciplinary training in the multifaceted aspects of this project including atomic physics, optomechanics, materials design and synthesis, and MEMS fabrication.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
