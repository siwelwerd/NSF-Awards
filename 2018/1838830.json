 "awd_abstract_narration": "Twenty percent of Americans will be 65 years or older by 2030 out of which 35 - 50% will report having age-related hearing impairment that is treated primarily with hearing aids (HA). Regular use of HAs has been shown to improve communication and avoid the negative effects of hearing loss that include an increased risk of social isolation, depression, and inability to work, travel, or be physically active. Past research has shown that many people do not wear their HAs regularly, as they are unsatisfied with the performance in the real world. A fundamental limitation of existing methods for tuning HA is that they are not tailored to individual needs, which often leads to unsatisfactory performance. As part of this project, a team of computer scientists, engineers, and audiologists will develop new methods for tuning HAs that are based on the individual needs of a patient.\r\n\r\nThe project is based on the approach that better HA configurations may be identified based on feedback from the patient that is collected in the moment and in situ. The project includes development of two systems for optimizing the configuration of HAs. The first system will improve the efficacy of the traditional tuning process by improving how feedback is obtained from patients, combined with auditory context information, and translated into HA configuration adjustments. The second system will automatically adapt the configuration of a HA based on patient feedback and auditory context information without requiring an audiologist to perform adjustments. The intellectual merit of this proposal includes the advances in machine learning necessary to model the performance of complex systems that have numerous parameters such as HAs and tuning their parameters based on feedback obtained from patients. Additionally, the project will advance the state-of-the-art in embedded systems by developing techniques to run HA optimization algorithms as part of a multi-tier system composed of HAs, mobile phones, and cloud services. It is anticipated that the proposed research will empower patients to become more involved in their hearing care, improve HA satisfaction, and enrich their social interactions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Hearing aids adoption rates are even worse for people with lower incomes, racial and ethnic minorities. Furthermore, even when the price is not a factor, hearing aid users continue to report that they are dissatisfied with the performance of their devices. A critical factor in increasing patient satisfaction is appropriately configuring the numerous parameters available on modern hearing aids to improve speech understanding, sound quality, and comfort.

We have developed a novel approach to configuring hearing aids by incorporating user feedback from paired comparisons (see figure). To reduce the number of paired comparisons the user must complete to configure the hearing, we divided the problem into two parts.First, we identify a few presets that can meet the hearing needs of a large fraction of people with mild-to-moderate hearing loss. Next,&nbsp; a machine learning algorithm guides a user through a sequence of pairwise comparisons to identify their most-preferred preset. The machine learning algorithm is designed to minimize the number of questions asked to reduce the burden on the user. Our approach was validated through an extensive user study involving 45 users with mild-to-moderate hearing loss.

Unfortunately, the accuracy of data collected using survey methods is negatively affected by memory biases as patients are asked to remember the circumstances in which hearing aids performed poorly long after the fact. Therefore, we have developed mobile apps to allow audiologists to characterize the auditory environments in which people use their hearing aids and evaluate the performance of hearing aids in the real world. The original system was a mobile phone app that used ecological momentary assessments to simultaneously assess the performance of hearing aids and the auditory context.

The app encapsulated our experience with building user interfaces tailored for older adults, maximizing the amount of information collected by exploring different schemes for compensating subjects, and, most importantly, customizing existing audiology survey instruments designed to be used retrospectively for ecological momentary assessment. Over time, we refined the original app to integrate with hearing aids to collect acoustic measures.
