 "awd_abstract_narration": "Water droplets do not freeze spontaneously until -40 degrees C, unless there is a particle surface to act as a nucleus for the freezing process. Ice nucleation and the resulting freezing of water induced by particles and surfaces is important in many processes.  It plays a critical role in organ preservation and in the manufacturing and purification of pharmaceuticals, food, biomolecules, cosmetics, and nanomaterials.  Ice nucleation also plays a key role in cloud glaciation, the transformation of water droplets in a cloud to ice crystals.  Glaciated clouds are responsible for most precipitation over land.  Atmospheric ice nucleating particles that cause clouds to glaciate create significant changes in the structure and behavior of the clouds. This cloud freezing dramatically changes the lifetime of the cloud and increases its ability to precipitate. However, we lack a rigorous understanding of this heterogeneous ice nucleation process. We still do not understand what special properties make these rare one-in-a-million atmospheric particles effective at nucleating ice crystals. We also lack small transportable instruments that can determine the concentration and freezing temperature of atmospheric ice nucleating particles in real-time by sampling from suspended aerosol particles. This research addresses many of these short-comings through the development of a new microfluidic approach to continuously capture and measure ice nucleating particles. Individual particles are activated into liquid droplets, which are then captured into an oil flowing through a microchannel in a device fabricated from a soft polymer. By sending the microdroplets through a temperature gradient applied to the microfluidic device, the freezing temperature of each particle-droplet pair is determined optically as each droplet turns opaque upon freezing. The use of engineered carbon nanotubes and metal oxide nanoparticles as robust ice nucleating particle standards with well-defined and reproducible freezing temperatures will then be explored using our unique device. The importance of heterogeneous ice nucleation and phase transitions will be communicated to the public and to underrepresented K-12 students in particular by conducting hands-on educational activities at several local public schools through after-school programs. The students will conduct experiments where they induce freezing in a small cloud chamber. These activities will be developed into self-contained educational modules that will be shared with a larger number of educators.\r\n\r\nA new approach will be developed for transferring individual size-selected aerosolized particles in microdroplets into a continuous oil flow in a microfluidic chip. This will enable new experimental avenues in numerous fields. The capture of particles - first activated into droplets using a cloud condensation nuclei counter - into the continuous oil flow will be optimized using scaling analysis to tune the aerosol and oil flow rates to ensure droplet impaction and coalescence that avoids bouncing or droplet shattering. A linear temperature gradient will be applied along the microchannel using micro-Peltier elements, and measured using an array of thin-film thermocouples. Temperature measurements along with numerical simulations will provide the temperature gradient field along the chip, allowing us to correlate the observed position of droplet freezing to its critical ice nucleation temperature. The lattice and surface properties of engineered nanoparticles will be determined and correlated to the ice nucleation ability we determine using the microfluidic device. This will be used to test our hypothesis that engineering nanoparticles will have tight and robust freezing temperature spectra. The uniform characteristics of these engineered nanoparticles should result in very reproducible freezing properties, creating improved ice nucleating particle standards that are greatly needed for ice nucleation measurements. This project brings together experts in aerosol science and technology, atmospheric chemistry, transport phenomena, and microfluidics, to perform truly interdisciplinary research. As this research focuses on advancing fundamental understanding of a key phase transition, it will have immediate impact on a wide range of fields in science and engineering, such as materials synthesis and purification, physical chemistry, the geophysical sciences, and anthropogenic climate change.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This phase transition is a critical but still poorly understood phenomenon that has important effects on the formation, evolution and lifetime of clouds, the likelihood that they will produce precipitation, their radiative properties, and thus the effects of aerosol particles on weather and climate. Crystal nucleation is also important for materials synthesis and their properties in the food sciences, for cryopreservation, and for the production and purification of pharmaceuticals.

Each droplet floats in the surrounding oil, avoiding contact with any solid surface that could act as a weak ice nucleant and cause background freezing that interferes with the sample analysis. The MINT device was demonstrated to obtain accurate droplet freezing temperature spectra with high statistics and a low background freezing temperature of -33 C. This enabled determining the ice nucleation ability of complex biomass-burning aerosol emitted from wildfires, a major source of pollution emitted episodically to the atmosphere. Minerals produced by the biomass fuel combustion were determined to be the source of the ice nucleating particles. This discovery helped to explain the long-standing mystery regarding why some biomass fuels produce ice nucleating particles, while others do not, and what the source of these rare and important particles are. Furthermore, the MINT approach developed here allowed us to determine that simulated atmospheric photochemical aging can further enhance the ice nucleation ability of the smoke particles, by removing organic carbon coatings that conceal the mineral-based ice nucleants.</p>\n<p>A novel approach to capturing aerosol particles into a droplet microfluidic device that preserves the unique identity of each individual particle was also developed.

A custom nozzle was designed to transport the droplet to the oil-filled open channel of a microfluidic chip. A small vacuum flow applied to the nozzle bled some of the air from the aerosol droplet stream to reduce the total flow velocity arriving at the oil surface. Dimensionless analysis involving the Stokes number that predicts if the droplet will be intercepted by the oil, and the Weber number that predicts how the droplet will behave when it strikes the oil surface, was developed to tune the parameters of the droplet collection.

Good droplet collection efficiency &gt; 40% in the expected size range was observed, and droplet coalescence once transferred to the continuous oil phase of the microfluidic device was avoided by addition of an appropriate surfactant to the oil. The successful development of a new approach for transferring individual aerosol particles each suspended in a droplet into a microfluidic device opens numerous potential new avenues of scientific discovery.
