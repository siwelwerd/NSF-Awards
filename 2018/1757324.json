 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Description\r\n\r\nPlants and animals live in a fragile balance that can be upset by human land use decisions. This project aims to help landowners, state park planners, city planners, and Native American tribes in Idaho make informed decisions on land use that will minimize the effects on native wildlife. To do this, researchers from several colleges and universities across the state will create tools that will use data from a wide variety of sources including advanced genetics, ecological and geographical databases, and survey results from landowners and Native American tribes. These tools will provide options for land use that will encourage the most effective use of land while minimizing the impacts on native plant and animal species. Through this program, Idaho will engage the public, train the next generation of scientists, and develop exciting new tools that will provide new methods for scientifically informed land use decisions.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\n\r\nThis Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) Track-1 project from Idaho will study two keystone species (redband trout and sagebrush) in ecosystems of the American West. The project will use existing environmental legacy data to inform agent-based models (ABM) to predict adaptive capacity of these two species. The project team will determine the links between genomes and phenomes via experiments using temperature as the key variable to identify genomic responses of the adaptive capacity of these species and iteratively link them through the ABM to further inform our understanding of genetic capacity. Finally, the project participants will map species' genomes by environmental outcomes across additional impacts including biotic, abiotic, and various anthropogenic effects and local knowledge through methodologies originating from the social and economic sciences to inform the ABM model. The model will be used to predict the outcomes of various land use scenarios, and will be presented to stakeholder advisory groups who will discuss and make decisions based on the results from simulations. Decisions made by the stakeholder groups will further inform the model. It is expected that this iterative feedback model will be a transformative tool for land use decisions in Idaho and beyond. Additionally, strong workforce development plans will engage faculty, postdocs, graduate, and undergraduate students of the three research universities in Idaho, as well as 2- and 4-year Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs) in a Vertically Integrated Project approach that encourages all academic levels of the institution to work together. The inclusion of different types of higher educational institutions across Idaho will address and answer the state?s need for a well-trained workforce in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Results from redband trout research demonstrate substantial plasticity to thermal stress in cold and cool montane populations while genetic adaptation to local thermal conditions may be more limited among the study populations. Sequencing of the sagebrush draft genome is complete and has been published on the National Center for Biotechnology Information and is being used to conduct population genetics analyses and use transcriptomics to identify mechanisms of drought resistance. The team also advanced bioinformatic pipelines to overcome challenges associated with assembly and annotation of a complex genome.</p>\n<p>In concert with the advances made in understanding these mechanisms, the team completed development and publication of population distribution models and the simulation of adaptive capacity and population vulnerability using agent-based models. They advanced and published spatial maps of &nbsp;genotype-by-environment phenotypes in populations across complex social-ecological systems (SES) that are poised to inform management decisions across the Owyhee and Teton Valley regions in Idaho. This SES work has been advanced through the development and implementation of an innovative alternative scenarios methodology.

Over 150 undergraduates received paid research experiences with structured training. Over 100 graduate students and approximately 27 post-doctoral fellows also participated in the program. Also, as a sustainable contribution to our research capacity, eight new faculty hires were active GEM3 researchers. New hires enhanced the metrics for the number of publications in peer-reviewed journals and the number of proposals for extramural funding. Four of the new faculty hires were awarded six NSF grants as PI or Co-PI, one of which is a CAREER grant.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong></p>\n<p>The integrated Workforce Development and Broadening Participation program enhanced and increased the number, diversity and preparation of skilled scientists and engineers in GEM3 fields. Idaho&rsquo;s three universities made further expansions to the rollout of the Vertically Integrated Projects (VIPs) strategy. The project built a robust on-ramp for students across Idaho&rsquo;s research, predominantly undergraduate, and two-year colleges into research and training through development of lab modules in courses within our undergraduate curriculum and participation by diverse trainees in the Summer Authentic Research Experience (SARE).
