 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities-Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) Research Initiation Awards (RIAs) provide support to STEM faculty at HBCUs to pursue research at their home institution, at an NSF-funded Center, at a research intensive institution or at a national laboratory. The RIA projects are expected to help further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, to improve research and teaching at their home institution, and to involve undergraduate students in research experiences. With support from the National Science Foundation, Fayetteville State University (FSU), will conduct research aimed at addressing one of the most pressing environmental concerns of our age: the escalating level of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), which is a major greenhouse gas largely correlated to the combustion of fossil fuels. For the foreseeable future, it seems that the ever-growing energy demand will most likely necessitate more consumption of these indispensable sources of energy. Therefore, it is strategically important to develop technologies for Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage (CCUS). Currently, aqueous amine solution is the most advanced technology for carbon capture. However, the use of aqueous amine solution suffers from several significant drawbacks, including apparatus corrosion and high regeneration cost. These disadvantages can be alleviated if we graft amine into porous solid matrix instead of mixing with water. This project aims at developing novel amine-grafted porous organic polymers for efficient carbon capture. We expect two major benefits for our designed materials: one is noncorrosive. Amines are grafted inside the porous solid matrix without direct contact the apparatus. The other is energy efficient. Water has one of the highest heat capacities. It costs a lot more energy to heat aqueous solution than porous solid in a temperature swing process. The successful implementation of this proposed research will enhance our international competitiveness in carbon capture technology.\r\n\r\nThe scientific challenges for amine-grafted porous materials to become an economically viable technology for carbon capture are their CO2 loading, recyclability, and manufacturing costs. The better understanding of adsorption-desorption mechanisms of CO2 in amine-grafted porous materials is one of the key factors which will help us design and synthesize such materials to reach maximum CO2 loading with optimized energy efficiency. We propose several strategies to build porous polymeric platforms to study the structure-property correlations between amines and CO2 molecules. First, we build anchors in the porous platforms, then we use these anchors to attach amines of different lengths. The number of amines that could be incorporated is largely dependent upon the number of installed anchors; therefore, high concentration and even distribution of anchors inside the porous platforms ensure the maximum amine loading afterwards. The proposed research will advance our understanding of the CO2 adsorption-desorption mechanisms in amine-grafted porous materials at the molecular level. The knowledge generated will guide the development of such materials of high CO2 loading with optimized energy efficiency. The proposed research will also allow the PI to work with two to three undergraduate researchers each year over a three-year course. All of them will obtain extensive training in experimental design and implementation, data collection and analysis, results presentation and publication, etc. Such experiences will boost their competency and prepare them for graduate schools or professional workforces.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In this work, we focused primarily on studying novel two-dimensional transition metal carbides known as MXenes for their application to CO2capture and then assessing how the intercalation of amine-containing compounds affected the CO2adsorption capacity of these materials.Firstly, we investigated how the etching procedure used to prepare Ti3C2Txand Ti2CTxMXene influenced the morphology, specific surface area, and CO2adsorption capacity. Secondly, we studied how the intercalation of amine-containing molecules affected the morphology, specific surface area, and CO2adsorption capacity. Furthermore, we also studied the morphology, structure, surface area, heat of adsorption, and adsorption capacity of CO2in one-dimensional lepidocrocite titania (1DL TiO2).The following findings were revealed from the project:\r\n\n\n1. The etching process in the synthesis of Ti3C2TxMXene from the Ti3AlC2MAX phase affects the morphology and thus the specific surface area and CO2adsorption capacity.The milder hydrothermal etching process involving an aqueous solution of lithium fluoride (LiF) in hydrochloric acid (HCl) seems to favor MXenes with a greater CO2adsorption capacity than for MXenes produced from the harsher direct hydrofluoric acid (HF) method.\r\n\n\n2.

An enhancement in ultra-micropores (CO2uptake at low partial pressures in MXenes and in one-dimensional lepidocrocite titania (1DL), and an increasedCO2adsorption capacity does not simply result from an increase in surface area.Since the synthesis of 1DL titania involves a bottoms-up approach, similar to that in metal organic frameworks (MOFs), there is greater control of the production of ultra-micropores compared to the top-down synthesis preparation of MXenes via the selective etching of MAX phase materials.\r\n\n\n4. From theCO2adsorption-desorption isotherms for 1DL samples, the heat of adsorption analysis from the desorption branch (80 kJ/mol) is greater than that obtained from the adsorption branch (40 kJ/mol), indicating that theCO2is interacting with the 1DL titania surfaces.\r\n\n\nBroader impacts of the project\r\n\n\nThe project focused on enhancing diversity in STEM education and training by engaging underrepresented undergraduate students in research and scholarly activities.
