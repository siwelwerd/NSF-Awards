 "awd_abstract_narration": "The undergraduate physics curriculum has not changed much in the past fifty years.  To provide a skilled STEM workforce in the U.S., improvements in undergraduate physics instruction is critical.  The Paradigms in Physics Project at Oregon State University recognized this problem early on and reformed the entire upper-division curriculum for physics majors in 1966. This reform involved two actions. The first was a rearrangement of content to better reflect the way professional physicists think about the field. The second was infusion of evidence-based interactive pedagogies that are known to engage students more effectively. The resulting curriculum has become a local and national model for curricular reform and includes a variety of active-engagement teaching strategies.  An ongoing challenge to sharing the Paradigms course materials with other institutions is the large quantity of material available.  This project will develop two online resources to freely deliver these materials.  The first online resource will be an improved website designed from the ground up to enable faculty to access the resources they need to improve their teaching.  The second online resource will be a new textbook for teaching the mathematical skills students need to be successful in advanced physics courses. This textbook will be based on years of research by the Paradigms team on student use of math in physics courses. It will use the latest technologies to deliver an interactive experience that deepens student understanding.\r\n\r\nThe new website will be designed using a user-centered design process to make it intuitive for users to find needed information. Employing a relational database for the structure underneath will allow for adding new layers of information about sequences of activities and courses.  The result will be a more effective website that can be used by faculty teaching upper-division physics courses across the world.  Many curriculum development groups are struggling to create a website that can be used effectively.  The complex structure of the long-term Paradigms project is a further challenge. One of the two major aggregators of physics curricular materials, PhysPort, simply links to the Paradigms site.  Making the Paradigms site more useful to those wishing to adopt various aspects of the Paradigms materials could make this site a model for how other curriculum development projects might achieve the same goals.  The second strand of this work will build an open source, modular, online mathematical methods book for use in a just-in-time fashion in upper-division courses.  Using Pretext and Sage will allow the inclusion of multiple types of collapsible text alongside embedded computer algebra coding and high-quality graphics.  This book will document the content, language, and interactive nature of Paradigms courses as a living curriculum, whose continuous further development is driven by what happens in the classroom. Thus, this project will provide a resource not only to Oregon State students, but also to colleagues in mathematics, physics, and science education, both at Oregon State and at other institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nParadigms in Physics: Second Generation Dissemination Strategies\nCorinne Manogue, Tevian Dray, Elizabeth Gire\nNSF/DUE-1836603\n\nThe Paradigms in Physics project is an ongoing curriculum development project (begun in 1996) at Oregon State University (OSU) to develop and test classroom materials for upper-division physics courses. In this grant cycle, modern open-access technologies were employed to update and further advance two dissemination strategies. First, the Paradigms team constructed a new website to distribute the active-engagement curricular materials and prepared to connect the new site to national physics curriculum databases. Second, the Paradigms team adopted PreTeXt as an improved online textbook format, ported three existing textbooks to the new format, and enhanced them with new content and advanced interactive features.\n\nNew Website\n\nTwo challenges for any curriculum development project are: 1) How to make it easy for developers to add new content and continuously update old content; 2) How to make it easy for adopters to find materials appropriate for their courses.\n\nThe curricular content on the old DokuWiki-based dissemination site was successfully ported to a MySQL database, and editing interfaces for faculty were developed, tested, implemented, and revised with feedback from users. The number of classroom-tested curricular elements was approximately tripled and now exceeds a thousand; most have been beta-tested by at least a second faculty member at OSU. Some of the curricular materials, especially those covering quantum mechanics content, were enhanced and studied more substantively under the auspices of a companion grant: Paradigms in Physics: Representations in Quantum Mechanics, NSF/DUE-1836604. Solutions to many activities and homework problems were added and enriched with detailed discussions and sensemaking strategies. During remote teaching related to the COVID-19 shutdown, many of the classroom activities were also reframed and tested in a remote mode, with most proving to be robust.\n\nFeedback from the National Advisory Board was used to iteratively design the various landing pages on the website to make them more intuitive and easily searchable. ComPADRE metadata was added to each curricular element so that future automatic connections to the two main national physics curriculum repositories ComPADRE and PhysPORT will be straightforward to implement.\n\nThe new site allows faculty easily to choose materials from the database and to enter them into a course schedule. The schedule includes a faculty view that allows for quick choosing, editing, rearranging, and posting of both initial content and, later in the course, solutions. An automatically-generated, streamlined student view includes columns for dates, topics, in-class activities, links for reading and other resource materials, and homework assignments. This novel course builder was successfully tested, not only for courses at OSU, but also for national dissemination workshops and courses at AIMS, South Africa. It has been chosen by PhysPORT to be a feature of a newly proposed upper-division physics portal.\n\nOnline Textbooks\n\nA challenge in upper-division physics is how best to incorporate mathematical methods content. For some students, learning higher-level mathematics and physics at the same time is overwhelming; for others, without a physics context the mathematics makes no sense. This project has created books that support these two types of learningthose that focus on mathematics and those that interweave mathematics with physics content.\n\nThe Geometry of Vector Calculus (GVC) is a lower-division, mathematics-only text that nevertheless is designed to develop the geometric reasoning skills that support transfer of knowledge to a physical sciences setting. Similarly, the Geometry of Mathematical Methods (GMM) covers mathematics topics such as Fourier series, complex numbers, and partial differential equations in a context-neutral setting, but using language and notation common to upper-division physics courses (e.g. bra/ket notation for vectors). Alternatively, the Geometry of Static Fields (GSF) alternates mathematics and physics chapters so that readers immediately encounter an electromagnetic context. \n\nThe pilot content of these books was successfully ported to PreTeXt. A unified file system allows content to be shared among these textbooks and will allow for the development of more texts in the style of GSF, combining just-in-time mathematics with appropriate upper-division physics contexts. A brand-new PreTeXt feature will allow hyperlinks between different textbooks for students who need a deeper mathematical approach than can be provided in a combined text.\n\nThe authors' commitment to making active-engagement educational resources free for all users was reconfirmed by their experiences teaching online during COVID-19 and teaching courses for Masters' students in South Africa. In support of this commitment, the books have piloted the incorporation of new interactive algebraic-computing (SageMath) and computer visualization (GeoGebra) resources, which are open source and run in the cloud, with no need for any software installation by the reader.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/02/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: TevianDray\n"
