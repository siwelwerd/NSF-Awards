 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Frontiers of Engineering (FOE) Symposia, organized by the National Academy of Engineering, provide emerging engineering leaders from academia, industry, and government laboratories the opportunity to share research insights to facilitate an interdisciplinary transfer of knowledge and research methodologies. The nature of emerging technologies and how they fit together to create products and processes that drive economic growth in an increasingly competitive environment have heightened the need for engineers to understand each other's disciplines and enhance the value in that interaction, particularly among those developing and using these new technologies. The symposia serve as a catalyst to spur engineering innovation and foster collaborative networks of researchers within the United States and between engineers from the United States and partnering countries. \r\n\r\nThis award will provide partial support for two Frontiers of Engineering (FOE) symposia, to be held in 2018, organized by the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) for early career researchers: the Japan-America FOE to be held in Tsukuba, Japan on June 18-20, 2018 and the US FOE to be hosted by MIT Lincoln Lab in Lexington, Massachusetts on September 5-7, 2018. The 2018 US FOE symposium will focus on Quantum Computing, Resilient and Reliable Infrastructure, Theranostics: Diagnostics+Therapy, and Technology for Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief.  The 2018 JAFOE symposium will focus on Advanced AI, The Water Treatment Revolution, Bionics and Prosthetics, Smart Structures and Materials. Approximately 100 outstanding young engineers for the U.S. symposium and 30 from each country for the bilateral symposia will participate. Each two and one-half day symposium will include plenary sessions, technical tours, break-out sessions, and opportunities for developing collaborative research partnerships. Sessions will consist of presentations on cutting-edge research, innovations, and emerging research opportunities in engineering fields relevant to the symposium. FOE symposium papers, abstracts, presentation videos, and slides will be made available on the FOE website (www.naefrontiers.org ).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
