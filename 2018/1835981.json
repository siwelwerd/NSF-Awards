 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop will have three foci - pedagogy, student success and grant writing. This workshop will assist Historically Black College and University (HBCU) faculty in improving their research productivity by engaging in increased grant writing while continuing their mission to be effective advisors and educators.  Increasing the number of underrepresented groups earning computer and information science and engineering degrees is critical to the nation's economic competitiveness.  Minority-serving colleges and universities produce a disproportionate share of bachelor's degree graduates in computer and information science and engineering: HBCUs are only 3 percent of all 4-year colleges and universities, but awarded 11.4 percent of bachelor's degrees in computer and information science to African Americans. HBCU faculty are extremely important to the success of HBCU students in computer and information science.  The investigators will leverage the UNCF (United Negro College Fund) Innovation Summit to introduce workshop attendees to current and emerging topics that can create more competitive proposal topics (and writing), impact pedagogy to improve student retention and generate the interest of institutional leaders who typically attend the annual event.  A pre-and-post survey will be used to assess the effectiveness of the proposed work.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
