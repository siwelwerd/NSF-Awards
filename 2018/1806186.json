 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop award will support a combined community panel and participant networking conference session, focused on ways to foster diversity and inclusion within the engineering mechanics research community by building a culture of mentoring early career researchers, at the 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Engineering Mechanics Institute (EMI) Conference. This session will be held on the morning of May 31, 2018, during the ASCE EMI conference at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, May 29-June 1, 2018. This award will provide travel support for up to four invited panelists and up to 13 early career engineering mechanics researchers from underrepresented groups to attend the panel and networking session and EMI conference.  The invited panelists will share their research experiences and challenges during their research career, and suggest career-building research strategies and mentoring opportunities for early career researchers. This conference session will support the engineering mechanics research community to develop a plan for mentoring early career engineering mechanics researchers to enhance the diversity and inclusion of the research community, and thus broaden the perspectives and expertise to advance the progress of scientific and engineering research and knowledge in the engineering mechanics field.    \r\n\r\nThe objectives of this conference session are to: (1) discuss the impact of role models in cultivating diversity and inclusion in the next generation of engineering mechanics researchers, (2) identify the challenges facing early career researchers from underrepresented groups in the engineering mechanics community, (3) learn from and build upon successful research mentoring activities from other research communities and academic institutions, through the sage advice offered by the panelists, (4) highlight the importance and impact of mentoring and networking on early career research development, through the experience of mentees from prior National Science Foundation-supported faculty mentoring programs, and (5) recommend steps that can institutionalize mentorship activities for faculty to transition into leadership roles within the engineering mechanics research community.  The outcomes of this workshop will create a positive and proactive culture for networking and mentoring among the diverse engineering mechanics research community.  This award will produce a plan for mentoring activities to build a diverse and inclusive engineering mechanics research community and will disseminate the plan through a workshop report.",
