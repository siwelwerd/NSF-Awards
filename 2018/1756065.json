 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stress and evaluations of performance are commonplace in domains such as education, yet\r\nsurprisingly little research in humans has investigated the effects of stress on cognition. Although\r\nacademic success is often attributed to innate ability, how individuals respond to situational factors, such\r\nas stress, may have an even greater influence on cognitive performance. Thus, it is particularly important\r\nto investigate how stress influences the neural processes supporting cognitive performance. Research\r\nsuggests that too much stress may cause an increase in distraction and an accompanying shift away from\r\nengagement of the brain's cognitive control network (CCN), which guides attention outwardly toward the\r\ntask, toward greater engagement of the default mode network (DMN), which guides attention inwardly. As\r\ncognitive control is often required to maintain high performance, especially on difficult tasks, this shift may\r\nresult in a decrease in task performance. The project will investigate how stress affects levels of the stress\r\nhormone cortisol as well as brain activity in the CCN and DMN during the performance of a difficult task\r\nrequiring cognitive control. The research is important because it may identify neural mechanisms by which\r\nstress may prevent students from performing to their potential. This information may aid in effectively\r\ndeveloping approaches to minimize the negative impact of stress on cognitive performance. Additionally,\r\nthe proposed research will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in scientific research, as\r\nRutgers-Newark is consistently rated as having the most diverse undergraduate population in the nation.\r\nFurthermore, through an established program at Rutgers-Newark, local high school students from\r\nunderrepresented minority groups will assist with the proposed research.\r\n\r\nThe project combines physiological measurements of the stress hormone cortisol with functional\r\nmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate how psychosocial stress influences cognitive control\r\nprocesses and task performance. We aim to determine the effects of the Trier Social Stress Test, a known\r\npsychosocial stressor involving social-evaluative threat that reliably elevates cortisol release, on task\r\nperformance and brain network engagement during a Go/No-Go task. This task is ideal because it requires\r\ncognitive control and sustained attention, and distraction leads to a suboptimal response. The project\r\ncombines levels of analysis to provide links between the cognitive, physiological, and neural effects of\r\nstress. By investigating the relationship between psychosocial stress and the engagement of DMN and\r\nCCN, this research will provide important insights into how factors other than intelligence, such as how a\r\npotentially stressful event is experienced, drive the brain processes that determine cognitive performance\r\nand academic achievement.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe research funded by this grant investigated how stress influences the neural processing underlying cognitive performance.  Psychosocial stress involves evaluative threat that makes it more difficult to meet the demands of the situation.  We hypothesized that psychosocial stress would increase thoughts that are unrelated to the task at hand, hindering cognitive performance and shifting brain activity away from the Executive Control Network, which is engaged when performing difficult cognitive tasks.  We conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment with two groups of 40 participants each. One group endured psychosocial stress, elicited by the Trier Social Stress Test, which involves the preparation and performance of a speech in front of a \"speech expert,\" followed by a difficult serial subtraction task.  The other group filled out personality questionnaires as a control condition.  The participants then performed a Go/No-Go task which required them to associate traffic light stimuli of the colors red and green with \"No-Go\" (don't press the button) and \"Go\" (press the button), and then perform the same task following a reversal of the color-action contingencies. This is a difficult task involving a high degree of cognitive control, which effortfully guides attention to the task at hand.\n\nThe results confirmed that the Trier Social Stress Test led to elevated subjective ratings of stress and elevated blood pressure. Contrary to our hypothesis, compared to the control group, the stress group made fewer errors in the condition requiring the most executive control (fewer \"Go\" responses on \"No-Go\" trials with green traffic lights). These results suggest that although the Trier Social Stress Test was effective in eliciting stress, the stressed participants may have actually been more vigilant during task execution, leading to better performance.\n\nAnalysis of the fMRI data differentiated activity in the stress and control groups in the medial intraparietal area (mIPA) and the cerebellum.  These regions are involved in visuomotor coordination, which is central to goal-directed behavior.  These results suggest that the stressor-induced hypervigilance that facilitated performance on our task may be represented neurally by the activation patterns of cognitive control regions.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nBenefit to Society of the Proposed Work:  This research has implications for education and the science of learning, which may benefit society in the long term.  In trying to understand how to best tailor educational practices to the needs of the individual, influences on learning and cognitive performance other than ability need to be considered.  Students must deal both with life stress from outside the classroom and stress generated within the educational environment, and it is important to understand how this stress may impact brain function and cognition. The research indicates that stress may not always be detrimental to performance, and in fact, stressful events can lead to an increase in vigilance and activity in brain regions that may facilitate performance.   \n\nResearch Training and Inclusion of Underrepresented Groups in Scientific Research:  During the course of the award, I have trained 4 graduate students, 2 post-bac research assistants, 4 undergraduate students, and one high school student in my lab.
