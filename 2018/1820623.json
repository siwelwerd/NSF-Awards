 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mississippi State University (MSU) proposes to build cyber security education capacity with Mississippi Valley State University (MVSU). MVSU is an HBCU in the heart of the Mississippi Delta. In this effort, MSU will conduct faculty development summer workshops on the MSU campus for MVSU faculty. Together, MSU and MVSU will develop curricula that support Security+ certification of MVSU students. MSU will also work with MVSU to enhance MVSU's high school computer science summer camp program.   \r\n\r\nMSU's Center for Cyber Innovation proposes to work with MVSU's Mathematics, Computer and Information Sciences Department and MVSU's Center for Cyber Security. This partnership will provide commercial cyber certification opportunities for MVSU faculty and staff. MSU will facilitate this goal by developing and delivering a review course for the certification exam. By making the certification review material publicly available, MSU and MVSU seek to promote cyber security education capacity and economic development in the Mississippi Delta and beyond. A key early outcome of this effort is to establish a pipeline for MVSU students to be awarded scholarships through the CyberCorps: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program at MSU to pursue graduate studies. Longer term, MSU will assist MVSU in becoming certified through the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) jointly sponsored National Centers of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense (CAE-CD) program. The strategic goals are to position MVSU as an CAE-CD and ultimately establish an SFS program at MVSU to serve the Mississippi Delta region.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Over this time, MSU and MVSU established a strong partnership and worked closely with one another. MSU was able to enroll several MVSU students into its graduate degree programs. For this grant, two students received Master's degrees, and an MVSU graduate completed their Ph.D. at MSU in December 2021. In addition, MSU and MVSU offered summer internships that allowed college students from SFS programs and HBCUs to contribute to cybersecurity research projects in the summer of 2020 and 2021. Our team also held multiple high school summer camps geared toward providing a baseline of cybersecurity knowledge. The content of these summer camps were based on the CompTIA Security+ certification exam. The effort introduced the essential principles associated with the certification to highlight the opportunities in this career field. The high school students that participated in these camps were from the Mississippi Delta area. MVSU benefited from this award as a whole, with students gaining research experiences and faculty members having the opportunity to participate in training sessions. For example, MVSU attended Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) training at MSU in May 2019. MVSU and MSU also worked together in aligning courses with NCAE-C designations. As a part of this effort, MVSU generated a Cybersecurity track for their BS degree in Computer Science.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/30/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Demarcus&nbsp;M&nbsp;Thomas</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1820623/1820623_10548916_1667185353896_group--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1820623/1820623_10548916_1667185353896_group--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"CEH_Course_2019\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1820623/1820623_10548916_1667185353896_group--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"CEH_Course_2019\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This picture includes participants from the 2019 CEH class held at MSU.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">MSU</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Demarcus&nbsp;M&nbsp;Thomas</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">CEH_Course_2019</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1820623/1820623_10548916_1667186004540_mvsu_malware_class--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1820623/1820623_10548916_1667186004540_mvsu_malware_class--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Malware Analysis Course (MVSU)\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1820623/1820623_10548916_1667186004540_mvsu_malware_class--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Malware Analysis Course (MVSU)\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Photo from MVSU where MSU provided a malware analysis class to students in the Spring of 2022.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">MSU</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Demarcus&nbsp;M&nbsp;Thomas</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Malware Analysis Course (MVSU)</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
