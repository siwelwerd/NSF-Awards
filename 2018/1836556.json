 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advanced chemical sensors enable technologies such as point-of-care medical testing and personal protective equipment against chemical warfare agents. Increasing sophistication of the chemical sensors derives from advances in the materials used as the sensor or in studying existing materials with unusual properties. One such material is the commercial polymer, Nafion, which is used in electrolysis, mineral extraction, specialty chemical synthesis, electrochemical sensors, and fuel cells. The widespread use of Nafion is due to its unique chemical structure, which is comprised of a long hydrophobic (water repellent) backbone of fluorine and carbon atoms and hydrophilic (water loving) branches. These dual functionalities give rise to high chemical stability, high reactivity, and flexibility in the presence of water. The dual functionality also leads to unique transport of molecules through the material, particularly when fabricated into a thin membrane. Transport of small molecules within the Nafion membrane is well described by existing theories. However, transport of larger organic compounds, such as those found in chemical warfare agents, cannot be explained within existing theoretical frameworks, particularly when the water-induced flexibility of Nafion is considered. This project will use advanced experimental techniques to deduce transport of large organic molecules that are representative of chemical warfare agents through the dynamic Nafion membrane. \r\n\r\nThis project will develop a direct mechanistic understanding of water-enabled transport of organic molecules through Nafion membranes. Preliminary data suggests large organic molecules are effectively immobilized in a tertiary interphase region between hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains in dry Nafion. The source of this interphase is hypothesized to be the fluoroether linkage between the backbone and the perfluorosulfonic acid side chains. However, phenols and other weak organic acids remain immobilized under both dry and wet conditions. This project will probe the interphase, and the role of bulk sulfonated polystyrene copolymers on transport of large organic molecules in mixed solvent systems. An interdisciplinary team will employ small angle neutron scattering, X-ray scattering, and nuclear magnetic resonance at high magnetic fields. If successful, the proposed research will resolve the relationship between the structural and dynamic properties of the distinctly different domains in perfluorosulfonic acid and sulfonated polystyrene membranes. Specifically, the investigation will determine impact of domain morphology on the transport, immobilization, and reactivity of organic molecules. The project will support graduate education, create new teaching modules, and community outreach activities that demonstrate opportunities at the intersection of transport, catalysis and structure optimization of polymeric membranes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNafion is a versatile material with well-known macroscopic ion transport and catalytic properties.  This perflurosulfonic acid polymer has a unique phase-segregated morphology that has been applied for ion permselectivity in electrochemical processes such as fuel cells, chlor-alkali production, as well as the high volume synthesis of specialty chemicals.  Emerging applications include chemical sensors that enable point-of-care and non-invasive medical testing (diabetes, lung tissue permeability, cancer) as well personal protective equipment against agents such as those used in chemical warfare. \n\nDespite such widespread and long-term interest, little information existed prior to our current work on how Nafion\u2019s bulk morphology influences the local transport behavior of large organic molecules.  This information is essental to optimize the use Nafion in emerging applications..  For example, our earlier colorimetric sensing data on the loss of Nafion catalytic activity in the presence of water suggested that large organic molecules with amphiphilic character imbibe into a tertiary (perflouroether) interphase region between hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains in dry Nafion.  Even earlier small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data provided evidence for such incorporation in the case of various low molecular weight alcohols.  However, the implications of such structural effects on the local transport behavior were unknown at the time and only macroscopic transport measurements were available.  The present research project combined a number of sophisticated tools in chemical physics (SAXS, SANS, QENS, and pulsed-field gradient NMR) to probe the self-diffusivity of various species in Nafion in the presence of water.  New macroscopic permeability and sorption data has been generated utilizing customized apparatus in cases where none existed to assess the influence of microscopic effects on macroscopic transport.  The role of the perfluorether interphase region in PSA membranes on the transport of organic molecules in mixed solvent systems has thus been ascertained.\n\nOur work has shown that amphiphilic organic molecules follow primary transport pathways in Nafion that are different from those of water.  Specifically, unlike water, these molecules do not exhibit transport that is domain-size limited.  SANS, SAXS, and QENS data simultaneously indicate that these molecules are imbibed in the intercrystalline domains of Nafion as opposed to the more dispersed, hydrophilic domains which contain water. Of additional signifcance, co-diffusion of vanillic acid and acetone is found to further enhance this localized permselective nature of Nafion.
