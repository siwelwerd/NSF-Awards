 "awd_abstract_narration": "PART 1: NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nBlock copolymers are a unique class of long chain molecules (polymers) that are made up of two different chains (blocks) attached together at one of their ends.  If the blocks possess distinctly different chemical properties, then they may be capable of self-assembling into well-ordered physical structures that impart material properties that are very different, and often better, than the properties of the individual blocks alone.  Unfortunately, the chemical synthesis of block copolymers is generally much more complicated, energy intensive, and expensive compared to that employed in synthesizing a typical commodity polymer of just one block.  While polymer chemists have made remarkable progress in developing new ways to synthesize block copolymers, commercial success has been limited and often relegated to applications in high-cost fields such as advanced medical devices or semiconductor manufacture.  In this project, a new physical approach will be used to create blocky copolymers in a straightforward, economically-attractive fashion by selectively modifying specific sequences of units along the chains of commercially available polymers.  The breakthrough approach here involves performing chemistry in the gel state, whereby specific portions of the chains are essentially hidden from the modifying chemistry.  This research will provide significant advancements in accelerating the creation of tailored block copolymer assemblies and enhance fundamental insight toward next-generation membrane technologies.  With respect to the grand challenges facing our society, this project will provide cost-effective, readily available alternative materials needed to meet critical demands for water purification membranes, fuel cell membranes for clean energy conversion, and environmentally-friendly materials for the medical and healthcare industries.  The interdisciplinary nature of research activities in this project, ranging from pure chemistry to materials structure and properties, will provide a plethora of educational opportunities to a diverse community of students and researchers eager to contribute to our nation's leadership in a scientifically and technologically advanced society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART 2:  TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis project will focus on a new way to create blocky copolymers using straightforward, post polymerization chemistries on semi-crystalline homopolymers in the gel state. With reactions upon only the accessible amorphous chain segments within the semi-crystalline network, this new physical process yields a non-random, blocky incorporation of functionality, and is a simple alternative to the complex polymerization mechanisms that are conventionally employed in the synthesis of block copolymers. Building upon recent discoveries that semi-crystalline polymers, such as syndiotactic polystyrene and poly(ether ether ketone), can be brominated in the heterogeneous gel-state as a simple way to create blocky copolymers with tailored sequence distributions, this project aims to engage a wealth of substitution chemistries available with brominated aromatic templates to create a wide variety of new blocky copolymers as a means to systematically manipulate phase behavior and thus the formation of ordered morphologies with tailored properties.  In addition to the substitution chemistries, the morphological parameters of the semi-crystalline gel will be altered by controlled temperature, concentration, and solvent to precisely affect the sequences of functionalized and non-functionalized chain segments.  The grand challenge to be addressed in this project will be: Can we now direct the formation of ordered phase-separated domains, similar to that observed with conventional block copolymers, by tailoring the chemical composition of these new, gel-state functionalized, blocky copolymer systems? Membranes of the blocky copolymers will be architecturally tailored for energy conversion and water purification applications.  The interdisciplinary nature of research activities in this project, ranging from pure chemistry to materials structure and properties, will help to educate a diverse community of researchers, including underrepresented groups.  Educational outreach activities will engage citizens of all ages through the focus on cutting-edge research aimed at ensuring a healthier, more energy-efficient global society.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe overall goal of this project was to develop a simple way to synthesize functional copolymers (i.e., long chain molecules containing two different types of monomer units), where the units containing the functional groups are gathered in runs (blocks) along the chain and separated by unfunctionalized runs of crystallizable units.  The functional groups explored in this project have ranged from sulfonated units capable of transporting ions and water for energy applications to halogenated units capable of providing sites for further chemical substitutions (i.e., blocky templates for new polymers).  The resulting copolymers have a blocky distribution of comonomers and resemble a microstructure known as a block copolymer; yet our new approach does not require the complex controlled sequential copolymerization procedures conventionally used to make block copolymers.  In fact, the novel synthesis of blocky copolymers highlighted in this project does not involve any polymerization procedures.  Instead, we have developed a post-polymerization functionalization procedure conducted in a semi-crystalline gel state containing a network of polymer crystallites that are linked together by amorphous (non-crystalline) chain segments.  During the functionalization reaction, the reagents are not able to get inside the crystallites and are thus only capable of reacting with the open and accessible amorphous chains.  Consequently, the functional groups are distributed in blocks between unfunctionalized runs of segments originally residing in the crystals.  A key aspect of this project was to demonstrate that the blocky microstructure of the gel-state functionalized copolymers could be tailored by controlling the gel morphology (specifically the lamellar thickness of the polymer crystals).  Using various gelation solvents and thermal treatments in forming the semi-crystalline gels, we have shown by NMR characterization that the degree of blockiness is indeed correlated to lamellar thickness.\n\nIntellectual Merit:  In this project, we have demonstrated that blocky copolymers bearing sulfonated and halogenated units may be prepared from syndiotactic polystyrene (sPS), poly(arylether ketone) (PAEKs, e.g., PEEK and PEKK), as well as poly(phenylene sulfide) (PPS).  With our model system (sPS), we have developed a precise and quantitative NMR sequencing analysis coupled with computational simulations of the copolymer microstructure.  These powerful tools have provided critical insights into the degree of blockiness and crystallizability of the gel-state functionalized copolymers.  Matched sets of random and blocky copolymers from sPS and PEEK containing a wide range of functionalization have shown that the blocky microstructures preserve crystallizability as a \"memory\" of the original heterogeneous, semi-crystalline gel morphology.  Small-angle x-ray scattering experiments have shown that the mostly pure segments of the blocky copolymers are also capable of phase-separating from the functionalized segments in a manner similar to conventional block copolymers.  This behavior has led to new morphologies that provide enhanced proton conductivity in blocky sulfonated PEEK that is comparable to the benchmark Nafion (a metric never before obtained with conventionally sulfonated PEEK).  With blocky halogenated PEEK, we have shown that crystallizability can be preserved for extremely high degrees of functionalization (e.g., 170 mol%).  Multiple substitutions on a given monomer unit also lead to significant enhancements in the copolymer glass transition temperature, Tg.  Using computational modeling, this behavior has been attributed to steric restrictions in conformational freedom as the bulky halogens significantly raise the energy barrier for rotation about the substituted aryl ether bonds.\n\nBroader Impacts: As a means to systematically alter the gel morphology prior to blocky functionalization, this project has also focused efforts to discover new gelation solvents for a variety of crystallizable aromatic polymers.  We have discovered that diphenylacetone (DPA) is a new gelation solvent for PAEKs and PPS that is generally non-toxic (it is an FDA approved food grade additive), and it provides a very new gel morphology containing fibrillar crystallites with more control over lamellar thickness.  This new solvent has allowed our project to shift away from the use of toxic, environmentally-hazardous solvents toward \"greener\" processes in the sustainable synthesis of novel blocky copolymers.  This project has also stimulated fundamental studies of polymer-solvent interactions in the gelation of aromatic polymers, and the formation of lightweight hierarchical polymer aerogels with robust mechanical properties. \n\n            This project has resulted in the publication of 13 peer-reviewed journal articles.
