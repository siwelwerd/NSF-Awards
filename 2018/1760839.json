 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division supports the project by Professor Jonathan S. Lindsey. Professor Lindsey is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at North Carolina State University. He is developing methods to create chlorophylls and bacteriochlorophylls (molecules that nature used to harvest energy from light) in the laboratory from simple starting materials in a straightforward manner. The synthesis of (bacterio)chlorophylls has never been fully accomplished in this manner. The ability to build such molecules along with analogues will afford a much deeper understanding of energy flow in photosynthesis (an area that impacts biophysics, plant sciences, energy generation), the nature of metabolic breakdown products (an area that impacts ecology, global carbon balance), and the chemical properties of such compounds (an area that impacts nutrition, medicine).  The project mainly involves organic chemistry but will also impact diverse areas of science including understanding of photosynthesis. Thus, the project is well suited for the education and training of scientists in a collaborative environment.  Professor Lindsey's group is well-positioned to provide this experience for students underrepresented in science.  In addition, outreach activities involving North Carolina teachers will also be part of the funded project.  \r\n\r\n\r\nChlorophylls and bacteriochlorophylls are the chief pigments in photosynthetic organisms, including plants, cyanobacteria, and anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria.  The lack of synthetic methods for preparing (bacterio)chlorophylls and analogues constitutes an intellectual and technical deficit in the photosynthetic sciences.  The Lindsey lab proposes to fill this chasm by developing robust methods for synthesis of such valuable macrocycles.  The particular challenges in synthesizing (bacterio)chlorophylls include (1) the stereochemistry of substituents in the pyrroline ring(s), (2) the fifth (isocyclic) ring, and (3) substituents arrayed about the perimeter of the macrocycle. The intellectual merit of the work concerns the development of routes for the synthesis of the key photosynthetic pigments and analogues; the latter have broad impact (beyond the scope of the present grant) encompassing studies of quantum coherence in photosynthesis and catabolism in ecology.  A key outcome is a methodology in heterocyclic chemistry for preparing pyrroles, pyrrolines, dipyrromethanes, hydrodipyrrins, and phyllobilins relevant to the (bacterio)chlorophylls of photosynthesis.  The broader impacts entail professional development of middle and high school science teachers to improve teaching of photosynthesis (via a chlorophyll-based experiment) in schools and to inspire middle and high school students to STEM, thereby broadening the participation of underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nChlorophylls and bacteriochlorophylls are the chief pigments in photosynthetic organisms, including plants, cyanobacteria, and anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria.  The chemical synthesis of (bacterio)chlorophylls has never been fully accomplished from simple starting materials, although individual segments of the synthesis of chlorophyll a have been achieved.  The lack of synthetic methods for preparing (bacterio)chlorophylls and analogues in a straightforward manner constitutes an intellectual and technical deficit in the photosynthetic sciences.  The Lindsey group at NC State has been working to redress this deficiency by developing robust methods for synthesis of such valuable macrocycles.  The analogues ultimately sought (and their impact areas) will afford a much deeper understanding of energy flow in photosynthesis (biophysics, plant sciences), the nature of metabolic breakdown products (ecology, global carbon balance), and the properties of such compounds (nutrition, medicine).  The research will deepen our capabilities in fundamental chemistry, particularly of nitrogen-containing compounds, given that each (bacterio)chlorophyll contains four distinct nitrogen atoms.  With regards to intellectual merit, research to date has resulted in multiple advances including (1) conceptualization of a convergent, atom-economic joining of two halves of the molecule (AD and BC halves) to form the intact macrocycle, (2) introduction of stereodefined substituents for the all-critical ring D at early stage precursors, (3) introduction of substituents of the native macrocycles in rings A, C and E, and (4) in-depth characterization of the reaction conditions for the final joining process.  With regards to broader impacts, the research team has integrated the research objectives with education and outreach opportunities for middle-school students and their teachers.  The overall goal is to inspire and train the next generation of STEM innovators while fostering the value of photosynthetic science and research.  An experiment emphasizing the role of chlorophyll in photosynthesis (?green plants, red glow?) was developed in the research lab, tested in multiple middle schools (rich and poor alike), demoed at a teachers? conference, published in a leading journal for science teachers nationwide, and prepared in kit form for ultimate delivery to middle schools statewide.  The unifying theme of the intellectual merit and the broader impacts is to gain deeper insight and appreciation into the multiple roles of native chlorophylls and bacteriochlorophylls in photosynthesis.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/11/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jonathan S Lindsey"
