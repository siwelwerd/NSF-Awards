 "awd_abstract_narration": "The majority of cells in an organism contain the same DNA, and yet they are able to develop along different paths to achieve different functions and phenotypes. The cell type identity is defined, at least in part, by the specific regions of the genome that are transcribed from DNA to RNA.  Transcription is the basic cellular process that creates the RNA intermediate that either codes for proteins, mRNAs, or regulates other processes, producing various non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) like enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). Both types of transcript cell differentiation paths or cellular responses to environmental influences. RNA polymerases are the enzymes that produce RNA transcripts, such as mRNAs and ncRNAs, and they exist in cells either as molecules that are maintain their association with the DNA template or are released being transported away from the DNA and acted on by other cellular machinery. One complication to analyzing the transcription process is that genes can overlap, so the presence of a polymerase and a nascent RNA transcript might indicate activity of either gene using current methodologies. Since RNA transcripts have a high propensity to fold into three dimensional shapes they that can affect the downstream processes, both sequence and shape of the nascent RNA are important characteristics of nascent transcripts still associated with DNA as well as the RNA transcripts that are released from the DNA. Only recently have high throughput nascent transcription assays become available; these allow researchers to assess the activity of cellular polymerases directly. This project seeks to develop an integrated analysis framework for nascent transcription data.  Critically, changes in the shapes or levels of transcripts provide information as to how mutations, or other perturbations, have affected an RNA polymerase's functional properties.  Understanding the detailed molecular basis of transcription is critical to many research areas including biochemistry, molecular biology and computational biology. As such, careful attention will be paid to the development of educational and computational resources to support of the larger community. \r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this project is to develop of an integrated framework for the interpretation and analysis of nascent transcription. This project leverages a mathematical model of RNA polymerase II that, when fit to nascent transcription data, quantitatively characterizes not only the levels but also the shapes of all transcripts genome-wide.   Specifically, this project has 4 overarching goals, as follows:  Leverage patterns of differential nascent transcription to identify overlapping transcripts; detection of overlapping transcription at regulatory regions like enhancers may provide insight into how such ncRNAs function. Capture termination of transcription within a principled mathematical model of polymerase behavior; the algorithm developed here will inform on the conflicting hypotheses about how transcription termination occurs. Identify the impact of technical choices, such as protocol selection and sequencing depth, on the detection and characterization of transcripts, thereby recommending best practice in nascent transcription studies. Enable broader adoption of nascent transcription analysis through construction of an educational module that supports the use of these computational tools; the module will encompass the software, websites, and user documentation.  In summary, the research proposed here will provide an unprecedented perspective on differences in transcription characteristics at individual genes and how perturbations affect them.  By quantifying alterations in transcription at individual genes and their magnitude, the end result of this project will be an integrated framework for the interpretation of nascent transcription.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe first readout of the genome is transcription.  Despite years of studies into expression, these studies have not focused on transcription -- as nearly all expression studies focus on RNA-seq, a steady state measure of RNA.   Steady state measures of RNA are influenced by not only transcription but also RNA decay rates.  Luckily, nascent transcription assays more directly assay true transcription, e.g. what RNA is actively associated with cellular RNA polymerases.   Thus, nascent transcription assays are proving to be critical to understanding transcriptional regulation.   \n\n \n\nThe goal of this project was to improve on our existing model of RNA polymerase II activity which we fit to nascent transcription data -- providing unprecedented readouts on the activity of RNA polymerase II in response to cellular perturbations.   For this work we focused on three key aspects of nascent transcription analysis: (1) improving the model to capture and characterize RNA polymerase II termination; (2) identify the impact of protocol selection, sequencing depth, normalization, and analysis tool selection on the identification of transcribed regulatory elements (also known as enhancer associated RNAs); and (3) develop a series of educational modules and associated resources to simplify nascent transcription analysis.  We also examined the possibility of using a large repository of nascent transcription assays to identify sites of same strand overlapping transcription within the underlying population of cells.\n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nImprovements to the RNA polymerase II mathematical models were ongoing throughout the duration of the grant.  We both improved method of using our existing model (no termination, the Tfit model) on a variety of datasets and developed an improved mathematical model for RNA polymerase II activity that includes a model for termination (LIET).   Testing and deployment of these models were used in studies of TFIIH and TFIID, fundamental components of RNA polymerase II.   Additionally, the improved models were instrumental in understanding how perturbations (growth conditions, drug exposure, differentiation, condition changes) alter upstream regulatory proteins (transcription factors). \n\n \n\nAdditionally, we build a large cohesive repository of published nascent transcription data that was leveraged for two purposes: (a) to assess the impact of various experimental choices on transcribed regulatory element (TRE) detection and (b) to determine best practices in nascent transcription analysis.  Using the repository, we determined that several protocol specific variations in individual TREs exist.  We also compared several methods of TRE detection and developed improved analysis pipelines (Nextflow) that leverage the best practices for these methods.   Finally, we have explored new methods of normalization within and across nascent transcription data sets.   A website supporting the repository is being actively developed.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nOur broader impacts focused on making nascent transcription analysis easier for scientists which we accomplished through a combination of activities.  First, we improved the documentation (both programmer and user) for our nascent transcription analysis tools (Tfit, FStitch, and TFEA).   We also now provide Docker instances for these algorithms.  Additionally, we have developed Nextflow pipelines to assist in both the upstream (quality control and mapping) and typical analysis steps (Tfit, others).   Second, we coupled these technical improvements with a \"best practices\" paper to be published in Methods in Enzymology.  Third, we developed a hands-on workshop oriented educational module that we incorporated into our two-week summer workshop on short read sequence analysis. The materials for the workshop (instructional videos, class slides, worksheets, homework examples, and additional information) are available online.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/20/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robin D Dowell"
