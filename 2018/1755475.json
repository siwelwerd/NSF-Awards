 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Antarctic Broadcasts: Broader Impacts Through Telepresence (ABBITT) project is a pilot project that has the potential to greatly improve education activities related to NSF-funded Antarctic research. The project will test technologies that have been developed for ship to shore transmissions in a region where they have not been used - extreme southern latitudes - and test the delivery of broader impact activities using this technology while at-sea onboard the R/V Lawrence M. Gould (LMG) and from the U.S. Palmer Field Station, located on the Antarctic peninsula. The LMG has a new ship's satellite antenna that should be capable of the broadcast quality service, but it has not been tested for this use. The Inner Space Center (ISC) at the University of Rhode Island's Graduate School of Oceanography is a leader in developing ship-to-shore telepresence technologies - communications technology that optimizes live video, audio, and data transmissions via advanced satellite and terrestrial networks that link remote locations to the rest of the world. The ISC serves research expeditions aboard several ships in the U.S. research fleet, as well as several privately owned research vessels. The ISC facility includes a fully equipped broadcast studio that allows for the production of professional quality programming and live, interactive broadcasts. The PIs propose to test this equipment aboard the LMG and at Palmer Station. They will test the system and produce live interactive broadcasts from the ship that will be delivered to the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) during the testing phase.\r\n\r\nA new  combination of technologies that have not been previously used in the Antarctic will be tested, including a Mobile Telepresence Unit (MTU) and a new shipboard antenna on the LMG. University of Rhode Island scientists will configure the MTU for the ship and install it in the shipboard laboratory. This system will integrate with the new Fleet XPress satellite telecommunication system and should be sufficient for video broadcasting and sending produced video clips ashore to be cut in during the outreach programs. Broadcasts will be conducted from the ship and from Palmer Station in Antarctica when weather and satellite footprints allow connection to the U.S. These broadcasts will be aired in the Q'rius Center auditorium at the Smithsonian NMNH, which has seating for about 100 museum visitors. The new capability supported by this award will expand options for communications from the Antarctic and Southern Ocean, providing additional capacity for both research and education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The project tested this technology, which has been developed and used throughout the lower latitudes for ship-to-shore transmissions and live, interactive broadcasts, in a region where it has not been previously used - extreme southern latitudes. The project also tested the delivery of live, interactive broadcasts using this technology from sea onboard the ARSV&nbsp;<em>Laurence M. Gould&nbsp;</em>(LMG) and from Palmer Station. The ISC is a world leader in developing ship-to-shore telepresence technologies, providing advanced satellite communications technology that optimizes live video, audio, and data transmissions using satellite and terrestrial networks that link remote locations to the rest of the world.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The ISC team designed, installed, and tested a mobile telepresence unit (MTU) on the LMG while the ship was stationed in Punta Arenas, Chile and as it transited across the Southern Ocean to Palmer Station during the 2019-20 field season. The MTU is a portable system consisting of devices that allow multiple audio/video inputs for routing, switching, mixing, and encoding of transmissions. The system also contains an audio intercom system for two-way voice communications between location on the ship, to the ISC, and to other designated locations across the globe. One project goal was to determine if the ISC's MTU could work within the constraints of the ship's own satellite system and the low angle of satellite reception in the Antarctic region. Once the system was proven to be operational, the next goal was to determine if the system could be used to conduct live programming within a bandwidth high enough to successfully engage public audiences in real time from the ship. The ISC was able to design a MTU that effectively met the two main pilot project goals. The system provided the capability for the ISC team members and scientists on the ship and staff at Palmer Station to conduct engaging live, interactive broadcasts with public audiences to increase awareness and understanding of the changing Antarctic region and the NSF research being conducted there. The ISC team was able to determine the technical capacities of the system so that further live, interactive broadcasts could be a viable model for future Antarctic research broader impact activities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As proposed, broadcasts were successfully conducted with audiences at the Smithsonian Institution Natural Museum of Natural History. The ISC team was able to go beyond what was originally proposed to also conduct live, interactive broadcasts for classrooms, additional museum and zoo venues, and for the general public via Facebook Live. During the LMG's roundtrip transit between Punta Arenas, Chile and Antarctica, as well as while the ship was stationed at Anvers Island, Antarctica, 11 live interactions to classrooms, museum and zoo venues, and meetings took place.&nbsp;This was the first time live, interactive broadcasts were conducted from the LMG. During these 25-minute live interactions, scientists, technicians, and Palmer Station's staff members communicated about NSF-funded Antarctic research, technology and tools used to explore the Antarctic, and daily life in this remote region. Participants in the live broadcasts were able to ask questions of polar scientists \"face-to-face\" in real time. The project was successful in designing an MTU that could work in high southern latitudes and in delivering live interactions that reached close to 6,000 individuals during this pilot project. Audiences learned about the changing Antarctic, Palmer Station, the LMG, and currently funded NSF Antarctic research, therefore extending the capacity of the LMG to make connections between polar scientists and non-experts during future expeditions. In addition, the ISC team produced a technical guide for NSF, ship, and Antarctic technical personnel that describes how to optimally use a shipboard satellite system for telepresence transmissions in the Antarctic region.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/29/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Gail&nbsp;A&nbsp;Scowcroft</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1755475/1755475_10579847_1588099176064_IMG_7480--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1755475/1755475_10579847_1588099176064_IMG_7480--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Shipboard Live Interactions\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1755475/1755475_10579847_1588099176064_IMG_7480--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Shipboard Live Interactions\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Scientists, technicians, and Palmer Station\ufffds staff members communicated about NSF-funded Antarctic research, technology and tools used to explore the Antarctic, and daily life in this remote region during 11 live interactions.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Inner Space Center</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Gail&nbsp;A&nbsp;Scowcroft</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Shipboard Live Interactions</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1755475/1755475_10579847_1588099294169_73364127_2821734574505531_2232992302219919360_o--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1755475/1755475_10579847_1588099294169_73364127_2821734574505531_2232992302219919360_o--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Behind the Scenes Shipboard Live Interaction\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1755475/1755475_10579847_1588099294169_73364127_2821734574505531_2232992302219919360_o--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Behind the Scenes Shipboard Live Interaction\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A look behind the scenes of a live broadcast from the LMG.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Inner Space Center</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Gail&nbsp;A&nbsp;Scowcroft</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Behind the Scenes Shipboard Live Interaction</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1755475/1755475_10579847_1588099569692_IMG_22363--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1755475/1755475_10579847_1588099569692_IMG_22363--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Behind the Scenes- Inner Space Center\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1755475/1755475_10579847_1588099569692_IMG_22363--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Behind the Scenes- Inner Space Center\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A look behind the scenes at the University of Rhode Island\ufffds Inner Space Center (ISC).
