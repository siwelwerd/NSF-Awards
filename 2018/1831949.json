 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will develop a new tool for the analysis of in situ indican precursor in indigo plants, which when combined with genomic analysis and genetic linkage mapping in selectively bred indigo crops, will lead to high indican yielding breeding parental lines and ultimately competitively price natural indigo dye.  Additionally, characterization of genetic markers will accelerate further crop improvement by understanding and harnessing the genes crucial to indican synthesis and other aspects of significance to overall indigo yield. These advancements will benefit customers, denim mills, by leading to a more reliable, lower cost plant-derived indigo supply. The success of this multiphase STTR project will enable a cost-competitive, cleaner, and more sustainable denim dyeing process, while greatly expanding the market for domestically produced natural indigo.  Commercialization of a more consistent and higher yielding US-grown indigo plant that produces high purity indigo powder can replace the current standard of synthetic, imported indigo powder. While in demand by the marketplace today, plant-derived indigo is currently only used in premium denim products due to the high cost per pound resulting from low yields per plant per acre. The direct result of this research will be to open new market segments and expand existing market penetration for US-grown and manufactured biobased indigo for the textile industry, an addressable market of $1.86B. The methods and technology developed through this project have a direct path to the commercial marketplace and the industry is ready to support biobased textile dyes such as plant-derived indigo.\r\n\r\nDuring this project, reference genome resources will be constructed for indigo feedstock crops, F1 mapping populations will be constructed for P. tinctoria, I. tinctoria, and I. suffruticosa varieties, and design of the handheld rapid assay device will be validated through laboratory analysis. The reference genome for I. suffruticosa will be built using Pacific Biosciences SMRT sequencing and assembly.  In addition to this reference genome, whole-genome resequencing will be performed on available I. suffruticosa and I. tinctoria varieties.  Nucleotide variation and variant effect prediction will be made between the Indigofera-based indigo varieties.  This variation will be used to develop markers to evaluate intervarietal crosses. Controlled greenhouse crosses of three species will be made to create F1 mapping populations for use in constructing a genetic map and linkage mapping, in combination with the resources developed.  Intraspecies varieties exhibiting distinct phenotypic traits of commercial interest or notable dye yield differences will be selected for crossing to generate the F1 populations. Results from laboratory-based fluorometry equipment will be evaluated for efficacy and then compared against extractive indigo dye analysis from the leaf biomass.  A final prototype will be constructed based on these findings and validated through use in the laboratory and in the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project addresses the development of plant based indigo dye as a natural, sustainable and chemically-identical alternative to synthetic indigo dye derived from non-renewable and carcinogenic chemical reagents.  While indigo was once a high-value crop important to global trade, little modern research had been performed relating to crop improvement with regard to breeding and genetics and the resultant impact on dye yield, dye quality, and cost of production.  During this project, researchers were able to establish major gains in genomic mapping, rapid tissue assay and scoring, genetic marker development, and trait heritability; ultimately resulting in plant population improvement of over 300% with regard to indigo dye precursor accumulation per mass of leaf tissue.  This greatly improved dye yield has not only dramatically lowered the cost of production and improved market acceptance by elite brands, but it has also resulted in the significantly higher average dye purity as the ratio of indigo dye to plant-derived byproducts has increased.  In recent years, this has led to the commercialization not only of high performing natural indigo as a drop-in replacement for synthetic indigo in the textile and fashion market, but more notably the development and commercial launch of the first pre-reduced natural indigo in partnership with a market-leading commercial partner, but also the development of an ultra-high purity natural indigo suitable for use in the rapidly-growing natural food colorant market.  \n\nRoughly 150 million pounds of synthetic indigo is produced every year, largely for the use in textiles.  This synthetic indigo is derived from harmful and carcinogenic reactants including benzene, aniline, formaldehyde, and cyanide in an environmentally unsustainable process.  The technical advancements realized through this project have allowed for natural indigo to compete more closely with its synthetic counterpart, as the genetic gains provide higher product yield per plant compounded by lower batch production and agricultural costs of per pound of dye.  Commercially this has led not only to increased sales in the traditional denim market, with customers including Levi\u2019s, Wrangler, and Patagonia; but also directly to the development of a pre-reduced natural indigo (PRNI) product through partnership with global dye leader Archroma.  This product has not previously been technically achievable using natural indigo due to the traditionally low and inconsistent purity of the crude product.  This product is targeted toward elite and environmentally conscious textile mills at a higher pricepoint, and has been pre-sold for all production campaigns.\n\nAn initial key outcome of the project was the development of a non-destructive germplasm assay capable of quantitating the level of dye precursor in the plant tissue &ndash; and this in turn enabled both validation of precursor concentration as a heritable trait as well as rapid mass assay of nursery crops for mass selection.  The resulting strategy of mass-assay, culling low-performing individuals, and encouraging mass in-field crossing of high-performing genetics through pollinators in turn resulted in more than a doubling of precursor content and ultimately dye-yield in four generations of using this tool.  A second area of focus was built around the development of a de novo genome for the indigo crop Indigofera suffruticosa.  This first-available genome for I. suffruticosa was key to assessing loci of interest related to glycosyl transferases and glucosidases, and established target locations for genetic marker development.  Ultimately, three key genetic markers were developed which were highly correlative with indigo dye precursor concentration.  These three markers were then applied to an assay of 72 different accessions of I. suffruticosa which were sourced from seed repositories around the world and grown out in nursery plots in tropical zone of Florida.  65 of the 72 accessions were shown to carry one of the two identified variants of each of the three markers, and in assessing the combined marker triplet, the number of high-performing variants in each triplet correlated positively with the level of dye precursor possessed.  This combination of tools &ndash; genetic marker screening at the greenhouse seedling level, followed by leaf tissue assay at the field level &ndash; will provide a highly beneficial platform from which to continue improving indigo crop germplasm for the production of natural indigo dye as a bio-based specialty chemical.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/21/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Shawn Genung"
