 "awd_abstract_narration": "The effect of invasive species is thought to be second only to habitat destruction as a threat to biodiversity. The spread of invasive species is a major problem in spatial ecology, and there is a large body of literature on understanding this spread. However, there is far less work on the actual eradication and control of invasive species once invasion has occurred. Currently, there are only a few conclusive eradication measures for aquatic invasive species. The Trojan Y-Chromosome (TYC) strategy is an eradication strategy with the advantage of targeting only the invasive species in question, while protecting native species. The PIs will develop an experimentally tested mathematical model of the TYC strategy. The computational and theoretical analysis of the mathematical model will inform experimental biologists about the viability of the TYC strategy and provide crucial insight into the spatial-temporal population dynamics associated with the TYC strategy and other phenomena associated with such control efforts. Ultimately results of the project will guide experimental research at the USGS Wetland and Aquatic Research Center in Gainesville, Florida.\r\n\r\nThe TYC strategy is a biological control that introduces a sub-population of genetically modified males with YY chromosomes in order that their offspring are guaranteed to be male. The object of the introduction is to skew the sex ratio in the invasive population to be strongly male biased, driving down the female population density, and ultimately leading to extinction. In developing Peocilia reticulata (guppy fish) YY-males in the laboratory, mesocosm experiments can be conducted that examine the interaction, dynamics, fecundity, and viability of the TYC strategy. The experimental data will then be used to develop the relevant parameter space and refine, verify, and validate reaction diffusion models of the TYC strategy. In addition, numerical designs and implementation procedures will be developed to provide a reliable platform to efficiently simulate the system of partial differential equations that incorporate features such as cross and self-diffusion, non-smooth initial datum, temperature effects and life history traits such as cannibalism. This research and its results will advance our understanding of the use of flexible and reversible passive efforts to eradicate and control invasive species, as modeled via both weakly coupled and strongly coupled reaction diffusion systems.",

The spread of invasive species is a major problem in spatial ecology, including the actual eradication and control of invasive species once invasion has occurred. To this end there are two broad methods of control. Chemical control, such as the use of insecticides, and biological control, where a secondary species is introduced to curb the growth of the invasive species. This could be an introduced predator, to depredate on a pest species, or a modified organism, introduced to manipulate the mating system of an invasive species. </span></p>\n<p><span>This project aimed to investigate the Trojan Y-Chromosome strategy.

We have shown that the classical Trojan Y-Chromosome model has solutions that can blow-up in finite time, for certain initial numbers of the invasive population. This makes the classical model biologically irrelevant in certain regimes. Various model corrections have been proposed, that do possess bounded solutions, and hence are biologically relevant. We have also shown mathematically that there are ways to mimic the TYC strategy without a YY male present. This can be done per se by harvesting females and stocking males. As opposed to pure harvesting, that would harvest both females and males. This direction has been supported experimentally at the United State Geological Survey, Wetland and Aquatic Research Center in Gainesville, Florida. What has also been experimentaly ascertained is that harvesting both males and females, interestingly leads to a \"hydra\" effect - where increasing the mortality rate of a population, counterintuitively increases the population density. We have also shown that considering Allee effects, can completely change the threshold between extinction and recovery of the invasive species. This threshold is known as the \"extinction boundary\". Our results show that female harvesting and male stocking, in conjunction with Allee effects can change the shape of this boundary, facilitating far better control of the invasive species. Note, the&nbsp;Trojan Y-Chromosome strategy is currently in practice in Idaho, where YY males for the invasive Brook trout have been released in several rivers and streams in Idaho. This is being supplemented by harvesting and stocking. Thus the modeling efforts of this project, will continue to guide and inform such field trials as well.</p>\n<p>The project has led to the training of 3 PhD students, one female and two from groups underrepresented in the mathematical sciences, and several undergraduate students, spanning the states of Iowa, New York, Wisconsin and Texas. Via our research experience for undergraduates program, a number of undergraduate students associated with the project have been motivated to pursue STEM careers in industry, graduate school as well as high school science teaching. Our results have led to 12 journal publications, and have been disseminated via several local, national, and international conferences, as well as broad audience scientific talks.
