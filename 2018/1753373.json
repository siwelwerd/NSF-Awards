 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many stars smaller and cooler than the Sun have planets; such stars are by far the most numerous in our Galaxy.  Because the stars are relatively dim and their gravity relatively weak, detecting planets close enough to the star support life is easier around these stars.  The investigator will use theoretical modeling to study the diversity of climates that may exist on extrasolar worlds.  She will produce a database of likely surface conditions, depending on whether the surface of the planet is covered with water, soil, or salt. This database will be of use to investigators studying newly discovered planets for signs of life.  She will expand upon a program, Rising Stargirls, that she has already created to strengthen the interest of middle-school girls from underrepresented groups in science.  She will conduct monthly workshops for girls and help train educators to facilitate workshops in their own communities.\r\n\r\nThe proposed program will incorporate atmospheric science, orbital and climate dynamics, surface geology and glaciology, and numerical modeling with the goal of building a qualitative pathway to the most rigorous evaluations of candidates for habitable planets beyond the Solar System.  The major factors to be considered are surface albedo (various proportions of water, water ice, land, and salt), atmospheric composition, and planetary rotation rate.  The PI will use two different Global Climate Models to run the climate simulations.  The systems of Proxima Centauri, TRAPPIST-1e, and LHS-1140b will be used at testbeds to apply the methods developed here to new planets discovered with TESS.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

During the life of this CAREER award, my team used a hierarchy of computer climate models to explore and quantify the effects on climate and habitability of the interaction between the light from different types of stars and a range of surface compositions possible on exoplanets, including hydrohalite (sea ice with a highly reflective salt crust on top), carbon dioxide ice that may form on distant or eccentric exoplanets (planets with highly elongated orbits), and different types of land surfaces. We've also quantified the impact of land fraction on planetary habitability, the effect of eccentricity on the fraction of a planet's orbit over which it exhibits above-freezing surface temperatures for liquid water, and the effects of a host star's spectrum on a planet's global energy budget - how it's star's light is distributed or \"budgeted\" throughout a planet's atmosphere and surface\". We've also identified a previously unexplored climatic regime possible for planets orbiting cooler, smaller, \"M\" and \"K\" stars with one side permanently facing their host star (the day side) and the other side permanently facing away (the night side). We determined that this new regime, which we call, \"Terminator Habitability\", in which such planets may be too hot on the day side, too cold on the night side, and only habitable along the dividing line between the two inhospitable sides, the \"terminator\", is stable for planets with limited water inventories, and less so for water-dominated planets. I also wrote a review paper on my field of exoplanet climatology - the first in the field. The canon of data and papers our team has generated will help to connect the theoretical and observational exoplanet communities, and aid in prioritizing planets to follow up on with next-generation instrumentation to look for signs of life in their atmospheres or on their surfaces.</p>\n<p>My NSF-supported broader impacts work has focused on developing my program Rising Stargirls, which integrates creative strategies such as free writing, visual art, and theater exercises into a traditional astronomy education for middle-school girls from backgrounds traditionally underrepresented in the sciences, into a global program. During the lifetime of this award we've facilitated workshops for hundreds of girls and educators from across the US, and Canada, Europe, India, Pakistan, Nigeria, and South America. The Rising Stargirls Teaching and Activity Handbook has been translated into Spanish, and we generated a COVID-19 virtual version to aid educators in implementing Rising Stargirls activities online during the COVID-10 pandemic while face-to-face workshops are not possible. The handbook has been downloaded from the Rising Stargirls website by 816 people in 38 countries across seven continents to date.
