 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interplay of tectonics and climate is an essential aspect of mountain landscape evolution. Research efforts focusing on the interactions of mountain landscapes with climate and tectonism, especially those directed toward quantitative reconstructions of climatically and tectonically driven disturbances, are fundamental to understanding the past and future evolution of Earth's surface, and are critical for human adaptation and resource conservation efforts. This project focuses on the Teton mountain range in Grand Teton National Park, WY, where past climatic and tectonic disturbances are unusually well-recorded by glacial landforms, fault scarps, and lake sediment archives, all of which can be precisely dated. \r\n\r\nThe overarching goals of this project are to quantify the influences of tectonic-driven disturbances (earthquakes, landslides) and climate-driven changes and disturbances (e.g. deglaciation, glacier fluctuations, vegetative shifts, fire occurrence) on alpine erosion rates and landscape evolution operating during the late Pleistocene and Holocene (past 25 ka). Specifically, the study combines detailed landform mapping, 10Be surface exposure dating, paleoseismic fault trenching, lake seismic surveys, and lake sediment cores to develop complementary records of: i) glacier fluctuations, including the timing and character of deglaciation and Neoglaciation; ii) environmental variability along the elevation gradient of the Teton range; and iii) earthquake timing and frequency related to postglacial ruptures of the Teton fault. The highly-active tectonic setting, distinctive geomorphology, and relatively pristine ecosystem of the Tetons present an exceptional opportunity for this research. Moreover, the integration of these techniques will provide comprehensive insights into the couplings and feedbacks among climatic and tectonic processes that modify all mountain landscapes over diverse length and time scales.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project is one of three components of a collaborative effort to understand the recent history of the Teton fault and its influences on mountain uplift and erosion processes in the Teton Range of western Wyoming and eastern Idaho.  The broader collaborative project has included studies of earthquake disturbance and the sedimentation history in Teton Range lakes, dating of glacial landforms to determine longer-term fault offset rates on the range front, and results of faulting history from postglacial fault scarp analysis and fault trenching (this report).  \n\nPaleoseismic trenches were excavated across fault scarps at Antelope Flats, on the east side of Jackson Hole, and at Ski Lake, where a scarp of the Phillips Canyon fault lies several kilometers into the range from the topographic range front.  At Antelope Flat, two trenches revealed evidence of a single fault rupture between approximately 21,000 and 14,000 years ago. At the Ski Lake site in the southern end of the Teton Range, a fault scarp trench revealed evidence of two ruptures since deglaciation, between 7,400 and 5,900 years ago for the earlier event and between 4400 and 3900 years ago for the most recent event.  These events correlate with the two most recent rupture events documented at a 2017 trench on the main fault scarp near Teton Village.  Through correlations such as these, the Antelope Flats and Ski Lake trench results can be compared with other trench project results at Leigh Lake, Steamboat Mountain, and Granite Creek to evaluate the length of fault rupture, and thus determine likely magnitudes of earthquakes, during rupture events during the 10,000 years or more.\n\nThis project has provided broader societal benefits through geosciences workforce training and through professional dissemination pathways and public science communications.  It has directly supported four graduate and undergraduate students and has indirectly supported several other students, interns, and young professionals at other institutions.  Project findings have been disseminated through public science engagement via the Geologists of Jackson Hole community group, other public science venues, courses at Idaho State University, and regional and national news articles.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/27/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Glenn D Thackray"
