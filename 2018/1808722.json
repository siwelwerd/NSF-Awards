This third workshop in the series will bring together experts from around the world in the field of cosmic rays, solar energetic particles, and space radiation with an additional focus on their propagation inside the heliosphere and their interaction with the Earth's magnetosphere.  The workshop aims to advance present understanding of the radiation environment in the near-Earth space by combining various observations of energetic particles with theory and numerical modeling.  Therefore, the project supports the goals of the National Space Weather Action Plan.",
