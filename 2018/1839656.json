 "awd_abstract_narration": "As computing has become integral to the practice of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), the STEM+Computing program seeks to address emerging challenges in computational STEM areas through the applied integration of computational thinking and computing activities within STEM teaching and learning in early childhood education through high school (preK-12).  This project is supported by the STEM+C program and advances its mission by integrating computational thinking, data literacy, and statistical concepts with a field-based STEM curriculum model for middle school students that focuses on science fields associated with habitat monitoring and restoration. This integration will be accomplished through: (1) Expansion and further development of Restoration Hubs in and near the water of New York Harbor that support field science experiences; (2) Professional learning opportunities for teachers that feature integration of computational thinking with other STEM disciplines; (3) Development of curriculum units that promote learning of computer science and data science concepts and skills, and raise awareness of education pathways to careers in computing, data sciences, and habitat restoration sciences; and (4) A summer STEM Institute for computer science and computing.\r\n\r\nThis project will augment a large-scale design and development project that is testing a model of community-based science education in an urban environment.  The existing curriculum model focuses on key concepts in the geological, environmental, and biological sciences that are associated with monitoring environmental conditions and habitat restoration. This project will enhance the existing model by integrating data literacy, computational thinking and relevant statistical concepts and skills into the existing curriculum, enabling students to gain new skills and competencies associated with gathering and analyzing large amounts of field data associated with environmental monitoring and habitat restoration. Data to be analyzed range from basic water chemistry data to data associated with bacterial monitoring and environmental DNA sampling and analyses.  The research associated with this project is guided by three hypotheses: (1) Teacher professional learning in data literacy, computer science, and STEM practices will positively influence student outcomes within their classrooms; (2) Teaching informed by teacher professional learning in data literacy, computer science, and science research practices, coupled with teacher and student engagement with scientists will positively influence student knowledge of computational thinking and perceptions of STEM fields and careers; and (3) The project's model of engagement, including problem-based learning, will enhance student awareness of and intent to pursue education pathways to STEM careers. A variety of measures will be used with teachers and students in treatment and comparison groups to test these hypotheses.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

By involving students in the ecological restoration of New York Harbor, the data collection experience demonstrates the observance of improved water quality and the direct impact ecological monitoring has on society. This project achieved building student research skills using a STEM+C five-pillar model: teacher training models; student curriculum development; digital platform data depository; Summer STEM Institute; and community-based restoration science hubs.</p>\n<p>The BOP CCERS aimed to connect teaching and learning to the restoration of New York Harbor, but also provide an opportunity for underserved students to gain access to STEM knowledge. The logic behind CCERS is based on the idea learning is more meaningful and motivating when connected to a specific personal local community issue and that science is learned best by doing as an exploratory field. This problem-based learning drives the conceptual framework of this project because it creates a community of learners who benefit from access to each other&rsquo;s thinking, learning, and discovery. These experiences, guided by trained teachers and mentors from the program, provided students with the support needed to develop their own science self-efficacy, which can shape what type of career a student pursues in the future. This created enhanced education and career outcomes for K-12 students who have historically also been underrepresented in STEM fields.</p>\n<p>The project has three strategic research questions:</p>\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How does the CCERS STEM+C project influence science self-efficacy and technological ability among students?</p>\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does improved technological ability explain the project influence on science self-efficacy?</p>\n<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How does the CCERS STEM+C project influence students&rsquo; interest in STEM careers?</p>\n<p>These questions guided the development and implementation of all project activities and subsequent evaluation.</p>\n<p>Project Pillars:</p>\n<p>Pillar 1: Teacher Trainings with Computer Science, Data Science and STEM Career Exploration</p>\n<p>Pillar 2: Student Curriculum with Computer Science, Data Science and STEM Career Exploration</p>\n<p>Pillar 3: Digital Platform</p>\n<p>Pillar 4: Summer STEM Institute for middle and high school students at Pace University</p>\n<p>Pillar 5: Community-Based Restoration STEM Hubs</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Achievements and Outcomes from BOP CCERS</span></strong></p>\n<p>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Creation of the BOP CCERS Digital Platform</strong></p>\n<p>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Establishment the BOPCCERS Ecosystem Teaching and Learning STEM Model; Replicable in other locale with various species</strong></p>\n<p>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Middle and High School Curriculum on Real World, Field-Based Learning</strong></p>\n<p>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Environmental Science Publication of Field Science Manual for Oyster Restoration</strong></p>\n<p>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Construction of BOP CCERS Community Exhibits</strong></p>\n<p>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>44 Scholarly Journal Publications</strong></p>\n<p>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>58 Conference Presentations</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>BOP CCERS STEM+C Project White Paper</strong></p>\n<p>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Establishing a modality to engage students within inquiry-based learning through restoration science thus increasing the quality of STEM + C teaching and learning</strong></p>\n<p>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Providing NYCDOE </strong><strong>teachers </strong><strong>with the necessary </strong><strong>training </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>tools </strong><strong>that will stimulate students interest in STEM Careers and Industry fields</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Increasing students&rsquo; knowledge of STEM careers through experiential teaching and learning within New York Harbor</strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Research Findings</span></strong></p>\n<p>It is hypothesized that students who participated in the problem based, hands-on CCERS activities that incorporated technology and computational thinking will show a higher level of self-efficacy compared to students who did not participate in the CCERS activities. In turn, self-efficacy would be positively associated with interest in pursuing STEM careers, thereby showing higher levels of STEM career interest among CCERS students compared to non-CCERS students.</p>\n<p>Results show support for the study&rsquo;s hypotheses. Students who participated in CCERS activities show a higher level of confidence in their scientific observations, inquiries, and communication compared to students who did not participate in the CCERS activities. Additionally, CCERS students had higher technological ability scores than non-CCERS students, and this explained some of the project's influence on science self-efficacy. Lastly, the program's influence on technological ability and science self-efficacy is related to students' career interest. The results of these analyses seem to hold for URM students when there is enough data to perform the analysis, meaning the results may be equitably distributed throughout the student population. The results show that the CCERS STEM+C program may be a part of the pipeline to bring students into STEM.</p>\n<p>In addition, there is evidence that the CCERS program impacts awareness. This seems to be a direct result of Pillar 1: Teacher Trainings, as one of the pillar's goals was for teachers to increase student engagement and learning in oyster restoration research, and interest in STEM careers. Additionally, teachers predicted that students&rsquo; awareness of STEM careers would increase because of participating in the BOP activities, as they were acting as scientists themselves and were collecting and working with computer data, a prediction that is supported by the data.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 04/24/2024<br>\nModified by: Lauren&nbsp;B&nbsp;Birney</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1839656/1839656_10582678_1702150261855_Field_based_Learning--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1839656/1839656_10582678_1702150261855_Field_based_Learning--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"BOP CCERS Field Based Learning\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1839656/1839656_10582678_1702150261855_Field_based_Learning--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"BOP CCERS Field Based Learning\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Restoring oyster reefs to New York Harbor offers an exciting scientific challenge.

In turn, self-efficacy would be positively associated with interest in pursuing STEM careers, thereby showing higher levels of STEM career interest among CCERS students compared to non-CCERS students.\n\n\nResults show support for the studys hypotheses. Students who participated in CCERS activities show a higher level of confidence in their scientific observations, inquiries, and communication compared to students who did not participate in the CCERS activities. Additionally, CCERS students had higher technological ability scores than non-CCERS students, and this explained some of the project's influence on science self-efficacy. Lastly, the program's influence on technological ability and science self-efficacy is related to students' career interest. The results of these analyses seem to hold for URM students when there is enough data to perform the analysis, meaning the results may be equitably distributed throughout the student population. The results show that the CCERS STEM+C program may be a part of the pipeline to bring students into STEM.\n\n\nIn addition, there is evidence that the CCERS program impacts awareness. This seems to be a direct result of Pillar 1: Teacher Trainings, as one of the pillar's goals was for teachers to increase student engagement and learning in oyster restoration research, and interest in STEM careers. Additionally, teachers predicted that students awareness of STEM careers would increase because of participating in the BOP activities, as they were acting as scientists themselves and were collecting and working with computer data, a prediction that is supported by the data.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/24/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: LaurenBBirney\n"
