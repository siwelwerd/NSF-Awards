 "awd_abstract_narration": "With continued reliance on fossil fuels for most electricity production and increasing concerns about carbon dioxide emissions, carbon dioxide utilization for syngas production via dry reforming of methane (which is abundant in the U.S.) has become a very attractive possibility. The objectives of the proposed project are to design high performance catalytic membrane reactors (CMRs) for low temperature dry reforming of methane (DRM) using processible polymer-based membranes, and to build understanding of the effects of selective hydrogen removal on carbon dioxide conversion, carbon deposition and catalytic activity in this process. This GOALI project will be supported by a key industry partner (Gas Technology Institute, GTI), with one graduate student serving as an intern at GTI to evaluate the CMRs in an industrial setting. This project directly addresses a focus area of the DOE-funded Rapid Advancement in Process Intensification Deployment (RAPID) Institute through process intensification for energy-efficient manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research plan aims to design, prepare and characterize coke resistant catalysts with high activity at low temperatures, and mixed matrix materials (MMMs) containing Pd nanomaterials in polybenzimidazole (PBI) with superior H2/CO2 separation performance. The catalysts will be subsequently integrated in CMRs and tested at laboratory scale. Models will be developed to describe the effects of selective H2 removal on the DRM reaction. The proposed work is novel in three key respects: (1) Design and preparation of nano-catalysts for DRM with improved low-temperature activity and resistance to coking using a unique flame-based aerosol process; (2) development of CMRs for low-temperature DRM using thermally stable, processible polymer-based membranes, and (3) understanding of the effect of H2-selective removal on the DRM reaction at low temperatures (including CO2 conversion, carbon deposition and catalytic activity).  CMRs based on hollow fibers will be prepared and thoroughly characterized for the DRM reaction; predictive models will be developed to uncover the effect of material and operating parameters on CO2 conversion; catalysts will be optimized for low temperature hydrogen-poor conditions; and preliminary techno-economic analysis will be performed, leading to a fuller understanding of the potential of CMRs for the DRM reaction. The graduate and undergraduate students participating in this program will be exposed to interdisciplinary research of reaction engineering, separation and materials science. The results will be incorporated into courses at the University at Buffalo, a popular textbook, and user-friendly teaching modules. Outreach activities will provide access to educational modules and research training to high school and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in the Buffalo area and inspire them to pursue STEM careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
