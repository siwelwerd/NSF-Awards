 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies the behavior of partial differential equations and other infinite dimensional dynamical systems, and adapts and develops ideas originating in the study of finite-dimensional dynamics to make qualitative and quantitative predictions about the behavior of solutions of such systems.  He focuses primarily on questions arising in physical applications.  Among the questions he studies are the metastable behavior of fluid systems, whereby long-lived structures like vortices appear in the flow on a relatively short time scale, and then determine the subsequent evolution of the fluid for very long times.  He also studies the influence of localized structures like vortices on the behavior of rotating, stratified fluid layers like the atmosphere.  The differential equations arise in a variety of different physical contexts and are characterized by the fact that while the equations themselves are well known, they are too complicated to solve explicitly except in very special or physically unrealistic cases.  Nevertheless, applications require at least a qualitative understanding of the behavior of their solutions; this research project aims to develop such an understanding.  The project incorporates the training of graduate students and post-doctoral fellows into all facets of this research.\r\n\r\nAmong the specific systems that the investigator studies are: (i) nearly inviscid fluids and weakly damped Hamiltonian systems like the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam system using normal forms and the theory of hypercoercivity; (ii) invariant manifolds and their implications for the behavior of: (a) unstably stratified, rotating fluid systems, (b) the compressible Navier-Stokes equations and (c) as a means of understanding the continuum approximation of kinetic systems, and (iii) small-divisors in fluid mechanics and other infinite dimensional systems.  One feature that makes it difficult to apply dynamical systems ideas to partial differential equations on unbounded domains is the interplay of effects due to continuous spectrum with those coming from discrete spectrum.  The planned work on stratified fluids and approximation theorems for kinetic systems further develops the theory of invariant manifolds to treat these problems.  The study of small divisor problems in the vortex sheet equations extends KAM-like methods to a new class of infinite dimensional systems.  The study of weakly viscous fluids and weakly damped oscillator systems both leads to a deeper intrinsic understanding of the origin of intermediate time scales in these systems and illuminates the mathematical relationships between these two apparently quite different physical systems.  Graduate students and post-doctoral fellows are included in the work of the project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nIn understanding the behavior of a physical system it is important to understand not only what happens, but also the time scales on which various events occur, and the spatial locations at which they take place. Understanding the time scale on which a particular physical phenomenon happens may either allow one to average over the effects of this phenomenon and replace the differential equations that describe the system with simpler equations, or to ignore particular effects, if the time scale on which they occur is much longer than time scale of interest in a particular context. Events which are strongly localized in one spatial region, versus those which involved extended spatial domains, may allow for their use in either storing, or transmitting information, depending on the length scales on which they manifest themselves. One particular type of solution which plays a special role in both of these contexts is known as a breather. These are solutions of partial differential equations or spatially discrete extended dynamical systems which are periodic in time, but strongly localized in space. The research supported by this grant studied breathers in both of these settings.\n\n\n\nWhile many techniques exist for analyzing either very short, or very long, time scales, there are fewer mathematical methods available for analyzing intermediate time scales. Metastable states are an example of the sort physical phenomenon which often occur on these intermediate time scales, and the understanding of the origin and evolution of these states has been one focus of the research supported by this grant. Systems of coupled, nonlinear oscillators are often studied to understand how energy or information is transported through extended systems. This includes systems as disparate as vibrations in crystals, and signal propagation in the brain. In work with a former undergraduate student, we showed that for weakly damped systems, there exist solutions, which are localized and periodic if no damping is present, but which are destroyed by the damping. Nonetheless, they can still be used as a sort of framework for the metastable states by showing that the damped system evolves in a way to remain close to the (formerly) periodic states, but with a frequency which changes in a very slow, and computable, way. These breather states are much less common in partial differential equations, but a second area of research supported by this grant has focussed on developing methods to prove their existence and understand their properties in special classes of equations.\n\n\n\nA further, somewhat different, focus of my research has been the rigorous derivation of simplified approximate equations which again hold on these intermediate time scales. There are many important physical systems for which the underlying differential equations are so complex that it is difficult to solve them even with the aid of computers. In such cases, accurate, but simple, model equations often yield important insight into the behavior of these equations. While non-rigorous approximations have existed for such problems for many years, only in the last few years has it been possible to rigorously establish the validity of such approximations. Time scales are again an important aspect of this problem since these approximate equations typically describe the underlying physical system for a very long, but finite time and extending this time as much as possible has again been one area of emphasis for my research. In research recently completed with a former PhD student, I investigated the appropriate approximating equations for a class of nonlinear oscillators known as the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou beta-chain. The novel aspect of these results is that they allow for solutions with non-zero limits at infinity, which leads to much more complicated analysis.\n\nThroughout the research supported by this grant I have also focussed on including PhD students and post-doctoral fellows in my research program. Three different PhD students received support from this grant and I also served as the principal faculty mentor for an NSF post-doctoral fellow.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/18/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ClarenceEWayne\n"
