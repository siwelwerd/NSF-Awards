 "awd_abstract_narration": "Video streaming on mobile devices has seen tremendous growth recently, and is a major marketing point of many wireless carriers.  Because videos have very large data sizes, the mobile devices must spend a great deal of their battery power on downloading and processing the video over the wireless network. Existing research on video streaming over the Internet does not consider the new research challenges related to energy efficiency and the special characteristics of mobile devices and wireless networks.  This project addresses these challenges by developing novel techniques to save energy while maintaining users' Quality of Experience (QoE) during video streaming.\r\n\r\nTo support energy-aware and QoE-aware video streaming on mobile devices, this research addresses the challenges of how, when and how much data to download under different contexts to save energy and improve users' QoE through the following thrusts: (a) understanding how the processor frequency affects network throughput and energy consumption, and how to adjust the frequency to minimize energy or maximize QoE considering user context; (b) development of protocols for buffer management considering that users skip scenes and abort watching under some circumstances; and (c) reducing the energy consumption of video streaming through network quality aware downloading and context-aware downloading.  \r\n\r\nAs video streaming on mobile devices becomes part of everyday life, this research has great potential to benefit society by improving the quality of video streaming and making mobile devices last longer. The results from this research are likely to foster new research directions on supporting energy aware and QoE-aware video streaming on mobile devices.  The project will engage under-represented students in research.  The scholarly discovery of this project will be disseminated broadly through publications, open-source software, and summer camps.\r\n\r\nAll data produced as a result of this project, including trace data, software code, simulation data, and publications, will be made publicly available at the project repository: http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gcao/nsf/mobilevideo.  The data and the resulting research outputs will be maintained using appropriate methods for at least five years after the end of the project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Since videos have very large data sizes, the mobile devices must spend a large amount of battery power on downloading and processing the video over the wireless network. Existing research on video streaming over the Internet does not consider the new research challenges related to energy efficiency and the special characteristics of wireless networks and mobile devices. This project addresses these challenges by developing novel techniques to save energy while maintaining users' Quality of Experience (QoE) during video streaming.\n\n\nFirst, we have investigated how to adjust the processor frequency to minimize energy or maximize QoE for video streaming on mobile devices.  The energy consumed by video streaming includes the energy consumed for data transmission and CPU processing, which are both affected by the CPU frequency.  Based on real measurement results, we model the effects of CPU frequency considering the special characteristics of wireless networks and propose an algorithm which selects the CPU frequency that can achieve a balance between saving the data transmission energy and CPU energy.

Through trace-driven simulations and real measurement, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can reduce the energy consumption by 50% compared to the default Youtube app.\n\nSecond, we leverage user's context (environment) to save energy.  High quality video streaming for mobile devices implies high energy consumption due to the transmitted data and the variation of wireless signals.  However, the QoE does not substantially increase when watching high bitrate video in a vibrating environment (i.e., a moving vehicle).  To address this problem, we propose to save energy by considering the context of video streaming.  To model the impact of context, we exploit the embedded accelerometer in smartphones to record the vibration level during video streaming. Based on quality assessment experiments, we collect traces and model the impact of video bitrate and vibration level on QoE and model the impact of video bitrate and signal strength on power consumption.  Based on the QoE model and the power model, we formulate the context-aware and energy-aware video streaming problem as an optimization problem, design an algorithm to solve it, and demonstrate its advantage over existing approaches when considering both energy and QoE.\n\nThird, we have developed QoE-aware and energy-efficient techniques for 360-degree video streaming on mobile devices.  Tile-based streaming techniques have been widely used in 360-degree video streaming, where the main challenge is to determine the right tile size.  Our solution is to encode popularly viewed areas as macrotiles, so that high compression efficiency can be achieved, and the total amount of downloaded data is reduced.  We propose techniques for identifying and building macrotiles and adjusting their sizes to consider practical issues such as head movement randomness.  To support macrotile based 360-degree video streaming, the client selects the right tiles with the right quality level to maximize the QoE under bandwidth constraint. We formulate this problem as an optimization problem and propose a solution.  Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve QoE, save bandwidth usage, and reduce energy consumption.\n\nMany of the research results have been integrated with the education curricula at the Pennsylvania State University. The project has supported three Ph.D.  students working on their dissertations and two undergraduate students have participated in the research. The involvement of the graduate and undergraduate students will prepare them for leadership roles in computer science research, academia, and industry. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/06/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Guohong Cao"
