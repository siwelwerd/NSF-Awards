 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to use the possibilities provided by the Blue Waters supercomputer to model fundamental and challenging space physics problems.  The heliosphere is the sphere like region of space dominated by the Sun, which extends far beyond the orbit of Pluto.  The Solar Wind (SW) consists of ionized atoms from the Sun.  The project will model the SW flows in the inner and outer heliosphere, and compare the results with observational data.  It is anticipated that the project will provide a leap forward in the simulation of complex charged and neutral gas systems. Furthermore, the proposed approach to computational resource management for complex codes utilizing multiple algorithm technologies is expected to be a major advance to current approaches. The development of resource management technologies will be essential for all future modeling efforts that incorporate a wide diversity of scales and physical processes.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of flows of partially ionized plasma that are characterized by multiple or highly localized scales and multiple processes, will have a transformative impact for heliophysics. The project will address a variety of physical phenomena occurring throughout the solar system, such as the charge exchange processes between neutral and charged particles, the birth of pick-up ions (PUIs), the origin of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs), turbulence, the interplay of the heliopause instability and magnetic reconnection at the SW and local interstellar medium (LISM) interface, plasma wave generation in the LISM, the effect of the heliosphere on the TeV cosmic ray anisotropy, and more.  The project will also fit simulation results with observational data to constrain the properties of the LISM and refine time-dependent SW models. The project will incorporate the direct measurements from the New Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter missions, as well as the in situ measurements of the SW from the Sun to Earth and further to the heliospheric boundary, from the New Horizons, Voyager, IBEX, and air shower observations. This project will extract the fundamental physics of plasma-neutral flows accompanied by the interaction with energetic particles. The goal of the modeling activities is to understand and interpret observations in a way previously unthinkable because of the limitations in both physical models and computing power. Components of the physical model and corresponding code routines will be made available in a publicly accessible simulation suite.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

WE have also developed and  tested different, data-driven mechanism for coronal mass ejections  (CMEs). Our simulations have been thoroughly validated against  observational data from IBEX, New Horizons, OMNI, Parker Solar Probe,  Ulysses, and Voyagers.

It has been shown  that the \"croissant\" or \"round heliosphere\" scenarios are based on  illegitimate assumptions and contradict vary many observations. We have  investigated the heliospheric boundary layer of depressed plasma density  on the LISM side of the heliopause and demonstrated that its origin is  due to charge exchange between interstellar protons and neutral H atoms.  Simulations are in a good agreement with the Plasma Wave Instrument on  board Voyager 1. The effect of dissipating heliospheric current sheet  and generated turbulence on the heliosheath magnetic field and plasma  distributions has been investigated. We have analyzed shock waves  propagating through the LISM and showed their effect on the plasma wave  generation. We have investigated the kinetic evolution of the pickup ion  (PUI)&nbsp; distribution function in the LISM and proved its consistence  with our own mechanism of the IBEX ribbon - a thin layer of enhanced  energetic neutral atom (ENA) flux in the direction where the line of  site is perpendicular to the magnetic field lines draped around the  heliopause. We have demonstrated te importance of PUIs on the structure  of the heliosphere and&nbsp; ENA fluxes observed by IBEX, Cassini, and SOHO.  We have performed kinetic (probabilistic test particle and full PIC)  simulations of PUIs crossing the heliospheric termination shock. This  made it possible to advance the derivation of Rankine-Hugoniot  conditions including PUIs. We also investigated 3-D instability of the  heliopause and proved its importance for the evolving width of the  heliosheath. We have disseminated our results by publishing papers and  making presentations at national and international conferences,  seminars, and team meeting.
