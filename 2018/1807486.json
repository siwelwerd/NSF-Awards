 "awd_abstract_narration": "Containers have a variety of uses, such as to preserve foodstuff, to organize collections of objects, and to hold objects during their shipment to specific destinations.  In the chemistry realm, molecular containers are used to isolate molecules that smell, to extend the lifetime of unstable compounds by not allowing them to react with other molecules, and to change important molecular properties like solubility. At the University of Maryland, Professor Lyle Isaacs' research group studies next generation molecular containers known as cucurbiturils.  By creating a series of new cucurbituril-type containers, studying their basic container properties, and showing how they may be integrated into complex systems, the Isaacs' group enables other academic and industrial labs to adapt cucurbituril molecular containers to applications such as drug delivery and sensing of addictive over-the-counter drugs.  Isaacs' research data is used to stimulate interactions with computational chemists via the program Statistical Assessment of the Modeling of Proteins and Ligands (SAMPL) Challenges.  The researchers also conduct outreach activities with pre-schools, and disseminate problem sets for use in spectroscopic methods courses.\r\n\r\nThe research focuses on the development of the synthetic and supramolecular chemistry of a family of molecular container compounds called cucurbit[n]uril (CB[n]).  An important aim of this project is to develop structure affinity relationships that refine the understanding of the extraordinarily tight binding affinity of CB[n] toward cationic diamondoid molecules. The new acyclic cucurbituril containers have triptycene derived aromatic walls that allow tailoring of the surface to enable chiral recognition and guest selectivity.  By linking the CB[n] containers to metal-organic polyhedra, the research team investigates how guests are take up  inside the CB[n] containers, further promoting chemical reactivity inside the metal-organic polyhedra.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant funded our work on the preparation and molecular recognition properties of (acyclic) cucurbit[n]uril (CB[n])-type molecular containers and metal organic polyhedra.  Cucurbiturils are shaped like barrels and function as molecular containers for guest molecules in water.  When guest molecules are encapsulated inside cucurbiturils their fundamental properties (e.g. solubility, reactivity, color) are different.  Under this grant, we worked toward three main goals: 1) tuning the properties and applications of acyclic CB[n] by attachment of new aromatic walls (triptycenes), 2) delineation of the factors governing ultratight binding of guests inside CB[n] and demonstrating their uses, and 3) marrying the recognition properties of CB[n] with the structural features of metal-organic polyhedra.\n\nUnder the first goal, we have prepared a variety of new acyclic CB[n]-type receptors including those with triptycene walls that blur the lines between what it means to be a host or a guest.  Triptycene walled acyclic CB[n] were also made to assemble into vesicles and were triggered to release their contents by addition of guest as a stimulus.  We also showed that acyclic CB[n] are capable of recognizing the N-terminus of insulin and a variety of cationic peptides with high binding affinity.  Finally, acyclic CB[n] were demonstrated to generate an induced circular dichroism signal upon binding to chiral guests which can be used determine their enantiomeric excess.  \n\nUnder the second goal, we measured the binding affinity of CB[7] and CB[8] toward triamantane mono- and di-ammonium ions to clarify the role of the hydrophobic diamondoid skeleton on the host&bull;guest binding affinity.  The CB[8]&bull;guest complexes were exceptionally tight with Ka values in the 1013 &ndash; 1014 M-1 range.  An important outcome of the work was the development of a new method to measure exceptionally tight binding complexes by using a ternary host&bull;guest2 complex as competitor.  With our collaborators we have also shown how to marry the tight binding properties of CB[n] with nucleic acids to produce stimuli responsive systems.\n\nUnder the third goal, we have studied the self-assembly of CB[7] and CB[8] with a variety of bipyridine compounds that feature a viologen recognition site with iron(II)salts.  We found that we were able to form self-assembled tetrahedra and cubes that feature CB[7] units complexed onto the viologen units on the edges of the polyhedra.  According to the results of NMR and mass spectrometry we find that roughly 50% of the edges remain uncomplexed.\n\nLastly, a variety of broader impact outcomes supported by the grant.  Four graduate students received their Ph.D. degrees who worked on the project.  Four undergraduates were co-authors on papers resulting from their participation on the project; all four students continue in science and medicine.  Dr. Isaacs and his group performed several outreach visits to local preschool and elementary school classrooms to raise kids interest science.  In addition, Dr. Isaacs created a series of NMR problem sets for use in senior undergraduate and first year graduate level organic spectroscopy courses which are freely available via the digital repository at University of Maryland and advertised them to the community via Twitter.  Lastly, we participated in the SAMPL challenges by supplying blinded acyclic CB&bull;guest datasets as challenges to enable computational chemistry to improve their methods for free energy calculations; SAMPL has enhanced synergistic interactions between supramolecular and computational chemists.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/13/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lyle D Isaacs"
