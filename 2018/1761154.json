 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will investigate the associations between perceived supports and persistence for both majority (Caucasian) women and underrepresented minority (URM) women in STEM doctoral programs.  Women leave doctoral programs in STEM at higher rates than their white male counterparts.  Reducing the attrition of these talented individuals from STEM is of particular importance given that diversity at all levels of the STEM workforce has been shown to benefit the outcomes of related scientific research.  The proposed work will increase understanding of the reasons for the underrepresentation of women in STEM academic and research careers.  Key research findings will be incorporated in the online CareerWISE resilience training intervention and will provide the foundation for informing and educating key support sources about how to strengthen support for women in STEM.\r\n\r\nThe project addresses the overarching research question of: How do experiences of perceived support play a role in the academic persistence of diverse female doctoral students in STEM? The project proposes three studies, each of which utilizes different research methods, and are guided by the theoretical lens of Social Cognitive Career Theory.  The \"reflections study\" will produce qualitative data about the nature of support episodes, and the sources, types, and timing of interpersonal support that were most effective in mitigating discouragement and stresses from difficulties experienced in STEM doctoral programs. The lab-based \"communications of support\" study will provide real-time observations of how support is communicated between a faculty mentor and an advanced stage doctoral student. Finally, the \"first and second year support experiences\" study will assess support experiences that take place during the critical early stages of doctoral study. Participants in the studies will include current STEM doctoral students, early career professionals who have recently graduated from doctoral programs, and women who left their STEM doctoral programs prior to completing their degrees. Data across the studies will be collected from interviews, surveys, daily journals, and lab-based observation.  The project is supported by the Education and Human Resources Core Research Program (ECR), which funds fundamental research in STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
