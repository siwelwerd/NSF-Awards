 "awd_abstract_narration": "The emperor penguin is an iconic seabird that is found in colonies distributed around the entirety of the Antarctic coastline. Emperor penguins are an important indicator species for the health of the Southern Ocean because their reliance on sea ice for major parts of their life cycle means that their population can be influenced by changes in the extent and duration of sea ice around Antarctica. Although baseline data exists on emperor penguin distributions and overall population size, data on how population size varies at individual colonies is limited to only a few locations. Thus, knowledge about how changes in local or regional environmental conditions impacts local or global population status is poorly understood. By combining established methods in satellite remote sensing with ground and aerial surveys of several colonies across the continent, this project will generate population estimates for the 54 known emperor penguin colonies. Decadal scale population trend data will be combined with environmental variables (e.g., sea ice extent and duration among others) to reveal which conditions influence population fluctuations at regional and continental scales. The project will engage with international collaborators, train post-doctoral associates and future scientists, and develop citizen science and K-12 outreach programs. \r\n\r\nThis project on emperor penguin populations will quantify penguin presence/absence, and colony size and trajectory, across the entire Antarctic continent using high-resolution satellite imagery. For a subset of the colonies, population estimates derived from high-resolution satellite images will be compared with those determined by aerial surveys. This validated information will be used to determine population estimates for all emperor penguin colonies through iterations of supervised classification and maximum likelihood calculations on the high-resolution imagery. The effect of spatial, geophysical, and environmental variables on population size and decadal-scale trends will be assessed using generalized linear models. This research will result in a first ever empirical result for emperor penguin population trends and habitat suitability, and will leverage currently-funded NSF infrastructure and hosting sites to publish results in near-real time to the public.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

They breed on sea ice during the austral winter around the Antarctic continent. Emperor penguins occupy a sort of<em> Goldilocks zone</em> in their frozen world when there is too much sea ice, adults and chicks might starve when the adults foraging trips to the edge of the ice pack take too long; when the sea ice breaks up early, effectively bringing open water too close to nesting sites, chicks can drown. Hence,&nbsp; Emperor penguin is a sentinel species sensitive to the effects of climate change, through sea ice, and is thus a leading signal of the impacts that may be expected for other species.</p>\n<p>Emperor penguin colony are remote, hence data on how population size varies at individual colonies is limited to only a few locations. This project has quantified for the first time the colony trajectory over the last decade, across the entire Antarctic continent using high-resolution satellite imagery. We found that the global population of emperor penguin has declined dramatically between 2009 and 2018. In addition, if current global warming trends and government policies continue, Antarctica's sea ice will decline at a rate that would dramatically reduce emperor penguin numbers to the point that almost all colonies would become quasi-extinct by 2100, with little chance of recovering. Indeed, by including periodic environmental perturbation, like the 2016 collapse of the colony in Halley Bay caused by an early break-up of sea ice that led to the death of 10,000 chicks, the demographic models developed in this project&nbsp; showed that 98% of colonies will be extinct by 2100 and the global population will decline by 99% if greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated. Notwithstanding the models showed that if the world meets the Paris climate agreement targets, keeping warming to under 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 F) compared to pre-industrial temperatures, that could protect sufficient habitat to halt the emperor penguins' decline. It's still not a foregone conclusion that we will prevent this from happening. Current policies have shown to offer a greater than 97% chance of exceeding 2 degrees Celsius, but there are options available that would prevent us from driving emperor penguins off the face of the planet. That makes penguins the proverbial <em>canary in the coal mine</em>, which tells us how well we are sharing the planet with emperor penguins, and with all the other species that call Earth home.</p>\n<p>Broader impacts:</p>\n<p>We found that near-term global policy decisions over the next decade will have dramatic impacts on the viability of the emperor penguin, and will likely shape the future of Earth's biota. Our findings starkly illustrate the far-reaching implications of national climate policy decisions and were instrumental in the proposed listing of emperor penguin on the Endangered Species Act by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Until the goals of the Paris agreement on climate change are met, this project has also defined other necessary conservation actions, including listing the emperor penguin as an Antarctic Specially Protected Species under the Antarctic Treaty and updating its status to Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, and increasing spatial protection at breeding sites and foraging grounds by creating large-scale MPAs. &nbsp;This project has also provided opportunities for training and professional development for five undergraduate students and two postdocs.
