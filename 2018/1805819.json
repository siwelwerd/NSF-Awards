 "awd_abstract_narration": "The researchers intend to drill two 165-meter long cores to bedrock from the col (i.e., the lowest point on a mountain ridge between two peaks) at 6,050 meters above sea level masl) and two 70-meter cores from the South Peak summit at 6,756 masl). \r\n\r\nAlthough the col was surveyed and successfully drilled to bedrock in 1993, summit drilling was not possible, and only a few dating techniques were available to help establish a valid time scale for the last 20,000 years. Stable isotope records from Huascaran will provide histories of mid-troposphere temperature and precipitation, and the site's proximity to the Amazon Basin will allow the reconstruction of environmental changes in the vast rainforest by analyzing biological parameters (microbial populations, pollen and methane concentrations).\r\n\r\nThe researchers aim to address the following objectives: (1) document and characterize abrupt climate and environmental variations with emphasis on mid-Holocene events and the deglaciation; (2) assess how the climate and environment have changed over the past century in response to anthropogenic forcing; (3) establish tightly constrained timescales for each of the ice cores; (4) determine tropical atmospheric and climatological dynamics on multi-decadal, decadal, and ENSO time scales; (5) assess the regional characteristics of climatic and environmental variability during the Holocene and Last Glacial Stage (LGS) with a focus on changes in the Amazon Basin and determine how they compare to contemporaneous conditions elsewhere; and (6) provide one-quarter of the Huascaran col core for archival at the U.S. National Ice Core Laboratory for future investigations by the scientific community.\r\n\r\nThe potential Broader Impacts (B.I.) includes strong science and educational aspects.  Mid-tropospheric warming in the Peruvian Andes, enhanced by recent strong El Ninos, is accelerating glacier retreat. Currently this retreat is increasing dry season water discharge which is not sustainable.  Most of Peru's population lives in the west coast desert which relies on glacier streams for agriculture, hydroelectricity, and municipal water supplies. Retreating glaciers also exacerbate geohazards and impact ecosystems, tourism and recreation. Understanding the impact of this acceleration of glacier loss on future water resources requires information about past changes in high elevation glacier mass balance which is virtually unknown, except from a few point-estimates based on ice core studies.  Such information is urgently needed by policymakers, governmental agencies, and public resource administrators to help guide mitigation and adaptation strategies. Educational and public outreach will be conducted through Ohio State University's Education and Outreach Program recently established educational and outreach programs in Peru. Such programs are dedicated to providing climatic and environmental information to students, the public, and policymakers at all levels.  The project would support early career scientists and continue to foster international collaborations in science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The reconstructed records reveal how climate in the South American tropics has changed over recent centuries as well as over many millennia. These data reveal the atmospheric, climatological, and glaciological processes that have allowed the Huascaran glacier to survive for over 20,000 years while records from most other glaciers in the deep tropical Andes extend back only a few millennia. Since the Little Ice Age (~1400 to 1890 Common Era or C.E.) the Cordillera Blanca has lost roughly half of its ice cover, and currently glaciers there cover less than 450 km<sup>2 </sup>(Motschmann et al., <em>Climatic Change</em>, 2020).</p>\n<p>The glacier on Huascaran (9.11?S, 77.61?W, 6768 masl) is Earth's highest tropical glacier (Photo 1). The Ohio State University's Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center's Ice Core Paleoclimatology Research Group (ICPRG) drilled the first cores to bedrock on the col of Huascaran (6000 m; 20,000 ft) in 1993, recovering long cores that provided a climate record extending back into the Late Glacial Stage (~19,000 years ago) and possibly longer (Thompson et al., <em>Science</em>, 1995). In 2019, the ICPRG and the National Institute of Investigation in Mountain Glaciers and Ecosystems (INAIGEM) returned to Huascaran and recovered two ice cores to bedrock from the col (165 m and 167.6 m long). Additionally, for the first time, ice cores were drilled to bedrock from the summit of the South Peak (6768 m; 22,205 ft.). These cores are 69.3 m and 68.7 m long (Photo 2).</p>\n<p>The col and summit cores have been analyzed continuously from top to bottom in high temporal resolution for oxygen isotope ratios (&delta;<sup>18</sup>O), glaciochemistry, and mineral dust concentration. Particularly exciting achievements of this project include the analysis of selected core sections for the concentrations of trace elements and &nbsp;black carbon and the first measurements of &nbsp;&delta;<sup>18</sup>O of the air (&delta;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>atm</sub>) &nbsp;and the concentrations of methane (CH<sub>4 </sub>) trapped in the bubbles preserved in the ice. The &delta;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>atm</sub> and CH<sub>4 </sub>concentrations allowed the refinement of the timescale for the earlier (1993) Huascaran cores that, along with the new (2019) cores, are now confirmed to extend back over 30,000 years.</p>\n<p>It is well established that the climate in the Cordillera Blanca has been influenced over millennia by the easterly trade winds that transport moisture from the North Atlantic Ocean over the Amazon Rainforest to the mountains. These new ice core-derived records reveal the response of temperature and precipitation in the tropical Andes Mountains to the easterly trade winds, the migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (a narrow zone near the equator where northern and southern hemispheric air masses converge), and the oceanic and atmospheric changes during El Nino-Southern Oscillation events. The atmospheric methane concentrations preserved in these new cores compare well with the extensively documented methane data from Antarctic and Greenlandic ice cores. Due to Huascaran's high elevation and tropical location, these new methane records provide unique information regarding changes in the natural CH<sub>4 </sub>sources as well as recent anthropogenic influences. The development and interpretation of these data are currently underway.</p>\n<p>During this project, four post-doctoral scholars, 2 females (one Hispanic) and two males, have been mentored and advanced their careers with co-authorships of two peer-reviewed papers based on data from the Huascaran ice cores. The Huascaran data from this project are the basis for two current PhD dissertations. To date, this project has produced three peer-reviewed publications, two additional peer-reviewed papers that are now in revision, and a chapter in a book scheduled for publication in 2024. Additional publications are expected on topics including ice core dating, abrupt climate change, ice-core methane records, microbes (bacteria and viruses), and the atmospheric linkages between low-latitude ice core climate records from South America and Asia. These ice core-derived records provide a long-term context for climatic, atmospheric, and environmental variability in the tropics, a climatically critical region which is currently experiencing rapid warming.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/18/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ellen&nbsp;Mosley-Thompson</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1805819/1805819_10555050_1692378712110_Photo2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1805819/1805819_10555050_1692378712110_Photo2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Photo 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1805819/1805819_10555050_1692378712110_Photo2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Photo 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Shown are the ice core drill sites on the col and the summit of the south peak of Huascaran in the Peruvian Andes</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Lonnie G.
