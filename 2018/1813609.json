 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will study the outskirts of the nearest giant elliptical galaxy, named Centaurus A, to learn how the galaxy built up its stellar and dark matter mass over cosmic time.  The investigators have measured the positions of nearly all the luminous star clusters associated with Centaurus A, and will precisely measure their velocities using large ground-based telescopes.  Using observations of the collection of star clusters, and their motions around Centaurus A, the investigators will measure the dark matter density profile of the galaxy, and search for remnants of smaller galaxies that have merged with Centaurus A.  The important goal of their observations is identifying large star clusters which are the remnants left over from smaller galaxies after they have been devoured by the larger Centaurus A.  By studying the motions of these star clusters in detail, along with the smaller galaxies it has destroyed, they will have a complete inventory of the 'dark side' of Centaurus A.  Their results will be applied to studies of all galaxy populations.  The investigators will present the science results from this program to visitors at the National Science Foundation's Kitt Peak National Observatory, by implementing a new docent training program at the visitor center.  The investigators will travel to Bryce Canyon National Park and present their results, through summer internships, which ultimately teach 16,000 visitors about the night sky.\r\n\r\nThe currently favored cold dark matter model makes clear predictions for the sub-halo mass function and dark matter density profile of galaxy-sized halos, but quantitatively verifying these predictions is challenging.   Centaurus A's dark matter density profile will be measured, using the kinematics derived from a nearly complete sample of star clusters, and the results compared to recent simulations that suggest galaxies with recent mergers and active galactic nuclei should have shallow dark matter profiles.  By combining the star cluster kinematics with an already existing red giant branch star map, the visible, accreted substructures will be identified and weighed.  Finally, a complete sample of ultra-compact dwarfs will be analyzed, including a search identifying them as the central compact remnants of stripped dwarf galaxies.  Accounting for this population of sub-halos is a novel aspect of this program, and one that has largely been neglected when testing galaxy formation models.  These efforts will test major predictions of the cold dark matter model at sub-galactic scales in our nearest elliptical galaxy neighbor.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project has focused on the \"dark side\" or unseen mass in the famous nearby galaxy NGC5128 or Centaurus A.  This include both trying to measure the mass and extent of the dark matter halo and to find black holes in the remains of galaxies that have fallen in to NGC5128.  The key to both of these measurement are globular clusters, dense clusters of millions of stars that are orbiting around NGC5128.  We identified hundreds of new candidate globular clusters around NGC5128 using deep imaging data we have taken, combined with archival data from the Gaia satellite and other ground-based observatories that allow us to measure their brightness, color, and size.   We then began the process of verifying the candidates by measuring their motion relative to that of the parent galaxy using spectroscopic measurements of the clusters.  Some candidates were found to in fact be stars in our Milky Way, while dozens have already been verified to be part of NGC5128.  For some of the spectroscopic measurements, we could also measure the motions of stars inside the cluster.  For 57 of the clusters, we have used these measurement to determine the gravitational mass of the clusters with high accuracy.  Of these, one third were found to be abnormally heavy.  One possible explanation for this extra weight would be the presence of massive black holes in these clusters.  These black holes are expected if some of the clusters are the centers of smaller galaxies that have fallen into NGC5128 and had all their outer stars pulled away by the gravity of the larger galaxy.  These \"stripped nuclei\" can provide a record of galaxy mergers in NGC5128's past.  Future measurements will verify whether these objects are in fact nuclei with large black holes at their centers.  We have also begun work to use the motions of the clusters to constrain the dark matter halo of the galaxy.  In addition to the scientific work, this proposal also funded two summer astronomy outreach internships in Bryce Canyon National Park.  These interns interacted with thousands of visitors and shared the wonders of the night sky with them.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anil Seth"
