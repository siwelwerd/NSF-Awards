 "awd_abstract_narration": "High cognitive functions, including quantitative reasoning, learning and memory, originate in the human brain as a result of communication between complex networks of neurons connected through synapses. The key molecular element of this synaptic connection is the ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR), a protein in the postsynaptic neuronal membrane that conducts electrical signals to deliver messages from the presynaptic neuron. This process of neurotransmission is modulated by a variety of auxiliary proteins that bind to glutamate receptors. This project will illuminate how different auxiliary proteins interact with the glutamate receptor and with each other to initiate and modulate communication between neurons.  This study enhances our knowledge of the molecular underpinnings of brain function. The research will involve undergraduate and graduate students, providing an educational environment and training opportunities at the forefront of brain research. Outreach activities involving local high schools and colleges are planned as well to promote diverse participation in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nIt is increasingly recognized that the majority of proteins operate in cells within dynamically formed and re-formed complexes. This is especially important for signaling receptor proteins, such as ionotropic receptors in the brain that conduct electrical current through postsynaptic membranes to facilitate fast communication between neurons. The AMPA receptors (AMPAR) - a subtype of iGluRs - mediate the fastest excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian brain. Correspondingly, regulation of AMPAR trafficking, localization and function is the key mechanism determining synaptic strength and plasticity that underlies high cognitive brain functions, such as learning and memory. It has been discovered recently that synaptic AMPARs function as complexes with a multitude of auxiliary proteins. This project aims to characterize molecular interactions of AMPARs with the cys-knot AMPAR modulating proteins (CKAMPs) and their interplay with the transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (TARPs). A large collection of AMPAR and CKAMP mutants will be employed to identify interaction domains and specific residues involved in receptor regulation. Computational structural modeling including docking and molecular dynamics simulations will be employed to guide further determination of the protein-protein interfaces, which will be tested by electrophysiology experiments, and to generate and analyze candidate constructs for successful structure determination by cryo-EM. This collaborative effort, combining complementary approaches and continuous exchange of information and reagents, may provide the synergy needed to reach a new level of understanding of AMPAR regulation. In addition to providing fundamental insights into AMPAR gating and regulation, the results of this study will also serve as a roadmap for investigating AMPAR-mediated processes in synaptic physiology.\r\n\r\nThis award was co-funded by the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems, and the Rules of Life Venture Fund.\r\n\r\nThis collaborative US/Israel project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the Israeli Binational Science Foundation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Signals from one neuron to another travel through contact zones called synapses. Neurotransmission through a synapse involves arrival of the action potential to the presynaptic terminal, release of a neurotransmitter to the synaptic cleft and binding of the neurotransmitter to and activation of postsynaptic receptors. The activated postsynaptic receptors open their channel pores for ion conductance, leading to changes in the postsynaptic membrane potential and triggering an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron that travels down the neuronal network. The key players of this electro-chemical signaling are postsynaptic receptors. Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) mediate the majority of excitatory neurotransmission and are activated by the neurotransmitter glutamate. The fastest subtype of iGluRs, AMPA receptors (AMPARs), do not reside in the postsynaptic membrane alone but are surrounded by numerous auxiliary subunits, thus representing a core of synaptic complexes. Being the integral components of synaptic complexes, auxiliary subunits regulate AMPAR trafficking, localization, and function, determine synaptic strength and plasticity, and, as a result, modulate high cognitive brain functions, such as learning and memory. We have been studying how different auxiliary subunits regulate AMPAR function using biophysical and biochemical techniques. Among the most abundant AMPAR auxiliary subunits are Transmembrane AMPA Receptor Regulatory Proteins (TARPs) and GSG1L (germ cell-specific gene 1-like). TARPs, originally named &gamma;-subunits based on their sequence homology to &gamma;1 calcium channel subunit, include type I (&gamma;2, &gamma;3, &gamma;4, and &gamma;8) and type II (&gamma;5 and &gamma;7) subunits, which play activating and suppressive roles in neurotransmission, respectively. GSG1L serves a generally suppressive function, similar to type II TARPs. We studied activation of AMPAR complexes with type I TARP &gamma;2 and found that the channel of AMPAR opens to four discrete conductance levels (O1-O4), with higher conductance levels associated with the increased number of agonist glutamate molecules bound to four individual ligand-binding domains (LBDs). By solving cryo-EM structures of AMPAR-&gamma;2 complexes at different concentrations of glutamate (Figure), we showed that glutamate binds to LBDs of subunits B and D only after it is already bound to at least the same number of LBDs that belong to subunits A and C. Our structures combined with single-channel recordings, molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning analysis suggest that channel opening requires agonist binding to at least two LBDs. On the other hand, agonist binding to all four LBDs does not guarantee the maximal channel conductance and favors subconductance states O1 and O2, with O3 and O4 being rare and not captured structurally. Lack of subunit independence and low efficiency coupling of glutamate binding to channel opening underlie gating of synaptic complexes to submaximal conductance levels, providing a potential for upregulation of synaptic activity. We have also studied the process of desensitization of AMPAR complexes with type II TARP &gamma;5 and GSG1L. Desensitization is a gating process that results in closure of AMPAR channel despite the presence of glutamate bound to LBDs. We solved AMPAR-&gamma;5 and AMPAR-GSG1L structures in the closed and desensitized states and found that the structures have a stoichiometry of only two auxiliary subunits per AMPAR tetramer (2:1), which is different from the 4:1 maximum stoichiometry observed for type I TARP &gamma;2. During desensitization, LBD dimers of the AMPAR-&gamma;5 complex retain their 2-fold rotational symmetry, while the ones of the AMPAR-GSG1L complex become asymmetric. Our structural and functional studies therefore identified two distinct AMPAR desensitization mechanisms, important for better understanding the role of these receptors in excitatory neurotransmission.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/06/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Alexander&nbsp;Sobolevsky</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1818086/1818086_10560897_1673040955138_figure--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1818086/1818086_10560897_1673040955138_figure--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1818086/1818086_10560897_1673040955138_figure--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">AMPAR-y2 complex viewed parallel to the postsynaptic membrane (left) as well as its ligand-binding domain (LBD) layer (upper right) and transmembrane domain (TMD) with the ion channel in the middle (bottom right) viewed from the synaptic cleft, orthogonal to the postsynaptic membrane.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Alexander Sobolevsky</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Alexander&nbsp;Sobolevsky</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
