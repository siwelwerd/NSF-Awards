 "awd_abstract_narration": "Networks of autonomous underwater and surface vehicles (AUVs and ASVs) allow direct and continuous monitoring of the ocean. New deployment strategies are needed to obtain maximum coverage from a relatively small number of vessels. This will require better understanding of the structures controlling transport in geophysical flows such as ocean currents. New results show that AUV/ASV motion planning and adaptive sampling strategies are improved by incorporating models of ocean current dynamics. However, these currents change continually and apparently unpredictably, and this makes it highly challenging to take full advantage. The goals of this project are to better understand the dynamics of the dominant structures in ocean currents, and to explore their impact on AUV/ASV autonomy. Additionally, this work will produce robust motion control strategies for both single vehicles and teams of vehicles, to track desired structure boundaries, while leveraging the environmental dynamics to prolong operational lifespan. \r\n\r\nIn pursuit of the project goals, the research objectives are to: 1) identify and evaluate key kinematic features that control transport in oceanic surface flows of greatest relevance to autonomous vehicle navigation and control, 2) develop a general mathematical and control framework for teams of autonomous vehicles that leverages key transport controlling features in oceanic flows for improved navigation and monitoring of dynamic and uncertain environments, and 3) apply the control framework to the tracking of salt wedge fronts using the WHOI Jetyaks to establish the transition from the laboratory to the ocean. This work has a significant experimental component that leverages the PIs' existing research infrastructure.  The work addresses the theoretical and experimental challenges needed to develop a general mathematical and control framework for applying geophysical fluid dynamics to the development of novel planning, navigation, and control strategies for individual and networked teams of autonomous vehicles.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "This project focused on understanding the impact of ocean dynamics on autonomous marine vehicles (AMV) and how ocean currents can be exploited to improve an AMV's operational lifespan.  Ocean dynamics is of great industrial, military and scienti&#64257;c interest and the problem of predicting physical quantities or &#64258;ow features is a critical one. AUVs and ASVs have &#64257;lled an important gap by allowing direct and continuous monitoring of the ocean, but monitoring networks are sparse, and a placement strategy is needed to optimize the impact of the collected data. Such strategies are difficult to formulate a priori due to the complexity of typical ocean circulation patterns, which are intrinsically time dependent and three dimensional. Instead, autonomous vehicles must be able to extract important &#64258;ow features and adaptively form a placement strategy that is optimal in terms of both information input and energy expenditure.  Better understanding of the impact of the &#64258;uid environment on the vehicle will improve the design of  distributed control and coordination strategies for networks of AMVs to operate more ef&#64257;ciently and effectively in the ocean.\nIn particular, this project has combined ideas from fluid mechanics, nonlinear dynamics, control theory, and robotics to develop energy-efficient navigation and control strategies for AMVs that leverage the ambient ocean dynamics.  The intellectual merits of the project include the development of: 1) graph-based path planning strategies for AMVs subject to ocean currents; 2) strategies for mobile sensors to actively control their mean escape times from their assigned monitoring regions; and 3) reduced-order modeling strategies to determine the effects of vehicle and environmental interactions on vehicle maneuverability.  Our graph-based path planner is able to plan time and energy optimal paths in flows, accounting for obstacles such as islands and/or ships, and has been validated using real ocean flow data.  The planner is also able to account for uncertainties in the flow data as well as incorporate different types of vehicle kinematic constraints.  For power-constrained vehicles or sensors with minimal actuation capabilities, we have developed an AMV controller that exploits knowledge of flow features and environmental noise to determine its average escape time from its assigned monitoring region.  The control strategy pushes the AMV towards the center of its monitoring region if it gets too close to the boundary to extend its dwell time or pushes the AMV away from the center if the goal is to minimize its dwell time in the region.  We have also developed a data-driven strategy for uncertainty quantification in centimeter-scale vehicles and robots. We employ tools from functional expansion-based methods, the Karhunen-Loeve (KL) decomposition in particular, to identify appropriate reduced-order models of robotic systems through empirical observations, and discover underlying dominant dynamical behaviors of a system resulting from vehicle/robot-environmental interactions.  Lastly, we have generalized some of these approaches and shown how the idea of leveraging environmental forces can be extended to microscale systems subject to an external biasing field, e.g., microrobots actuated by an external magnetic force field.\nBroader impacts of the project include the training of four graduate students and two undergraduate students, three of which are female students and one of which is an underrepresented minority student.  The project also supported the group\u2019s participation in K-12 outreach activities including the Philadelphia Science Carnival.  The Philadelphia Science Carnival is one of the largest STEM events in the city, attended by thousands of families and hundreds of colleges, companies, and science institutions. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/14/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: M.
