 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will investigate how public investments in rail transit impact levels of income segregation in urban America.  The investigators will analyze how a public investment like rail transit affects land values, residential location decisions, and neighborhood changes in ways that influence metropolitan-wide patterns of segregation, with special emphasis given to the movements of lower-income residents.  The project will enhance basic understanding of fundamental theories regarding residential sorting.  It will help fill an important gap in the current state of knowledge of gentrification processes by modeling where potentially displaced residents move.  The project will help identify motivating factors that influence decisions to stay or leave a neighborhood impacted by new transit development through community-engaged scholarship that focuses on the perspectives of local residents and that connects residents, researchers, and key stakeholders and decision makers.  Given widespread investments in rail transit, project results will provide information and perspectives that can be used to address social and public policy issues in many communitiesacross the United States and elsewhere.  The project also will promote technical literacy and education by engaging students and community partners in an applied, mixed-methods geography course where they will examine the issue, participate in surveying residents, perform basic analyses on the collected data, and map and measure segregation trends following the implementation of a new rail transit line.\r\n\r\nMuch of the recent scholarship examining relationships among rail transit investments, displacement, and gentrification has emphasized how land values and aggregate-level neighborhood outcomes are impacted by transit.  This research project will focus on the movement of lower-income residents in response to transit investments by addressing the following research questions:  (1) Are lower-income residents more likely to move out of neighborhoods following the placement of new transit stations than other residents?  (2) Do lower-income residents relocate to neighborhoods with lower socioeconomic composition?  (3) What are the motivating factors that affect relocation decisions both into and out of transit neighborhoods?  (4) Where and for which income groups do residential economic segregation trends change following the establishment of a new transit system?  To gather quantitative data about residential movements and to understand the rationale behind these locational decisions, the investigators will employ a mix of multi-scalar methods.  They will analyze an individual-level, longitudinal dataset collected as part of the Panel Study on Income Dynamics to trace residential movements of individuals in and out of transit neighborhoods throughout the United States since 1970.  They also will conduct a complementary qualitative analysis in neighborhoods along a new transit line in Charlotte, North Carolina, that will involve interviews with key individuals at both the city and community scales as well as surveys and focus groups with neighborhood residents in proximity to stations of the new line.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We used a mixed, qualitative and quantitative research design to examine this topic from multiple spatial scales - from the perspective of residents of neighborhoods close to a newly opened transit station in Charlotte, North Carolina to a nation-wide, longitudinal study on broader trends. Using a national, longitudinal dataset on residential moves from 1970-2014 (The Panel Study on Income Dynamics), we first questioned whether lower-income residents were more likely to move out of their neighborhood following the nearby placement of a new transit station, compared to other residents. Our analysis found no significant evidence that living near a new station had any impact on the probability of a low-income resident relocating, based on our data. Using the same dataset, we then investigated where lower-income residents who did move, relocated to. We were specifically interested in whether being located near a new transit station increased one's odds of moving to a neighborhood of higher or lower socioeconomic status. We found that middle and higher-income homeowners had a greater chance of moving to a neighborhood of a higher socioeconomic status, just prior to the opening of the station potentially capitalizing on rising home values. However, this was not the case for lower-income homeowners and renters. Therefore, found some evidence that the new transit stations may shape where residents move to in a way that may serve to further income segregation patterns.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our third research objective took an in-depth, qualitative approach towards understanding the motivating factors that drive relocation decisions into and out of transit neighborhoods as well as residents' perceptions of a new transit line's impact on their neighborhood. We used a case study of a newly opened light rail line in Charlotte, North Carolina and performed surveys, interviews, and focus groups with residents and other local stakeholders. The results from these analyses varied geographically along the rail line. In neighborhoods close to the city center, more dramatic changes were perceived with an influx of new, higher-end developments catered towards young professionals moving into the city from elsewhere. These were accompanied by other amenities cited as typical signs of gentrification such as breweries, gyms, coffee shops. A sentiment was expressed that the residents to whom these new housing developments were marketed to were not reliant on public transit as they all also included garages. Notably, these developments were transforming previously industrial and undeveloped land, but nonetheless contributed to a changing sense of place, and in neighborhoods close to the center city, tear-downs, dramatic renovations, and steep increases in older single-family homes were also noted. Further along the line in more suburban, and largely African American neighborhoods, residents were more fearful that the new rail line would bring about dramatic changes and cause displacement, but there was not widespread discussion that such changes had been realized. The feelings tended to reflect long-standing distrust in a rapidly growing city that these new developments were not aimed at helping older, minority residents. Along the entire rail line, more residents who participated in our survey viewed the investment favorably, but this was more-so the case for residents who had lived in their neighborhood for a shorter amount of time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, our fourth research question returned to a multi-city scale and examined the impacts of rail transit investments on neighborhood income diversity and metropolitan segregation. This connects our residential mobility modeling efforts with aggregate outcomes at the neighborhood and metropolitan level.
