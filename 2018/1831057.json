 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to make growing produce more convenient and accessible to a new generation of gardeners while enabling student engagement and professional development of the team. The project aims to reconnect people with the way that food is grown in a way that helps them and the planet. This connection is critical to helping people make healthier food choices. By enabling people to grow their own food, we also connect them with the reality of seasons and enable them to make choices that are better for the environment.  The project will also provide a platform for student engagement with entrepreneurship, product development, and engineering design. Students are a part of and have shaped smart garden automation from the beginning, and the team plans to continue to work with academic institutions to maintain this relationship. Finally, the NSF I-Corps program will help this team develop the skills necessary to create value from ideas. This learning curve will be critical as the team moves forward on this project, and will better prepare them to be both leaders and mentors for others in the future. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is about a smart gardening system that lets gardeners grow more plants with less work. By harnessing recent technical advancements in low-power wireless communication, moisture sensors, and networked device protocols, the system makes gardening more convenient and accessible. When paired with a smart phone or web interface, this system has the potential to better enable a generation of gardeners and lead to healthier people, more efficient water usage and storm-water management, and a lower average carbon footprint for a given person's diet. The intellectual merit in this project is demonstrated by the fact that there are no existing systems on the market that can do all of things that this project's invention is set to do. The NSF I-Corps program will help the project team recognize the market segments for any potential commercial product.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
