 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop tools and data necessary to accurately predict lifespan from the activity of genes that respond to environmental conditions such as food intake or stress exposure. It is not fully understood how genes and the environment determine an individual's specific longevity outcome. For example, it is known that calorie reduction or reduction in oxidative stress can lead to increased longevity, but precisely predicting longevity from this information alone is not possible. Given the difficulties of studying aging in humans, the roundworm, Caenorhabditis elegans, will be used as a model to link the activity of specific genes known to affect aging. A mathematical model of the relationship between environment, genes, and longevity will be generated to reveal which genes and environments are most important in determining aging and longevity and to enable the prediction of lifespan. This information will be used in future work that focuses on whether these predictions can be extended to other organisms, and ultimately to humans. Through this work, two graduate students and one postdoctoral researcher will receive interdisciplinary training. In addition, this project will support a Latinx-directed STEM initiative for high-school students.\r\n\r\nThe project's main goal is to develop an experimental and analytical pipeline that will enable the establishment of rules of lifespan determination in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. Mathematical and statistical models that can predict lifespan of an individual based on lifelong activity of key aging pathways will be developed. The research tests whether variability in activity of key genes (due to biological noise or environmental or genetic perturbations) is propagated to variability in lifespan. To address this question, a microfluidic platform that enables monitoring of multiple individuals throughout their lifespan, while quantifying the activity of key aging pathways through endogenous fluorescent reporters, will be developed. The proposed platform will allow data pairing, where gene activity at the single individual level can be paired with its lifespan. Experimental tools that enable simultaneous quantitative analysis of in vivo gene activity and combinatorial environmental perturbations will be developed. These tools hinge on microfluidics, computer vision, automation, and new reporter strains engineered by CRISPR to track gene activity under endogenous regulatory control. The acquired data sets will be used to derive data-driven mathematical models that describe the stochastic dynamics of gene activity and its downstream phenotypic outcome: lifespan. Novel statistical techniques will be combined with mathematical models to infer phenotypic heterogeneity and robustness within populations. Interdisciplinary training will be provided to two graduate students and one postdoctoral researcher, and the award will support an educational program directed at broaden participation of Latinx high-school students in science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In particular, we aimed to understand how food intake changes the state of cells in the organism, and how this state ultimately regulates how long an animal lives. We refer to cell state as the activity of key genes that are known to play a role in longevity. It is known that different conditions, including reduced food intake, can turn on these key genes. The activity of these key genes, in turn, can extend lifespan. However, how multiple genes work together to establish lifespan is not entirely clear. To answer this question we worked with a nematode that is a useful system to study aging: <em>C. elegans. </em>We aimed to track these animals grown under different conditions throughout their entire life, while taking measurements of the activity of the key genes. To track individual animals, we aimed to develop a system where each nematode can grow and be monitored in a microchamber, while being fed bacteria. This microchamber array, however, is prone to clogging by bacteria. To solve this problem, we developed a system that filters bacterial flocs. This is a microfluidic device whose design was inspired by the feeding mechanism of the Manta Ray. We studied how different velocities in flow of bacterial suspensions changes the filtration efficiency. This system can be then incorporated with nematode microchambers for continuous feeding, while circumventing clogging. In addition, we also generated nematode strains that enabled direct analysis of the activity of the key genes mentioned above. To do this, we used a widely used DNA editing tool (CRISPR/Cas9), which allows precise cuts and insertions in the genomic DNA of the organism. We inserted the code for a fluorescent protein next to the code of the gene of interest. In this way, the animal generated a fluorescent version of the aging gene under study. Using fluorescence microscopy allows quantification of the levels and location within the cell of the protein of interest, at natural levels. We studied the patterns of this protein (called DAF-16) under a variety of conditions of food intake, and found that the levels of activity can predict how long animals live. In addition, we identified this protein localizes to important tissues and cells that had not been identified before. Finally, we also focused on the development of new approaches to analyze the structure of aging neurons. To do this, we incorporated computational approaches (deep learning) which are able to learn the specific changes in neurons that occur due to aging or other stressors. This approach allows unbiased, quantitative analysis of neurodegeneration, and revealed that the changes induced by aging and other stressors are different, suggesting these are generated through different biological mechanisms.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/23/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Adriana&nbsp;San Miguel</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1838314/1838314_10558319_1635531021170_Beading--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1838314/1838314_10558319_1635531021170_Beading--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Neuronal beading in C. elegans\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1838314/1838314_10558319_1635531021170_Beading--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Neuronal beading in C. elegans\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Deep learning captures changes in neuronal structure in aging and cold-shock</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sahand Saberi, Kevin Flores, Adriana San Miguel</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Adriana&nbsp;San Miguel</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Neuronal beading in C. elegans</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1838314/1838314_10558319_1635533220102_Picture1b--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1838314/1838314_10558319_1635533220102_Picture1b--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Microfluidic filtration system\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1838314/1838314_10558319_1635533220102_Picture1b--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Microfluidic filtration system\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Manta-Ray inspired filtration system for bacterial aggregates and particles</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Andrew Clark, Adriana San Miguel</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Adriana&nbsp;San Miguel</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Microfluidic filtration system</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1838314/1838314_10558319_1635533398340_daf-16--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1838314/1838314_10558319_1635533398340_daf-16--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"DAF-16::GFP endogenous tracking strain\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1838314/1838314_10558319_1635533398340_daf-16--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"DAF-16::GFP endogenous tracking strain\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">C. elegans expressing fluorescently tagged DAF-16 at endogenous levels</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Javier Huayta, Adriana San Miguel</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Adriana&nbsp;San Miguel</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">DAF-16::GFP endogenous tracking strain</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
