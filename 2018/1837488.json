 "awd_abstract_narration": "STEM domains have long provided productive contexts for problem solving research, a central learning objective in education for the 21st century. Problem solving and related constructs, such as critical thinking and computational thinking, are increasingly holding organizing power in the design and implementation of K-12 curriculum across educational domains. The Computer Science for All: Researcher-Practitioner Partnership (RPP) program is supporting this project, with an RPP team comprised of teachers, principals, researchers, professional development leaders, curriculum developers, and software engineers stretched across several institutions in Los Angeles, including three elementary public and charter schools, the University of California, Los Angeles, and a non-profit community learning center that develops CS curriculum and software. This project focuses on how to effectively teach problem solving practices in 3rd - 4th grade computer science classes, namely on how to build students' capacities to articulate their problem-solving process, understand how different strategies advance problem solving, and develop and enact new strategies for problem solving. The RPP will seed this problem solving process with 3rd and 4th graders traditionally marginalized in urban environments by designing CS lessons that promote sustained, rigorous, and collaborative reflection on problem-solving processes. This work will generate lesson templates and research findings valuable to educators interested in the intersection of problem solving and computer programming, and set the stage for larger scale research-practice partnership initiatives.\r\n\r\nThe RPP's approach will address a critical research need to understand how young students think about and pursue problem solving with code in the context of whole- and small-group classroom discourse, focused around facets of problem solving synthesized from the wider research literature: problem exploration, goal setting, implementation, monitoring, and reflection. The project team of curriculum designers, researchers, and practitioners will be informed by multiple data sources: observations of classroom practice, teacher interviews, designer interviews, school leader interviews, and bi-monthly student surveys. They will use a blend of design methodologies, agile development and design-research conjecture mapping, to iteratively and pragmatically aim to foster rich classroom discourse on CS problem solving processes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Specifically, the project sought to build students\u2019 capacities to articulate their problem solving process, understand how different strategies advance problem solving, and develop and enact new strategies for problem solving.

We completed the design of five curricular units (about 4-5 lessons each) framed around the following goals: \n\n\nCS Education and General Education Standards\n\n\nCommon Core State Standards and Next Generation Science Standards: When possible, curriculum was aligned to ELA, Math, and/or Science state standards to draw clear connections between computer science and the liberal arts. \n\n\nComputer Science Teacher Association Standards: These standards are slowly being adopted across the nation. Though the Los Angeles Unified School District has not formally adopted CSTA standards at the elementary level, these standards were used as a guide for rigor and relevance for student learning. \n\n\nCS Domain Practices: Along with the computer programming concepts of developing sequences, loops, and functions, teachers focused on developing thinking and problem solving skills like debugging, prototyping, iteration, and reflection. \n\n\n\n\nEquity Goals\n\n\nEconomic Participation: Participating in emerging labor markets agentively. \n\n\nDevelopment of Critical Tools: Students gaining CS-related and other ancillary knowledge and skills that will help them engage in social transformation. \n\n\nDevelopment of Educational Tools: To use CS as a space to express diverse student competencies, and to develop knowledge and skills that can be transferable to other educational domains. \n\n\n\n\nStudent Learning Outcomes\n\n\nGeneral Cognitive and Academic Development: Students develop general, transferable skills, mindsets, and knowledge that support broad problem-solving and academic participation.\n\n\nCoding Knowledge and Skills Development: Students develop proficiency, mindset, and skills to successfully solve CS-specific challenges.  \n\n\nMindsets Towards CS: Students feel motivation, engagement, interest, sense of competency, and belonging in CS.\n\n\nAgentic User of CS: Skills and knowledge to use CS to shape and design society with CS. \n\n\n\n\nPedagogy\n\n\nConnection to Real Life: Drawing on connections to phenomena outside of school, including the real life work of programmers, societal impacts, application in various professions and student interests. \n\n\nConnection to Other Content Areas: CS work informs, and is informed by student learning in other content areas. \n\n\nCognitive Support for PS: Focus and Scaffolding on problem-solving processes; making cognition visible; collaboration with others; classroom problem-solving discourse; metacognitive understanding of PS process. \n\n\nOpen-Ended, Design-Driven: Students engage in problems that are open-ended and design-driven. Asking them to construct knowledge and tools. \n\n\nAssigned Problem-Driven: Students work to solve a problem with an existing answer using CS concepts.\n\n\nClassroom Culture: The curriculum helps build a classroom culture that supports collaboration, perseverance, and agency. \n\n\nAesthetics and Ease of Use: Teachers and students need to find the curriculum aesthetically appealing and easy to use/learn from. \n\n\n\n\nOrganizational Assets and Needs\n\n\nTeacher capacity development in CS education\n\n\nBuilding organizational infrastructure and pipelines for CS education\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment of Collaborative Design Practices\nThe project developed effective processes to engage in collaborative design cycles between university researchers, curriculum designers, and teachers and administrators from four schools. These design cycles have been developed in order to:\n\n\nmaximally leverage the assets of each stakeholder groups;\n\n\nensure the designed curriculum meet the respective needs and priorities of each stakeholder group;\n\n\nexchange knowledge across the stakeholder groups;\n\n\ncontinuously refine curriculum, design frameworks and processes.\n\n\nensure the usability of the curriculum in individual teacher classrooms;\n\n\ncenter stakeholders\u2019 perspectives on equitable CS education in design of CS lessons. \n\n\n\n \nAcademic Research \nThe following articles have been prepared for forthcoming publication: \n\n\nGomez, K., Lee, U.
