 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant, under the direction of Professor Jaroslav Trnka of the University of California at Davis, supports the attendance of junior participants at the 2018 Amplitudes Summer School.  This event will be held June 11-15, 2018 at the Center for Quantum Mathematics and Physics (QMAP) on the campus of the University of California, Davis.\r\n\r\nThis event focuses on research associated with the modern amplitudes program.   This program focuses on the development of a new set of techniques for calculating the scattering of elementary particles against each other, as occurs in particle colliders.  Such new calculational techniques might even trigger a deeper, transformative understanding of quantum field theory itself --- the theory that combines quantum mechanics with special relativity.  Progress in this field has been accelerating over the past few years, and this event will provide a comprehensive introduction to some of the most exciting discoveries in this field. Participants at this week-long event will consist primarily of graduate students and postdocs who will gain cutting-edge exposure to the research associated with this research program from scientists who made some of the most important discoveries in this field.  The participants will also have the chance to present the results of their own research to their peers.  Thus the participants will not only receive training in one of the cutting-edge topics in theoretical high-energy physics, but also gain valuable talk-giving experience to help them sharpen their presentation skills.   This event thus serves the national interest not only by advancing fundamental science in the United States but also by simultaneously training the next generation of physicists to engage meaningfully in its development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
