 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an experimental study of how disordered materials flow.  The flow of materials like mud, cement, foam, and dirt in landslides is quite different from the flow of liquids.  These materials have been studied before but their complexity makes it difficult to determine general principles about how these interesting substances flow.  Some past studies used simple systems to try to mimic these complicated materials: a standard simple system is a liquid full of round particles with a specific size.  It is clear that these simple systems fail to reproduce many of the interesting flow behaviors of the real materials.  This work studies the flow of materials with intermediate complexity: liquids with particles with a wide variety of sizes in the same sample.  Optical microscopy is used to examine the motion of the particles and see how they rearrange, for example, how small particles are forced to move around large particles.  These observations will be used to develop basic ideas about the flow of other disordered materials, which will lead to better understanding of how to move, mix, and process complex materials of industrial relevance.  Undergraduate and graduate students will be engaged in conducting the research.  Additionally, the researchers regularly host field trips of visiting students (first grade through high school) to teach them about soft squishy materials and how scientists study these materials.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to understand how amorphous solids flow, in particular to connect particle-scale rearrangements to macroscopic flow profiles and rheological behavior.  The samples are highly polydisperse emulsions, where the largest droplets are ten times the radius of the smallest droplets (or more).  Flowing and sheared samples are studied with video and confocal microscopy.  This enables the motion of individual droplets to be measured.  When a large strain is applied, droplets rearrange irreversibly.  These rearrangements can be quantified in terms of topological changes, magnitudes of displacements, and how non-affine the flow is locally.  The project connects these details of droplet rearrangements to the size of individual droplets.  More broadly, these details likely depend on the overall droplet size distribution.  Additionally, the microscopic details must connect with macroscopic rheological properties.  Complementary experiments can be done with solid particles, and simulations provide a third route to explore these questions.  The overall motivation is to bridge the gap between prior model systems that studied mixtures of particles of fairly similar sizes, and complex real-world materials such as mud and cement.  This will lead to new microscopic understanding of the shear of amorphous materials with large size polydispersity.  At least one undergraduate and one graduate student will be involved with the research.  The research team will also host field trips each year to demonstrate to visiting students that cutting edge science can be done with simple materials which they can literally get their hands on.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMaterials such as sand, mud, emulsions, foams, and colloids are in between liquids and solids.  Mayonnaise is a common example of an emulsion, composed of oil droplets coated in egg proteins.  We examine how these sorts of materials behave when they flow, for example if they were moving through a pipe in a factory.  In particular, we focus on ?highly polydisperse? materials that are made from mixtures of particles or droplets with a wide range of sizes.  We have done simulations (and a few experiments) studying the flow of emulsions like mayonnaise.  Our main finding is that when these materials flow, small droplets try to move around the big droplets.  This causes all the droplets ? both big and small ? to move in directions that are different from the average flow direction.  However, the variability of motions is more extreme for the small droplets.  The variability is more dramatic when the material has a broader range of droplet sizes.  Moreover, knowing where the big droplets are in the material helps predict where the small droplets will be most likely to move in unusual ways.  We also discovered that the materials made from a broad range of droplet sizes are less viscous (by about 13%), meaning it is easier to make these materials flow.\n\nWe also did some related simulations studying how glassy materials flow.  Here we examined a computer model of glass.  Forcing such a material to flow in the simulation allows us to measure the stress required to cause it to flow, and the strain which is how much flow has occurred.  We found several properties of the flow behavior that behave in similar ways between systems with different temperatures, densities, and strain rates.  However, the maximum stress required to start the flow is a counterexample, which depends on temperature, density, and strain rate in a way that differs from the several other properties we studied.  This tested ?isomorph theory? which has found a large number of properties of liquids and glasses that follow universal behavior, so our finding of a counter-example is an intriguing challenge to this theory.\n\nAdditionally, our work had broader impacts related to training students.  We also conducted field trips with 1st grade and 6th grade students coming to our laboratory (pre-pandemic), showing them the fun science we do.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/04/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric R Weeks"
