 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experimental distributed computing services are becoming vital to support emerging cyberphysical systems.  But the capital investment and operational expenses required to sustain experimental research testbeds to host these vital services can grow large. In this project the Leafy edge compute cloud explores a new model for computing research infrastructure -- a software-only, geographically decentralized cloud testbed that expands in size through voluntary contributions of available computing hardware, on a part- or full-time basis. The LEAFY Cloud offers the prospect of a virtuous cycle: as more sites join the LEAFY edge cloud, more software developers and experimenters are attracted to the infrastructure, resulting in the deployment of more applications and services, increasing the value of new contributors offering to host a compute resource.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop and prototype a viral, sustainable, software-only distributed testbed for Cloud-in-the-Loop Systems, and to explore the issues involved in supporting distributed computing experiments and services. It will incorporate modern orchestration, management, and tenancy technologies, and rely heavily on open source virtualization and cloud management software technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes. LEAFY will be the first multi-tenant wide-area distributed system to deploy systems and experiments using a state-of-the-art micro-services architecture. Two experiments will be hosted and analyzed to evaluate the system: a Distributed Collaborative Visualization System and the Global Data Plane.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nEdgeNet pioneered a new kind of Cloud -- one that  presents the functionality of any Cloud but offers much faster response times and much higher bandwidth than any existing Cloud; but one that also costs much less and is far more sustainable than today?s giant, centralized Clouds.\nA miracle?  Not really.  In fact, EdgeNet uses the same strategy that launched the Internet in the eighties and the World Wide Web in the nineties -- a bottom-up, live-off-the-land strategy that utilizes existing local resources to grow without bounds.  \nThe need for a new kind of cloud, an edge cloud, is due to the tyranny of latency -- the delay between a request and its answer.  Giant, centrally-administered Clouds can only afford a few tens of points of presence worldwide, meaning that the nearest Cloud node is often hundreds of kilometers away.  And distance is time -- hundreds of kilometers translates into tens of milliseconds of delay.  This added delay means that many applications can?t be run in the Cloud.  These applications include: real-time collaboration around big data; VR rendered in the Cloud and streamed as videos to headsets; real-time control of the Internet of Things; real-time AI-based object recognition; and many others.\nTo run these applications in the Cloud, and thus make them available through \"thin\" clients such as tablets and phones, a new kind of Cloud is needed -- one that is close to the end-user or end-device, anywhere on Earth.  But building this Cloud the traditional way would be prohibitively expensive and cumbersome.  A simple theorem from plane geometry shows that reducing the maximum distance (and thus latency) to a cloud point of presence by a factor of n requires and increase in the number of POPs by a factor of n2.  In other words, to reduce latency by a factor of 10 would require 100 datacenters for every datacenter today.  Clearly a new architecture is required.\nThe world has faced this before; in the early 1990s, there was tremendous interest in digital libraries.  Holding all the world?s information was a staggering task.  But it was solved by something very simple -- an easy-to-parse text format, a universal protocol which permitted one computer to send a file to another, and an easy way to join.  In those days, all one had to do to set up a website was to download a simple program, run it, and put HTML files in the appropriate directory.  A universal digital library built itself in a decade, by the local actions of first thousands, then millions of people who brought up webservers on their workstations and personal computers.\nEdgeNet is a prototype of a Cloud designed to spread as the Web spread -- by local action of individuals, on campuses, in businesses and in homes.  EdgeNet is simply a worldwide cluster built on Kubernetes (K8s) and Docker technology, and an EdgeNet worker node is any computer with a routable IP address  running  K8s worker software, including a VM running on a local Cloud.\nThe EdgeNet project was a preliminary attempt to investigate the feasibility of such a bottom-up, live-off-the-land Cloud.  In particular, it attempted to answer the questions:\n\n\nCould standard Cloud management software (Kubernetes) function in a highly-distributed environment?\n\n\nCould developers deploy applications across the edge cloud using standard cloud deployment techniques and technologies (kubectl)?\n\n\nCould nodes be added seamlessly and automatically, simply by installing the Kubernetes worker node software?\n\n\nCould a skeleton, part-time team maintain the cluster?\n\n\nWe have operated EdgeNet continuously, reaching over 35 nodes in five countries on three continents, and demonstrated that the answers to each of these questions is \"Yes\".  In particular, EdgeNet runs standard Kubernetes software, unmodified, as a single worldwide cluster.  Applications are deployed and maintained using standard Kubernetes tools and techniques, unmodified.  Nodes are added to the cluster by downloaded a simple shell script and running it on a local node; it takes about a minute to join the cluster.  And a team of a couple of part-time researchers in North America and colleagues at PlanetLab Europe in France have maintained the cluster.\nPlanetLab Europe intends to switch its infrastructure to EdgeNet in 2019, bringing the total size of the EdgeNet cluster to several hundred nodes worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/23/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Patrick Mcgeer"
