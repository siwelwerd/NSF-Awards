 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the establishment of an officially-supported version of the Weather and Research Forecast (WRF) model in the cloud environment.  WRF is the world's most popular numerical weather prediction model and is supported by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) for a community of users across universities, research labs, and operational weather centers.  This project will address fundamental issues such as modeling system accessibility, improvement of model support to the research and educational user communities, student and scientist training, and facilitation of model development. Given WRF's prominence in both atmospheric research and real-time weather forecasting, this work will not only promote the advancement of science, but also will contribute to the vigor of development and application of one of the nation's cyberinfrastucture (CI) assets, a key weather prediction model used at operational centers and for public purposes.  Furthermore, this project will contribute to education at minority-serving institutions and will yield tools to better the training of new generations of the nation's atmospheric scientists. Lastly, the project will leverage the resources and support of commercial cloud service providers to serve these national interests, in a collaboration of the principal researchers with industry.\r\n\r\nThe viability of running the WRF in the cloud has been previously demonstrated, and this project would advance the field by configuring and supporting the official version of the WRF in the cloud, with an up-to-date, cloud-configured version of the WRF system code synced to the WRF GitHub repository.  Other materials that will be available include the WRF tutorial materials and system documentation, WRF input and output datasets, and the WRF Testing Framework code analysis package.  The project will produce a configured and documented cloud WRF system that will open a new arena for model use and that will enhance the efficiency of both user support and the integration of contributed model improvements.  This cloud capability will exploit an emerging common cyber-ground to facilitate code development for the target model and allow for critical reproducibility in code analysis and testing.  It will advance the delivery of modeling system tutorials, and thus scientist training and education, through establishing globally-accessible modeling spaces, enhancing instruction portability and access, decreasing costs for host institutions, and improving usability of on-line materials.  These new cloud capabilities will be addressing bottlenecks in model support and development, and once developed, the CI can be adapted for other community models, thus benefiting other scientific disciplines and their tools via its reuse.\r\n\r\nThis award by the NSF Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the Cross-Cutting Program within the NSF Directorate for Geosciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project has exploited the emerging technology of cloud computing to advance the world's most popular numerical weather prediction (NWP) model, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model and its critical community support effort.  It has created and documented cyberinfrastructure (CI) capabilities to run WRF in the cloud.  In doing so it has expanded system accessibility, improved user community support and training, and removed a bottleneck in the model development path.  The project has also provided the cloud-based systems and materials produced to universities to advance education and research.\n\nThe main project products have been: cloud-adapted and set up versions of the WRF system code; Cloud WRF tutorial materials; configured cloud environments for supporting WRF Model tutorials; and a cloud code testing tool to assist WRF developers in code preparation and submission.  These cloud-based cyberinfrastructure capabilities for WRF have advanced model support and development and have facilitated community use of this key NWP system.\n\nThis project has established the WRF modeling system and environment for community use on two cloud service provider environments: Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Scala Computing.  The broad WRF user community now has documented cloud WRF systems for these environments.\n\nThe project has produced CI to support student and scientist training in regularly-offered WRF Model tutorials, and the materials were used and refined in four tutorials delivered within the project period.  The CI and cloud resources have significantly improved the hands-on training component of the basic model tutorials. \n\nThe project produced a Cloud WRF tutorial and accompanying documentation.  This has been delivered to students and faculty at collaborators North Carolina A&amp;T State University and Colorado State University.  Students and staff at these schools will be pursuing cloud applications using the CI created.\n\nLastly, the project has built a cloud-based tool for the automated testing of code contributed to WRF.  This CI element employs the continuous integration utility Jenkins to launch and report on regression tests on new WRF codes.  The tool runs automatically on code submissions to the WRF Github code repository.  This has met the previous need for much more extensive, efficient, and user-friendly testing for the modeling system and has removed a bottleneck in the development process.  The CI will be used for another community atmospheric model at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and thus the CI will be reused.\n\nThe project has advanced the training of university students and the professional development of project scientists.  It has yielded a paper describing the cyberinfrastructure created and the application to advance atmospheric science and education.\n\nThis project has succeeded in positioning the popular WRF Model for cloud use, benefitting thousands of users worldwide, and future users to come.  Atmospheric modeling is increasingly seeking to take advantage of cloud computing, and with WRF a key model, this project has advanced numerical weather prediction and atmospheric sciences.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/01/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jordan G Powers"
