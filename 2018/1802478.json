 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference \"Vertex operator algebras, number theory, and related topics\" will be held at California State University, Sacramento from June 11-15th, 2018. The conference is designed to bring together a diverse international pool of researchers with expertise in algebra, number theory, and conformal field theory in theoretical physics to discuss a variety of topics related to the intersection of these fields. In particular, a wide range of junior and senior researchers from varying institutions will disseminate recent work, discuss the current state of intersection among their fields, exchange ideas on common problems, and form new collaborations. The conference will focus on two main objectives. First, the dissemination of recent and developing research trends within the focused research areas of number theory, vertex operator algebras (VOAs), and their intersection will help advance the mathematical sciences, allow researchers to stay up to date with developments in the field, and allow participants to form new connections among different research areas.  Second, the conference aims to help train and develop young and diverse scientists in the mathematical and physical sciences, while introducing them to new ideas and the international community. Presentations by senior scientists will aid in this process.\r\n\r\nThe conference will include forty research presentations covering a range of topics related to the intersection of vertex operator algebras, number theory, and conformal field theory. This will include topics such as group theory, Lie algebras, modular and other automorphic forms, quantum groups, representation theory, tensor category theory, and theoretical physics, as well as applications and intersections of these areas. Due to the rapidly changing landscape of these mathematical fields, and their intersection with theoretical physics, this conference serves as a timely and important opportunity for the research community to share and disseminate knowledge in order to advance new research developments. An important theme that will be highlighted is the interplay between the theory of VOAs and automorphic forms. The presentations will be chronicled on the conference website. The conference webpage is http://www.csus.edu/math/2018conf.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
