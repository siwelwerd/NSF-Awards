 "awd_abstract_narration": "While most coral reefs in the world are threatened by multiple disturbances that are driving coral cover downward, the coral reefs at Mo'orea, French Polynesia, provide a striking exception. However, it is not yet clear what makes the coral communities of Mo'orea an exception to the trend of global decline in coral cover, and what drives spatial variation in recovery patterns around the island. The most recent wave of recovery on the outer reefs is dominated by corals in the genus Pocillopora (the cauliflower coral). While the colonies of this coral all look similar to one another, they actually represent multiple 'hidden' species that are genetically divergent but visibly indistinguishable. The morphological similarity makes it hard to identify species in the field, and this often forces researchers to pool these corals into a single group, which has impeded a full understanding of coral recovery. The ecological differences among these hidden species remain poorly understood, but they may be a crucial factor keeping the ecosystem in a coral-dominated state. This project is studying how 'hidden diversity' provides a form of 'ecological insurance' that provides reef-building coral communities around this island with ecological and evolutionary options that buffer reefs from unpredictable and unfavorable environmental conditions. If multiple cryptic species exhibit a diversity of responses to disturbance and stress, then it increases the ability of the community to recover and re-organize after impacts compared to that if all the species responded the same way. By studying the reefs at Mo'orea, this project provides unique, important, and transferable knowledge to better understand fundamental mechanism driving coral community recovery following catastrophic damage, and will provide much-needed information to better manage coral reefs and favor them remaining in a coral-dominated state. A PhD student and a postdoctoral researcher at Florida State University (FSU) are being supported and mentored during the project, and a program of professional growth is being provided for a technician who will work on the project. The investigators are working with science educators from Florida schools to introduce marine biology clubs that will provide outreach opportunities for FSU and California State University Northridge participants to engage high school students and teachers in the research themes at the core of this project.\r\n\r\nThis project will test the hypothesis that the presence of morphologically similar yet genetically divergent lineages of corals in the genus Pocillopora drives rapid recovery of coral communities dominated by Pocillopora on the outer reefs of Mo'orea, French Polynesia. By creating a diverse portfolio in the capacity of the Pocillopora community to recover and reorganize after disturbance, hidden ecological differences among coral lineages in their response to disturbance is expected to promote community resilience. A well-studied genetic marker will be used to distinguish coral colonies among different lineages. Field-based projects, co-located with Moorea Coral Reef-Long-Term Ecological Research (MCR-LTER) sites, will determine how pocilloporid lineages differ in their distribution and abundance, spatial and temporal patterns of annual recruitment, symbiont composition, and post-settlement growth and survival. These data will be used to build Integral Projection Models (IPMs) to compare population differences among lineages in their sensitivity to size-dependent perturbations, and their capacity for population growth following disturbance. Results from the field projects and IPMs will be synthesized to estimate response diversity as the multivariate dispersion of lineage dissimilarity, and to assess the extent to which it predicts variation among sites in the recovery rate of pocilloporid percent cover, estimated empirically from the MCR-LTER time series. The intellectual merits of this project lie in developing new and transferable understanding of: i) the ecological differences within an ecologically important coral genus, ii) why pocilloporids at Mo'orea are an exception to the global trend of declining coral cover, and iii) the potential for hidden response diversity to act as a fundamental mechanism determining the capacity for coral communities to reestablish and reorganize following disturbances.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The field work component was based at the University of California Berkely Gump Station in Moorea, French Polynesia. The research integrated with, and added value to, the Moorea Coral Reef (MCR) Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site, also supported by the US National Science Foundation.</p>\r\n<p>Coral reefs are an important source of food, income, medicine, and protection, but are globally in decline, which affects the US both directly and indirectly. Perhaps surprisingly, much of the biodiversity on coral reefs remains to be properly described so there is still much to learn about why some locations appear more resilient than others. Corals that look similar to each other but are genetically divergent because of different evolutionary histories are called cryptic species. Cryptic species are being increasingly discovered in many types of coral.</p>\r\n<p>The <em>intellectual merit</em> of this work was the advance in knowledge for how cryptic coral species can, on the one hand create diverse portfolios in the capacity of biological communities to recover and reorganize after disturbance, and on the other hand reveal species with population sizes and geographic ranges that are smaller than previously thought with higher vulnerability to environmental change. We used modern genomic techniques to delineate six cryptic species of cauliflower coral (Pocillopora) and reveal their evolutionary relationships to each other, as well as to the suite of symbiotic algae hosted in the coral&rsquo;s cells. In 2019, there was a severe marine heatwave that caused about 70% of the corals to die at Moorea. Larger corals bleached and died more than smaller corals, leading many to conclude that coral size mediates bleaching. Our research discovered that one particular species (genetically identified), which was also quite common and had large colony sizes, suffered much higher mortality than the other five species. As a result, we were able to show that differences in coral bleaching and mortality were explained by different tolerances among cryptic species, and not the size of the coral. This discovery led to a fundamentally different interpretation of the mechanisms explaining why some corals bleach while others do not. We also discovered that different cryptic species prefer to live in different habitats within the reef. Such niche partitioning is important because it sheds light on how cryptic species diverged evolutionarily, how they coexist without outcompeting each other, and how restoration initiatives should consider the location and choice of corals to focus on. We also performed a series of aquarium experiments that showed how cryptic species have different physiological responses to environmental factors like temperature and light, both of which differ among habitats and are changing over time. Overall, this project has changed the way researchers study cauliflower corals, shown how cryptic coral species affect ecological processes that are relevant beyond corals, and positioned the research community, including the MCR LTER, to pursue new research questions and directions. The project has produced 11 peer-reviewed papers so far, many as open access.</p>\r\n<p>The results of this research had <em>broader impacts</em> that were directly relevant to management decisions and restoration initiatives because the project generated new knowledge of the species diversity within the main type of reef building coral, uncovered how different habitats within coral reefs contain different cryptic species, and revealed that marine heatwaves affect some cryptic species but not others. The project contributed to STEM education by supporting three PhD students and two undergraduate students. The project contributed to developing a competitive STEM workforce by mentoring one postdoctoral scholar and four research technicians. The project increased participation of the best and brightest in STEM by training and mentoring six women and two people from an underrepresented group. One student from the latter group was also supported with supplemental funding (INTERN) to do a non-academic research internship at the NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center. The internship provided training and professional development to expand the student&rsquo;s preparation for a wider range of career paths after graduation. There were also numerous public engagement activities including communicating results via public lectures at local libraries, and by press releases and news articles of key findings. We also described a new species of <em>Pocillopora</em> at Moorea, and deposited a specimen at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History.
