 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will document seed-bearing plants that lived during the age of dinosaurs in Mongolia and Inner Mongolia, China. Sediments laid down 100-125 million years ago in these areas produce many exceptionally well-preserved fossils that capture the biodiversity of Asia at the very beginning of the rise of flowering plants. Many seed-bearing plants during this time were close relatives of flowering plants yet later became extinct for reasons that are not well understood. Documenting these extinct seed-bearing plants will allow scientists to more fully understand the ecology of this ancient environment and the evolution of seed plants, including flowering plants that form the foundation of terrestrial ecosystems today. Researchers will unearth and describe seed plants preserved as compressed as well as three-dimensional fossils from multiple field sites. The project will train undergraduate and graduate students, including members of groups that are under-represented in science, and support the professional development of an early-career researcher. Researchers will educate the public about the Mongolian fossils by authoring a book of popular science non-fiction intended for wide audiences. Their outreach activities will build on popular interest in dinosaurs and will include materials and exhibits produced through the Chicago Botanic Garden. Project personnel will use next-generation science standards to engage middle-school students via an online, bilingual illustrated series about paleontology and earth science. \r\n\r\nThis project will contribute to a deeper understanding of a critical ecological transition period in the history of life. Research will add significantly to existing knowledge about seed plant diversity during the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous in Asia and the global distributions of these species. Researchers will uncover numerous fossil fragments of species, which will allow unprecedented opportunity to reassemble whole plants and compare different developmental stages. Researchers will analyze the morphology and anatomy of these fossils using scanning electron microscopy and high-resolution X-ray microtomography. Newly excavated and existing fossil specimens are expected to yield species new to science and as well as new insights about previously described species. Outcomes of this project will include improved understanding of ancient ecosystems, the historical biogeography of extinct seed plants across continents, and the homology of pollen- and seed-bearing organs among living and extinct seed plants, including flowering plants. The project will create new fossil collections and strengthen international research collaborations among US, Russian, Mongolian and Chinese scientists.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The late Jurassic and early Cretaceous is a critical interval in plant evolution and Mongolia and Inner Mongolia, China, are a paleobotanically poorly explored part of the world. Although much work has been done on fossil vertebrates from this region, very little work has been done on the fossil plants that formed the ecosystems in which the vertebrates lived. Our study of fossil plants from the Jurassic and Cretaceous of this region has revealed a diverse assemblage of plants that thrived just before the flowering plants became diverse and abundant and became the dominant group of plants in most terrestrial ecosystems around the world. The fossil plant material has been studied using light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and high-resolution X-ray microtomography. The excellent preservation of the fossils provides a rare opportunity to reconstruct extinct Jurassic and Cretaceous age ?whole plants? from multiple co-occurring fossil organs including leaves, stems, seeds, cones, pollen, etc. The fossil plants documented in this study reveal a diverse assemblage of fossil gymnospermous seed plants that were unknown prior to our work. Surprisingly, no fossil flowering plants were discovered in our research. Thus these fossil assemblages document the forests of central Asia just prior to the invasion of flowering plants. The primary objective for the study has been to develop a deeper understanding of seed plant evolution and diversity during the Mesozoic. The research adds to knowledge about extinct seed plants during the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous, an interval of major and rapid evolutionary and vegetational change, immediately prior to the major diversification of flowering plants and the extinction of many ancient groups of Mesozoic seed plants. In addition to providing new information about plant diversity in the Mesozoic, the project has strengthened international collaboration among US, Mongolian, Chinese and Russian scientists and students. In addition to publishing scientific papers, the research team has participated in outreach activities to public audiences at museums, botanic gardens, and geology and paleontology clubs.</span></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/27/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Patrick&nbsp;S&nbsp;Herendeen</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1748286/1748286_10541652_1693152151828_KrassiloviahabitFINAL2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1748286/1748286_10541652_1693152151828_KrassiloviahabitFINAL2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Reconstruction of Krassilovia mongolica\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1748286/1748286_10541652_1693152151828_KrassiloviahabitFINAL2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Reconstruction of Krassilovia mongolica\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Reconstruction of a branch of Krassilovia mongolica bearing terminal seed cones and alternately arranged leafy shoots of Podozamites harrisii.
