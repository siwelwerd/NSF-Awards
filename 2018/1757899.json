 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the College of Charleston, located in Charleston, SC, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2018- 2020.  Research is conducted at Fort Johnson, located just across the harbor from downtown Charleston.  Fort Johnson is a marine science campus that houses the College's Grice Marine Laboratory and research labs from four federal and state partner institutions that contribute to the program.  The program focuses on how organisms, populations, communities and ecosystems respond to natural or anthropogenic change in marine environments.  Student projects involve issues like environmental variability, climate change, coastal development, species introductions and contaminants. In addition to being engaged in full-time research in the lab or field, students will participate in seminars, discussions, field trips and workshops to develop science communication and professional skills.  Students will be housed in the Grice Marine Laboratory dormitory.  Students from schools with limited marine research opportunities and from underrepresented groups are especially encouraged to apply.  Participants are selected based on potential career benefits, on the diversity that each student contributes to the intern group, and on evidence of strong potential for academic and personal achievement.  \r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited opportunities in marine research, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, how different scientific institutions formulate and address research questions, how the graduate school application process is carried out, what kinds of scientific careers are available, and how scientific information is presented to public and professional audiences.  Many will present the results of their work through scientific conferences and publications.\r\n\r\nA common web-based assessment tool used by all REU Site programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program.  Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system, and student career paths will be tracked after the program. More information about the program is available by visiting http://reu.cofc.edu or by contacting the PI (Dr. Robert Podolsky, reu@cofc.edu).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Fort Johnson REU summer program (FJ-REU) is a ten-week internship that combines independent research with workshop activities to promote STEM career development and communication skills.  The program provided these experiences to 33 undergraduate student interns over the three years it ran (2018, 2019, 2021).  Student participants were drawn from 17 U.S. states and included 48% underrepresented minorities and &gt;75% from non-PhD granting institutions, providing research experience in marine biology to students with traditionally fewer opportunities.  The broad theme of the program, \"Marine Organism Health: Resilience and Response to Environmental Change,\" enabled interns to pursue a range of molecular and organismal approaches to topics in the marine biology of environmental stresses and contaminants, population and community ecology, and species invasions involving bacteria, archaea, algae, sponges, snails, corals, crabs, shrimp, sea urchins, horseshoe crabs, fishes, frogs, sea turtles, sea lions, and manatees.  Many of the species studied have implications for conservation or are commercially important. \n\nThe Fort Johnson campus where the program is housed is a consortium of five partner institutions: two state academic institutions (the College of Charleston and the Medical University of South Carolina), one state government agency (Department of Natural Resources), and two federal agencies (National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Institutes of Standards and Technology).  Participating mentors were drawn from all of these institutions across the Fort Johnson campus.  By leveraging the strengths of this partnership, the program provided interns with exposure to diversity in the culture and practice of science in different institutional frameworks, including familiarity with how environmental questions are formulated and addressed by mission-based and inquiry-based institutions.  Although cancelled by COVID in 2020, we were able to keep the program running in 2021 despite COVID-constraints by giving research opportunities to 13 local students.\n\nIn addition to having students carry out independent research under a faculty mentor, a second major component of the program was a Science Communication Workshop Series (SCICOMM).  The SCICOMM series, led by the PI, developed skills and an awareness of opportunities for presenting science to public audiences and professional audiences.  The communication products developed by SCICOMM for public audiences involved traditional and social media platforms.  Over the years we have given interns experience with different kinds of communication products&mdash;an intern science blog (https://blogreu.wordpress.com/), science communication videos (e.g., https://podolskyr.people.cofc.edu/reu/Mateos.mp4\n\n), national podcast interviews (https://gricemarinelab.cofc.edu/public-engagement/index.php#cc), community events (https://www.cultivatesciart.org/2021-summer-pop-ups) and press releases&mdash;all designed to educate the public about the impact of their research on environmental health.  Each intern also engaged in the production of scholarship for professional audiences included a scientific research proposal poster, a research manuscript and a colloquium presentation.  Research done as part of this grant has resulted in at least 3 peer-reviewed publications with intern co-authors, at least 13 intern presentations at national meetings, and at least 3 best student presentation awards.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/15/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert D Podolsky"
