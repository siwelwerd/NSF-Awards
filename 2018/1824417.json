 "awd_abstract_narration": "The basic idea of plate tectonics is built on a simplified view that the lithosphere (the outermost layer of the solid earth) is broken into rigid pieces that drift around relative to each other without deforming internally, like puzzle pieces that are moved around to make a picture but don't themselves change shape or size.  This works well to capture the motions of pieces once their boundaries are well-developed, but doesn't explain how the pieces are made in the first place, such as how the African piece breaks into several parts along the East African Rift System.  This experiment is focused on quantifying the role of three different factors in influencing plate break-up: preexisting structures in the lithosphere; present topography; and the convecting mantle beneath.  The Turkana Depression of northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia is an ideal place to investigate these issues: it is probably the location where anomalous mantle first interacted with the African lithosphere to produce magma, it has considerable inherited structure, and it has very little topography compared to adjacent parts of the rift.  The scientific and broader impacts of this project are significant. An international team supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation and the U.K. Natural Environment Research Council and including scientists from the US, UK, Kenya, and Ethiopia will undertake both field observations and scientific computing.  The work will support graduate and undergraduate students at the two collaborating US institutions. Knowing how new plate boundaries form in space and time allows us to better understand the tectonic evolution of the planet over its long history, to identify past, current, and future plate boundaries, and to understand the natural hazards associated with tectonic boundaries, such as earthquakes and volcanos.\r\n\r\nNonlinear interactions among mechanical competence, gravitational potential, mantle dynamics, and magmatism determine how continental plate boundaries evolve over time.  The East African Rift System (EARS), is an ideal natural laboratory for rifting processes.  For example, because the far-field boundary conditions on the whole EARS are the same, systematic comparisons of strain accommodation in melt-rich and melt-poor sectors have illuminated the role of heating and composition. Comparing sectors with and without large lateral material heterogeneities has revealed the role of pre-existing lithospheric architecture; comparing sectors with different total finite strain can be used as proxies for evolution. What remains to be considered, however, is the role of gravitational potential energy (GPE) through a comparison of a rift sector in high topography to one in low topography. Although the seismically and volcanically active Turkana Depression appears to represent the end member conditions of very low topography, very high material heterogeneity, and elevated mantle geotherms, it has yet to be investigated in detail with modern geophysical methods. This project involves a multi-method geophysical investigation of the Turkana Depression, combining seismic and geodetic data collection for seismic imaging, earthquake source mechanisms, surface kinematics, crustal strain rates, and structural architecture. Systematic comparisons of the data products to one another, combined with inverse models of geodetic, structural, and earthquake data and limited forward numerical simulations of rift topography and strain patterns will test basic hypotheses about the role of GPE and crustal architecture in continental rifting. Doing so will help to resolve the longer-term rift evolution, especially the role of one or two mantle plumes, inherited continental structure from Mesozoic rifting, and topographic feedbacks in contributing to and shaping continental breakup. Such constraints on the dynamics of rifting will, in turn, enable a better understanding of the exchange of mass and heat between the lithosphere and mantle, long timescale continental tectonic plate and boundary behavior, and the spatial and temporal distribution of hazards and resources associated with magmatic rifting.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merit\n\nFor at least 3 billion years, Earth's continental plates have rifted apart to create new ocean basins that later close in subduction.  Yet, rift initiation within cold, thick, strong lithosphere and eventual rupture remain debated.  The seismically and volcanically active East African rift system includes regions where heating and mass movement through volcanic processes reshape the crust, and other areas lacking volcanism.  It also has regions of rifting on uplifted plateaus and depressions.  Comparisons between diverse regions will enable us to answer the longstanding question:  What controls the location of rifting and magmatism in cold, thick continental lithosphere ?  Between 2019 and 2021, our team of U.S., U.K., Kenyan and Ethiopian scientists deployed U.S. and U.K. seismic and Global Positioning System (GPS) instruments across the East African rift system in Kenya and Ethiopia to image the crust and upper mantle and to measure plate opening directions and velocities to infill a critical gap in knowledge and to distinguish between competing models for continental breakup: mantle plumes, inherited continental structure from a rifting event 80 My ago, or gravitational potential energy from large topographic variations.  Such constraints on the dynamics of rifting will in turn enable us to better understand the time and space  distribution of hazards and resources associated with rifting.\n\nThese new data and existing data enable, for the first time, a complete picture toevaluate the forces driving extension. Using a combination of seismic methods we image multiple mantle plumes rising beneath the African plate.  The buoyant material below the plate dynamically uplifts the entire region, including the low-lying Turkana Depression. This broad, anomalously hot upwelling may have contributed to the 45 million years to present volcanism in southwestern Ethiopia.   The low-lying Turkana Depression, therefore, is a consequence of multiple episodes of crustal thinning, and not a lack of dynamic support from buoyant mantle upwellings.  \n\nOwing to the directional dependence of seismic velocity, or anisotropy, in rocks that have been deformed, we have measured the direction of the fast polarization plane in the crust and mantle beneath the region.   These analyses support the interpretation of a dynamic connection through the Turkana Depression.  We find no rotation in the direction of faster polarized waves as they encounter pre-existing fault zones and sutures between ancient continental masses.  Instead, we find that rift-parallel zones of molten rock, called dikes, are likely causes of the observed seismic anisotropy.  Seismic imaging and earthquake locations provide ittle evidence for control by pre-existing structures in the plates. Pre-existing crustal thin zones do not necessarily represent zones of plate weakness where subsequent phases of rifting will develop.\n\nThe distribution of earthquakes, including one Mw5 earthquake detected on global networks, and the GPS opening direction demonstrate low elevation and high-elevation regions are active, as are areas with and without Holocene magmatism. Variations in the active plate boundary's location, orientation and plate velocity correlate with lithospheric heterogeneities.  Areas lacking recent volcanism coincide with ~250 km-wide rift zones underlain by seismically fast, and probably stronger lithosphere, whereas volcanically active areas are characterized by ~100 km-wide zones of rifting.   \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThis UK-US-Kenya-Ethiopia project infilled a critical data gap to constrain plume dynamics beneath the East African rift system, Earth?s archetypal rift zone.  The collaborative work also trained a diverse group of scientists.  The data have been used in theses and papers by US-UK-Kenyan-Ethiopian students and early career scientists.  One U.S. PhD student, 1 MSc student, and 2 undergraduate students have participated in laboratory and field work in Kenya.   One Kenyan student completed his MSc on data from this project, and a female Kenyan student in the University of Nairobi-Uppsala University sandwich program, is using data from this project in her PhD thesis.  Five additional Kenyan students participated in field work.    \n\nOur data inform geothermal energy potential in the region, as well as groundwater resources.  The Kenyan MSc graduate is now employed to use our data on a groundwater project funded through UNESCO in Kenya.  Our work provides, for the first time, information on the seismic and volcanic hazards of this remote region. Active fault zones and volcanic zones have been delineated and shared with governmental and academic agencies in Kenya and Ethiopia.   Earthquakes span the entire crust, meaning that potentially damaging earthquakes are possible; the M5 earthquake in 2020 is probably not the largest the region has experienced.  These results inform future development projects, and ongoing oil and water drilling in the region.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/28/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Cynthia J Ebinger"
