 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multiple astronomical observations have established that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of known particles. Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. One of the most exciting quests in particle physics is the search for new particles beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Extensions of the Standard Model predict not only new particles with large masses but also some with very small masses. Such a candidate is the axion, which has been introduced to explain the smallness of Charge-Parity (CP) violation in Quantum Chromodynamics and which turns out to also be a prime candidate for a constituent of the dark matter in the universe. The Axion Resonant InterAction DetectioN Experiment (ARIADNE) is designed to search for axion-mediated spin-dependent interactions between nuclei at sub-millimeter ranges. The experiment involves a rotating non-magnetic mass to source the axion field, and a dense ensemble of laser-polarized He-3 nuclei to detect the axion field by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. \r\n\r\nWhile participating in this research, a team of postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduate researchers will be broadly trained in the techniques of experimental atomic physics, optical pumping, nuclear magnetic resonance, low-temperature physics, micro-fabrication, magnetic shielding, vacuum systems, and modeling. This will be valuable preparation for work in basic or applied research, either in the U.S. or international work force or scientific community.\r\n\r\nThe signal from an axion field can be resonantly enhanced by properly modulating the axion potential at the nuclear spin precession frequency. The goal of this award is to complete construction of the experiment, bring it through its commissioning phase during which possible systematics will be evaluated, and start the early data taking stage, exploring new parameter space for the PQ axion. The method has the potential to improve previous experimental and astrophysical bounds on axions by several orders of magnitude and probe deep into the theoretically interesting regime for the PQ axion. The experiment is also sensitive to more exotic axion-like particles. The new method can ultimately exceed present laboratory constraints on spin-dependent short-range forces by up to 8 orders of magnitude and can improve on the combined laboratory/astrophysical limits by a factor of 10^4 in the axion mass range of ma between 10 micro-eV and 10 milli-eV, probing deep into the traditional \"PQ-axion window\".\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project continued research and development on the ARIADNE experiment, the goal of which is to search for so-called \"axion\" particles, which are a theoretically well-motivated candidate for the dark matter of the universe.  The nature of the dark matter, which seems to make up about 1/4 of the total mass content of the universe, is a wide open scientific question, and so it is important to investigate all reasonable possibilities for its identity.\n\nIn this experiment, we will look for a very small change in the direction of a collection of helium-3 (3He) nuclear spins as a notched tungsten wheel is spun in very close proximity.  The dense, non-magnetic tungsten mass would act as the source of an axion field if such a field exists.  The wheel is spun at a rotation frequency which is in resonance with the 3He nuclei as they precess like tops in an external magnetic field.  If the axion exists, the spinning mass will produce an oscillating axion field which interacts with the 3He spins and causes them to tip, a resonant effect similar to what happens when you push someone on a swing.  We would detect this tip in direction using the same type of technology used in the magnetic resonance imaging employed in many hospitals.\n\nThis experiment is a collaboration between Indiana University (IU), Northwestern, Stanford, the Center for Axion and Precision Physics (CAPP) in Daejon, South Korea, and the National Metrology Institute of Germany (PTB).  Our responsibility at IU was to demonstrate a low temperature test system for the experiment (which must be conducted at 4 degrees above absolute zero), to test whether the residual magnetic fields of the tungsten mass as it spins are small enough not to cause problems in the experiment, and to install a shaft in the mass and apply a periodic reflective pattern to its surface for precision assessment of its spin rate with a laser.\n\nTo these ends, the discovery of excessive magnetized welds in the cryostat originally planned for the polarized 3He test measurements at 4K necessitated another solution.  A refurbished, non-magnetic cryostat was completely redesigned and is under construction at IU, where it will be integrated into the completed magnetic field coil and laser polarization system for 3He.  We will soon install custom glass test cells, made by a glassblower at Notre Dame, to guide the polarized 3He atoms to the low temperature part of the apparatus.  We have also designed and started construction of a second test system which will allow the polarized 3He gas to be recirculated in a loop between 4K and room temperature.  Assessments of the spinning source mass were completed in the sensitive magnetic scanning facilities at PTB.  Analysis of the data is underway and the mass delivered to a precision shop for fitting the shaft.  Silicon wafers, plated with the periodic velocity-assessment pattern in gold, were fabricated and shown to have good electrical conductivity and robustness on thermal cycling.  A scheme to attach the wafer to the mass was successfully tested.\n\nThe broader impacts of this work consisted of the successful training of undergraduate and graduate students in science.  One PhD student won a prestigious DAAD fellowship to collaborate with our PTB colleagues in Germany.  Our undergraduate students have secured admission to physics PhD programs.  One undergraduate also won a summer research position at CAPP in Korea, and another was supported by the Research Experience for Undergraduates program of the National Science Foundation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/05/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joshua C Long"
