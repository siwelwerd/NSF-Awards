 "awd_abstract_narration": "Long-term measurement of the large-scale magnetic field of the Sun is essential for understanding the solar activity, both at the Sun and throughout the heliosphere, as well as for gaining insight into the activity cycles of other stars that may affect habitability of exoplanets.  Furthermore, because of society's increasing reliance on technology that is susceptible to changing conditions in space, knowledge of the space climate and predictive understanding of the next Solar Cycle are crucial.  The main purpose of this five-year project is to enable continued accurate measurements of the large-scale magnetic field of the Sun during the transition from Solar Cycle 24 to Solar Cycle 25 using the Wilcox Solar Observatory (WSO) instrument.  Observing this transition in the solar activity is particularly important, because solar physicists were unable to predict many of the unusual characteristics of Solar Cycle 24: its delayed start, historically weak level of activity, diminished solar wind strength, increased cosmic-ray intensity, and strong north-south asymmetry.  Consequently, extending WSO's consistent 43-year time-series of measurements into the next Solar Cycle is critical for understanding the long-term magnetic activity cycle of the Sun and other Sun-like stars.  \r\n\r\nDuring this five-year project, the team at Stanford University will: (i) collect, process, and evaluate the WSO observations of the Sun's photosphere; (ii) extend the reliable, consistent, nearly four-solar-cycle-long time-series of useful data products; and, (iii) make the data even more conveniently available to the broad scientific community.  Furthermore, the WSO will continue to contribute to STEM education in the U.S., work force development, and public outreach.  Observations at the WSO are collected by a resident observer, who is a graduate student in solar physics at Stanford University.  Numerous summer students contribute to the data analysis and software development at the Observatory.  Improved Solar Cycle predictions are crucial for advancing the national Space Weather efforts, and improved understanding of the Solar Cycle is relevant to advancing knowledge on the activity cycles on other Sun-like stars, which can affect our assessment of exoplanet habitability.  The research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Observations of the mean magnetic field of the Sun reveal the predominant magnetic field configuration at the surface of the Sun, which shapes the corona at the base of the heliosphere that the solar wind ultimately carries to Earth and beyond out to the boundary of the solar system. Full disk magnetograms obtained during this interval were used to compute the coronal field in more detail using a potential field &ndash; source surface model. As shown in Figure 1 (described below) the structure of the heliospheric current sheet could be tracked during the rising phase of the cycle. The polar field in 2018 was about 15% stronger than it was at the previous minimum in 2008 (see Figure 2, described below), but weaker than the three previous minima observed at WSO using the same instrument since 1975. The polarity of the high-latitude solar fields reversed in the second half of 2023, about a year before solar maximum. It appears that the reversal during this cycle was better synchronized in the north and south hemispheres that the previous cycle. Magnetic flux associated with Solar Cycle 25 that has emerged at lower latitudes will continue to strengthen the new polar caps during the declining phase of the cycle.</p>\r\n<p>Figure 1 shows a map of the magnetic field in the corona at the base of the heliospheric current sheet from 2019 through 2024 for Carrington Rotations 2218 - 2286. Each panel is two full rotations wide, so that it is easy to see the structure. Data are plotted between 70 degrees south and 70 degrees north. The Carrington Rotation (CR) number of the rotation centered between the two vertical lines is indicated in the outer margins. Panels in this figure are spaced by 4 Carrington Rotations (about 109 days). The year of the first CR of each calendar year is indicated in the center of the plot, between the two columns. At solar minimum (CR 2218 in calendar year 2019 at upper left) the dark solid line shows that the heliospheric current sheet is relatively flat near the equator of the Sun. The current sheet separates the positive and negative polarity regions of the heliosphere. The lighter shading shows regions of positive magnetic field polarity.&nbsp; As time progresses down the first column the latitude reached by the current sheet increases and becomes more complex. In 2022, shown at the top of the second column, the base of the heliospheric current sheet (HCS) reaches more and more poleward. In the first half of 2023 the HCS resembles an equatorial dipole rather than the axial dipole shown at the start of the interval. This is the time leading up to the polar field reversal described in Figure 2. By mid 2024 (bottom right panel) the polar field direction had reversed, with a negative polar cap the north (compare with CR 2254 at the start of 2022).</p>\r\n<p>Figure 2 shows the line-of-sight magnetic field observed above 55 degrees latitude in each solar hemisphere from 1976 to the present. The heavy dark line shows the smoothed average of the two hemispheres. The values for southern pole, shown with the dashed red curve, are shown with the opposite sign so that it is easier to compare the values in the two hemispheres. The annual variations in the unsmoothed values are due to the inclination of the Earth&rsquo;s orbital plane to the rotation axis of the Sun.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/29/2024<br>\nModified by: Jon&nbsp;T&nbsp;Hoeksema</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1836370/1836370_10554603_1732917606837_Polar2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1836370/1836370_10554603_1732917606837_Polar2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"The Sun's Polar Field - 1976-2024\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1836370/1836370_10554603_1732917606837_Polar2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"The Sun's Polar Field - 1976-2024\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The polar magnetic field of the Sun observed at the Wilcox Solar Observatory from 1976-2024.
