 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Professor John Miecznikowski from Fairfield University and colleagues Matthew Kubasik, Aaron Van Dyke and Jillian Smith-Carpenter have acquired a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with an automatic sampler. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as allow study of biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The instrument positively impacts students at this institution and at nearby Iona College. The research team is partnering with the Upward Bound Program at Fairfield University by hosting a series of one-day scientific instrumentation workshops for 9-12th graders from the Bridgeport, CT school system and most of the students. Many of these students identify themselves as minority and low-income. They also partner with the annual Broadening Access to Science Education (BASE) Camp at Fairfield University directed to local high school students from Bridgeport schools who participate in hands-on research experiences with faculty mentors. \r\n\r\nThe proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially aids the development of water-soluble carbonyl reduction precatalysts based on zinc(II) pincer complexes and studies of helical peptide conformational dynamics. The spectrometer is essential in characterizing synthetic products of capture-tag-release probes to label endogenous enzymes, such as histone deacetylases, and those prepared thorough synthesis of 1,2-dithiolane functionalized self-assembling peptides.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
