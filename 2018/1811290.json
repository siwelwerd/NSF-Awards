 "awd_abstract_narration": "Star and planet formation occur at the same time, in regions of the Galaxy less than about 10 million years old.  Most stars in the Galaxy form in dense groups or clusters. This research will produce the most comprehensive and detailed study to date of the dust disks with the potential to form planets surrounding stars in these typical, dense star-forming regions.  In previously-funded work, the investigator obtained the basic data for this new program and published the first results in scientific journals.  Here, the investigators will combine these data with available supporting data from other scientists, increase the amount of data with the results from new telescopic observations, and analyze all of the data. These results will constrain theoretical models of planet, dust disk, and clustered star formation.  This project supports the mission of the NSF by promoting our understanding of the formation of planet-forming disks in dense, clustered star forming regions. The lead investigator will include a student from a non-traditional background in the research project, and will share the research results with classes that he teaches and through public evening lectures.\r\n\r\nThis research will produce the most comprehensive and highest angular resolution study to date of potentially planet-forming disks in clustered star forming regions.  Such dense, transient, short-lived clusters contain from 100 to over 1000 forming stars inside self-gravitating, parsec diameter clumps within giant molecular clouds where outflow feedback, UV radiation, stellar winds, and supernovae shape the environment of planet formation.  The expected results will include the circumstellar masses within the planet-forming zones of hundreds of coeval protoplanetary disks, the size distribution for these disks, constraints on other disk parameters such as scale height and surface density profile, and relationships between disk, stellar, and environmental properties.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this program was to constrain some of the most important initial conditions of planet formation, and to do this for systems that are typical of star and planet formation in the Galaxy.  Most stars, and presumably planets (including our own), in the Galaxy formed in rich clusters where intense UV radiation from massive stars and high stellar density can influence physical processes related to star and planet formation.  For example, intense UV radiation can drive winds from protoplanetary disks around low-mass cluster members, depleting the reservoirs of material that can ultimately form planets.  \n\nWe studied protoplanetary disks in the Orion Nebula and NGC 1977 clusters (both within the larger Orion molecular cloud), and constrained their masses, chemical compositions, and UV-driven mass-loss rates.   In the Orion Nebula cluster, the well-known Trapezium stars are hot and massive, and can produce UV fields up to a million times stronger than those found in lower-density star-forming regions.  In NGC 1977, the most massive stars are somewhat less extreme, but can still prpduce UV fields up to 1,000 times more intense than in low-density regions.\n\nWe showed that the disks in the ONC are compact, likely because of the mass-loss driven by the intense UV radiation from the high mass Trapezium stars.  Despite their smaller sizes, we showed that these disks still appear to contain sufficient mass to form planetary systems, including giant planets like those in our solar system.  In NGC 1977, mass-loss is still observed, but appears less significant than in the ONC, meaning that less extreme environments are even more hospitable for planet formation.  Our findings indicate that rich clusters, which are the typical sites of star-formation in the Galaxy, likely host planetary systems (or will eventually host such systems) around many or most cluster members.\n\nA graduate student was trained throughout this program, and led many of the publications describing the results of this work.
