 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many materials must have both solid-like and fluid-like properties during their processing and/or use.  Examples include construction materials such as cement and asphalt, biological fluids such as blood, consumer products including toothpaste and hand-creams, naturally occurring muds, clays, and sediments, and polymers and pastes used in 3-D printing.  To achieve the desired flow behavior, product formulators vary particle properties, such as size, shape, and surface coatings, add flow modifiers and gelling agents, and vary the processing conditions.  However, there is no accurate method of predicting the flow behavior. This limits the development of many products and points to a gap in our scientific understanding of these important materials.  This research will develop a new theoretical framework, to be validated by innovative experiments, to aid in this endeavor.  The work should both improve our scientific understanding of these complex materials and provide engineering guidance for industry on improving processing.  In addition, high school students, undergraduates and graduate students will be trained in this multidisciplinary research effort.\r\n\r\nMore technically, this research addresses thixotropy, which is a ubiquitous, and often vexing, property of particle-containing complex fluids, pastes, and soft matter characterized by a complex, time-dependent rheology due to flow-microstructure coupling. Micromechanical approaches are inherently restricted to small scales of length and time, while at the larger scales of importance to engineering applications and processing, only phenomenological models exist. These are often restricted to shear flows, and contain internal parameters with ill-defined physical meaning.  The principal investigators plan to remedy this by developing a fundamental and rigorous, multiscale theoretical framework and use this to develop truly predictive constitutive equations, which will be validated against advanced experiments on well-defined, model thixotropic systems. They will develop a new tensorial, multiscale microstructure-based framework that is thermodynamically consistent and generally applicable for all flows (i.e., cast in materially objective fashion). The theory is based on the most modern nonequilibrium thermodynamic (NET) formalism (GENERIC); the investigators at the University of Delaware are among the pioneers of this approach. Coarse graining of a newly derived population balance model based on particle properties for suspensions with yield stress and matching with the continuum model will fix the mesoscale parameters in the NET theory and result in a predictive constitutive model that can be rigorously tested and validated against exact analytical results as well as internationally recognized data on model concentrated suspensions in transient and oscillatory shear flows and non-viscometric flows, and directly against microstructure data obtained using RHEO-optical & RHEO-SANS, leveraging research supported by NIST. The proposed NET multiscale modeling with a simultaneous emphasis on both the rheology and the material's microstructure, combined with tight coordination with the leveraged experimental program sets this work apart from previous efforts.  The research will lead to a new capability in the modeling and understanding of complex thixotropic systems that can significantly advance the rational formulation and processing of many materials of industrial and national importance.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Providing a bridge between a molecular or particle-level description of the fluid with the macroscopic, or continuum description, has been challenging and our research provides a framework that enables one to do this systematically and accurately. &nbsp;Furthermore, this new framework is &ldquo;thermodynamically consistent&rdquo;, which means that measurements of the fluid&rsquo;s properties in the laboratory can be used to predict and simulate the behavior of such fluids robustly in practice, such as needed to process such fluids.&nbsp; We validate this framework against model systems comprised of silica particle dispersions, often used in advanced materials, as well as carbon black suspensions, such as used in batteries.&nbsp; Furthermore, we applied our new methods to model and better understand the rheology of human and animal blood, connecting the properties of the red blood cells and the blood plasma to blood flow behavior.&nbsp; The outcomes of the research are published or being published in 8 peer reviewed journal articles and as part of a book, and were presented nationally and internationally at 17 invited lectures and 22 contributed technical presentations at conferences and workshops.</p>\n<p>The application to the study of human and animal blood flow illustrates some of the broader impacts of the research. Using the models developed in this research, we also explored the use of machine learning to begin connecting blood physiology, such as obtained in a routine laboratory blood panel, to the measurable flow properties of blood. Such approaches can lead to the potential use of simple blood flow measurements as a medical diagnostic tool. Another broader impact of the research is the resolution of the conundrum of violation of &ldquo;Galilean invariance&rdquo;, (a term coined by Albert Einstein, &nbsp;which refers to the principle that the laws of motion must be the same in all inertial frames of reference) by existing models for multiphase transport of mass, momentum, and energy.&nbsp; Applying principles of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, we reformulate the theory describing multiphase flow to respect the principle of Galilean invariance, and in doing so, also provide a better method for numerically solving problems in multiphase flow that can be, otherwise, very difficult to calculate. Finally, the research trained a doctoral student, who participated in an NSF sponsored (INTERN program) industrial internship with the DuPont Electronics &amp; Industrial Operations Group that provided both professional development of the student as well as technology transfer of the project to industry. This project prepared the student to join a leading U.S. engineering company, W.L. Gore, and helped to train other undergraduate, masters and doctoral students in research methods for future participation in the STEM workforce.
