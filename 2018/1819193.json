 "awd_abstract_narration": "Protein molecules are basic components in all forms of life, and electrostatic effects play a key role in \r\ndetermining protein structure and function. However studying these effects experimentally is difficult, \r\nand there is great interest in using computer simulations to advance this area of biochemical research. \r\nThis project will contribute by developing new mathematical algorithms to improve the accuracy and \r\nefficiency of these simulations. Potential biomedical applications include (1) protein-ligand binding, \r\nwhich is important for synthetic drug design, and (2) protein folding, which is important for \r\nunderstanding how misfolding causes disease. The investigators will collaborate with bioscientists, and \r\nthe software developed in the project will be made available in open source format for use by the \r\nscientific community. The project results will be disseminated through conference and seminar \r\npresentations, and publications in scientific journals. The project will develop the national workforce in \r\ncomputational mathematics by training junior personnel at the postdoctoral, graduate student, and \r\nundergraduate student levels.\r\n \r\nBiochemical simulations of charged particle systems are often limited by the cost of computing long-\r\nrange electrostatic interactions. To address this issue the PIs have developed a treecode-accelerated \r\nboundary integral (TABI) method to solve the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation for the electrostatic \r\npotential of a solvated protein. In this project the PIs will extend the TABI solver to the challenging case \r\nof interacting proteins in solvent, focusing on subtle dielectric and ionic structural effects. The work \r\nentails advances in modeling, improvements in treecode and boundary element methods, and \r\napplications in molecular biochemistry including the following topics: (1) The TABI code will be \r\nextended to compute the binding energy of a solvated protein-protein complex. (2) The treecode will \r\nbe adapted to accelerate computations of the total correlation function in the Reference Interaction \r\nSite Model (RISM) which provides a physically accurate description of the water structure near the \r\nsolute/solvent interface. (3) Explicit ion simulations will be carried out to validate the PB and RISM \r\nsimulations, and to investigate the effect of finite ion size on the interfacial charge structure. (4) The \r\ntreecode will be improved by implementing a more effective multipole acceptance criterion, and \r\nparallel CPU and GPU implementations of the treecode will be developed. (5) A new method for \r\ncomputing electrostatic PB forces will be tested for application in molecular dynamics simulations of \r\ninteracting proteins in solvent. (6) Efficient computation of pH-dependent effects in solvated proteins \r\nwill be demonstrated using TABI.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
