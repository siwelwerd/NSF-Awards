 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Structure Dynamics and Mechanism (CSDM-A) program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Roseanne Sension of The University of Michigan is using x-ray techniques to develop visual images and movies of the internal motions of the atoms in molecules which have been exposed to a pulse of ultraviolet (UV) or visible (Vis) light.  Pulses of UV/Vis light can cause distortions of the chemical bonds in molecules, and even cause them to break or re-form in what we call a photochemical reaction.  These light-induced motions occur on very short time scales, from a few femtoseconds to a few nanoseconds (A femtosecond is one quadrillionth of a second.  A nanosecond is one billionth of a second).  X-ray diffraction has been used to determine molecular structure for more than a century.  However, these have been molecules that are stationary in a crystal lattice.  In order to capture the extremely fast motions of molecules after they have been exposed to light, Prof. Sensions is using the intense x-rays produced by free electron lasers (for example, at the LINAC Coherent Light Source at Stanford University). Professor Sension and her students are measuring how molecules absorb x-rays, and developing methods to convert x-ray absorption information into images that can be sequenced as frames in a motion picture.   The visualization of photochemical reactions at the molecular level helps us understand chemical reactions in general, and also supports the long-term goal to control chemical reactions with light. The project is also training students in the use of advanced experimental facilities and in advanced computer simulation of UV/Vis and x-ray absorption.  In addition, the results are being integrated into the undergraduate curriculum to help students understand the relevance of mathematics and physics to chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis project uses femtosecond x-ray free electron lasers to visualize quantum wave packet motion in molecules. A short laser pulse is used to initiate and control a photochemical reaction. A polarized x-ray pulse probes the coherent structural dynamics on the excited state potential energy surface. Cobalamin photochemistry and photophysics is used as a model system for molecular visualization and quantum control with femtosecond x-ray pulses sources. The visualization of coherent excited state dynamics and the correlation of dynamics with the molecular ligands facilitate the understanding and development of cobalamin based molecular devices. The experimental observations are interpreted using quantum chemical calculations and finite difference near edge spectroscopy ab initio code to simulate x-ray absorption spectra. In addition, general simulation methods are being developed to model ultrafast x-ray spectroscopy and coherent excited state dynamics.  This research project has implications for a wide range of applications in energy conversion, medical therapeutics, molecular electronics, switches, sensors, and delivery platforms. Many of these applications exploit intrinsically quantum mechanical dynamics of the molecules involved.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

A molecule absorbs light and this initiates action. Many applications of photochemistry exploit intrinsically quantum mechanical dynamics of the molecules involved. Time-resolved x-ray spectroscopies are uniquely capable of reporting on these coherent molecular motions. The fundamental time scale for atomic response to changes in the electronic configuration is in the range of 10's to 100's of femtoseconds (1 fs = 10<sup>-15</sup> seconds).&nbsp; In this project, UV-visible and x-ray spectroscopies were used to study the initial electronic and structural dynamics cobalt containing vitamin B<sub>12</sub> analogs with a primary focus on the initial quantum wavepacket evolution.</p>\n<p>Alkylcobalamins, with an unusual carbon-cobalt bond, undergo sequential structural evolution after absorption of light in the visible and near ultraviolet regions of the spectrum. The comparison of optical and x-ray absorption for adenosylcobalamin (coenzyme B<sub>12</sub>) illustrates the sequential structural evolution of this molecule after absorption of green light. Polarized x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra demonstrate that the ring around the central cobalt atom expands first in the y-direction, then 50 fs later in the x-direction. During this expansion the molecule also emits light. The expansion of the ring is followed 200 fs after excitation by a change in electronic distribution, expansion of the axial bonds, and the loss of fluorescence. The dynamics of propylcobalamin are also sequential, with y-polarized ring expansion upon excitation. The x-polarized expansion of the ring and the expansion of the axial bonds follow simultaneously ca. 100 fs after excitation. The dynamics observed for methylcobalamin are similar. The asymmetric evolution in the XANES spectrum of alkylcobalamins reports on the sequential nature of quantum wavepacket evolution in the excited state of these molecules and on the impact of the size of the upper ligand on the dynamics.</p>\n<p>In contrast with the alkylcobalamins, aquocobalamin and hydroxocobalamin have a cobalt-oxygen bond with a water molecule or a hydroxide anion as the upper axial ligand. The excited state dynamics are distinctly different from the alkylcobalamins. For these molecules, excitation results in a prompt expansion of the cavity around the cobalt equally in the x and y directions. Coherent expansion of the axial bonds follows in a ballistic manner, controlled by the shape of the excited state surface. The molecule recoils and settles into an excited state with a ring structure similar to the initial molecule, but changes in the axial bond lengths. Ultrafast x-ray emission spectroscopy leads to the assignment of this state as a metal-centered excited state.

In addition, cobalamins provide a promising platform as light-activated agents for spatially and temporally controlled delivery of therapeutic agents, as biocompatible sensors, and as photocatalysts since the upper axial ligand can be replaced with a wide variety of chemically or biologically active ligands. These systems, like many other chemically interesting compounds, are only available in small quantities or at low concentrations. A drop delivery system was demonstrated that enables x-ray measurements of very small sample volumes by timing microdrop delivery with the optical and x-ray laser pulses. Time-dependent UV-visible and x-ray measurements on adenosylcobalamin bound to CarH demonstrate that the protein harnesses the photochemistry of the cobalt-carbon bond by changing the excited state dynamics and reaction pathways.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/26/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Roseanne&nbsp;J&nbsp;Sension</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1836435/1836435_10558460_1653614760394_Outcomes2022Figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1836435/1836435_10558460_1653614760394_Outcomes2022Figure4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Excited state dynamics of aquocobalamin\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1836435/1836435_10558460_1653614760394_Outcomes2022Figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Excited state dynamics of aquocobalamin\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Ultrafast X-ray measurements of the dynamics following excitation of aquocobalamin.
