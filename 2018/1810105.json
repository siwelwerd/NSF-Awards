 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sustainability has become a pressing global challenge. A major means to address this is to utilize renewable energy at a large scale. However, this changes the nature of power systems and imposes unprecedented challenges to the stable operation of a power system, which is arguably the most important infrastructure underpinning social life and economic growth. Following the PI's work on the large-scale utilization of renewable energy, in particular on the synchronized and democratized (SYNDEM) grid architecture and the associated enabling technologies that unifies the interaction of modern power systems, this project aims to solidify its theoretical foundation by developing fundamental systems theory and control algorithms. This will speed up the large-scale utilization of renewable energy, improve the stability, reliability, resiliency of modern power systems, promote energy independence and sustainability, bring job opportunities and economic growth, and eventually lead to a low-carbon economy. \r\n\r\nThis project seamlessly integrates profound multidisciplinary thinking in systems theory, power electronics, and power systems. The port-Hamiltonian systems theory, which combines the historical Hamiltonian modeling approach in geometric mechanics and the port-based network modeling approach in electrical engineering, offers a systematic and scalable mathematical framework for structural modeling, analysis and control of complex networked nonlinear multi-physics systems. This powerful mathematical tool will be further developed to passivate a large-scale, interconnected, geographically distributed, heterogeneous networked power system with millions of power electronic converters and rigorously prove its stability, leading to a uniform mathematical structure for passivated and homogenized modern power systems. The theoretical framework developed will be validated numerically and experimentally. The results will also shed lights on the understanding of other large-scale networked systems. \r\n\r\nResearch results will be disseminated timely worldwide through various channels, including the LinkedIn Group on Virtual Synchronous Machines and Power Electronics-enabled Autonomous Power Systems. Undergraduates and postgraduates from underrepresented groups will be encouraged to take part in the project. The project results will also be included in graduate courses and training programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

A major means to address this is to utilize renewable energy at a large scale. However, this changes the nature of power systems from CENTRALIZED regulation by a small number of large generators to DEMOCRATIZED interaction of millions of small heterogeneous suppliers and loads (called players), which puts the stability of future power systems under threat. The stability of such a large-scale, interconnected, geographically distributed, heterogeneous networked system has never been mathematically proven, because of difficulties in modeling heterogeneous players and large-scale networks, quantifying the impact of power electronic converters, and identifying an appropriate mathematical tool. The principal investigator of this project has previously shown, through the Synchronized and Democratized (SYNDEM) grid architecture, that millions of heterogeneous players in modern power systems can be SYNCHRONIZED by the synchronization mechanism of synchronous machines, which has underpinned the stable operation of power systems for over 100 years, and HOMOGENIZED/UNIFIED via operating power electronic converters in these players as virtual synchronous machines.&nbsp;<br /><br />Through this project, the following significant achievements are made:<br />1) A control framework has been proposed to render a power electronic system passive by adopting the port-Hamiltonian systems theory. The system has a power electronic converter, either grid-tied or islanded, and the control framework consists of a lossless interconnection block and three control channels. The resulting power converter behaves as a virtual synchronous machine. It is proven that the closed-loop system is passive without the need of assuming constant frequency, constant voltage, and/or constant loads. It is sufficient to only assume that the load can be described as a passive port-Hamiltonian model.<br />2) The model of generic transmission and distribution lines is developed.<br />3) The model of a generic passive transmission and distribution grid is established.<br />4) A compact and scalable mathematical model has been established for generic power systems dominated by power converters that are interconnected through a passive transmission and distribution grid, which can be applied to power systems with an arbitrary number of power electronic converters with generic passive controllers, passive local loads, and different types of passive T&amp;D lines connected in a meshed configuration without self-loops.<br />5) The Input-to-State Stability (ISS) of generic power systems dominated by power electronic converters interconnected through a passive transmission and distribution grid is proven, without assumptions on constant frequency/voltage, constant loads, and/or lossless networks, except the need of passivity for all parts involved, and without using the Clarke/Park transformations or the graph theory.&nbsp;<br />6) The transient angle stability of virtual synchronous machines equipped with the robust droop control strategy has been thoroughly studied. The study shows that there does not exist a transient stability problem for this type of virtual synchronous machines because a stable operating point can always be achieved for a post-disturbance system with proper control.&nbsp;<br />7) A wind power generation experimental system has been set up and the self-synchronized universal droop control has been applied successfully.<br />8) A rotorless wind turbine simulator has been developed to facilitate the research and verification of wind power generations systems.<br />9) Two PhD students and four master students were trained, making contributions to workforce development.<br /><br /></p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/12/2024<br>\nModified by: Qing-Chang&nbsp;Zhong</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1810105/1810105_10552685_1731462586324_SYNDEM_Grid_Architecture--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1810105/1810105_10552685_1731462586324_SYNDEM_Grid_Architecture--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"The Synchronized and Democratized (SYNDEM) Grid Architecture for Next-generation Smart Grids\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1810105/1810105_10552685_1731462586324_SYNDEM_Grid_Architecture--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"The Synchronized and Democratized (SYNDEM) Grid Architecture for Next-generation Smart Grids\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Synchronized and Democratized (SYNDEM) grid architecture that unifies the integration and interaction of synchronous machines (SM),\ndistributed energy resources, and the majority of loads through operating power electronic converters as virtual synchronous machines (VSM)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Qing-Chang Zhong, Power Electronics-Enabled Autonomous Power Systems: Next Generation Smart Grids, IEEE Press, 1st Edition, 2020, available at https://www.amazon.com/dp/1118803523</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Qing-Chang&nbsp;Zhong\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">The Synchronized and Democratized (SYNDEM) Grid Architecture for Next-generation Smart Grids</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1810105/1810105_10552685_1731463801500_CompactModel--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1810105/1810105_10552685_1731463801500_CompactModel--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"A compact and scalable mathematical model for generic power systems\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1810105/1810105_10552685_1731463801500_CompactModel--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"A compact and scalable mathematical model for generic power systems\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A compact and scalable mathematical model for generic power systems dominated by power converters that are interconnected through a passive transmission and distribution grid</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Q.-C.
