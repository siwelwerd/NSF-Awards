 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds a project to develop materials that will help students understand the challenging topics in quantum mechanics. The aim is to prepare future scientists and engineers for the demands of the high-tech workplace with its growing dependence on quantum phenomena through the continued development, assessment, and dissemination of Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorials (QuILT) and peer-instruction tools for undergraduate course.  QuILTs and peer-instruction tools use research as a guide and are based on a cognitive-apprenticeship model emphasizing modeling, coaching and weaning.  Guidance and effective methods of education are critical in retaining students in science and in shaping their career choices.\r\n\r\nThe curriculum features that make these products particularly suited for the challenging task of teaching quantum physics are: (1) They are based upon research in physics education and pay particular attention to cognitive issues. (2) They consistently keep students engaged in the learning process by asking them to predict what should happen in a particular situation and then providing appropriate feedback. (3) They employ visualization tools to help students build physical intuition about quantum processes. (4) They attempt to bridge the gap between the abstract quantitative formalism of quantum mechanics and the qualitative understanding necessary to explain and predict diverse physical phenomena. (5) They are based on systematic investigations of difficulties students have in learning various concepts in quantum physics. (6) Many of the tools can be used in class by the instructors as supplements to lectures or outside of the class as homework or as self-study tool by students. (7) They consist of self-sufficient modular units that can be used in any order that is convenient.  These tools can also be used by graduate students who may need to refresh concepts learned in undergraduate quantum mechanics as a self-study tool.  This award is co-funded by the Division of Physics Integrative Activities in Physics Program within the  Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and by the Division of Undergraduate Education within the Education and Human Resources Directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
