 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mediterranean region is identified as a climate change hot spot. Recent observations, including increased fire activity in 2017, suggest that aridity in the Iberian Peninsula is already increasing. This multi-institutional team of researchers seeks to provide a spatial and temporal context for on-going and future climatic changes in this region by constructing a 2,500-year-long history of hydroclimate variability from precipitation-sensitive stalagmites formed in caves in central and southern Portugal. Rainfall in Iberia is strongly correlated to the strength of the Azores sub-tropical high-pressure system, and these cave sites lie at its climatological epicenter.  \r\n\r\nSpecifically, this project aims to bridge the hydroclimate knowledge gap for the last 2,500 years using sub-decadally resolved, multi-proxy stalagmite records (carbon and oxygen stable isotope ratios, trace element abundances, growth laminae, and high precision Uranium/Thorium dating) from cave sites in central and southern Portugal.  Based on measuring, counting and comparing the uppermost Uranium/Thorium age from one stalagmite, these laminae appear to be annual in nature. Resulting data will be combined and evaluated with similarly-resolved hydroclimate-sensitive records from northern Iberia (Spain) and northwest Africa (Morocco), creating a latitudinal transect that will allow spatial and temporal constraints to be placed on the Azores High\r\n\r\nThis research could also provide a significant spatial bridge between the only existing high-resolution paleo-hydroclimatic reconstructions (northern Morocco and northern Spain) from this zone. Together, these time series will allow for a more comprehensive evaluation of dynamical changes in the regional climate system through time, particularly in the spatial extent and intensity of the Azores High.\r\n\r\nThe state of the atmospheric circulation in the North Atlantic region during recent millennia, and particularly medieval times, remains the subject of considerable debate in both proxy- and model-based studies.  Of particular interest is the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), an atmospheric dipole between the Iceland low and the Azores high, which is strongly linked to regional inter-annual precipitation variability in Western Europe and northwest Africa through the routing of storms tracks. Dynamics of the NAO and the Azores High are poorly understood prior to the late 19th century, and as a result, the drivers of NAO/Azores High dynamics have not been adequately explored.  An ideal place to address these deficiencies is central and southern Portugal, where few, if any, high-resolution records exist.\r\n\r\nThe potential Broader Impacts (B.I.) includes the potential to transform the understanding of the nature and drivers of past Iberian hydroclimate variability, and through comparison with model simulations, how it may respond to future anthropogenic forcing. As such, the development and synthesis of these high resolution and precisely dated records will be of value to the broad climate/paleoclimate communities.  All data produced as part of this project will be made publicly available and archived on community websites. The project unites a diverse, internationally recognized team of researchers from major research institutions (Iowa State University, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, University of New Mexico) and liberal arts colleges (Cornell College, Union College) to apply multi-disciplinary approaches to addressing long-term hydroclimate dynamics. This work will involve the training of a PhD student already in residence at Iowa State and at least eight undergraduate researchers in state-of-the-art climate reconstruction and modeling techniques.  A component of data collection in Portugal will involve citizen-based science at a local tourist cave and with regional caving groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFormed by dry descending air in the subtropics, the Azores High, and broadly the North Atlantic subtropical high (NASH), sets clockwise flowing winds across northern Africa, the East Coast US, and Western Europe. The Azores High is the reason Iberia and the Mediterranean region, in general, have a sunnier and drier climate compared to Northern Europe, which is much wetter due to the westerly winds picking up moisture from the North Atlantic.  The NASH has impacts extending beyond the North Atlantic, such as the North American monsoon, and thus understanding its variability is of broad interest.\n\nThe impact of global warming on the strength and position of the Azores High is not well established.  One way to get insight into this question is to study past variability of the Azores High.  We were able to do this because climate signals associated with changes in the Azores High are recorded in cave deposits called speleothems.  The carbon and oxygen composition of speleothem calcite reflects in part the composition of the rainfall-derived drip water from which they form.  We can distinguish between wet and dry intervals in the past as a result.  Because of their excellent preservation in the cave environment and our ability to date specific layers using radiometric dating based on the decay of 234-uranium to 230-thorium (U-series dating), we were able to construct a record of moisture variability in Iberia, which has a strong sensitivity to changes in the strength and position of the Azores High.\n\nOur first contribution was obtaining a 9000-year record.  We were able to show that decrease in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation, in combination with changes in the sea surface temperature (SST) off the coast of Iberia, drove long-term trends in the Azores High, leading to dryer conditions in Iberia. Superimposed on this long-term trend, we found significant short-term shifts between wet and dry conditions.  As a result, we undertook a more detailed study of the past 1200 years, including a warm interval, at least in the Northern Hemisphere, known as the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), followed by a cold period known as the Little Ice Age (LIA).   The MCA is characterized by frequent winters with extremely strong, broad, and easter-shifted Azores High, which contribute to aridity in this region. The wettest interval of the 1200-year record occurs during the  LIA,  1250 CE until 1700 CE, indicating a less intense, narrow, and east-shifted AH.  The Industrial period is characterized by conditions similar to the MCA with expanded, strengthened Azores High. \n\nFollowing our proxy-based study we conducted a widely publicized modeling study which appeared in Nature Geosciences first-authored by one of our students.  We showed that extremely strong Azores High (AH) is more common during the industrial period since the 1850s, compared to the pre-industrial period over the past 1200 years.  This condition resulted in a significant drying of Iberia.  We show that the expansion of the AH during the 20th Century is unprecedented in the last 1200 years and that anthropogenic warming is likely the culprit.  \n\nIn addition to these scientific achievements, we trained and mentored undergraduate and graduate students from Iowa State, Cornell College, and Woods Hole Institution.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/26/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Yemane Asmerom"
