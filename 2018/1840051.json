 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier (FW-HTF) is one of 10 new Big Ideas for Future Investment announced by NSF. The FW-HTF cross-directorate program aims to respond to the challenges and opportunities of the changing landscape of jobs and work by supporting convergent research. This award fulfills part of that aim.  Expert teachers effectively orchestrate the complex flow of ideas and products in the classroom through individual, small group, and whole class activities. In supporting the future work of teachers, this project will facilitate the classroom orchestration process through the development of an intelligent teaching assistant, implemented as a tablet-based dashboard. This will allow the teacher to delegate cognitively-demanding orchestration tasks related to classroom activities to the intelligent assistant, enabling him/her to focus on other tasks to support student learning.  Building on an existing shared-document system for middle school mathematics teachers, the proposed system will facilitate teachers in monitoring student work, assessing it, and making conclusions (e.g., indicating student progress, errors, and misconceptions) while allowing them to circulate among students who are working individually or in small groups.  Ultimately, the system will behave like an automated teaching assistant and allow teachers to be more effective and increase their job satisfaction by allowing them to concentrate on assisting learners who most need help.  \r\n\r\nBuilding on the team's Formative Assessment with Computational Technologies (FACT) system, the development of an intelligent teaching assistant will enhance teachers' awareness of what is going on in the classroom and facilitate the cognitively-intensive tasks of orchestrating classroom activities. In the first six-month phase, the project will employ a knowledge engineering process to uncover the tacit knowledge teachers use for decision-making in managing the flow of classroom activities.  In the second phase, over two and one-half years, a series of ten comprehensive trials will be conducted to iteratively develop the cognitive policies of the system through data collection and optimizing the flow of work and ideas, carefully considering teacher input.  This knowledge will be encoded in a rule-based Artificial Intelligence where the intelligent teaching assistant can perform some of the decision-making.  Authorized by the teacher, it will send messages directly to students in specific situations - some will be feedback, some will be hints, some will be requests to visit other students and some will just be to redirect attention to get back on task.  The automated teaching assistant will also prioritize tasks for the teacher; e.g., which students to visit in the classroom.  As part of this process, new sensors will be added to FACT that will monitor the teacher's speech and location. The potential broader impact includes facilitating teachers in conducting more pedagogically complex and effective lessons and increasing teacher job satisfaction while improving student learning.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIf a job is boring and repetitious, then today's technology can assist or even replace human workers.  However, when a job is a challenging, constantly changing mixture of tasks and social interactions, then research is needed on how technology can help while leaving the human in charge, engaged and energized by the job.   Teaching middle school math classes is exactly such a job.\n\nFACT is a job aid for teachers who are conducting a lesson that involves individual work, group work and whole class work.  Such job aids are called classroom orchestration systems, because conducting such a class is analogous to conducting an orchestra, except that the conductor/teacher is calling forth ideas instead of musical passages from the students.  Unlike conventional teaching, our teachers are encouraging idea generation without giving feedback on correctness.  Often, correct ideas spring from one student and spread throughout the classroom.  They spread because they enable solution to a complex problem that the students are working on.\n\nThe FACT project was driven by trials in middle school math classrooms in California and Britain.  We recorded and analyzed 124 classroom trials.  We constantly revised the system because we discovered that what works is often not what researchers or even teachers thought would work. These discoveries comprise the intellectual merit of the project.  A few will be described here.\n\nIn recent trials, it was amazing to see how much smoother the classroom workflow went when the teacher was using FACT.  For instance, instead of collecting worksheets and handing out the next set of materials, the teacher taps on the \"Next\" button and students' devices instantly display the next materials.  When students are working individually or in small groups while the teacher circulates, FACT indicates who needs to be visited even though they haven't raised their hand.  It also indicates why they need to be visited and suggests how to open the visit. Since unequal distribution of teacher attention is a known issue in education, part of FACT's broader impact is addressing this issue. \n\nThe teachers' hand-carried dashboard (see figures 1 and 2) displays not only correctness of student work but also collaboration status.  Teachers want group members to collaborate, but sometime one member dominates or members work independently.  \n\nMost recently, we added audio input to FACT.  The teachers and students wore microphones (not shown in the figures).  We used off-the-shelf speech detection to help determine if a group of students is collaborating verbally. \n\nFor our final evaluation of FACT in classrooms, we attempted a novel data collection method.  Because screen recordings during the pandemic proved particularly valuable for analyzing student reactions to FACT, we wanted to record screens and audio from every student in the classroom.  During a pilot study, we streamed screen capture audio-video from approximately 25 students simultaneously to our data collection server in Arizona.  This overloaded the school infrastructure, halting FACT repeatedly.  Thus, we pioneered a method for chopping the compressed video into small packets before sending them.  This allowed us to record all the students simultaneously.  However, there appears to have been some data loss anyway, so we were able to recover only some of the student screen recordings. \n\nWe analyzed these screen recordings to determine if FACT's novel, rule-based analysis of collaboration worked and how students reacted to FACT's reminders, which were sent to non-collaborating group under certain circumstances.  The bottom line is that FACT's analysis of collaboration was not very accurate, probably because it used off-the-shelf speech detection and rule-based classification.  If we had had sufficient data for training a machine learner, FACT's collaboration classifier would probably have been more accurate.  Interestingly, even when FACT's analysis was accurate, students often disregarded its reminders, perhaps because they were more focused on completing the activity than on collaborating. \n\nOn the other hand, both the students and teachers were very happy with the way FACT used microphones;  the teachers remained happy with the efficiencies FACT afforded them; and we were very happy with the screen recordings, when we could get them.  This suggests that future classroom orchestration systems should incorporate and improve these features.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/25/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kurt Vanlehn"
