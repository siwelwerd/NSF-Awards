 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is a three year collaborative effort between researchers at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) and G & A Technical Software Incorporated (GATS) that is aimed at extending the understanding of the dynamics of the complex Arctic atmosphere and geospace regions. Specifically, the dynamical and neutral-plasma coupling in the middle and upper atmosphere would be investigated with a new resonance lidar at Poker Flat Research Range (PFRR), Chatanika, Alaska, that is a sodium resonance wind-temperature lidar (W&T) system that was recently relocated to PFRR and made operational with observations starting in January 2018. The operations of this instrument would acquire wind and temperature profiles through the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) region of 80-110 km that would be coordinated with the on-going operations of six key instruments at PFRR: namely, the volume imaging sodium lidar, the Poker Flat Rayleigh density-temperature lidar, the Poker Flat metal resonance density lidar, a three-channel all sky imager, the Poker Flat Meteor Wind Radar, and the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar. The research would have a variety of broader impacts addressing fundamental processes in fluid dynamics, aerosol and plasma science while developing new remote sensing technology. The W&T resonance lidar will be operated at the Lidar Research Laboratory at PFRR, and would support the participation of two UAF graduate students as well as visiting students in scientific investigations and engineering projects. The W&T lidar system operations would enhance the Poker Flat Rocket Range research infrastructure, extending the cluster of ground-based suite of instruments at PFRR that would in turn allow new rocket-based investigations at PFRR. The activity will advance integration of satellite and ground-based measurements and inter-comparison, calibration, and validation of remote sensing techniques. The observations, analyses and results of this activity will contribute to national and international programs, including the CAWSES, CEDAR, SEARCH, and SPARC programs. The results of the activity will be disseminated widely through both professional and public outreach programs associated with UAF and NASA. \r\n\r\nThe Arctic atmosphere can be considered as a unique laboratory for investigating atmospheric coupling and understanding how terrestrial meteorology forcing (from below) and space weather activity (from above) combine to determine the overall structure and circulation of the middle and upper atmosphere. The W&T instrument would acquire measurements of sufficient accuracy and precision to allow comparative studies of temperature and wind over daily, seasonal, and yearly time scales. These measurements would provide excellent data supporting studies relating to dynamic coupling, ion-neutral coupling, and aerosol-plasma coupling. The program of lidar measurements would address these topics through observations of specific phenomena: gravity waves, tides, planetary waves, instabilities, mesospheric inversion layers, mesospheric metal layers, extended thermospheric metal layers, sporadic layers, Joule heating, ion drag, ion composition, and noctilucent clouds. The overarching aim of the series of observations would be to achieve a coherent framework for understanding these interactions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This advanced lidar system forms an integral part of a new cluster of lidars, radars, imagers, and rockets that will help understand the changes in the temperatures, winds, and chemistry of the arctic upper atmosphere.This was a collaborative project between GATS, a private research company, and the University of Alaska, Fairbanks. GATS PI Dr. Williams helped train three UAF graduate students in high resolution laser spectroscopy, lidar techniques, and atmospheric dynamics. In addition to the routine observations by UAF staff, Dr. Williams travelled to Alaska to help with lidar improvements and operations during three summer campaigns, one fall campaign, two spring campaigns, and two winter campaigns. This dataset is being used to study atmospheric wave dynamics over a wide range of periods from 20 seconds to several days, something that is possible with very few other instruments.</p>\n<p><strong>Lidar Improvements:</strong> We installed a new 0.9m diameter telescope and aligned it with a third beam giving us simultaneous east, north, and zenith beams for wind vector measurements. We published an instrument paper (Li et al., 2020) describing the instrument status halfway through the grant and comparing to other sodium lidars. Since then, improvements to the transmitter and the alignment of the beams and telescopes have increased the total signal to get up to 1000 counts/shot in the summer and up to 1500 counts/shot in the winter, providing some of the highest-resolution multi-beam temperature and wind vector measurements made to date near the mesopause.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Results:&nbsp;</strong>This data has been used in many conference presentations, a completed Ph.D. thesis (and one in progress), a Masters thesis, and six published papers (with more in progress).</p>\n<p><strong>Polar Mesospheric Cloud (PMC) formation and dynamics:</strong>&nbsp;The three summer campaigns took place in the first half of August when we had darkness at midnight and could run the Rayleigh lidar and imagers to measure PMC's in concert with the SRWTL, the meteor radar, and incoherent scatter radar. This project has also helped with analysis and publication of ground-based measurements taken by this lidar during a 2018 NASA SuperSoaker rocket campaign at Poker Flat Research Range. &nbsp;Collins et al. (2021) studied artificial ice cloud formation and&nbsp;Mesquita et al. (2020) studied a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) using rocket TMA trails and lidar data.</p>\n<p><strong>Routine measurements of billows in Na density:</strong> The high signal levels in the second half of the project are allowing us to routinely resolve instability billows in Na density along with simultaneous temperature and wind vector profiles, which allow us to categorize and model the billows. Figures 1 and 2 show&nbsp;two billow examples (likely KHI).</p>\n<p><strong>Measurements of wave breaking and instabilities:</strong>&nbsp;Li et al. (2021) used SRWTL data to investigate wave breaking leading to overturning and eddy diffusion during three fall and winter nights. Our new PMC camera and the all-sky nightglow camera at Poker Flat Research Range allows us to measure horizontal properties of instabilities while the Na lidar measures the vertical scale and temperature and wind gradients. So far we have seen KHI, secondary KHI (Figure 3), tube/knot interactions (Figure 3), and vortex rings (Figure 4). UAF staff is continuing to work on instability events during their no-cost extension and modeling work is continuing at GATS under other related grants.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/02/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Bifford&nbsp;P&nbsp;Williams</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1829138/1829138_10557829_1643804933745_PokerKHI-06Aug2021--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1829138/1829138_10557829_1643804933745_PokerKHI-06Aug2021--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1829138/1829138_10557829_1643804933745_PokerKHI-06Aug2021--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1: High resolution sodium density measurements of likely KHI billows on 06 Aug 2021 lasting several hours in all 3 beams.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Bifford Williams</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Bifford&nbsp;P&nbsp;Williams</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1829138/1829138_10557829_1643805039009_PokerKHI-23Sep2021--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1829138/1829138_10557829_1643805039009_PokerKHI-23Sep2021--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1829138/1829138_10557829_1643805039009_PokerKHI-23Sep2021--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 2: High resolution sodium density measurements of likely KHI billows on 23 Sep 2021.
