 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award supports research that contributes new knowledge related to the use and understanding of a nanomanufacturing process known as matrix assisted pulsed laser evaporation for processing pharmaceuticals. Matrix assisted pulsed laser evaporation has the potential to revolutionize the way pharmaceuticals that do not dissolve in water are manufactured. Manufacturing processes are available to place these pharmaceuticals within small spherical containers that are known as liposomes. However, the high cost to make pharmaceutical-loaded liposomes makes accessibility to these pharmaceuticals difficult for individuals and communities with limited resources. Matrix assisted pulsed laser evaporation involves layer-by-layer deposition of drug-loaded thin films on three-dimensional printed needles for delivery with greater precision and lower cost than current technologies. New combinatorial chemistry, drug design, and drug screening mechanisms have led to the development of a large number of new water-insoluble pharmaceuticals. This research advances the production mechanisms for these drugs thus benefiting the U.S. pharmaceutical industry and improving patient quality of life. This GOALI project involves several disciplines including nanotechnology, laser technology, pharmaceutical science, manufacturing science, and materials science. It helps broaden participation of women and underrepresented minorities in research through activities at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and local schools. Collaborations between North Carolina State University and Lynntech, a company that develops medical products, propels commercialization and clinical translation of nanomanufacturing of pharmaceuticals using matrix assisted pulsed laser evaporation technology.\r\n\r\nThe matrix assisted pulsed laser evaporation nanoscale manufacturing process can overcome several limitations associated with conventional pharmaceutical manufacturing techniques such as cost and delivery precision. By this process, drug-containing thin films can be formed on drug delivery substrates with excellent control over coating thickness, roughness, and homogeneity. This award overcomes several scientific barriers to realize the full potential of matrix assisted pulsed laser evaporation for processing pharmaceuticals that do not dissolve in water. This research is to fill the knowledge gap on the relationships among processing parameters, structure, chemical properties, and biological functionality for a drug that can be used to treat a common type of skin cancer (basal cell carcinoma) as well as fungal infections. The development of layered nanocomposite films, which extend the amount of time over which the drug is released, has the potential to reduce the number of times that a drug needs to be administered for effective treatment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
