 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to build an open-source software toolbox under the GNU-GPL license to facilitate the investigation of information systems (e.g., data storage systems, streaming data structures, and content delivery systems) using information theoretical methods, more precisely, to facilitate the derivation of outer bounds and identifying novel code constructions.  By building modern software tools which are able to take advantage of the advance in computer hardware and software, this effort can help the community more efficiently incorporate computational intelligence into information theoretic research.\r\n \r\nThe main theoretical foundation for the approach is the entropy linear programming framework, and techniques based on symmetry and implication relations that can reduce the complexity of such programs. The core components of the toolbox are various software tools to perform information theoretic analysis and exploration of information systems in a computational manner. The completion of such a toolbox can enable researchers to build, with minimal programming efforts, computer software which takes in a description of the information system of interest, processes the relation among its components, formulates an appropriate optimization problem, and invokes a computational optimization solver to produce meaningful results regarding the fundamental limits and code constructions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "The conventional approach of identifying and deriving fundamental limits of information systems has become rather unwieldy, due to the increasing complexity of systems being studied.  Our novel computational approach utilizes a representation of entropy as a linear program, which allows us to compute the fundamental limits of an information theory system, instead of analytically deriving such bounds.  In this project, we developed an open source toolbox to automate steps of the computation pipeline.  A JSON based problem description format was first designed.  The implemented toolbox can automatically read the problem description file, generate the corresponding linear program, and complete the required computations, including: 1) computing an outer bound for a given linear combination of information measures and providing the values of information measures at the optimal solution; 2) efficiently computing a polytope tradeoff outer bound between two information quantities; 3) producing a proof (as a weighted sum of known information inequa lities) for a computed outer bound; and 4) providing a sensitivity analysis composed of the range for information quantities between which the optimal value does not change.e., sensitivity analysis.  Additional peripheral function templates are also provided to automate problem description generation and result visualization.  The toolbox has been released under GNU open source license, and is free to use by the general research community.\nThese functions allow researchers to perform information theoretic studies of information systems, without diving deep into the complex relation of the joint entropy and mutual information relations directly, or skillfully manipulating information inequalities to derive the lower bound.  We applied the toolset developed in this project on several research problems, such as coded caching, private information retrieval, distributed data storage, and multilevel diversity coding, which either led to new bounds or inspired new code designs.  The toolbox is anticipated to have further impact in future study of information systems.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/10/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James S Plank"
