 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hagfishes are a group of eel-shaped animals that are found in deep ocean habitats around the world. Hagfishes are notorious for their ability to thwart attacks by predators such as sharks by producing large volumes of gill-clogging slime in a fraction of a second after they are bitten. The slime is unique both in the speed with which it forms, and because it contains thousands of silk-like fibers known as slime threads. One aim of this project is to investigate how these 15-cm long fibers are produced within the cytoplasm of specialized cells called gland thread cells. To do this, researchers will observe developing gland thread cells using live cell microscope imaging techniques. The second aim of this project is to understand how the slime glands evolved and diversified. Hagfishes are an ancient group of about 78 described species, and the two species we have examined thus far have defensive slime that differs in significant ways. To explore the evolution and diversification of hagfishes and their slime glands, researchers will collect anatomical and genetic data from many hagfish species from around the world. Hagfish slime threads have material properties that rival those of high performance spider silks; understanding how they are made within cells could thus provide valuable information for efforts to produce bio-inspired textiles. Furthermore, this project dovetails with a summer outreach program called \"Inspiring Biology\", which aims to increase enthusiasm and participation in the sciences by under-represented minorities by introducing them to the concept of bio-inspired design.\r\n\r\nHagfishes are a group of 78 species of marine craniates that are important players in benthic ecosystems worldwide. One of their most remarkable adaptations is their ability to thwart attacks by fish predators by producing large volumes of gill-clogging slime in a fraction of a second. The slime consists of a synergistic mixture of seawater, mucus-like glycoproteins, and thousands of silk-like protein fibers known as \"slime threads\". While much is known about the function and mechanical properties of the slime, little is known about how the major slime components are produced within the slime glands or how the slime glands evolved. The project has two Aims. First, researchers will elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in slime thread production within hagfish gland thread cells. Specifically, several mechanistic hypotheses about how the slime thread elongates, coils, and matures within these cells will be tested. Second, the researchers will elucidate the evolutionary origins and diversification of hagfish slime glands. Specifically, they will test the hypotheses that the slime glands arose from invagination of the skin, or that they are serial homologs of cloacal glands and evolved via metameric duplication and modification. To achieve these aims, they will use an approach that integrates cell biological, morphological, and comparative transcriptomic and phylogenetic methods. These experiments will identify the genes that are most important for slime production and they will illuminate the proximate and ultimate mechanisms involved in the origins of an evolutionary novelty unique to hagfishes and central to their organismal biology.\r\n\r\nThis award was co-funded by the Physiological Mechanisms and Biomechanics Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems and the Cellular Dynamics and Function Program in the Division of Molecular and Cell Biology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In one part of this study, we investigated whether the cells that give rise to the fibrous component of hagfish slime, called gland thread cells, are larger in larger hagfish individuals and species. The vast majority of cell types do not vary with body size, with larger animals generally having more cells of the same size, rather than larger cells. We wondered if hagfish gland thread cells might be different given that they function outside of the animal and therefore are likely subject to different kinds of selective pressures than most cells. We indeed found that these cells are larger in larger hagfishes, which demonstrates that these cells are subject to unusual selective pressures that are more powerful than those that prevent scaling in other cells. We also explored the evolution of hagfish gland thread cells by investigating the structure and function of related cells in the epidermis, epidermal thread cells, which also possess a coiled thread within their cytoplasm. We found that these cells likely serve an anti-predator function and that they possess a large cluster of granules in their cytoplasm that might play a role warding off biting predators. By measuring gene expression patterns in both hagfish skin and slime glands, we also found that the proteins responsible for the threads in both epidermal thread cells and gland thread cells differ substantially, with the skin expressing only a single pair of thread genes while the slime glands express six pairs of related genes. These results support the hypothesis that thread cells in the slime glands arose from modifications of the thread cells in the skin. We also explored the function of hagfish slime by quantifying its clogging performance and found that the slime is remarkably good at clogging even at vanishingly low concentrations of about 35 mg per liter. We also discovered that it is the mucus component of the slime that is primarily responsible for the clogging performance, with the strong silk-like slime threads preventing the mucus from getting easily washed away from a predator&rsquo;s gills. In our efforts to collect slime glands from multiple species of hagfishes and measure their gene expression, we traveled to the Galapagos Islands, which at the time was known to have four species of hagfishes. During our time there, we discovered four new hagfish species, including the world&rsquo;s first albino hagfish, Myxine phantasma. This work has increased the number of known hagfish species worldwide by almost 5% and has raised interesting questions about why these animals are so diverse in the Galapagos and how they differ from one another in their ecology, behavior, and physiology.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/08/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Douglas&nbsp;S&nbsp;Fudge</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
