 "awd_abstract_narration": "Galaxies often eject large amounts of gas and dust in outflowing galactic winds, which are a crucial element in how galaxies evolve with cosmic time. These galactic outflows explain why galaxies form relatively few stars, compared to the amount of potential fuel available for star formation. They are required by theoretical models to correctly match the observed distributions of masses and star formation rates in galaxies, yet they remain poorly understood. This project will test the extent to which stars can create such winds. Investigators will determine the physical properties of outflows in galaxies that are undergoing a burst of star formation. This project will determine the physical characteristics of both the stars in the galaxies and the outflows they are driving. These galaxies likely represent a crucial phase in the creation of massive galaxies as they consume gas and shut down the future formation of stars. This project will train undergraduate and graduate students in research and implement outreach activities that will connect K-12 classrooms across the country with professional astronomers through in-class video discussions and follow-up reflection and assessment.\r\n\r\nFeedback in the form of outflowing gas and dust is a crucial aspect of galaxy evolution, explaining why galaxies form relatively few stars, compared to the baryon budget of the Universe. Galactic outflows are prevalent in star-forming galaxies and likely regulate and eventually shut off star formation. Despite the critical importance of feedback to the galaxy evolution process, its physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. This project will test the limits of stellar feedback by characterizing the physical properties and determining the space density of compact starburst galaxies that exhibit the fastest outflows (>1000 km/s) and highest star formation rate surface densities known. This project will determine physical characteristics of both the dusty starburst cores of these galaxies as well as the multi-phase outflowing gas. These results will constrain the physical drivers of these extreme outflows, as well as their impact on their host galaxies. This project aims to fully characterize the nature of the outflows, test a time sequence for the shutdown of star formation and the development of feedback, and place these galaxies in the broader context of massive galaxy formation. This project will also support the research efforts of multiple undergraduate students, as well as two graduate students, and will support outreach efforts to connect K-12 students with research by bringing professional astronomers into classrooms via in-class video discussions and follow-up reflection and assessment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWe have published a total of 4 peer-reviewed papers from this grant, with another paper that has been accepted and is in press, 2 more papers that have been submitted and are being refeered, and another paper at a very advanced stage that will be submitted soon.  These 9 papers span a wide range of aspects studying extreme compact, distant, star-forming galaxies that are driving extraordinarily fast outflows of gas and dust out of the galaxies into the space around the galaxies.  Such outflows are thought to be a key stage in galaxy evolution, explaining how star forming galaxies turn into quiescent galaxies that are no longer forming stars.  As stars are created from cold, dense gas, in order to shut off star formation an energetic event is needed that either removes and/or heats up the gas, such that it can not collapse in the future to form new generations of stars.  While such outflows are proposed to be a crucial stage in galaxy evolution, the details of how these outflows are created, what their properties are, how far the ejected gas travels, and how the outflowing gas interacts with the lower density gas surrounding galaxies are all unclear.  We have used a variety of spectroscopic data, primarily from the Keck Observatories in Hawaii, to characterize these outflows in greater detail and also understand how the galaxies we are studying are related to the larger galaxy population.  Our observations are also highly constraining for theoretical models of galaxy evolution, and in particular models of outflows and the creation of quiescent galaxies. \n\n \n\nOne of the most exciting aspects of this work is that we discovered the largest galactic outflow ever observed; the gas in this outflow reaches over 50 times farther away than the stars in the galaxy.  The outflow is much larger than the galaxy, and is in fact populating the halo of lower density gas around the galaxy on very large scales.  This discovery has generated a lot of interest in the field and has helped to resolve a long-standing question of how galaxies have so much gas around them; how did it get there?  Large-scale outflows driven by bursts of star formation appear to be a key creator of this halo gas.  We have also been determining the properties of the outflowing gas, such as the gas kinematics (speeds), densities, morphology, ionization state, and metallicity which allows us to both constrain what creates these outflows and also what they do to the galaxies they are in.  We find that very high densities of star formation in galaxies can drive such extreme outflows, which do expand well beyond the galaxy itself.  We also find that the outflows a large amount of mass (in the form of gas and dust) and eject enough mass from the galaxy that they likely can shut off star formation in the galaxy, creating quiescent galaxies.  This implies that these outflows play a substantial role in creating massive, quiescent galaxies.  We have also studied the properties of the galaxies themselves, their star formation properties, star formation histories, gas densities, and ionization states, all of which help determine the conditions needed in galaxies to create such powerful outflows.  We have also estimated the space density of our galaxies, which reflects how common they are, and compared their space densities to other known galaxy populations, to check for consistency in the scenario that they may be an important pathway that star forming galaxies follow on their way to quiescence.  This allows us to place our galaxies in a cosmological context and compare with theoretical simulations.  Our work has garnered great interest from theorists who work on galaxy evolution, star formation driven outflows, and properties of the gas surrounding galaxies, and it has been rewarding to work with them to both test their current models and inform their thinking about what useful predictions they could make in future models and numerical simulations. \n\n \n\nThrough the life of this grant our team has been involved in numerous outreach events to middle and high school students to present our work and talk about what being a professional astronomer entails.  The grant has also provided numerous educational and mentoring opportunities for undergraduate students, graduate students, and a postdoctoral researcher across multiple institutions, including both large, public state universities as well as small, undergraduate-only institutions.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/29/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alison L Coil"
