The funds will be used to cover the registration fees for participating postdocs, assistant and associate professors. The symposium aims to highlight recent advances in controlled polymerization and functionalization techniques enabling the synthesis of chemically heterogeneous copolymers (and block copolymers) with complex architectures, as well as their self-assembly characteristics. The symposium offers opportunity for the cross-fertilization between academic faculty, R&D industrial researchers, postdocs and graduate students regarding progress in both fundamental and technological aspects of polymer synthesis, self-assembly and applications.",
