 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Control of atomic scale structure in ultra-thin films on non-planar substrates is critical to next generation optical, electrical, biological, and magnetic materials and devices. In particular, nanoscale control of materials is essential to enable further decreases in the feature sizes and growth of materials in three dimensional architectures that are being developed for applications such as logic circuitry, memories, and photovoltaics. This research investigates the fundamental rearrangement of single atomic layers on surfaces during thin film growth, and provides important knowledge regarding the factors that influence transformation of disordered layers of atoms into ordered, crystalline arrangements. The primary experimental platform utilizes an electron beam to probe the structure of atomically-thick layers during growth and thermal processing. The research also uses atomically-resolved electron microscopy to probe the structure of these films. The knowledge generated from this research allows for an enhanced control and understanding of the formation of nanoscale crystalline materials that can be created on three dimensional (non-planar) surfaces and impacts a wide variety of fields in nanoelectronics, computing, photovoltaics, and nanoscale mechanical systems. This research activity is integrated with a university thin film course, a hands-on equipment laboratory, and an industrial outreach effort. Graduates typically find employment in national laboratory or industry.  \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: This research elucidates the fundamental transformations that occur during atomic layer deposition and annealing by utilizing in situ reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED). Current atomic layer deposition (ALD) processes are often limited in terms of the structural control that is available due to precursor decomposition at high temperatures, which presents a significant barrier to precisely controlled three dimensional epitaxial architectures that are integral to next generation electronics. Therefore, this work separates the precursor chemisorption steps (ALD component) that result in amorphous layers from thermal processing that provides energy needed to induce crystallization in the model material system gallium oxide. Importantly, electron diffraction is probing in real time the structural transformations that occur to reveal the effect of ambient atmosphere, substrate structure, and orientation with adlayer thicknesses in the range of 0.5-10 nm. Analytical electron microscopy is providing precise structural and compositional details of the films and film-substrate interfaces including defect characteristics. This research captures a slow-motion picture of the structural changes that occur during many traditional thin film epitaxy techniques, and yields new relationships that control crystallization of ultra-thin layers and thus impacts the thin film/epitaxy communities. Undergraduate and graduate students are trained during the research. Industrial engagements are pursued with the Lehigh University Office of Economic Engagement. Mentorship and outreach are conducted with Lehigh University's Clare Booth Scholarship Program, Mountaintop Experience, and a local science center.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project investigated the intricacies of thin film growth of metal oxide materials using an electron beam probe. An existing system was adapted to conduct both atomic layer deposition (ALD, a film growth process) in conjunction with reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED, an electron beam monitoring technique) within the same system. The system was redesigned, modeled, constructed, tested, and its value demonstrated during this project.\r\n\n\nThe nuances of integrating the two techniques (RHEED and ALD) were modeled using analytical and numerical techniques to determine system physical dimensions and operational limitations such as temperature and pressure. Several custom-buid parts and commercial components were used to construct the deposition system. The system was carefully calibrated by conducting electron diffraction (RHEED) using gold and sapphire samples. Initial measurements on films were conducted by monitoring the crystallization of hafnium oxide, an important dielectric in modern electronic devices. This initial work was published in Review of Scientific Instruments (Howzen et al, 2024).\r\n\n\nFurther studies conducted focused on studying the nuances of gallium oxide phase changes and epitaxy. Gallium oxide is an attractive material for power electronics and solar-blind photodetectors. Understanding and manipulating the growth, texture, and crystal structure is highly important for application of this material. Central to this work was the ability to observe the crystallinity of the growing films using the RHEED capability. To this end, films grown at several different temperatures were monitored and it was discovered that the structure (amorphous/glassy vs crystalline) could be controlled with by controlling the substrate temperature. The ability to monitor the structure allows for real time understanding of film growth behavior. Additional studies grew gallium oxide thin films of varying thickness in the amorphous state and used RHEED to monitor crystallinity during a ramped heating after growth. This study tested and confirmed the hypothesis that larger film thicknesses would be more constrained and thus crystallize at higher temperatures.\r\n\n\nIn this work, a hands-on laboratory was created as part of a thin film science and technology course taught to undergraduate and graduate students at Lehigh University. Students were given hands on tasks with vacuum system hardware so they could become competant at vacuum-system techniques including thin film growth and many characterization techniques. In one instance, students were broken into groups and they grew films using Lehigh's cleanroom facility. Each team was then responsible for mastering a characterization technique and measuring the films grown. Finally, the entire team was tasked with creating a technical document (similar to a peer-reviewed publication) and presentation. Skills sharpened in this broader impacts activity include technical skills, vacuum systems, teamwork, and technical communcation.\r\n\n\nOverall, this work advanced the knowledge of film growth using ALD by integrating electron diffraction and studied several important material compositions (hafnium oxide and gallium oxide). These materials are important for a wide range of optical and electrical devices.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/26/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: NickStrandwitz\n"
