 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, CalcVR, will explore the use of virtual reality (VR) in the teaching of multi-variable calculus. An important outcome is that the principal investigators will more than triple the number of lessons and demonstrations they have created so far on a cutting-edge educational platform based on the Unity software platform and freely available tools from Google. Additionally, the new materials may be extended to allow others to build VR materials that can be easily deployed. The design of the software will allow for distribution at no cost to the user through the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store. Further, the hardware costs are negligible, because Smartphones are almost universal. \r\n\r\nIn multi-variable calculus, one of the greatest obstacles for students is the visualization of surfaces and other figures in three or more dimensions.  To support students' visualization in calculus, CalcVR has two overarching goals. The first is to create and improve demonstrations and lessons of multi-variable calculus concepts in an immersive virtual reality environment that can be easily accessed using mobile technology, via the freely-available CalcVR app. The second is to measure the effectiveness of the educational material in the CalcVR app and corresponding course materials. Formative assessments will include student interviews, feedback from an Advisory Board of experts, and broad student surveys. Additional research will include the analysis of student responses to specific exam questions on conceptual topics of importance.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Each of the major goals of the CalcVR Project listed above was supported directly by 1) multiple development cycles of virtual reality (VR) materials, 2) development of supplemental materials, 3) student interviews, advisory board meetings, and cycles of course usage and revision of materials.</p>\n<p>The development of VR materials in the <em>CalcVR</em> Project has yielded huge advancements in the material presented and the quality of the presentations. The earliest versions of lessons in the CalcVR app were primarily passive presentations of the topics with 3D visuals and narration. Based on student interviews, advisory board meetings, and surveys of course usage, the PIs have added multiple levels of interaction for the user to actively engage with the graphical and conceptual elements in VR. Examples include the ability to rewind/fast forward lessons, enhanced ways for users to input their own generating functions, interact with figures and change the dynamic measurements in lessons, switch from external views to being on a figure (like a surface or inside a vector field), embedded questions that utilize common distractors, randomized options, or modifying figures to match a particular property, and many more. Over the four years of NSF support, the CalcVR has grown to 55 VR scenes (tutorials, lessons, quizzes, or playgrounds) organized across seven chapters of material. All of these lessons have been upgraded in terms of functionality, and most lessons have undergone multiple revisions of their content based on the feedback listed above. Additionally, the PIs have upgraded the infrastructure of the <em>CalcVR</em> app to utilize industry standard tools. These updates have allowed the PIs to greatly increase the number of capable devices including publication to the Oculus Lab store (which supports devices like the very popular Quest 2 headset). As of summer 2022, the CalcVR app has been downloaded by over 5000 unique users (across all platforms) despite only being required for course usage at SFA.</p>\n<p>As has been studied in flipped classrooms with videos, it is necessary to have active learning activities that connect the external resources to the course work and class meetings. The PIs created <a href=\"https://calcvr.org\">CalcVR.org</a> to host supplemental materials that connect the VR materials to course requirements. Additionally, <a href=\"https://calcvr.org\">CalcVR.org</a> offers guides for setting up and using the CalcVR app on each platform, as well as support options for users. The CalcVR supplemental materials have been classroom tested by the PIs and include multiple types of activities, from interactive homework problems to in-class activities to scaffolded explorations. While these supplemental materials were designed to complement <em>CalcVR</em>, many of them are appropriate for use in all multivariable calculus classes.</p>\n<p>The assessment of the effectiveness of <em>CalcVR</em> materials has taken many forms. In 2019 and 2020, the PIs met with an advisory board of faculty who are experienced with implementing innovative technology in mathematics courses. The advisory board provided a valuable formative assessment of <em>CalcVR</em> materials as well as a diverse set of perspectives on what faculty would need to implement materials like <em>CalcVR</em>. The <em>CalcVR</em> application has been used by over 150 students over 6 sections of multivariable calculus at SFA. Students provided informal feedback to the PIs, testing of <em>CalcVR</em> on a wide range of smartphones, feedback on setting up and getting started with <em>CalcVR</em> (using only the guides on calcvr.org), and through a modified version of the SALG (Student Assessment of Learning Gains). As a primitive summative assessment, the SALG data showed that students identified the <em>CalcVR</em> materials as having a positive effect on their engagement with calculus and geometric concepts. In 2018 and 2019, Dr. Steven Jones interviewed student users about what they notice and how they use <em>CalcVR's</em> virtual reality lessons. These interviews resulted in a lot of useful formative assessments (and associated modifications of CalcVR materials) and a published paper by the PIs and Dr. Jones [Full article: Design of virtual reality modules for multivariable calculus and an examination of student noticing within them. In fall 2021, Dr. Rafael Martinez-Planell conducted student interviews to compare the VR adaptations of multivariable function activities that the PIs had added in summer 2021.&nbsp; Preliminary analysis of these results shows that the VR adaptations were comparable to traditional implementations of these APOS activities with some better results in a few geometric concepts.</p>\n<p>In addition to the activities above, the CalcVR app has been distributed and updated on the Google Play Store and iOS App Store (since 2017) and the Oculus Labs store (since Spring 2022).
