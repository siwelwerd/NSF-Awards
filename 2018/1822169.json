 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arizona State University will collaborate with The University of Arizona, University of Southern California, Southern Illinois University Carbondale and the University of Connecticut to plan for the formation of a new Industry University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC), called Center for Networked Embedded, Smart and Trusted Things (NESTT).  Companies from a wide spectrum of industries will be recruited and will work jointly with faculty to create a portfolio of industry-ranked, multi-disciplinary research projects to develop innovative solutions to fundamental technological and societal challenges posed by Internet of Things (IoT). The outcome will be a proposal to establish NESTT as an IUCRC. \r\n\r\nASU will work with its partners to organize workshops involving industry leaders and academic researchers to draft the research agenda for NESTT, aimed at accelerating IoT technology development and transfer to industry, and make opportunities from the IoT equitable, safe and secure for all. ASU expertise will include edge and Fog computing; safe and secure cyber-physical systems; machine learning, data analytics; trustworthy, networked embedded systems; robotics and industrial IoT; smart cities and transportation systems; sensors and wearable electronics; IoT governance, technology-related law and ethics, and business models. NESTT at ASU will further the participation of underrepresented students in STEM disciplines.  \r\n\r\nThe IoT will become the foundational technology for every major industry.  NESTT?s technological innovations and holistic multi-disciplinary design will lower the barriers to the adoption IoT technologies which will accelerate the delivery of significant economic, societal and environmental returns. The enormous wealth of data generated from such IoT systems will also lead to new discoveries and inventions in many scientific disciplines as scientific communities further embrace data-driven research.  The planning for NESTT will include working with industry partners to develop innovative ways for recruiting (in industry and academia) underrepresented students in STEM disciplines. \r\n\r\nThe agenda and documentation of activities for the NESTT IUCRC planning meetings will be made available on ASU's website for the Center for Embedded Systems (https://embedded.asu.edu ). It will be maintained until the establishment of NESTT, and then merged with the NESTT site.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
