 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vector-borne diseases affect virtually everyone on earth.  Mosquitoes are the most widely distributed disease vectors and are a serious threat to human life and health. West Nile virus (WNV) is one of the mosquito-borne diseases for which there is still no effective treatment; to date, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported over 40,000 cases across the United States. Temperature and precipitation are the two most important weather variables that affect mosquito populations and thus affect the WNV transmission cycle.  The mosquito infection rate (MIR) is considered an important mediator to study WNV risk. Based on surveillance data for WNV in Illinois, this project aims to develop new methodologies and algorithms to study WNV and MIR using weather and environmental variables. Specifically, the investigators plan first to make predictions of MIR and then characterize the spatial pattern of temperature and precipitation to identify the risk level of WNV human illness and MIR. They will also establish a WNV Index to provide a reliable and interpretable warning for vector-borne disease risk. Finally, since mosquito-borne diseases are particularly affected by rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and a higher frequency of extreme weather events, the project aims to both quantitatively and qualitatively project the current risk to the future under climate change. The research will foster fundamental statistical methodology development as well as collaborations between statistics and public health. Graduate and undergraduate students will be engaged in aspects of the scientific research. The project will provide new results on the impact of climate change on national security, of general interest and importance to the wider public and policymakers.\r\n\r\nThe methods of this project include a spatially-varying-coefficient model with functional weather covariates to make predictions of MIR, as well as a multiple-testing approach to characterize the spatial pattern of temperature and precipitation for ultimately classifying the weather pattern into different risk levels with respect to WNV. The statistical models and algorithms learned from the historical data will be applied to downscaled future weather data to study the impact of climate change on WNV human illness and MIR. The analyses will be based on massive data including WNV human cases, MIR, current and future spatio-temporal stochastic weather processes, land cover, and the length of daylight. The statistical methods used in the project are not only effective for this WNV study but can be a general methodology for a wide range of vector-borne diseases. The spatially-varying-coefficient model with functional covariates takes the continuous and dynamic influence of the retrospective weather on MIR into account while allowing the relationship between MIR and weather and other environmental variables to vary over a spatial domain. The characterization of the spatial weather pattern and the establishment of WNV Index provide a new perspective to study and prevent WNV risk. Compared to previous methods that evaluate the difference between two spatio-temporal random fields as a whole, the multiple-testing approach in this project can detect exactly where the differences occur. This feature is crucial for regional risk detection. Quantifying the impact of climate change on vector-borne diseases is essential to policymakers; the results of the project are expected to provide a reliable resource for such purposes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The primary outcomes are listed below:</p>\n<p>1 We developed methods for comparing spatiotemporal data. The development of vector-borne diseases such as West Nile virus is closely related to climate and weather patterns, because some climate and weather patterns may be more suitable for vectors like mosquitoes to survive and breed. Identifying which pattern is associated with the outbreak of disease requires comparing spatiotemporal data. We have developed different methods for comparing and evaluating the difference between two spatiotemporal processes. One is based on functional data depth and another on multiple testing for spatial data. See an example in Figure 1.</p>\n<p>2 We developed a flexible and computationally efficient model with a fused penalty for spatial extremes. We then extended this method to quantify the location-specific impact of truck-mounted ULV adulticide spray efforts from 2010 to 2018 in the North Shore Mosquito Abatement District (NSMAD) in metropolitan Chicago, IL, on commonly assessed risk factors from NSMAD surveillance gravid traps: Culex abundance, infection rate, and vector index. See Figure 2. We found that ULV adulticide spraying has an immediate temporary reduction in abundance followed by an increase after five days. It is estimated that mosquito abundance increased more in sprayed areas than if left unsprayed in all but three trap locations.</p>\n<p>3 We developed functional data analysis methods to learn the relationship between different variables and the structures of spatiotemporal data. For example, we proposed a spatially varying functional regression model and changepoint estimation for spatially indexed functional data. In particular, we used the changepoint estimation method to study the Covid-19 data in Illinois. As we all know, the coronavirus emerged as mainly attacking older adults, but then it was observed that the age distribution of covid cases moved toward younger ones. One interesting question in studying how covid cases evolve is to identify when the age distribution changes. To investigate this question in our state, we obtain the daily covid cases for all counties in Illinois between 01/01/2021 and 04/05/2021, 95 days in total, from the Illinois Department of Public Health. The data reports the number of cumulative confirmed and probable positive cases in 9 age groups (&lt; 20, 20&ndash;29, 30&ndash;39, 40&ndash;49, 50&ndash;59, 60&ndash;69, 70&ndash;79, 80+, Unknown). We estimated changepoint for all counties in Illinois that appear to have an age distribution change. See Figure 3 for an example.</p>\n<p>4 We developed statistical and machine learning methods for spatiotemporal data fusion. How to effectively integrate data from different sources and of different resolutions to make discovery is a long-standing and challenging problem. We have developed both Bayesian hierarchical models and neural network-Gaussian process methods for data integration. We also applied a deep learning method called graph neural network to forecast West Nile virus in Illinois using both mosquito trap testing results (see Figure 4) and weather data. We showed that graph neural networks outperform a range of baseline methods for our data and problem. Our results can aid mosquito surveillance and abatement efforts within the state.</p>\n<p><strong>Broder Impact:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Student training</strong>&nbsp;Five of my former PhD students including four underrepresented, Dr. Sooin Yun, Dr. Danielle Sass, Dr. Trevor Harris, Dr. Mengchen Wang and Dr. Maurice Campos&nbsp;&nbsp;have worked on the proposed project as part of their dissertations.
