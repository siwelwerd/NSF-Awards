 "awd_abstract_narration": "Improving the teaching and learning of STEM concepts at the elementary level is an important priority for STEM education.  This Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE), Development and Implementation project aims to develop service learning projects that involve teams that include undergraduate engineering and education majors.  These undergraduates will collaborate to develop and deliver one-hour engineering lessons to elementary school students.  This project addresses three needs: 1) to increase the academic and professional persistence of engineering students; 2) to prepare engineers and elementary pre-service educators for workplace demands of collaborating and communicating in multi-disciplinary contexts; and 3) to prepare elementary teachers to gain confidence and competence to integrate engineering into instruction.  These cross-disciplinary, service-learning projects will be embedded into three core classes for education and three core classes for engineering students. Collaboration 1 will pair first year engineering students studying engineering design and pre-service teachers in Education Foundations. Collaboration 2 will pair upper level engineering students in Computation Methods and pre-service teachers in Educational Technology. Collaboration 3 will pair upper division engineering students in Fluid Mechanics with pre-service teachers in Science Methods. The research conducted in this study seeks to examine the ways in which this intervention affects: 1) the engineering students' understanding of engineering concepts; 2) the education students' knowledge of engineering and science; 3) the collaboration skills of both groups of students; 4) the first year engineering students' academic persistence in engineering; and 5) the upper level students' professional persistence in engineering and teaching.  Data will be disaggregated by student participant demographics (e.g., race, gender, ethnicity, and military status).  \r\n\r\nThe goals of this project are to: 1) increase academic persistence in first year engineering students; 2) increase professional persistence in upper level engineering students; 3) enhance collaboration skills for engineering and education students; 4) enhance engineering knowledge of engineering students; and 5) enhance engineering knowledge of pre-service teachers. Engineering students and pre-service teachers will be guided by the Next Generation Science Standards and Virginia Standards of Learning as they develop lessons to enhance elementary students' understanding of engineering and computational thinking. Engineering students will help devise the engineering challenges that will drive the inquiry-based lessons, while education students will be primarily responsible for developing the lesson plans. Both student groups will be involved in lesson delivery to elementary school students. This project intends to: examine standardized exam results appropriate for each group of students (e.g., fundamentals of engineering and Praxis exam questions suitable to the topic being studied); use standardized assessment rubrics to assess student technical work (engineering only) and collaboration skills (engineering and education); qualitatively assess student reflections about the process of lesson development; and track persistence in the engineering students.  This project aims to determine if this approach to teaching can significantly change engineering content knowledge, communication and collaboration skills, and persistence.  The proposed research is expected to contribute to the body of knowledge in teaching and learning by determining whether significant changes in engineering/science content knowledge can be achieved through collaborative partnerships between engineering and elementary education students.  It is anticipated that a replicable instructional model that can be adopted by engineering and teacher preparation programs across the country will result.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These classes were: 1) a 100 level mechanical engineering class collaborating with a foundations class in education to deliver lessons during a field trip, 2) engineering students in an electromechanical systems class collaborating with an educational technology class delivering an after school robotics club, and 3) a fluid mechanics class collaborating with a science methods class to teach about fluid mechanics and deliver an engineering lesson during a field trip. The main objectives of this project were to determine how an interdisciplinary service learning project would affect engineering knowledge and teamwork skills in engineering and education students, as well as retention and persistence in engineering students. There were three&nbsp; key research findings from this project. First,&nbsp; teamwork skills improved in engineering and education students by participating in the interdisciplinary service learning project when compared to traditional group projects within the same classes. Second, knowledge of the engineering design process improved in both engineering and education students who participated in the interventions. Finally, upper level engineering students who participated in this project were more likely to want to pursue a career in engineering over students who participated in comparison classes. 381 education students and 395 engineering students participated in this intervention. This research developed pedagogy for education students to learn about engineering, something that is currently lacking in their curriculum, while it is mandated in Virginia standards of learning and next generation science standards. Over the course of this project we worked with&nbsp; seven schools (5 public, 2 private), four of these schools are Title I schools. Approximately 1200 elementary students participated in the 120 engineering lessons that were delivered.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<div><span><br /></span></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/29/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Stacie&nbsp;Ringleb</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1821658/1821658_10573113_1675039725133_IMG_2065--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1821658/1821658_10573113_1675039725133_IMG_2065--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Spring 2022 collaboration\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1821658/1821658_10573113_1675039725133_IMG_2065--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Spring 2022 collaboration\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Engineering and Education Students worked on and engineering project with fourth graders outside at Larchmont Elementary School, as COVID-19 restrictions were still in place.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">unknown</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Stacie&nbsp;Ringleb</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Spring 2022 collaboration</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1821658/1821658_10573113_1675045777496_zoomrobots--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1821658/1821658_10573113_1675045777496_zoomrobots--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Zoom robotics\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1821658/1821658_10573113_1675045777496_zoomrobots--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Zoom robotics\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Engineering and Education Students Collaborating with elementary student over zoom to create a bio inspired robot</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jennifer Kidd</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Stacie&nbsp;Ringleb</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Zoom robotics</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1821658/1821658_10573113_1675045926804_19S_C1_ED___720x960___p258--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1821658/1821658_10573113_1675045926804_19S_C1_ED___720x960___p258--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Field Trip Year 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1821658/1821658_10573113_1675045926804_19S_C1_ED___720x960___p258--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Field Trip Year 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Engineering Day Field Trip</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">unknown</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Stacie&nbsp;Ringleb</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Field Trip Year 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1821658/1821658_10573113_1675046363964_collab3teaching--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1821658/1821658_10573113_1675046363964_collab3teaching--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Pre-Field Trip Lesson\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1821658/1821658_10573113_1675046363964_collab3teaching--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Pre-Field Trip Lesson\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students in collaboration 3 teaching fourth graders about fluid mechanics.
