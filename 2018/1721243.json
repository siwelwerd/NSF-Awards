 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the research capacity at these institutions expands the opportunities for students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be locally relevant, and encourages a faculty community to look beyond the traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This project, entitled \"Understanding Pollination With Research Designed for Student participation (UPWRDS),\" aligns directly with that goal, and moreover may prove to be a model for similar engagement at other small community colleges.\r\n\r\nThe project objectives are to provide an opportunity for SKC faculty and students to conduct original and community relevant research that contributes to scientific knowledge, benefits education, and leverages support for continuing research opportunities. UPWRDS specifically addresses the following:  1) Does the exclusion of pollinators significantly influence huckleberry productivity on the Flathead Reservation?; and 2) Which organisms are the primary probable pollinators of huckleberry plants on the Reservation compared to the overall active pollinator community?  The work will be pursued through pollinator exclosure experiments, direct netting of pollinators observed visiting huckleberry flowers, time-constrained net sweeps, berry productivity counts, and berry seed counts. Time-lapse cellular cameras will be employed to track huckleberry phenology to assist researchers in determining the timing for data collection during flowering and peak berry ripeness.",

Faculty at SKC are often unable to pursue research due to lack of funding and heavy teaching loads. The majority of students at SKC are American Indian and first generation college students that might otherwise not have the opportunity to gain research experiences and skills. Fifteen students worked on various aspects of this NSF funded research through paid research internships, and several of these students completed research papers and presentations based on independent research questions related to this work. Students gained skills in experimental design, data collection and analyses, writing research papers, and preparing presentations for both the general public and professional scientists. These skills will help these students follow successful careers or continuing education at the graduate level.</p>\n<p>The focus of this research was the pollination of huckleberries (<em>Vaccinium membrenaceum</em>), a culturally significant keystone species in the Pacific Northwest. Many people enjoy huckleberries and huckleberry products, and American Indian tribes have relied on huckleberries for countless generations. Since these plants are difficult to grow outside of their natural habitat most huckleberries are harvested from the wild for personal use as well as commercial sales. In addition to their value to humans, huckleberries are a primary food source for wildlife. For example, huckleberries can provide over half of a grizzly bears diet during peak productivity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We used remote cameras to document the animals visiting huckleberry plants and plant development. We observed multiple vertebrate animals feeding on the leaves, shoots, and berries including black bear, grizzly bear, deer, moose, snowshoe hare, squirrels, chipmunks, mice, and a variety of bird species. We also documented huckleberry flower visitors that included at least 11 species of bumble bees, other native bees, wasps, ants, and hummingbirds. We further confirmed that bumble bees, mostly queen bees, are the primary huckleberry flower visitors through standardized observations and direct captures. We used non-lethal methods to photograph bumble bees for identification. We continued bumble bee captures and focal observations throughout the growing season to learn more about the flowers they visit both during and after huckleberry flowering. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Documentation of bumble bee visits to huckleberry flowers did not address the potential importance of pollination to berry formation. To quantify the value of pollination to huckleberries we conducted a huckleberry enclosure study. We created bags from thule netting and secured these over huckleberry plants during flowering to exclude pollinators from accessing the flowers. We selected 120 experimental plants and placed the bags over half of these plants. We then chose half of the plants of each of these treatments to be hand-pollinated using pollination wands. This resulted in a 4-factor experimental design. We randomly assigned 30 plants to each of the following treatments; 1) natural pollinators: no net and no additional hand-pollination, 2) extra pollination: no net and extra hand-pollination by humans, 3) hand-pollinated only: natural pollinators excluded with netting but hand-pollinated by humans, and 4) no pollination: natural pollinators excluded with netting and no additional hand-pollination by humans. We removed the bags after flowering was complete and counted the berries on each treatment plant as they developed. We collected ripened berries, transferred them to a lab for recounting and obtaining weights. Berries were frozen until a method was developed to extract and count seeds from a subset of berries.</p>\n<p>We found that plants in treatments that included pollination had significantly (nearly tenfold) as many berries as the treatments that excluded pollinators. Berry weights were significantly higher for pollinated treatments than treatments that excluded natural pollinators. There was no significant difference among treatments for seed counts. This research provides evidence that there are crucial connections between bumble bees and huckleberries. Pollination of huckleberry flowers is essential for the production of large numbers of berries. Huckleberries flower early in the growing season when bumble bee queens emerge from hibernation and are collecting pollen and nectar for nesting. The value of these results are especially important considering concerns about population declines of many bumble bee species and the potential impacts of climate change on ecosystem dynamics. This information has and is being shared with the community to bring awareness to the importance of native pollinators and the potential impacts of climate change on mismatches in the timing of bumble bee emergence and huckleberry flowering.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/24/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Janene&nbsp;Lichtenberg</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1721243/1721243_10527619_1648147627007_Catchingbumblebees--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1721243/1721243_10527619_1648147627007_Catchingbumblebees--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Catching bumble bees\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1721243/1721243_10527619_1648147627007_Catchingbumblebees--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Catching bumble bees\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Student research intern capturing bumble bees at a huckleberry site on the Flathead Reservation, Montana.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Janene Lichtenberg, SKC</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Janene&nbsp;Lichtenberg</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Catching bumble bees</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1721243/1721243_10527619_1648144079517_IMG_6135--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1721243/1721243_10527619_1648144079517_IMG_6135--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Huckleberry Enclosure Study\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1721243/1721243_10527619_1648144079517_IMG_6135--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Huckleberry Enclosure Study\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Some of the 120 plants included in a study to quantify the value of pollination to the development of huckleberries.
