 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum mechanics is at the heart of 21st century science and technologies. To prepare a large and competent STEM workforce, instruction in quantum mechanics needs to reflect deep understandings of how people learn quantum mechanics. The project team will study how experts and novices visualize and conceptualize quantum systems. They will also study how people use and coordinate these understandings during complex quantum calculations. This research will produce new knowledge about three areas. The first area is how students and experts understand and use a variety of ways to represent quantum mechanical systems. The second area is how to best sequence representations in an approach that starts with the quantum mechanical idea of spin. This question will seek to find the approach that best supports development of correct student reasoning. The third area is how computational tools might support student learning in quantum mechanics. New research-based, student-centered instructional materials will be developed and tested in courses across the Paradigms in Physics program. This program is a national model for curricular reform that features a variety of active-engagement teaching strategies. The Paradigms in Physics program takes a spins-first approach to quantum mechanics, exploring the implications of the postulates of quantum mechanics while using simulations of quantum experiments to develop intuitions about quantum systems. The Paradigms in Physics program also features a computational physics lab that is coordinated with the main courses. This addition will allow students to harness the power of computation to explore and understand physical systems. This project is aligned with the discipline-based education research agenda recently set by The National Research Council: research conducted in a sequence of upper-division courses at the intersection of math, physics, and computer science with learning environments that promote problem-solving, metacognition, and visualization.\r\n\r\nA major focus of this project is the development of a learning progression for quantum mechanics, by documenting the evolution of student understanding of the fundamental concepts and representations used in quantum mechanics as they progress through the upper-division physics major. Problem-solving interviews will be conducted with both experts and students to establish levels and pathways in the learning progression. Real-time student learning will be documented with videos of students working collaboratively in class and analyzed using rigorous qualitative research methods. The learning progression will be documented graphically on a public, interactive website, including information about instructional materials, sequences of concepts & representations, and supporting research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

A hallmark of the Paradigms in Physics quantum mechanics curriculum is the attention to a spins-first approach and leveraging multiple representations. In this grant, qualitative research methods were used to create new knowledge of how students understand and use multiple representations to learn and do quantum mechanics, how to sequence representations in a spins-first approach to support student reasoning about quantum systems, and how computation may be leveraged to support student learning in quantum mechanics. Additionally, a series of curricular arcs for a spins-first approach to teaching quantum mechanics were studied and articulated.</p>\n<p>The Arms Representation of Complex Numbers and Quantum States is a kinesthetic representation invented by our group where a person's left fist represents a complex number in a complex plane swept out by their left arm. Quantum states are represented by groups of people, each of whom uses their left arm to represent a complex probability amplitude associated with each of the basis states. The Arms Representation supports students' learning of quantum concepts like complex probability amplitudes, relative and overall phase, time evolution, and wavefunctions. We used interview methods to study how students use the Arms Representation and relate it to other representations. We also studied how students experience the Arms Representation in class. We described how the affordances of the Arms Representation help students from diverse populations explore their own ideas and improve their understanding of key quantum concepts. We also described how kinesthetic activities like the Arms Representation interact with aspects of students' physics identities: interest, self-efficacy, and perceived recognition.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We also explored how computation can support student understanding of the connection between discrete and continuous systems. Through a series of qualitative interviews, we studied students&rsquo; ideas of continuity in quantum mechanics. We found that many students associate different representational systems with different levels of continuity. Often, students interpret bra/ket and matrix notations as indicating discreteness while function notation indicates continuity. Python code is more ambiguous and student interpretations of continuity are more varied.&nbsp; Additionally, in computational contexts, students have a robust understanding of an integral as a sum. These results further support the idea that computation can be leveraged to help students understand the connections and differences between discrete and continuous quantum observables.</p>\n<p>One key connection is that quantum states can be expressed in discrete or continuous bases. We studied how students understand and use completeness relations to express a quantum state in a basis and to change the basis in which a quantum state is expressed. We found that students can use and understand completeness relations productively as a special form of one formed by adding up all of the projections of the quantum state vector onto all of the basis vectors. However, we found that students have difficulty interpreting a set of numbers as a function and often make commutation errors with vectors represented in bra/ket notation.</p>\n<p>In this grant, we also identified and articulated several curricular arcs. These arcs describe an instructional sequence aimed at building students' conceptual and procedural sophistication over time. They may span several units/courses and may develop in terms of concepts or representations. We articulated curricular arcs about: Graphs of 1-D Wavefunctions, the Arms Representation of Complex Numbers and Quantum States, Vector Line Integration, and Partial Derivatives. Similarly, we described how the Paradigms in Physics courses sequence quantum systems (spin, particle in a box, particle on a ring, particle on a sphere, the hydrogenic atom, free particle, finite well/barrier, periodic well, and the harmonic oscillator) in order to support the students' conceptual and procedural sophistication.</p>\n<p>This project produced 9 peer-reviewed publications, 42 presentations/workshops, 2 PhD dissertations, and 3 master&rsquo;s theses.
