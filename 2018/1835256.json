 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to develop and automatize a connection between Earth observation data and numerical models of Earth system processes. Both collection of Earth observation data from satellites and modeling of physical processes have seen unprecedented advances in recent years. However, data-derived information is not used to inform modeling in a systematic and automated fashion. This creates a bottleneck that is growing with the data revolution. The award supports the development of a software cyberinfrastructure aimed at reducing this bottleneck by automating classification and parameterization. The proposed cyberinfrastructure will be implemented in a general and transportable way, but its functionality will be demonstrated by addressing a concrete open problem in glaciology: the acceleration during a glacier surge, which is characterized by an increase to 100-200 times the flow normal velocity. Glacial accelerations are important, because they constitute the largest uncertainty in sea-level-rise assessment. The team, from University of Colorado will combine their expertise of field work and data collection with their background in software development to generate a high-quality application that will be made available under an open source license to the broader scientific community. The project will engage graduate and undergraduate students in the software development, thus contributing to the development of future generations of scientists and cyberinfrastructure professionals.  The results will also be used to inform activities in K-12 schools and other outreach efforts.\r\n\r\nThe proposed data-driven auto-adaptive classification system is expected to provide a tool to the Earth Sciences community that allows it to employ the unprecedented detail in satellite image and SAR data (WordView, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2) necessary to extract information on surface properties and processes that were previously indiscernible. In that the classification will automatically adapt to changing conditions in time and space, it will provide a consistent parameterization of spatial processes that can be used to drive numerical simulations of Earth system processes. Thus, a direct connection will be established between data analysis and modeling. In a pilot study, the data-modeling connection will be demonstrated through classification of crevasse patterns, which result from deformation, and optimization of the basal sliding parameter in a three-dimensional model of a glacier surge. Hence the pilot study will advance understanding of ice dynamics. A second application is a sea-ice classification system, aimed to aid in mapping and understanding the changing Arctic sea-ice cover. The planned automated connection between data-driven automated classification and optimization of model parameters is expected to lay the foundation for a transformation of the data-modeling world in Earth sciences, atmospheric and polar sciences. The project will also advance machine learning and spatial statistics through realization of a science-driven approach to computer science and cyberinfrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis award by the NSF Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC) is jointly supported by the Cross-Cutting Program within the NSF Directorate for Geosciences, The OAC Cyberinfrastructure for Emerging Science and Engineering Research (CESER) program and the EarthCube Program jointly sponsored by the NSF Directorate for Geosciences and the OAC.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Harnessing the data revolution in Earth observation from space. Observations of our rapidly changing Earth are largely carried out from space, and the collection of such Earth observation data from satellites has rapidly advanced with increasingly large and detailed data sets becoming available for scientific investigations.<br /><br />Challenge 2. Climate, Cryosphere (Snow and Ice) and Sea-Level Rise (SLR). It is well-known and much-discussed in the media that the climate is changing, however, rising temperatures are typically the focus of attention. In fact, there are also results of more complex physical processes, such as sudden accelerations of glaciers, which can lead to rapid SLR. In this work, we use the case of the current surge in a large Arctic Glacier System (Negribreen Glacier System (NGS), Svalbard). Negribreen accelerated to over 200 times of its normal flow speed (called a surge), which led to heavy crevassing and transfer of mass (ice) to the oceans, resulting in the equivalent of 1 percent of global annual SLR in a few months in 2017 (see, Figures1-3). A surge in the NGS last occurred over 85 years ago and the surge is still ongoing. This situation may explain why glacial acceleration has been identified as the largest source of uncertainty in SLR assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and why surges are the least understood form of glacial acceleration. A surge is a catastrophic event that has&nbsp; immediate disruptive impacts on the ecology of the region where the surge occurs.<br /><br />Challenge 3. Connecting observation and modeling with the help of&nbsp; modern Cyberinfrastructure. Assessment of SLR is commonly carried out using numerical models. The challenge that has not been solved lies in linking data and models. Information that can be derived from data is not used to inform modeling in a systematic and automated fashion. Parameters or variables used in models are not directly connected to information that can be derived from data. A bottleneck is created - and growing with the data revolution - as this new wealth of information revealed by the new satellites makes it hard to incorporate observations into&nbsp; models of physical processes such as glacier surges. A problem lies in the fact that the scale of data is much higher than the modeling scale. An example are crevasses that form during a surge.<br />&nbsp;<br />In this project, a cyberinfrastructure is created that integrates machine-learning methods (``Artificial Intellgence\", AI),&nbsp; spatial statistical analysis and knowledge of physical processes to automatically classify surface signatures as observed in high-resolution satellite imagery. Central to the approach is the fact that the mathematically and physically complex processes of a surge result in patterns of crevasses on the surface of the glacier (Figure~2) and that these are visible from space,&nbsp; for example in Maxar WorldView imagery. Those crevasse patterns are directly linked to the physical processes that happen during glacial acceleration, in this case, the surge of the NGS. To exploit this connection, we use knowledge of physical processes to design a Neural Network (NN). <br /><br />While ``Deep Learning\" (Convolutional Neural Networks, CNNs) has been gaining much visibility lately, CNNs require training data sets of many 100000 labeled images. Such training data sets did not exist for cryospheric applications. The actual method uses a connection of automated spatial statistical analysis and a retraining loop in a first stage NN and thereafter a CNN. At the basis is a relatively small data set created by an expert in structural glaciology. Results of the classification method are maps that show the advance of the surge through the NGS (Figure-4). The open-source classification system GEOCLASS-image, derived under this project, is&nbsp; available under https://github.com/Herzfeld-Lab/GEOCLASS-image/releases/tag/v1.0 (doi:0.5281/zenodo.10232912).<br /><br />The link between automated data analysis and modeling has been explored and demonstrated in a simple form, connecting the crevasse classes from the image classification with deformation that occurs during the surge in the NGS. The simple form already involves a fully three-dimensional numerical model whose description is beyond this outcomes summary report. <br /><br />In summary, the project has shown the following: (1) Of importance is the finding that the future of applications of ML to Earth sciences lies in the connection of physical knowledge and cyberinfrastructure/ computer science methods. (2) The GEOCLASS-system provides a cyberinfrastructure that allows to harness the data revolution, as demonstrated for automated classification of high-resolution satellite imagery of glacier surfaces. (3) The connection between physically driven neural networks and numerical modeling of ice-dynamics indicates a path for future data-modeling connections and applications. (4) Exemplary results from application to the current surge in the NGS surge have led to understanding surge processes in Arctic glacier systems in general and thus to reducing the knowledge gap of uncertainty in SLR assessment.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 04/23/2024<br>\nModified by: Ute&nbsp;C&nbsp;Herzfeld</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1835256/1835256_10580345_1713894650227_timeseries_figure--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1835256/1835256_10580345_1713894650227_timeseries_figure--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Surge progression from automated crevasse classification.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1835256/1835256_10580345_1713894650227_timeseries_figure--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Surge progression from automated crevasse classification.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Evolution of the surge in the Negribreen Glacier System,\nSvalbard, from automated classification of crevasses. \nResultant from ap- 1\nplication of GEOCLASS-image (Herzfeld et al. 2023) to Maxar WorldView data.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ute Herzfeld</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ute&nbsp;C&nbsp;Herzfeld\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Surge progression from automated crevasse classification.</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1835256/1835256_10580345_1713893970744_DSC_0230.sm1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1835256/1835256_10580345_1713893970744_DSC_0230.sm1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fresh surge crevasses in upper Negribreen, Svalbard.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1835256/1835256_10580345_1713893970744_DSC_0230.sm1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fresh surge crevasses in upper Negribreen, Svalbard.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Recently opened surge crevasses indicate the advance of the surge.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ute Herzfeld</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ute&nbsp;C&nbsp;Herzfeld\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fresh surge crevasses in upper Negribreen, Svalbard.</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1835256/1835256_10580345_1713894155021_DSC_0306.sm1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1835256/1835256_10580345_1713894155021_DSC_0306.sm1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Negirbreen during surge.
