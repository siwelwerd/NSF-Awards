 "awd_abstract_narration": "A significant percentage of the materials around us are made from plastics, also referred to as \"polymers\".  The vast majority of synthetic polymers exhibit a linear structure, resembling a string, on the molecular level.  Within the last few decades, a number of branched polymers, with a more tree-like molecular structure, have been designed and made commercially.  The difference in structure from linear to branched results in unique properties and applications.  Professor Grayson at Tulane University and Professor Nazarenko at the University of Southern Mississippi are using new synthetic methods to control the exact amount of branching in a family of polyesters.  They study the properties of the polyesters to better understand how controlling polymer structure on the molecular level can yield polyesters with improved behavior and performance.  This effort engages researchers from both the undergraduate and the graduate levels in a multi-disciplinary, collaborative approach.  This project also include outreach to local public high school chemistry classes to demonstrate the use of the scientific method to better understand fundamental concepts in chemistry. A new interdisciplinary archeological chemistry course is also under development. \r\n \r\nWith the support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program from the Division of Chemistry, new synthetic tools are being employed to prepare a library of linear, hyperbranched, dendritic and \"pseudodendritic\" polymers based on the bis(hydromethyl)propanoic acid monomer.  Both traditional (nuclear magnetic resonance) and more novel (mass spectrometry) characterization techniques are being utilized to elucidate the structure as well as the reactivity of each architectural class of these polymers.  X-ray studies are combined with computer modeling to confirm the nature of the intra-and inter-molecular hydrogen bonding that occurs in these polyesters.  Pressure-volume-temperature studies are carried out to understand the molecular packing in the melt and solid states.  Finally, the materials dielectric properties are being investigated and correlated with the type of branching, as these materials show promise for high dielectric constant materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award has completed three doctoral awards and started two awards that will eventually become Ph.Ds. Although in the 1990s Hult and coworkers had determined that bis-MPA (2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)propionic acid) can produce a dendrimer (exact branching patterns) and a hyperbranched polymer (imperfect branching patterns), no one has completely a linear polymer with this reagent.\n\nThe first Ph.D. graduate, Joe Giesen, recognized that he can get a precursor with one of the two hydroxy groups protected with a benzyl ether group, however he had problems trying to polymerize this. He published these reactions in Tetrahedron Letters (2020) and also included the step-growth oligomeric byproduct.\n\nThe next graduate student, Oluwapelumi Kareem, then described another reaction of the benzylidene protected bis-MPA, to get the ester (rather than the ether) to yield 3-(benzoyloxy)-2-(bromomethyl)-2-methylpropanoic acid.  This was a very efficient reaction that yield a greater than 80% product form the benzylidene reactant.  However, the polymerization of this compound with potassium carbonate will undergo a chain-growth polymerization, because of the four-membered cyclic precursor, that can yield 85% of the product with a very narrow dispersity (heterogeneity of sizes of the final polymer) in Macromolecules (2020).\n\nThe final Ph.D. is McKenna Redding, who graduated in December 2022.  In addition to getting the linear polymers from Oluwapelumi, she also studied the hyperbranched polymers and dendrimers that had the exact same benzoyl ester for the end groups of the periphery.  She not only had an nearly exact compound of the dendrimer, hyperbranched polymer, and linear polymer, but she also had these molecular weight of these within 10% (via mass spectrometry) of the first four generations of the dendrimer.  These were characterized with gel permeation chromatography, light scattering, viscometry, and thermal characterization to understand exactly how the branching controls these polymers.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/31/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Scott M Grayson"
