Iron deficiency in humans has been described by the World Health Organization as the most common nutritional deficiency affecting nearly 2.2 billion people (~30% of the world's population). Therefore, understanding how plants sense, take up and re-distribute iron in edible tissues is essential. Traditionally, iron sensing by plants was believed to occur exclusively by roots that are in close contact with iron sources in the soil, however, provocative preliminary data from our laboratories and others suggests that plants rapidly sense changes in iron concentrations in specialized cells located in leaves, termed companion cells. This project will focus on the early events of iron deficiency responses in plants and on the communication between leaves and roots to adapt when iron becomes scarce. In addition, this project will provide training to undergraduate and graduate students on cutting-edge molecular biology techniques, particularly techniques that address changes in specific tissues such as the veins of plants, which have been shown to play an important role in leaf-to-root communication. Moreover, this project will emphasize collaborative work between students from different disciplines including computer sciences, biochemistry and plant sciences. Learning how to communicate across disciplines is critical for developing novel techniques and instrumentation to study in detail how plants respond and adapt to changes in nutrient availability. In the long-term, students capable of understanding and bridging different disciplines will be well-equipped for the current competitive job market in academia and industry.\r\n\r\nThe long-term goal of this project is the identification of molecular mechanisms mediating iron (Fe) sensing and homeostasis in plants. Respiration and photosynthesis heavily depend on the redox properties of iron to generate and store energy; however, this reactivity makes iron extremely toxic at high concentrations. Therefore, plants need to sense the levels of Fe within tissues and regulate Fe uptake to prevent overload and cellular damage. Despite significant advances in identifying molecular components of the Fe deficiency response in plants, the sensing and precise location of Fe sensing in plants remains unknown. More recently, it has been found that specific cells within the leaf vasculature (companion cells) are capable of sensing changes in iron availability more rapidly than roots. This project will use a cross-disciplinary approach to address the long-standing question about the spatial (where) and temporal (when) responses to iron deficiency in plants by identifying and integrating transcriptional and protein networks at cell-specific resolution. Several techniques, such as proximity labeling, have been specifically adapted to plants to pursue proteomic studies in specific tissues. Cell-specific translatome analyses during early stages of iron deficiency will be used to define the primary (early) and secondary (responses) to iron limitation in the vasculature and will guide high-throughput protein-DNA binding experiments to identify the molecular mechanisms driving early responses to Fe deficiency in companion cells. Experimental approaches will be complemented with modeling and simulation to produce an integrated view of plant responses to changes in iron availability.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Biochemically speaking, this is a feat that only few organisms on Earth can achieve. In turn, humans and other organisms depend on plants as the main dietary source for calories and nutrients. Plants, however, must regulate the uptake of nutrients to prevent an unregulated uptake. This is particularly critical for reactive nutrients such as iron (Fe), which is essential for respiration and photosynthesis but in excess, promotes the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that may damage proteins, membranes, and DNA. Notably, and despite of decades of active research, the precise mechanism by which plants sense their internal levels of nutrients remains largely unknown. Therefore, as part of this project, we proposed a series of experiments to begin&nbsp;the identification of molecular mechanisms mediating iron sensing and homeostasis in higher plants using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In recent years, our lab at the University of Missouri, have discovered that&nbsp;specific cells within the leaf vasculature, or veins, called companion cells respond more rapidly to changes in Fe availability than roots.

Moreover, and as part of this project, several techniques were developed to identify key proteins required for proper Fe sensing. In brief, the success of this project can be summarized in 4 major outcomes. First, we demonstrated that that the primary site for Fe sensing are mature photosynthetic leaves rather than roots (Plant Cell Environ 2018 41:2263). Our model suggests that mature leaves sense the Fe status of the entire plant and communicates this information to roots via a yet unknown systemic signaling. Second, we discovered a protein localized in the chloroplast called AtNEET, which is critical for Fe sensing and plants carrying a non-functional version of AtNEET show impaired Fe deficiency responses (Plant J. 2020 101:1152). We are currently exploring further the role of AtNEET in Fe homeostasis in plants. Third, we also determined that the levels of Fe around the vasculature determines the magnitude of gene expression associated with Fe deficiency responses (Plant Cell Physiol. 2022 63:829) and that some Fe responsive networks are more sensitive than others to the presence of reactive oxygen species (J Exp Bot. 2022 73:324). This was very relevant finding as it explains a previously unresolved observation where under certain circumstances plants are unable to respond to Fe deficiency even if the availability of Fe in the growth media is low. Fourth, we advanced the field of plant phenotyping by developing devices, built by teams of undergraduate engineering and biology students, to track leaves and roots in an automated manner through time. These devices are important to advance the field of plant biology by assigning functions to genes that have not been previously characterized.</p>\n<p>In total, this project generated 11 peer-reviewed manuscripts and supported, fully or partially, the training of 3 post-doctoral researchers, 2 graduate students, and 15 undergraduate trainees.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/04/2023<br>\nModified by: David&nbsp;G&nbsp;Mendoza-Cozatl</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1818312/1818312_10556717_1699117628704_Leaf_phenotyper--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1818312/1818312_10556717_1699117628704_Leaf_phenotyper--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Leaf phenotyper\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1818312/1818312_10556717_1699117628704_Leaf_phenotyper--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Leaf phenotyper\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Our students designed and built a platform to track automatically leaf growth over long periods of time.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">David Mendoza</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;G&nbsp;Mendoza-Cozatl\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Leaf phenotyper</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1818312/1818312_10556717_1699117419096_Industry_tours--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1818312/1818312_10556717_1699117419096_Industry_tours--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Industry tours\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1818312/1818312_10556717_1699117419096_Industry_tours--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Industry tours\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Our trainees got opportunities to visit companies to explore how research is done in private enterprises.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">David Mendoza</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;G&nbsp;Mendoza-Cozatl\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Industry tours</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1818312/1818312_10556717_1699117269817_Student_presentation--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1818312/1818312_10556717_1699117269817_Student_presentation--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Student presentations\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1818312/1818312_10556717_1699117269817_Student_presentation--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Student presentations\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">As part of this project, trainees are encouraged to present their results at local and national meetings.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">David Mendoza</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;G&nbsp;Mendoza-Cozatl\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Student presentations</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1818312/1818312_10556717_1699117514412_Root_phenotyper--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1818312/1818312_10556717_1699117514412_Root_phenotyper--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Root phenotypes\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1818312/1818312_10556717_1699117514412_Root_phenotyper--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Root phenotypes\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students supported by this project developed devices to track roots in an automated manner.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">David Mendoza</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;G&nbsp;Mendoza-Cozatl\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Root phenotypes</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
