 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support experimental shock wave measurements of molten rocks and metals at the pressure-temperature conditions of the deep Earth. Shock wave experiments use controlled high-speed collisions to generate high pressure and temperature for a short time, allowing unique measurements of the response of Earth materials to damage, high-speed deformation, and conditions like those in the lower mantle and core of the Earth. These data are needed to support next-generation models of lower mantle structure, the deep carbon cycle, evolution of an early terrestrial magma ocean, and the composition of the Earth's core. Molten materials are central to the understanding of planetary evolution and structure, but our understanding of them lags our understanding of solids because liquids are more complex and more difficult to study. Data from these shock wave experiments is often the only experimental data available at extreme pressure for validation of atomistic models of liquid structure and dynamics. This work leverages collaboration with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to exploit the expertise in the Department of Energy's shock physics group for geophysical problems and, in turn, the measurements made and methods developed in this work will have wide impact not only in experimental geophysics but also in condensed matter physics and the broader shock compression community. The project includes training of young scientists and outreach through television specials.\r\n\r\nThe project incorporates technical advances that enable new experiments, more extreme conditions, higher precision results, and faster turn-around time. Advances in shock temperature measurement technique, reducing uncertainty from ~500 K to ~30 K, will be used to look at temperatures of shocked silicate liquids. The one experimental constraint on the heat capacity of a silicate liquid (pure SiO2) at high compression shows great complexity; measuring shock temperature in liquid defines this heat capacity and completes the description of the equation of state. Experiments that measure shock temperature can also be configured to measure the sound speed in the shocked liquid state, which defines high-order constraints on the equation of state and allows a key test of the Mie-Gruneisen formulation for silicate liquids. Measurement of sound speeds and densities of liquid Fe alloys along actual outer core adiabats will use a combination of shock-and-release and shock-and-ramp loading paths to bring molten Fe and Fe-alloy samples to the outer core isentrope without the need for pre-heating or extrapolation. Isentropic experiments will make the well-defined observed gradient in sound speed with depth in the outer core a new constraint on its composition.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

NSF has provided long-term support to this unique lab to carry out this research, and this award covers five years of such work.</p>\n<p>The main area of focus is the properties of magma at high pressure.&nbsp;Molten rock, or magma, forms in terrestrial planets (like Earth) under specific circumstances ... leading to volcanic eruptions, formation of crust, and segregation of chemically distinct layers deep within the Earth. A scientific understanding of the role of magma in planetary evolution requires detailed knowledge of the physical properties of magma, often at extreme conditions that are challenging to achieve experimentally. We developed an experimental method that uses a high-speed impact into pre-heated glass to form a magma and then determines the speed of the shock wave, the temperature of the shocked liquid, and the sound speed in the shocked liquid. From these measurements, we can determined the density, pressure, internal energy, temperature, and compressibility of molten rock at any pressure needed for understanding the rocky layers of the Earth or the metallic liquids that form the Earth's core. During the current award, we achieved three matching pairs of density and sound speed constraints, each accompanied by two measurements of the temperature. We also use molecular simulations, which can rapidly examine a much broader range of simulated conditions than experiments can achieve, to develop intuition about how to fit our experimental data to flexible equations and then, in turn, predict liquid properties at any condition (whether it be one of the particular conditions achieved in our experiments or not). Our simulations identified an inaccurate assumption in previous treatments of this problem and also guided us to a simple form that goes a step beyond the previous assumption and achieves much greater accuracy. Applying this model to our accumulated shock data shows very good results and lends confidence to this new method of extrapolation to deep Earth conditions.</p>\n<p>A second area of focus is shock metamorphism, i.e. the record of impact and other high-energy transient events preserved, for example, in meteorites. For this work, we drive shock waves through materials contained in a capsule so that we can recover the samples and study them in detail with electron microscopes and other tools. Using this approach, we looked at a class of meteorites known to have been ejected from Mars and then delivered to Earth. We found that&nbsp;the shock conditions inferred for the ejection of these meteorites from previous work were too high; with our revised pressure scale it is easier to understand how these meteorites preserve an interesting record of Mars' history. We also identified a shock-driven mechanism for the transformation of sulfur from the form found at the surface of Mars by NASA's rover missions into the form found in the martian meteorites. Finally, we studied the unexpected formation of an unusual class of solid materials called quasicrystals by high-energy transient events including impacts (in meteorites and in our lab), nuclear explosions, and electrical discharges.</p>\n<p>This research formed an essential part of the training of two graduate students, two postdoctoral researchers, and one undergraduate researcher.
