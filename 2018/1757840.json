 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the University of Delaware's College of Earth, Ocean and Environment in Lewes, DE will be renewed for three years. The program will bring ten undergraduates to the Lewes campus each summer, and interns will conduct semi-independent research projects during the 10-week program. At the end of the summer, interns present their results during a mini-symposium and write up their work as a scientific paper. Weekly seminars by University of Delaware faculty will provide interns with a broad overview of marine sciences. Professional development workshops include career paths in the sciences, science communication, and graduate school funding. Interns will participate in several field trips including a day trip aboard the R/V Joanne Daiber, which introduces them to a variety of research and oceanographic techniques, a field trip to Cape Henlopen State Park, for hands-on introduction to coastal geology, and a marsh walk, which introduces them to the inhabitants and the ecological role of these systems. Students will be encourage to continue their research after the program, either by being a co-author on a scientific publication, pursuing a senior thesis or attending a scientific conference. The program also includes a partnership with the Delaware Technical Community College. Most of the funding provided supports participant costs for thirty undergraduates, including student stipends, housing and transportation to and from their home to participate in the program. This REU program contributes to the national goals of training the next generation of scientists and developing the nation's scientifically-trained workforce. \r\n\r\nThe University of Delaware will continue to manage the REU program located on their Lewes, DE campus, which will provide students with direct access to faculty research mentors, the extensive research facilities on campus and the coastal environment. The College of Earth, Ocean and Environmental Sciences includes the Departments of Geological Sciences and Geography and the School of Marine Science and Policy, offering students the opportunity for interdisciplinary research topics. Faculty mentors' expertise spans the range of marine science and professional development activities will introduce students to skills required for successful careers. The program will support the extensive technical training for thirty undergraduates, preparing these students to enter the workforce or to pursue additional graduate training.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We received 1295 applications from across the U.S. for these 41 positions. Half of our REU interns were from non-PhD granting institutions, providing them access to the cutting-edge marine science research at our Lewes, DE campus. In addition, half of our interns identified as underrepresented minorities, one quarter were first-generation college students, and two were veterans. In addition to 41 NSF-funded interns, an additional 33 students funded through other sources joined our internship programming.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the major goals of our REU Site program is to provide a research experience for all participants. Accordingly, all interns completed independent research projects under the guidance of University of Delaware faculty mentors. Research topics ranged from understanding the distribution of microplastics in Delaware Bay to the controls on toxin production in harmful algae to using foraminifera coiling ratios to reconstruct paleo-ocean hydrography. In addition to their research, interns participated in several field experiences to explore the diversity of coastal environments around Lewes, Delaware. A day trip aboard the RV/Joanne Daiber introduced them to various sampling techniques including trawling, plankton sampling and identification of organisms. Interns also participated in a marsh walk, during which they learned about adaptations of saltmarsh grasses and the animals that make their home there as well as the critical importance of these coastal systems in terms of carbon sequestration and coastal resilience. We also established an annual trip to join with Rutgers University's RIOS REU program in Cape May, NJ. Interns from both programs spent the day together visiting Rutgers' Haskin Shellfish Research Laboratory and presenting their research to each other. In addition to field experiences, weekly seminars and workshops included career planning, writing and communication in the sciences, funding for grad school and a Boating and Seamanship course offered through the US Coast Guard Auxiliary. Our interns also gained exposure to the array of disciplines in ocean science through a series of seminars by faculty and graduate students from the School of Marine Science and Policy at UD.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During summer 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic precluded us from hosting an in-person program, we pivoted and instead hosted a fully-remote 3-week REU program for 10 students. This program focused on professional development and skill building and included daily sessions on getting into grad school, GRE exams, finding jobs in the geosciences, communication, developing writing skills, and coding in R. We held several panel discussions including a Career Panel with participants from Delaware Sea Grant, a Getting into Grad School panel with current graduate students, and a panel with former REU participants. Students also gained a broad introduction to research in Marine Science through daily faculty research seminars.</p>\n<p>The overarching objective of our REU program is to increase retention of students in STEM, particularly for students from underrepresented groups. During this funding cycle, we have continued to directly recruit our REU interns into grad school by offering them contingent admission to our graduate program. This allows us to recruit graduate students from a highly competitive pool and one that that is also diverse; 50% of our participants over the duration of this award identify as underrepresented minorities in ocean science. In addition to attending graduate school at UD, our former interns have gone to graduate school at other institutions and have found employment in STEM and in Ocean Science related fields.&nbsp; Our program has continued to contribute to workforce development for STEM fields in the United States.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/02/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Joanna&nbsp;York</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757840/1757840_10530636_1685729427478_UDREU2021MarshWalk--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757840/1757840_10530636_1685729427478_UDREU2021MarshWalk--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"UD REU Marsh Walk 2021\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757840/1757840_10530636_1685729427478_UDREU2021MarshWalk--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"UD REU Marsh Walk 2021\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">University of Delaware Marine Sciences REU program Marsh Walk; Summer 2021; Great Marsh, Lewes, Delaware</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Joanna York</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Joanna&nbsp;York</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">UD REU Marsh Walk 2021</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757840/1757840_10530636_1685729645170_UDREU2022RVDaiberTrawlNet--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757840/1757840_10530636_1685729645170_UDREU2022RVDaiberTrawlNet--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"UD REU R/V Daiber trawl net 2022\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757840/1757840_10530636_1685729645170_UDREU2022RVDaiberTrawlNet--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"UD REU R/V Daiber trawl net 2022\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">University of Delaware Marine Science REU 2022.
