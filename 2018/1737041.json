 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the international GEOTRACES program is to understand the distributions of trace chemical elements and their isotopes in the oceans. The National Science Foundation is supporting a U.S. GEOTRACES sampling expedition in the Pacific Ocean in 2018, that will conduct full ocean depth at sites extending south from Alaska to Tahiti. The purpose of this project is to measure the concentrations of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) compounds and of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) along this transect of stations. These gas measurements can be used to determine the \"ages\" of water parcels and the rates of important oceanographic and biogeochemical processes. Such information is essential to the interpretation of the trace element and isotope data that will be gathered as part of GEOTRACES. The trace gas concentrations, ventilation ages, and rate data will all be made available to other investigators within six months of collection, forming an important foundation for the GEOTRACES Pacific program.\r\n\r\nThe project team will measure CFC-11, CFC-12, and SF6 concentrations aboard the 2018 Pacific Meridional Transect. Beyond the concentration measurements, the project has the following specific objectives: 1) Calculate tracer ages and identify the relative extent of ventilation and dilution of thermocline and intermediate water masses within which Trace Elements and their Isotopes (TEIs) reside across different circulation regimes, 2) Calculate rates of biochemically important processes (including apparent oxygen utilization and denitrification rates) and distinguish between the contributions from physical and biogeochemical processes across the different circulation regimes, 3) Put tracer and hydrographic GEOTRACES data into context of larger space and time scales using historical tracer, hydrographic, ARGO CTD and oxygen data. The CFC and SF6 tracer data will contribute to interpretation of the key GEOTRACES trace elements and isotopes by characterizing physical processes, which can affect trace element speciation and internal cycling. Calculated tracer ages are the backbone of this project and are the primary service for other GEOTRACES PIs. Tracer ages will be used to address each of the objectives. As tracer ages are an important part of the contribution to the GEOTRACES program, uncertainties will be estimated for the ages related to internal ocean variability and effects of mixing due to non-stationarity of the atmospheric transients.",
