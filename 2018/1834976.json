 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to support and enable students to attend the International Sedimentological Congress (ISC), a global meeting devoted to sedimentary geology. The meeting convenes every four years and will be held this year in Quebec City, Canada. This is first time since 1982 that this international meeting is being held in North America. It is expected that more than 2000 professional sedimentary geologists from throughout the world will be in attendance. During the five-day meeting, participants will have the opportunity to interact with one another through both formal and informal oral and poster presentations. The program also features a series of workshops that include presentations and opportunities for dialog that will allow for synthesis and collaboration between researchers across disciplines and across broad geographic regions. There are a series of midweek, pre-meeting, and post-meeting field trips and short courses offered that are designed to provide training in cutting-edge approaches to data analyses and to foster communication. Students funded will include both undergraduate and graduate students from across the various sedimentary geology disciplines. Underrepresented minorities, women and persons with disabilities will be especially encouraged to submit applications to receive this travel support.\r\n\r\nStudying aspects of the sedimentary crust of the earth is a vibrant discipline that includes such currently relevant topics as the tempo and mode of life on earth, the physical processes that control erosion and deposition of sediments; the stratigraphic record of environmental perturbations, and the preservation of the stratigraphic record. It is a completely interdisciplinary field of study that includes researchers from biology, physics, stratigraphy, geochronology, geochemistry, and modeling. The 20th ISC meeting will uniquely contribute to the geological sciences because it will bring together the global community of sedimentary geologists, of all career stages, to share their research methods, findings and experiences in the field. Unlike other meetings attended by sedimentary geologists (e.g. Geological Society of America, International Association of Sedimentologists, SEPM Society for Sedimentary Geology), ISC attracts a large, diverse, global cross section of sedimentary geologists (e.g. European, North American, Asia- Pacific, Eastern Europe, African, etc.), but is still a small enough venue for critical networking to occur across subfields. This will lead to new opportunities for collaboration and the creation of novel approaches to studying our world.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
