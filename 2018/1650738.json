 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work will study how certain energetic particles in the magnetosphere affect and change of the composition of the region of the atmosphere closer to the surface of Earth. Improved understanding of how different regions of Earth's atmosphere are linked will enhance our predictive capabilities to protect satellites and other technological assets from the effects of solar and magnetospheric storms. This grant will also develop interdisciplinary collaborations across geoscience (magnetosphere, ionosphere, energetic particles, upper and middle atmosphere).\r\n\r\nThe research will quantify the contribution of energetic electron precipitation from the Van Allen radiation belts to the production of reactive nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the mesosphere and stratosphere and its resultant impact on ozone (O3). Observations from the FIREBIRD (Focused Investigations of Relativistic Electron Burst Intensity, Range, and Dynamics) satellites and Van Allen Probes will be used to produce the particle spectra and the global maps of electron flux that will be used to drive the WACCM-DART model which implements a new D-region chemical scheme to calculate NOx. By adding this new source, i.e., electron flux from the radiation belts, to the WACCM-DART, the deficits of the NOx in the model simulation are expected to be tackled. Once the model can be validated and favorably compare with observations, the impacts of the radiation belt REP on the NOx in the mesosphere and stratosphere, and the O3 in the stratosphere will be quantified.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
