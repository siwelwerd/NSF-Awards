 "awd_abstract_narration": "Finding accurate solutions for complex optimization problems and other related challenging mathematical problems is very important in many engineering applications. Some example applications include: target tracking and surveillance where multiple sensor measurements are used to track targets, air traffic management to track airplanes, weather surveillance to track hurricanes, ground mapping, geophysical surveys, remote sensing, autonomous navigation, and robotics. State-of-the-art solution approaches to these problems include the Kalman filter algorithm and its many extensions.  However, in practice, such approaches can yield inaccurate and erroneous solutions because of technical issues related to complexity in dynamics and uncertainty.  In the past decade, a new class of algorithmic solution approaches to these problems has emerged referred to as the \"Feedback Particle Filter\".  The Feedback Particle Filter can better handle the technical issues related to such complex dynamics and uncertainty.  This research will advance the theoretical development and verification of the Feedback Particle Filter algorithm, and lay the groundwork for software tools that will be useful in tracking applications noted above. The project also includes several educational initiatives that seek to engage undergraduate students in entrepreneurship.   \r\n   \r\nA major objective of the research concerns the development of optimal control formulations of the feedback particle filter based on optimal transportation theory and mean-field games formalisms.  The theoretical research is closely integrated with the work on computational algorithms.  The algorithmic objectives pertain to numerical solution of the Poisson equation, convergence analysis of the particle system with finitely many particles, and comparisons with importance sampling-based algorithms.  The deliverables include efficient numerical schemes which will be implemented and demonstrated in software.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project was a massive success. The project supported PhD thesis work of two students, Amirhossein Taghvaei and Jin-Won Kim. In his PhD thesis, Jin-Won Kim solved a fundamental problem whose solution was widely believed to not be possible. For his PhD thesis, Jin-Won Kim won the Best CSL Thesis Award at the Coordinated Science Laboratory in UIUC. Jin-Won Kim also won the Best Student Paper Award at the IEEE Conference on Decision and Control in 2019.\n\n\nIntellectual Merit. Our project was on the problem of nonlinear filtering. This is an area of mathematics concerned with estimating hidden quantities from noisy measurements. Applications are found in all areas of engineering, signal processing, weather forecasting, and finance.\n\n\nIn this NSF project, we made important breakthroughs on fundamental understanding of this classical area. Specifically, in his PhD thesis, Jin-Won Kim contributed to the duality theory for the nonlinear filtering problem. This means formulating the nonlinear filtering problem as an optimal control problem. Such dual formulations have tremendous uses for both analysis of the algorithms as well as in constructions of the numerical approaches. The same is the subject of ongoing research.\n\n\nBroad Impact.A practical impact of our work has been in the development of motion-sensing technology using body-worn sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes). The technology was commercialized through a student-led startup led by Adam Tilton and Shane Ghiotto.\n\n\nResearch was publicized through several publications. Notably, we were invited to write an article for the Annual Review of Control on the subject of the proposed grant. The article appeared in the 2023 issue of the journal. A public facing article on our work appeared in August 2021 issue of the IEEE Control Systems Magazine.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/05/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: PrashantGMehta\n"
