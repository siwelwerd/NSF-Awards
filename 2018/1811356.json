 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program funds innovative research, approaches and resources for use in a variety of settings. This project examines the conditions in which families and young learners most benefit from \"doing science and math\" together among a population that is typically underserved with respect to STEM experiences--families experiencing poverty. This project builds on an existing program called Teaching Together that uses interactive parent-child workshops led by a museum educator and focused on supporting STEM learning at home. The goal of these workshops is to increase parents'/caregivers' self-perception and ability to serve as their child's first teacher by supporting learning and inquiry conversations during daily routines and informal STEM activities. Families attend a series of afternoon and evening workshops at their child's preschool center and at a local children's museum. Parents/Caregivers may participate in online home learning activities and museum experiences. The project uses an experimental design to test the added value of providing incremental supports for informal STEM learning. The study uses an experimental design to address potential barriers parents/caregivers may perceive to doing informal STEM activities with their child. The project also explores how the quantity and quality parent-child informal learning interactions may relate to changes in children's science and mathematics knowledge during the pre-kindergarten year. The project partners include the Children's Learning Institute at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and the Children's Museum of Houston. \r\n\r\nThe project is designed to increase understanding of how parents/caregivers can be encouraged to support informal STEM learning by experimentally manipulating key aspects of the broader expectancy-value-cost motivation theory, which is well established in psychology and education literatures but has not been applied to preschool parent-child informal STEM learning. More specifically, the intervention conditions are designed to identify how specific parent supports can mitigate potential barriers that families experiencing poverty face. These intervention conditions include: modeling of informal STEM learning during workshops to address skills and knowledge barriers; materials to address difficulties accessing science and math resources; and incentives as a way to address parental time pressures and/or costs and thereby improve involvement in informal learning activities. Intervention effects will be calculated in terms of effect sizes and potential mediators of change will be explored with structural equation modeling. The first phase of the project uses an iterative process to refine the curriculum and expand the collection of resources designed for families of 3- to 5-year-olds. The second phase uses an experimental study of the STEM program to examine conditions that maximize participation and effectiveness of family learning programs. In all, 360 families will be randomly assigned to four conditions: 1) business-as-usual control; 2) the Teaching Together core workshop-based program; 3) Teaching Together workshops + provision of inquiry-based STEM activity kits for the home; and 4) Teaching Together workshop + activity kits + provision of monetary incentives for parents/caregivers when they document informal STEM learning experiences with their child. The interventions will occur in English and Spanish. A cost analysis across the interventions will also be conducted. This study uses quantitative and qualitative approaches. Data sources include parent surveys and interviews, conversation analysis of home learning activities, parent photo documentation of informal learning activities, and standardized assessments of children's growth in mathematics, science, and vocabulary knowledge.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Research activities supported 71 educators to provide STEM family engagement experiences. This project&rsquo;s central activity was offering museum outreach events called <em>Teaching Together STEM &lsquo;Funshops&rsquo;</em> at schools where most students were economically disadvantaged. The events were designed for preschool families who speak English or Spanish, as these groups often have limited access to early STEM programs. In addition to STEM events, we provided family museum passes, museum field trips, text messages with STEM activity tips, and take-home STEM activity kits. Overarching findings from this research are that families value access to bilingual STEM programs and benefit when they are supported with bilingual informal STEM experts providing guidance during community events as well as bilingual, step-by-step activities they can use to extend learning at home. Bilingual family engagement resources from this project are available at no cost</span><a href=\"https://public.cliengage.org/tools/quality/family-engagement-resources/hosting-family-events-to-support-childrens-development/\"><span> </span><span>here</span></a><span> with suggestions to use relevant components.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>The project first generated insights into how parental attitudes towards STEM relate to young children&rsquo;s involvement in STEM. In a study published in <em>Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology </em>entitled &ldquo;Parental Attitudes Toward Early Childhood STEM Education: The Importance of Value and Expectancies,&rdquo; key findings revealed that while 56% of parents reported reading with their child every day, only 35% engaged in daily STEM activities. Additionally, parents' perceptions of the value of STEM&mdash;such as its utility and enjoyment&mdash;strongly predicted their involvement in STEM-related activities with their child. Interestingly, mothers with STEM careers reported higher self-efficacy in supporting their children&rsquo;s STEM learning. These initial findings guided the approaches we tested in a series of randomized controlled trials (RCT).&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>The first RCT, \"Informal STEM Learning Conditions to Increase Parent Involvement with Young Children Experiencing Poverty,\" was published in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em> and explored which informal STEM learning conditions increase parental engagement in STEM. The study revealed that parents who participated in museum-led, informal STEM learning sessions with their children <em>and</em> received take-home STEM activity kits were more likely to support STEM at home. In other words, taking home STEM resources was more beneficial than attending the Teaching Together STEM events alone. A key contribution of this research was&nbsp; understanding how informal learning environments can effectively support STEM education for marginalized populations. By equipping parents with the tools and confidence needed to support their children's learning, the research highlights the potential of early, informal learning experiences to promote STEM engagement across socio-economic boundaries.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>In a second RCT published in <em>Frontiers in Psychology </em>and titled \"Virtual Teaching Together: Engaging Parents and Young Children in STEM Activities\" researchers examined the effectiveness of museum-led, virtual learning experiences designed to enhance parent-child engagement in STEM activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Key findings indicated that these virtual sessions fostered meaningful STEM interactions between parents and children. The combination of mailing bilingual, step-by-step activity kits along with the engaging structure of museum educators' virtual learning sessions facilitated parents' confidence in supporting their children's STEM learning. However, the virtual space resulted in smaller effects on parents&rsquo; STEM involvement than our past in-person study. This was likely due to reduced opportunities for social support from the museum educators or other families in their school community due to the virtual constraints. Overall, the findings suggest that while parents find virtual engagement strategies to be convenient and useful during pandemic disruptions, they are not as robust as the traditional in-person learning.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>The third RCT published in <em>Frontiers in Education</em> and titled \"Evaluation of a Community-Based, Hybrid STEM Family Engagement Program at Pre-Kindergarten Entry\" assessed the effectiveness of a hybrid program &ndash; combining the benefits of in-person settings with the convenience of virtual offerings. This hybrid approach started with virtual Teaching Together events and then shifted to in-person events. This resulted in parents&rsquo; reporting more positive attitudes about their child&rsquo;s STEM learning. However, there were no significant impacts on children&rsquo;s STEM learning or parents&rsquo; involvement in STEM learning with their child. Our RPP concluded that future hybrid models could better facilitate meaningful interactions between parents and educators by focusing on in-person sessions first and offering virtual sessions as an alternative to broaden equitable access.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Collectively, these four studies and other reports from this project underscore the critical role parents play in shaping their children's STEM experiences. This project&rsquo;s development of resources to support bilingual family engagement events promises to create lasting impacts in the educational field, equipping both parents and children with the resources and confidence to succeed in STEM.</span></p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/25/2024<br>\nModified by: Tricia&nbsp;A&nbsp;Zucker</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div
