 "awd_abstract_narration": "Global environmental change has transformed our world. In the Eastern United States, increasing temperatures, for example, have had a significant impact on the timing of life events of plants and animals. For example, among the plants of this region, the flush of new leaves and spring flowering times occur more than two weeks earlier than decades prior. This project uses thousands of botanical specimens in museums across 16 states to understand the reasons why certain plants advance the timing of their life events more than others and to predict how plants will respond in the future. This work is broadly applicable to agricultural systems and the management of natural areas. As part of this effort, thousands of citizen-scientists will be engaged in the science of environmental change. In addition, educational and informative podcasts and teacher training programs will be developed. Finally, the project will also train undergraduate and graduate students and will enhance scientific infrastructure by making collections and their associated data more widely available.\r\n\r\nA vital resource in the study of phenological responses to climate change is historical records, especially those residing in natural history museums. Pressed and dried herbarium specimens, for example, represent snapshots of plant phenological events (e.g., flowering, fruiting) at specific places, times, and in association with specific climates. These specimens can facilitate the assessment of phenological variation across species ranges, and help elucidate plausible mechanistic causes, as well as highlight future expected responses. This project will use digitized herbaria to investigate plant phenology across the eastern U.S. and will address three specific aims. First, it will crowd-source phenological data from ca. 200,000 digitized herbarium specimens representing 1000 species from the eastern U.S. to estimate phenological change. Second, it will place phenological responses of these species in an evolutionary context by using large-scale genomic approaches to assess whether phenological traits can be predicted from evolutionary relationships. Third, it will develop models that identify climatic drivers of phenological responses and integrate these data to forecast spatial, temporal, and phylogenetic compositions of future plant assemblages.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

More than 100,000 specimens from over 300 species that have been collected by botanists from the eastern United States since 1850 and stored in herbaria were digitally scanned and posted in open and freely accessible image archives served by the Consortium for Northeastern Herbaria (https://www.neherbaria.org/portal/).&nbsp; The buds, flower, and fruits visible on these images, over one million records in total, were then scored by citizen-scientists using <em>CrowdCurio</em>, an online crowdsourcing platform accessed through Amazon Mechanical Turk.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Five key results emerged from the analysis of these crowdsourced data (now open access and publicly available through the Environmental Data Initiative [https://edirepository.org/]). First, we have demonstrated that botanical experts and citizen scientists quantify phenological data from digitized herbarium sheets with comparable accuracy, and these results can be used to train machine-learning models (convolutional neural networks) that yield data of comparable quality. Second, phenological data collected from herbarium sheets provides similar estimates of when plants are likely to be in peak flowering condition as do direct field observations. These results apply not only to the eastern United States, but also to other regions of North America as well as to tropical environments in Brazil. Third, predicted differences in flowering phenology among related plants growing close to one another (?phenological displacement?) compared with the same species of plants growing in different areas was more variable in the past than expected, but as climate changes, phenological displacement in the future is forecast to increase as the climate continues to change. Fourth, phenological changes in cities and other urbanized areas are different from those in rural areas. Specifically, increased urbanization is associated with earlier flowering in colder and wetter regions and delayed fruiting in regions with wetter spring conditions. Frost risk to plants was also higher in urbanized regions with colder and wetter spring conditions. Fifth, the inclusion of phenological data into models that predict the future distribution and abundance of plants as a function of climate change provide more optimistic projections than do models without phenological data. Specifically, the models that include phenology forecast significantly lower loss of habitat and less species turnover (gains minus losses of species) in those habitats than do models that do not include phenology. Taken together, these five key findings suggest that a combination of immediate acclimation of phenology to climate change (?phenotypic plasticity?) and longer-term evolutionary adaptations by plants in response to climate change (?local adaptation?) may help many species adjust their ecological niches and persist in their habitats during periods of rapid environmental change.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The overall results of this project have been published in more than 20 scientific papers, and were presented in a large public exhibition (on view June 2022 ? November 2023) at the Harvard Museum of Natural History, ?In Search of Thoreau?s Flowers: An Exploration of Change and Loss.? This exhibition was a collaborative effort between the project leader, Charles Davis, evolutionary ecologists Emily Meineke, and visual artists Marsha Gordon, Leah Sobsey, and Robin Vuchnich.
