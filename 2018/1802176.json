 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flowering time is an important biological phenomenon, affecting human societies through its effects on agricultural crops, pollinators, pests, and biodiversity.  Given the sensitivity of flowering times to climatic conditions, a thorough understanding of how plants respond to changing environments is necessary for predicting the consequences for pollinators, herbivores, parasites, and plant populations.  A record of historical flowering times is found within the nation's herbaria.  This award establishes a thematic collection network (TCN) dedicated to understanding flowering time shifts in the California flora.  California has the most diverse native flora of any state in the U.S., containing more than one-third of all U.S. plant species.  The state is a biodiversity hotspot due to the high number of endemic species that are also threatened.  The Capturing California's Flowers (CCF) TCN will record flowering times from and create images of over 900,000 herbarium specimens from the oldest records, the most diverse families, and most threatened families in California.  Twenty-two institutions spanning the state, including public universities, state agencies, museums, and botanic gardens, will participate in these efforts.  This project will generate data that will increase our understanding of flowering time shifts - a critical need for agriculturalists, conservation biologists, plant taxonomists, land managers, and wildlife biologists.\r\n\r\nDigitization of each specimen in the CCF TCN will result in a high-resolution image, a databased record of collection metadata, a georeferenced point, and the reproductive status of the specimen.  New tools will be developed for the public to search and display phenological data through a Symbiota portal interface.  The CCF TCN will develop novel data standards for capturing and sharing trait data from specimens.  Building on already successful national and regional programs, the CCF TCN will partner with schools, universities, botanical clubs, and the general public to crowd source phenological measurements through online expeditions, workshops, new college courses, and K-12 educational programs.  The CCF TCN will provide a historical record of plants currently being monitored through the National Phenology Network and other regional programs.  Finally, this award will expand efforts to train the \"next generation\" of museum curators, collectors, and researchers.  This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program, and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The objectives of the project were to image, database, georeference (as needed), and score timing-related features (e.g., flower and fruit production) on 904,200 Californian herbarium specimens housed at the 22 participating institutions. In so doing, the project partners were to generate a massive dataset capable of addressing critical questions about the flora of California, a biodiversity hotspot that is experiencing rapid climate shifts. The scoring of phenological (timing-related) features was to be done under a novel data-standard that will be developed for this project, but deployable to similar efforts world-wide. All specimen data and images were to be housed on a new, publicly-accessible data portal (<a href=\"file:///C:/Users/mguilliams/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Word/cch2.org\">cch2.org</a>) to facilitate their use by biodiversity and conservation scientists around the globe.</p>\n<p>The Garden, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, has the mission to conserve native plants &amp; habitats for the health &amp; well-being of people &amp; our planet (<a href=\"file:///C:/Users/mguilliams/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Word/sbbotanicgarden.org\">sbbotanicgarden.org</a>). In alignment with this mission, the Garden houses the Clifton Smith Herbarium (Index Herbariorum acronym: SBBG), the California Central Coast&rsquo;s largest collection of preserved plant specimens. When combined with the co-housed Garden Lichenarium, our natural history collections contain a unique gathering of approximately 210,000 specimens, an irreplaceable trove drawn primarily from California&rsquo;s hyper-diverse Central Coast and Channel Islands. For the Garden&rsquo;s part of this Digitization TCN grant, we set out to obtain high-resolution digital images of 80,000 of our approximately 155,000 plant specimens. This is more than half of the Garden&rsquo;s plant specimen holdings, and about 9% of the overall project goal.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the first four years of the grant, the 22 participating institutions imaged over 943,000 specimens, which exceeds the overall grant target by 4%. Our new public data portal, the CCH2, is online and now serves 4.5 million specimen records across all major California herbaria, of which 1.75 million have been imaged. Data standards for scoring phenological traits have been developed and applied to over 1.6 million specimens. The Garden has imaged 81,497 specimens, exceeding our goal by about 2%. Label data for approximately 95% of our total holdings are served at <a href=\"http://cch2.org/\">cch2.org</a>, along with available specimen images. These data and images are critical resources for biodiversity scientists in their study of the world we live in, and are increasingly being mobilized to address the most important challenges of our day (e.g., global climate change).</p>\n<p>This project has had broader impacts as well. Over the last four years, 100s of student participants and other volunteers have received training and developed new expertise in natural history collections &ndash; some have turned this experience into employment in the field (including at the Garden!). These opportunities have been well distributed in society: 58% of CAP participants were women and upwards of 16% are from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in STEM. At the Garden, over 70% of the paid staff who worked on the project were from underrepresented groups. Project partners have developed online and in-person courses, hosted educational workshops for the general public (e.g., WeDigBio), and developed workshop material that have served as critical resources for educators in California.
