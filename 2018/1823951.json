 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large networks of electromechanical agents, including complex robotic manipulators and self-driving cars, will soon become ubiquitous. Advanced control of such systems will increasingly benefit from inexpensive solid-state cameras but the resulting vision-based systems will be computation-intensive and introduce significant delays. Delays are known to cause instability in control systems, leading potentially to catastrophic failures in critical infrastructure. This project will develop methods to compensate and overcome such delays in networked control systems. The project will also contribute to the development of human resources in science and technology, continuing the efforts of the investigators who have supervised two dozen students from underrepresented groups on past projects, including women, Hispanics, and African-Americans. \r\n\r\nThe methods developed in the project are tailored to the efficient use of image data to facilitate real-time multi-agent path planning and collision avoidance. This will be accomplished using a combination of geometric representations and feature-based learning. Orientations and 3-D positions will be characterized for HSV color-classified objects to be grasped, for obstacles, and for destinations where the objects are to be placed. These orientations and 3-D positions will be employed for real-time generation of collision-free paths to be used as desirable trajectories. Computationally efficient fully decentralized and energy-efficient extremum seeking control schemes will be formulated, leveraging inherently parallel and highly redundant processing architecture and operating in the presence of interconnected nonlinearities, saturations, and uncertainties. Experimental validation of the results, using a 28th-order Baxter robot, will be carried out to examine the robustness and to validate the computational-energy efficiency of the algorithms.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We, for the first time, designed a time-delay adaptive compensator to estimate an unknown actuation delay to stabilize the operation of a 7-DOF robot at Dynamic Systems and Control Lab (DSCL). Also we designed an adaptive controller using Batch Least Square Identifier (BaLSI) to control a robotic system yielding finite-time convergence of unknown parameters. Along with this effort, we designed and experimented both prescribed finite-time&nbsp;tracking&nbsp;(PT) controller and prescribed-time safety filter (PTSf) for the 7-DOF robot, to not only carry out the task assigned in finite time but also to override an obstacle using control barrier function-quadratic programming. We formulated the PTSf for the case of a redundant manipulator performing a fixed-duration task. This formulation, which is based on a quadratic programming approach, yields a filter that is capable of avoiding multiple obstacles in a minimally invasive manner with bounded joint torques, while simultaneously allowing the nominal controller to converge to positions located on the boundary of the safe set by the end of the fixed-duration task. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, we performed a series of simulations and experiments on Baxter, a seven-DOF collaborative robot manipulator. In these simulations and experiments, Baxter must follow a 6-s parabolic trajectory as closely as possible while navigating around a large spherical obstacle blocking its path and place an object precisely on the surface of a table without overshoot by the end of the 6s. The results of our simulations and experiments demonstrated the ability of the PTSf to enforce safety throughout the 6s task, while allowing the robot manipulator to make contact with the table and thus achieve the desired goal position by the end of the task. Furthermore, when compared with the exponential safety filter (ESf), which is the state-of-the-art in current literature, our proposed method yielded consistently lower joint jerks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/26/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Peiman&nbsp;Naseradinmousavi</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1823951/1823951_10579359_1677446871485_prescribed--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1823951/1823951_10579359_1677446871485_prescribed--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Prescribed Time Controller\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1823951/1823951_10579359_1677446871485_prescribed--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Prescribed Time Controller\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Prescribed Time Controller to carry an object within prescribe 6s with large initial position errors.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Peiman Naseradinmousavi</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Peiman&nbsp;Naseradinmousavi</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Prescribed Time Controller</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1823951/1823951_10579359_1677447050467_filter_cbf--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1823951/1823951_10579359_1677447050467_filter_cbf--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"PTSf\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1823951/1823951_10579359_1677447050467_filter_cbf--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"PTSf\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Prescribed-Time Safety Filter to override an obstacle in prescribed time defined by user, through control barrier function based quadratic programming</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Peiman Naseradinmousavi</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Peiman&nbsp;Naseradinmousavi</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">PTSf</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1823951/1823951_10579359_1677447186659_decen--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1823951/1823951_10579359_1677447186659_decen--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Dec_Adaptive\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1823951/1823951_10579359_1677447186659_decen--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Dec_Adaptive\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Model-free decentralized adaptive controller to carry out the task.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Peiman Naseradinmousavi</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Peiman&nbsp;Naseradinmousavi</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Dec_Adaptive</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
