 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research will involve a synergistic use of gravity wave, precipitation, and cloud observations together with local-area models for new constraints on convective updraft-scale latent heating and wave drag on circulation.  Gravity waves surrounding convective clouds are complex, three-dimensional, time-varying phenomena.  Through application of two specially designed regional model tools together with available observations, the research can make the invisible features of both the latent heating and the waves visible. The project focuses on applying this new knowledge to the problem of subgrid-scale gravity wave drag for global climate prediction and weather forecasting.  Gravity wave resolving models that have been observationally validated indicate that the scales and propagation of gravity waves emitted from convective clouds carry the signature of the four-dimensional properties of the localized, rapid variations in latent heating inside the clouds.\r\n\r\nThe team will examine the following two hypotheses: (1) Observations of gravity waves and precipitation constrain the local, instantaneous properties of latent heating inside convective clouds; and (2) Knowledge of the latent heating can be used to construct the missing features of the wave field needed to accurately assess their remote effects on circulation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTropical gravity wave drag is the leading force driving the quasibiennial oscillation (QBO) in lower stratospheric winds, which itself is a leading factor in Northern Hemisphere wintertime seasonal and interannual climate predictability and tropical intraseasonal and interannual precipitation predictability.  The knowledge of gravity waves gained from this project will provide a clear picture of the gravity wave momentum flux variability and relation to convective clouds, which will permit more accurate predictions and future climate projections.\r\n\r\nThe research will have substantial scientific and societal impacts. These include: (a) forecasting clear air turbulence felt by aircraft; (b) early warning of hurricane intensification over remote ocean areas; (c) improving tropical weather forecast skill; (d) nonmigrating tidal influences on middle atmosphere winds; and (e) forecasting ionospheric disturbances and communication channel disruptions. The project will provide training to an early career scientist. The project would also support a female PI, a member of an under-represented group in STEM research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit \n\nAtmospheric gravity waves generated by rain clouds and storms are poorly resolved or unresolved in the global models that routinely make predictions of future climate conditions in the months to decades ahead.  Although too small to be resolved, these waves are known to collectively have major impacts on winds in the stratosphere, and without including those impacts, the climate prediction models are lacking an important source of prediction skill.  Observations of these waves are relatively sparse and rarely include sufficient information to assess their impacts on the stratosphere.  The work in this project developed ways to use routine round-the-clock weather radar observations and quantitatively them some key properties of the gravity waves and their impacts in the stratosphere.  We also identified pathways to improve on existing methods for approximately including gravity wave impacts in climate models.  These approximate methods are called \"gravity wave drag parameterizations\".\n\nBroader Impacts \n\nScientific results of this project are being used in new research.  In one case, our results are part of the basis for applying an updated gravity wave drag parameterization in a new prediction model (at NASA) a model that we did not originally study.  A second new project is developing a new type of gravity wave drag parameterization based on our scientific findings.  A third new project is seeking to apply artificial intelligence methods, specifically neural network algorithms, to improve weather forecasts and climate predictions, and our results are being used as a benchmark for comparison of these novel new algorithms.  In addition to these broader scientific applications, the project supported the training and mentoring of two early career female scholars, part of a group that is under-represented in STEM fields.  One female postdoctoral scholar has been promoted to research scientist and is enjoying success as a principal investigator of her own projects, and one female graduate student was mentored through the successful defense of her PhD thesis.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/04/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: M Joan Alexander"
