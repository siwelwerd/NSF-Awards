 "awd_abstract_narration": "Innovations developed through public sector investments over the past few decades have translated to technologies that have benefited U.S. agriculture productivity significantly, for example, reducing agriculture inputs through precision application of water, nutrients, and pesticides. Genetic technologies have led to better predictive models for plant breeding and introduction of novel traits into crops that could not be added by conventional means. However, the ability to introduce novel traits using biotechnology is often hampered by low efficiencies. This project seeks to improve the efficiency with which Agrobacterium tumefaciens can serve as a tool to introduce novel traits into crop plants by exploiting the bacterium's ability to secrete proteins into plant cells. The transient delivery of these proteins will impact both the ability of the plant cell to detect and fight off the bacterium, and the ability of the plant cell  to regenerate a new plant once it has been altered. To meet this goal, a multidisciplinary approach will be taken that brings together expertise in genetics, microbiology and molecular biology. Importantly, the underlying biology of the project will be communicated through outreach efforts to the non-science community on all aspects of food production and on how innovations in agriculture help maintain the U. S. strategic advantage through its capacity to produce a plentiful and safe food supply. \r\n\r\nThe research to be conducted in this project lays out an innovative set of studies to design and test novel Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains that can help mitigate two major inefficiencies of plant transformation: the competency of the cell to receive a genetic reagent and the ability of that same cell to lead to germline transmission of the induced genetic change.  Pseudomonas effector proteins that suppress the plant innate immune response will be transiently expressed to improve the efficiency of gene transfer from bacterium to plant cell.  In addition, plant morphogenic proteins will be transiently expressed to improve the efficiency of regenerating plants from transformed tissue culture cells.  The results of these studies will also provide insight into the size limit of a protein that can be shuttled through the Agrobacterium type IV secretion system. Overall, this project should lead to A. tumefaciens strains with enhanced transformation capacity across a broader array of genotypes within a plant species and that are easily transferable to the plant science community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These tools also assist researchers in elucidation of gene function in plants.  However, these tools are often hampered by the inefficiencies in their ability to introduce genetic variation into plants.  These inefficiencies are associated with both aspects of plant transformation, a) the ability to deliver a foreign piece of DNA into a plant cell, and b) the capacity of the cell(s), that receive the foreign of DNA, to regenerate in tissue culture and pass the trait on to the progeny (seed).  The project\u2019s overall goal was to exploit the type IV secretion system of the natural plant transformation bacterium, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, to deliver protein reagents into plant cells to impact in vitro regeneration component of plant transformation, and to affect the plant\u2019s ability to perceive a challenge by A. tumefaciens during the transformation process. In addition, genetic changes were created in A. tumefaciens that altered a known microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs).  MAMPs are molecules in microorganisms that when presented to a plant will trigger the plant\u2019s immune response. The MAMP targeted in this research was the bacterial elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu).  The rationale being that A. tumefacien\u2019s EF-Tu is recognized by the host plant during the transformation process, and in doing so activates the plant\u2019s immune response, which will negatively impact the transformation process.  Hence, by using the bacterium\u2019s type IV secretion system to deliver reagents to alter the immune response, combined with creating genetic changes of a known MAMP, the outcome would be a more \"stealth\" like natural plant transformation vehicle, with improved capacity to introduce novel bits of genetic variation into plants, due to mitigation in the plant\u2019s ability to perceive the bacterium during the transformation process. \n\n \n\nAn outcome of this project demonstrated that A. tumefaciens type IV secretion system can deliver from its cell into a plant host cell a protein cargo of 100 kDa in size, a cargo of such mass can accommodate most known plant cell morphogenic reagents that can positively affect in vitro regeneration of plants cells. Genetic elements were subsequently designed to transport two maize morphogenic reagents designated BBM/WUS, along with one from the plant Arabidopsis called ARR10. Introduction of these morphogenic reagents into plant cells via A. tumefaciens type IV secretion systems were evaluated in for impact on tissue culture response in corn, maize and soybean in vitroregeneration platforms.  The results revealed no significant impact on the regeneration capacity among the plant species tested, likely due to the amount and/or time period in which the reagents could be introduced.  \n\n \n\nAnother outcome of this research was the results tabulated from a bioinformatic exercise that explored the natural sequence variation across 32,000 EF-Tu proteins across 21 bacterial genera related to a plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000.  Here the results show that this plant pathogen evolved a rare sequence in its EF-Tu that blocked the MAMP from being recognized by the host, thus facilitating the disease state. By transferring the genetic variation observed in P. syringae pv tomato DC300\u2019s EF-Tu to that of A. tumefaciens\u2019, significantly enhanced the ability of the bacterium to transform members of the Brassicaceae family, namely Arabidopsis and Camelina.  The derived novel A. tumefaciens strain was subsequently engineered to enable the bacterium to inject type III effector reagents, to mitigate the host\u2019s defense response, which can be triggered by other MAMPs present in A. tumefaciens. Here the outcome displayed a 2.6-fold increase, relative to the \u2018wild-type\u2019 A. tumefaciens strain, in its ability to transform these two members of the Brassicaceae.\n\nThe outcomes of this program highlight the importance of the decades of research that have expanded our understanding of host microbe interactions, whose fundamental discoveries gave rise to the transformation tool of A. tumefaciens for the introduction of novel genetic variation into plants, reagents for genome editing, and creative genetic designs to protect yield under biotic stress.  Continued research efforts that expand our knowledge of the underpinnings governing the communication between the host and microbe will permit the plant biology community to further improve T-DNA transfer ability of A. tumefaciens and/or other microbes that possess such capacity and develop the next generation of reagents for introduce site specific genetic variation to continuously improve upon the resiliency of agriculture production systems. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/27/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas E Clemente"
