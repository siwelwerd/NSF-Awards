 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the international GEOTRACES program is to understand the distributions of trace chemical elements and their isotopes in the oceans. An essential part of this effort is determining the sources of trace elements to the oceans.  One important such source comes from seafloor hydrothermal venting. This project will support the measurement of helium isotopes on the 2018 U.S. GEOTRACES expedition in the Pacific Ocean, running south from Alaska to Tahiti. Helium isotopes provide important information on the presence and dispersion of hydrothermal plumes. On a larger scale, they can also be used to calculate global-scale inputs of hydrothermally-sourced trace elements and isotopes. Thus, the proposed work is closely tied to many other projects associated with this expedition.  The measurement of helium isotopes will also allow enable the investigation of physical mixing rates within the upper ocean to help interpret the fate of other trace elements. At the northern end of the section, this approach will also be used to investigate the rate at which other trace elements and isotopes from seafloor hydrothermal venting are delivered to the more biologically productive surface ocean. In addition to supporting the GEOTRACES effort and participating in community-scale outreach efforts associated with the expedition, the investigators will also work with a visual artist to communicate their science to the public in new ways.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. GEOTRACES Pacific Meridional Transect (56\u00b0N to 20\u00b0S, along 152\u00b0W) in late 2018 will intercept: strong margin fluxes, sub-Arctic high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll waters, the oldest deep waters in the world's oceans, the distal ends of multiple hydrothermal plumes, oxygen minimum zones, subpolar and equatorial upwelling, and, in the South Pacific near 20\u00b0S, some of the most oligotrophic waters known. This section, together with the US GEOTRACES East Pacific Zonal Transect (EPZT) conducted in 2013, will also close off a large volume of the Pacific Ocean. Consequently, this work will facilitate new, improved evaluations of regional-scale fluxes of hydrothermally-sourced trace elements and isotopes (TEIs) to the oceans. Because the 2018 expedition will intercept multiple hydrothermal plumes, this project will also allow the investigation of three key questions emerging from the larger U.S. and international GEOTRACES programs: 1) Is there a significant source of hydrothermally-sourced Fe and other TEIs to the euphotic zone in the North Pacific, through upwelling, as was demonstrated for the Southern Ocean from the 2013 EPZT results?  2) How do TEI:He-3 ratios in hydrothermal plumes vary with different geologic settings of their vent-sources?  3) How do the TEI:He-3 ratios imparted to hydrothermal plumes vary along the thermohaline conveyor as a function of varying water column chemistry?  Throughout the section the investigators will also combine upper-water column helium-3 measurements with water column tritium concentrations (extrapolated from data collected on past expeditions) to estimate water column ventilation time scales that can be used to quantify rates of TEI transformation across the wide range of biogeochemical regimes to be intercepted (tropical, subtropical, subpolar).  In regions characterized by upwelling, precise measurements of helium isotopes can be combined with canonical gas-exchange rate estimates to make flux-gauge determinations of upwelling rates for some key TEIs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project was part of a larger national program, US GEOTRACES, that collected water samples from throughout the deep Pacific Ocean along a due N-S oriented line extending from the Aleutian Islands in the North Pacific, via Hawaii to Tahiti in the South Pacific along Longitude~150W.The larger GEOTRACES program sought to understand the chemical behavior of a wide range of trace elements and isotopes that can vary as a result of biological and mineralogical processes in the oceans.But our study focused on the so-called noble gases which make up the far, right-hand column of the Periodic Table of the Elements.These elements are known for the level to which they are chemically inert  they dont undergo any chemical reactions  which makes them particularly useful (especially when analyzed as a group) to learn more about physical mixing processes that happen in the ocean.For the US GEOTRACES program, a particular value that we brought to the program was that we could provide a physical framework of how deep and shallow waters were circulating in the Central North Pacific Ocean which, in turn, provided context for all the other measurements made in other laboratories participating in the same endeavor.There were a series of highlights to what we discovered, just from this study alone.First, one of the elements studied, Helium, showed enrichment in Deep Pacific Waters in the lighter isotope of this element compared to the heavier isotope which provides an unambiguous tracer of input from hot-springs at the deep ocean floor that can be transported thousands of miles across ocean basins.These signals were strongest in the tropical south Pacific and in the tropical north Pacific but decreased closer to the Aleutian islands where release of the heavier isotope (from alpha decay of other radioactive elements) from sediments masked the hydrothermal signals.In the upper ocean, one of the most insightful results from our work were to reveal that we could use measurements of the heavier elements in the noble gas series to investigate seasonal changes in heating of the upper 200m of the Pacific Ocean from sunlight whereas the lighter elements could be used to trace how air bubbles are trapped by and dissolved into that seawater.Two particularly unexpected results from the work were as follows.Close to Hawaii, we found that there was a very strong and shallow input of hydrothermal fluids from the Kamaehuakanaloa Seamount and, combining our analyses with theoretical models, we were able to predict that these shallow, hydrothermally enriched waters might travel across the Pacific to offshore Washington State, Vancouver Island in Canada and perhaps as far as Alaska and the Aleutian Islands where they could deliver important nutrient chemicals to stimulate and enhance biological activity.Separately, using the heaviest noble gas measurements from the deep north Pacific ocean, coupled with ocean circulation models, we were able to derive information from the oldest deep waters on Earth, which carried information about the atmosphere near Antarctica, and how air pressure in that region has varied (with implications for how stormy the weather there must have been), dating back as far as the time of the Roman Civilization, more than 2000 years ago.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/23/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ChrisGerman\n"
