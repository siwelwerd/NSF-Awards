 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will study the outskirts of the nearest giant elliptical galaxy, named Centaurus A, to learn how the galaxy built up its stellar and dark matter mass over cosmic time.  The investigators have measured the positions of nearly all the luminous star clusters associated with Centaurus A, and will precisely measure their velocities using large ground-based telescopes.  Using observations of the collection of star clusters, and their motions around Centaurus A, the investigators will measure the dark matter density profile of the galaxy, and search for remnants of smaller galaxies that have merged with Centaurus A.  The important goal of their observations is identifying large star clusters which are the remnants left over from smaller galaxies after they have been devoured by the larger Centaurus A.  By studying the motions of these star clusters in detail, along with the smaller galaxies it has destroyed, they will have a complete inventory of the 'dark side' of Centaurus A.  Their results will be applied to studies of all galaxy populations.  The investigators will present the science results from this program to visitors at the National Science Foundation's Kitt Peak National Observatory, by implementing a new docent training program at the visitor center.  The investigators will travel to Bryce Canyon National Park and present their results, through summer internships, which ultimately teach 16,000 visitors about the night sky.\r\n\r\nThe currently favored cold dark matter model makes clear predictions for the sub-halo mass function and dark matter density profile of galaxy-sized halos, but quantitatively verifying these predictions is challenging.   Centaurus A's dark matter density profile will be measured, using the kinematics derived from a nearly complete sample of star clusters, and the results compared to recent simulations that suggest galaxies with recent mergers and active galactic nuclei should have shallow dark matter profiles.  By combining the star cluster kinematics with an already existing red giant branch star map, the visible, accreted substructures will be identified and weighed.  Finally, a complete sample of ultra-compact dwarfs will be analyzed, including a search identifying them as the central compact remnants of stripped dwarf galaxies.  Accounting for this population of sub-halos is a novel aspect of this program, and one that has largely been neglected when testing galaxy formation models.  These efforts will test major predictions of the cold dark matter model at sub-galactic scales in our nearest elliptical galaxy neighbor.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

All normal galaxies have a population of star clusters which surround them. Their spatial distribution, colors and stellar properties teach us about how the halo of the galaxy was built up, and by measuring their velocities we can use them to trace the dark matter halo of the galaxy they below to.\n\n\nWe have done this sort of analysis on an unprecedented scale around NGC5128, the nearest elliptical galaxy to our own. First, we used a very detailed map of NGC5128, as well as results from the Gaia satellite, to make a clean list of possible newly identified star cluster around the galaxy. This new technique can be used throughout the Local Universe, and is one of the main new results coming out of our program. With these new candidates in hand, we measured their velocities using spectrographs on several large telescope. These velocities let us confirm if our star cluster identification was correct, as some of them are actually foreground stars. For those that were correctly identified (over 100 new systems in total), we could trace how fast they were moving around NGC5128, which lets us also infer the mass of NGC5128. We used these new systems to measure NGC5128's mass out to much larger radii than had been done previously, further elucidating the dark matter halo of our nearest elliptical galaxy.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/26/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DavidJSand\n"
