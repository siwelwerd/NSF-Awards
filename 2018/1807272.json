 "awd_abstract_narration": "Frequency comb sources are frequency rulers that make it possible to measure frequencies with phenomenal accuracy - equivalent to measuring a shift in the distance between the Earth and the Sun of 100 times the width of an atom.  Frequency combs are used in basic physics experiments, for chemical, environmental, and medical sensing, for time and frequency transfer, and in radar systems.  The first frequency combs were made from bulky laser systems, and the discovery in the past decade that microresonators (mm-size optical devices) can produce frequency combs has led to an outpouring of scientific interest.  However, almost all frequency combs use short optical pulses called solitons.  Solitons in microresonators are hard to obtain, waste much of the optical pump power that is used to generate them, and are thermally unstable.  We will study novel waveforms that have the potential to solve these problems.  In our theoretical studies, we will use a unique set of computational tools that we developed and that to our knowledge no other research group has at present.  These tools make it possible to rapidly determine how these waveforms can be obtained and to determine their robustness in the presence of noise and thermal effects.  That allows us to move away from the \"cut-and-try\" experimental work that has mostly limited studies to date to single solitons.  The computational tools will be made generally available via the Web.  We expect that they will be useful in other systems, including economic and biological systems, as well as other optical systems.  To carry out this theoretical work and test these ideas experimentally, we have assembled a team that includes scientists at the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC), the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Purdue University, and the French Centre National de Recherche Scientifique. UMBC is a minority-serving institution with a reputation for diversity and educational innovation, and we anticipate involving undergraduate as well as graduate students in this research.  All our students will benefit from the strong theoretical-experimental collaboration and the opportunity to interact with students and faculty from different countries.\r\n\r\nThe principal technical goal of this research is to study the potential of waveforms other than single solitons for creating frequency combs in microresonators.  We will focus on cnoidal waves and soliton molecules.  Preliminary work indicates that cnoidal waves have a large region of stability, can be simply accessed by raising the pump power, are robust, and can have large bandwidths.  Cnoidal waves and dark soliton molecules can be obtained in the normal dispersion regime, in contrast to single (bright) solitons, which increases the number of material systems in which frequency combs can be obtained.  To achieve this goal, we will use a set of computational tools, based on dynamical systems theory and statistical mechanics, that we have developed and will continue to develop.  These tools will allow us to determine where in the system parameter space the alternative waveforms are accessible, stable, and robust in the presence of noise.  A secondary goal of this research is to demonstrate the utility of these theoretical tools and make them widely available to the research community.  Having identified where in the parameter space stable waveforms exists, we will work with our experimental collaborators at the CNRS and Purdue to test and refine the theoretical predictions, taking advantage of their existing experimental infrastructure, which is based on crystalline resonators and silicon-nitride resonators, respectively.  We anticipate an iterative process in which the theoretical work leads to new experiments, and the experiments guide the direction of the theoretical work.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe first aim of this project was to use theoretical and computational methods to find new approaches to generate stable microresonator frequency combs and to determine their long-term stability.  The second aim of this project was to develop a project-based educational program that would interest students in the generation, dissemination, and detection of time and frequency with a strong emphasis on students from under-represented populations. \n\nMicroresonators are millimeter-sized, cylindrically-symmetric devices, as shown schematically in Fig. 1.  At resonant frequencies, the light inside the microresonator grows in strength and through nonlinear frequency interactions generates a regularly-spaced comb of frequency lines that exit through the through port and through the drop port if it exists.  The frequency comb corresponds to a regular series of optical pulses in the time domain as shown in Fig. 2.  The actual optical pulse shapes that are created by the microresonator and circulate inside it can be quite complex, as shown in Fig. 3. \n\nAt the outset of our reseach program, it was difficult to obtain a stable frequency comb deterministically, and it was common to sweep through the frequency space many times in order to obtain the comb.  Thermal instabilities were a key difficulty that had to be overcome.  One of our aims was to investigate deterministic procedures for obtaining frequency combs.  At the outset of our research program, we intended to collaborate with the research group of Andrew Weiner at Purdue University.  They dropped out of the collaboration after a year, and we had to find other experimental research partners.  In the interim, leveraging other research funds, we developed collaborations with experimental groups at the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) and the National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) as well as an experimental program at UMBC in collaboration with Dr. Gary Carter.\n\nDuring the lifetime of the grant, we explored several approaches to deterministically obtain solitons, single solitary pulses that are shown in the upper left corner of Fig. 3, as well as other more complex pulses shapes that are shown in Fig. 3.  We first investigated the possibility of using careful control of the pump power and the frequency of the light in the input port in order to deterministically obtain a frequency comb.  We demonstrated that it is possible to do that, but subsequent studies at both ARL and UMBC demonstrated that it is difficult to obtain the precise callibration of pump frequency and the pump power that is injected into the microresonator that is needed.  Another approach that has been suggested is phase modulation of the pump power.  We investigated this approach both theoretically and experimentally.  Our results indicate that this approach works, but is restricted to a narrow range of frequencies.  We have submitted one publication related to this work and others are in progress. Finally, we investigated the use of avoided crossings.  Early work at Purdue indicated that they can play an important role in stabilizing solitons and other, more complex structures.  We investigated this issue theoretically using methods from dynamical systems theory that we pioneered, but we have not yet come to useful general conclusions.  This research is ongoing.  In the interim, it has been discovered that it is possible to use a secondary pump to stabilize solitons and other, more complex pulse shapes.  This work, in collaboration with NIST, is also ongoing.\n\nA secondary research goal was to continue to improve the dynamical methods that we use to characterize the long-term stability of the pulse shapes that generate frequency combs.  We have met with considerable success in automating these techniques.  We have presented these techniques in publications and are currently preparing a publication.\n\nWe have successfully met our educational goals.  Prior to the pandemic, we took advantage of an REU supplemental grant to recruit a group of nine undergraduates.  Three of those students continued to work with our group after the program ended.  All three were from under-represented populations or had disabilities.  One student has joined our research group as a PhD student and is leading the effort on the automation of the dynamical methods.  During the pandemic our efforts to recruit students led to two undergraduates who worked with our group virtually.  This summer, in collaboration with Dr. Carter, we began a projects-based program that had ten undergraduates.  Three are continuing to work with us and Dr. Carter during the academic year.  Two are from under-represented populations.  We are also piloting a projects-based course this fall on the elements of time and frequency, which currently has eight senior students.\n\nThe intellectual merit of our work has been exploring alternatives to standard non-deterministic approaches to obtaining frequency combs and the development of computational dynamical methods.  Our educational program will have a broad impact on the national effort to diversify our STEM workforce.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/03/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Curtis R Menyuk"
