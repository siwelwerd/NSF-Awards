This is a highly interdisciplinary meeting that brings together a diverse group of leading researchers from academia, national laboratories, and industry, aiming to broadly share advances in computational physics, to facilitate networking among attendees, and to discuss and further general plans for the community. The topics covered span the topical areas of the Divisions involved. NSF support will enable the participation of 12 early-career scientists, who might not otherwise be able to attend.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
