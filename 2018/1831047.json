 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to create a new service technology to improve physical activity engagement by developing personalized physical activity prescriptions with market-available exergames and fitness mobile applications (fitness app). This technology is a theory- and research-based service process that targets maintaining physical activity engagement. The application has the potential to improve fitness function in individuals at any age and in any physical condition when he/she engages in physical activity. The technology can have several broader impacts on society: (1) as a nation, we are in need of creative solutions to improve the general health and fitness of our citizens; (2) according to the US Census bureau, in 2050, the 65+ age population is predicted to be over 80 million (twice that in 2012) who need to be fit; and (3) chronic illnesses result in significant reduction in productivity of the working population - the severity of illness can be reduced by improving the fitness of the individual.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project aims (1) to determine what the customer segments and value propositions are for the technology; (2) to identify in what format the application should be delivered to make a market/product fit; and (3) to establish the readiness to transit the technology as an automated marketable service product. As of today, the technology exists as a manually prescribing procedure for patients who suffer from fatigue symptom. It has been thoroughly validated by pilot tests. Personalization features gauge and match multi-level factors, so the likelihood of adherence to the physical activity prescription is very high. The Exergame Grading Scheme is used to rate intensity of fitness attributes and energy expenditure of exergames and fitness app. The personalized physical activity prescriptions are generated by the Exergame Grading Scheme based algorithm, so that the prescription can challenge the individual's functional capacity. The intellectual merit lies in: (1) identifying the right combination of hardware/software technologies that can accurately implement the product; and (2) implementing a solution that is scalable in mass volumes with low cost per unit.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
