 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eruptions of high-silica rhyolite magma are explosive, violent, and potentially extremely hazardous events. However, questions of how, under what conditions, and over what timescales the magma bodies that source these eruptions are assembled remain debated. Resolving these issues is critical for understanding a variety of magmatic and crustal processes, ranging from the geochemical stratification of the crust to monitoring the volcanoes that source such dangerous eruptions for future hazards. A significant challenge to answering these questions lies in the difficulty in documenting the physical (e.g., temperature, pressure) and geochemical conditions in magmatic systems through time. Geophysical measurements on modern volcanoes can provide 'snapshots' of a magmatic system, but they cannot shed light on long-term changes that occur over tens of thousands to millions of years. One way to bridge this gap is to study ancient volcanoes where faulting and erosion have exposed both the material that erupted from the volcano and the un-erupted material that comprises the roots of these systems within the Earth's crust. Used in combination, these extrusive and intrusive deposits can be a powerful tool to understand longer-term processes. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to investigate one such ancient volcano near Searchlight, Nevada (USA). More specifically, the PIs will produce a high-resolution (<50,000 years) temporal record spanning the magmatic system's 1-2 million year lifetime, with which they will establish the history of magma emplacement in the crust, geochemical trends, and the relative timing of the eruption(s). To do this, the researchers will utilize high-precision U-Pb zircon geochronology, whole-rock and mineral geochemistry and barometry, and thermal models. This record will shed light on the timescales over which magmas accumulate and are stored within the Earth's upper crust, the processes that occur in and affect the magma body prior to eruption, and potential eruption triggers. Funding will also support two postdoctoral researchers (1 female), research opportunities for undergraduate students at Princeton and Northeastern Universities, and participation in Princeton University's Teachers as Scholars program, which introduces local K-12 teachers to the Earth sciences and helps them in building science curricula for use in their classrooms.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Understanding how magma evolves underneath volcanoes, and under what conditions it erupts, are important as we strive to build better tools for predicting volcanic eruptions in various geologic settings.  To do this, we must study both active volcanoes and also fossilized magmatic plumbing systems that were previously located beneath volcanoes and are now exposed at the surface.  However, connecting specific volcanic eruptions to their sources beneath volcanoes is difficult because volcanoes are commonly eroded away before exposing their guts.  In Searchlight, Nevada, a rare opportunity exists to do exactly this because a subterranean (or, plutonic) portion of the volcanic system AND its volcanic counterpart were tilted 90 degrees onto their side and eroded to expose both parts.  The project was focused on understanding the chemistry and chronology of both parts of this system with hopes of connecting volcanic rocks directly to the source regions from where they were extracted, now preserved as plutonic rocks. In order to do this, we collected samples through both rock types and analyzed them for geochemistry, ages (geochronology), and thermobarometry (a way of constraining the depth in the crust for the minerals in the rock).  We show that the magmatic system was active for over one million years, slowly placing magma into the crust, some of which periodically erupted.  In a short period of time (10s of thousands of years), a large magma batch intruded into the crust at depths of &lt;5 km, crystallized partially as it cooled, and the remaining liquid was separated from the crystals and erupted as explosive large volume ash flows and ash falls.  The implications are that although liquid was likely present in small volumes for over a million years, a large body of eruptible magma was present for much shorter time periods (tens of thousands of years) prior to a highly explosive sequence of eruptions, similar to those that potentially represent the most  disastrous for human communities.\n\n \nBroader Impacts:\n\nThis project began as a collaboration in the field near Searchlight, Nevada, between the PIs of the proposal, their students and postdocs, and researchers from other universities and the Geologic Survey of Nevada.
