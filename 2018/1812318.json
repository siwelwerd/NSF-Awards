 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports early career scientists to attend and participate in the \"Hot Quarks 2018: A Workshop on the Physics of Ultrarelativistic Nucleus-Nucleus Collisions for Young Scientists.\"  The quark gluon plasma, predicted by Quantum Chromo-Dynamics, has been observed through measurements at Brookhaven National Laboratory and the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron, but fully understanding the nature of this collective state of matter remains elusive.  The scientific scope of this field has broadened significantly with new measurements and theoretical developments. The discussions in this workshop will include an interdisciplinary combination of concepts from elementary-particle physics, nuclear physics, QCD thermodynamics, hydrodynamics, non-equilibrium transport theory and the application of AdS/CFT techniques to the phenomenology of heavy-ions collisions.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this workshop is to enhance the scientific communication among the younger members, particularly graduate students, postdocs and junior faculty, both from experiment and theory. For early career scientists, this represents an opportunity for exchange and exposure to science that that they might not have in one of the major big conferences. The organizers have a history of recruiting widely to broaden the participation of under-represented groups in nuclear science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
