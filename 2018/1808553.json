 "awd_abstract_narration": "The normal heart functions by contracting and pushing the blood from the left ventricle into the rest of the body. Due to various diseases, the contraction capabilities of the heart become diminished in certain regions of the heart chamber wall, compromising the overall function of the heart. In order to identify and select optimal treatment, it is critical to identify the regions of the heart wall that exhibit reduced contractions. Unfortunately, contractions cannot be easily measured. This project will estimate the stress (contraction power) developed within the heart muscle by combining medical imaging and mechanical modeling of the heart. These stresses will serve as a quantitative measure of the contractile function of the heart and help detect and localize disease. Therefore, this research has the potential to evolve into a future tool to diagnose cardiac function. This project will also feature a synergistically integrated education and outreach program. We will foster research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in computer science, biomedical engineering, mathematics, and imaging science at Rochester Institute of Technology and the University of Kansas. The PIs will develop innovative hands-on workshops to inspire and educate K-12 students from underrepresented groups on biomedical computing and medicine.\r\n \r\nThis project proposes to develop a method that enables non-invasive appraisal and visualization of the active stresses developed in the myocardium to serve as a direct means to assess the bio-mechanical function of the heart. The PIs will develop open-source cyberinfrastructure and integrate it into a novel computational framework for cardiac biomechanics that will reconstruct the active stresses from cardiac deformations. The PIs will accomplish this goal by developing and integrating techniques for medical image computing, high-order meshing, and inverse-problem bio-mechanical modeling. This research will address a currently unexplored niche in the cardiac modeling field, specifically the reconstruction and visualization of myocardial active stresses, to enable direct appraisal of cardiac function. This research will contribute to medical image computing through the development of algorithms for medical image processing and visualization. The PIs will develop and implement novel high-order meshing techniques and integrate them with the fiber architecture to enable accurate and efficient scientific modeling and computing. The project will contribute new knowledge in mathematical modeling and simulation by implementing efficient nonlinear least-squares solutions for inverse cardiac biomechanics. Lastly, the PIs will release the resulting cyberinfrastructure to the scientific computing community for research and education use.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe normal heart functions by contracting and pushing oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle into the rest of the body. Due to various diseases, the contraction capabilities of the heart become lessened in certain regions of the wall of the heart chambers. This reduces the overall function of the heart. To identify and select the best possible patient treatment, it is important to identify the regions of the heart wall that exhibit reduced contractions. Although contractions are difficult to measure, medical imaging and mechanical modeling of the heart can be combined to estimate the stress (or contraction power) within the heart muscle. These stresses can be used to measure the ability of the heart's cells to contract and help detect and restrict the disease to a particular location. In this project, we made significant progress towards the development of a technique for the assessment and visualization of the active stresses in the muscular layer of the heart. This will serve as a direct way of assessing the heart's biomechanical function.\n\n\nImage registration is used to transform different data sets into a single coordinate system. In this project, we developed several computer algorithms for image registration based on advanced machine learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks, which learn features on their own, and vision transformers, an architecture with a reduced learning time. Cine cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides dynamic, high-resolution 3D images of the heart that depict the hearts motion throughout the cardiac cycle. Hence image registration was used to estimate the cardiac motion between consecutive 3D images in the 4D cine cardiac MRI dataset. Given the improved accuracy in our image registration algorithms, we have applied these techniques to generate high-quality, accurate, deformable geometric left ventricle models from cine cardiac MRI data.\n\n\nMeshes refer to the discretization of a geometry which serves as an approximation of the geometry for use with geometry-based analysis techniques. The surface and volume of the geometry are typically discretized into shapes, e.g., triangles in 2D, and tetrahedra in 3D. High-order meshes connect adjacent mesh nodes with a polynomial of degree at least two, which results in a curved element. In this project, we developed computer algorithms for the generation of high-order triangular and tetrahedral meshes. These algorithms were based on the use of an advancing front method to progressively add one good-quality triangle or tetrahedron to the mesh at a time starting at the boundary of the geometric model and moving inwards. Local remeshing was used, when required, to improve the element quality. As a final step, mesh optimization was performed to curve the mesh elements and further improve their quality. The algorithms have been used to generate volume meshes from high-order surface meshes generated from patient-specific medical images or computer-aided design models.\n\n\nMesh warping is the process of mapping a mesh from a source to a target geometry. In this project, we developed a mesh warping algorithm for high-order meshes. Our algorithm solves equations to determine the deformed shape of an incompressible solid for a prescribed boundary deformation. The deformed shape specifies the new position of the high-order mesh. The algorithm has been used to develop a simulation of a beating heart based on the deformable geometric left ventricle models from cine cardiac MRI data. The high-order meshing software will be released to the scientific computing community for research and education use. At the University of Kansas (KU), the project provided opportunities for 2 Ph.D., 1 M.S., and 5 B.S. students to conduct research on the generation and warping of high-order meshes and cardiac simulations.\n\n\nWe organized a summer camp for middle school students at KU, which focused on image processing, computer algorithms, computer-aided design, geometric models, meshes, and 3D printing for biomedical applications. We also participated in two virtual math summer camps at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) for high school students and taught the students about biomedical models and meshes. Numerous students who attended the summer camps were female or from underrepresented minority groups. Dr. Shontz also taught a short course on moving meshes at a conference. She also gave presentations on geometric modeling and mesh generation for cardiac simulations in the Virtual Winter School for Cardiac Simulations at the Universita della Svizzera italiana; these were attended by researchers from around the world. In addition, she gave plenary talks on this research at the International Meshing Roundtable in 2021 (which was held virtually) and the International Conference on Adaptive Modeling and Simulation in 2023 (which was held in Sweden).  \n\n\nDr. Shontz was also recognized with the 2021 International Meshing Roundtable Fellow Award for a \"distinguished record of research accomplishments in mesh generation and exceptional service in the meshing community.\" \n\n\nThese research, education, and outreach activities were conducted at KU by the research team and our collaborators from RIT and beyond.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/28/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: SuzanneMShontz\n"
