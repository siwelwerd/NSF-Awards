 "awd_abstract_narration": "Seafloor landslides that occur just offshore of continents can have significant impacts on coastal areas. On the continental margin offshore of the heavily populated U.S. Mid-Atlantic, about 15% of the continental slope shows scars from large submarine landslides. This study aims to understand the driving mechanisms behind these common features. The role that fluids within the sediments play in triggering landslides will be examined by applying new analysis techniques to existing data.  Slope failure can occur gradually or catastrophically, and the type of failure will control the severity of the impacts to coastal areas. Results of this study will provide a better understanding of the following: (1) the natural hazard risk from tsunamis generated by catastrophic slope failures, (2) potential impacts when trapped greenhouse gases are released from both gradual and catastrophic failures, and (3) sedimentary systems along continental margins in a broader scientific sense. The project supports the training of two graduate students and a post-doctoral investigator.\r\n\r\nThe Cape Fear and Currituck submarine landslides offshore North Carolina will be examined using open-access seismic reflection data. A key question for these and other slope failures is \"What is the role of elevated pore-fluid pressure in promoting slope instability?\" Using pre-stack waveform inversion (PWI) and high-quality seismic data, detailed information on variations in P- and S- wave velocity of sediments inside and outside of these two slide complexes will be obtained. The new velocity information will be integrated with other available information on sediment properties from coring and drilling to constrain variations in sediment physical properties between failed and un-failed regions. Variations in pore-fluid pressure will be estimated using an effective-medium approach relating velocity and effective stress. Also, the seismic profiles will be reprocessed through pre-stack depth migration using velocities obtained by PWI to improve imaging of slide features. This study will add critical new constraints on in situ sediment properties and the stress state within and around the Cape Fear and Currituck slide complexes to the growing body of information on these slides.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project is a collaboration between Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) at Columbia University and The Ohio State University.<br />We completed a detailed seismic interpretation of the previously observed conspicuous region of undulating wavy beds behind the largest headwall in the Cape Fear System. This region has long been suggested as possible creep and ongoing deformation that could indicate future instability and potential slope failure. However, an alternative possibility is that the undulatory sediments are sediment waves and not a result of creep. Being able to distinguish creep versus sediment waves is a crucially important aspect of assessing potential for slope failure in the Cape Fear region. We engaged in a detailed investigation to answer this question. The results are strongly in favor of sediment waves rather than creep. This is based on the geometrical properties of the sediment waves that were only possible by careful mapping using the high-resolution multi-channel seismic data collected by the Eastern North American Community Seismic Experiment Cruise in 2014. Prior to this line being acquired, the older seismic lines were able to resolve a zone of wavy reflectors but not at sufficient resolution to allow for individual layer mapping and quantitative geometric properties to be extracted.<br />Based on detailed analysis of high-resolution multichannel seismic data, we interpret a region of undulatory sediments adjacent to a major headwall of the Cape Fear submarine landslide system offshore of North Carolina, USA, as sediment waves rather than creep or fault-related deformation. The wave package extends 19 kilometers upslope from the S4 landslide headwall and thickens upslope from approximately 250-450 m. Examination of the undulating sediments with seismic and bathymetry data reveals the undulations feature continuity of seismic horizons, upslope-migrating crests, downslope thinning, and wave heights and lengths of ~26 m and ~1 km, respectively, which are consistent with sediment wave fields. These waves may be related to the contourites of nearby Blake Ridge, formed by the Western Boundary Undercurrent. Nearby Ocean Drilling Program cores suggests that turbidity currents may have also played a role in wave formation. While most of the 19-km long field comprises unaltered sediment waves, we observe a ~5-km long zone adjacent to the landslide scarp containing evidence of faults that offset and deform the sediment wave strata. We interpret this deformation as the result of reduction in stress following the removal of the landslide mass. Given that the Cape Fear system has generated several episodes of potentially tsunamigenic slope failure, the future stability of the system is of interest. Redefining these undulatory sediments as sediment waves eliminates a major slope instability mechanism of the system and is important for understanding future slope stability hazards of Cape Fear. Our analysis highlights the importance of understanding sediment waves in hybrid submarine landslide-sediment wave systems.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/15/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Derek&nbsp;Sawyer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1830726/1830726_10572050_1644923237232_Seismic-Line--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1830726/1830726_10572050_1644923237232_Seismic-Line--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Interpreted Seismic Profile\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1830726/1830726_10572050_1644923237232_Seismic-Line--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Interpreted Seismic Profile\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(A) An uninterpreted section of high resolution multichannel seismic from ENAM-CSE Line 33-34.
