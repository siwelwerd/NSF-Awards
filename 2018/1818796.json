 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I project is intended to develop a noninvasive, ultra-sensitive molecular\r\ndetection system for Tuberculosis (TB). Although the prevalence of TB has diminished, it still\r\nremains the second leading cause of death from an infectious disease. The latest global TB report\r\nfrom the World Health Organization with data compiled from 205 countries put the figures at 1.5\r\nmillion fatalities and 9.6 million infections annually. The proposed technology uses the nano-\r\nPlasmonic Grating (P-GRAT) properties to enhance the detection signal of the TB biomarker by\r\nmore than 100X. This results in detecting concentrations in femto-gram/milliliter range resulting\r\nin early detection and treatment. The specificity, faster results, low cost/test and ease of use,\r\nmakes this system a substantive innovation in the TB diagnostic market. The TB testing market\r\naccounts for $1.5 billion annually of which North America is the second largest in terms of\r\ngenerated revenue due to the higher pricing for TB detection. The proposed technology will\r\nbenefit the patients with early diagnosis and provide the health care professionals with early\r\ntreatment options. With all the advantages this technology has to offer, it is expected to gain a\r\nsignificant share in the market place and generate a revenue stream.\r\n\r\nThe main limitation of the immunoassays is their inability to detect extremely small fluorescence\r\nsignals that are associated with ultra-low concentrations of biomarkers. The proposed nano-\r\nPlasmonic Grating (P-GRAT) technology can overcome this limitation due to its exceptionally\r\nefficient light coupling, reduced scattering, high signal-to-noise ratio and directional\r\nexcitation/emission. As a result, a fluorescence enhancement of P-GRAT is 100X or higher\r\ncompared to a glass substrates or polyurethane well plates. Such enhancements translate to ultrasensitive\r\ndetection and early diagnosis. Commercial immunoassays require hours to days to\r\nachieve pg/ml sensitivity. In comparison, P-GRAT can detect pg/mL range concentrations in less\r\nthan three hours. P-GRAT utilizes a simplified design to exclude expensive optics like laser\r\nsources, high-magnification objective lenses and filter cubes. The use of 3-D printed parts to\r\nfabricate the system and use a smartphone as the detector further reduces the cost. We intend to\r\ndevelop and commercialize a noninvasive, ultra-sensitive (fg/ml) molecular detection system for\r\nTuberculosis (TB). TB specific biomarkers Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) and Interferon gamma\r\n(IFN-g) will be detected in urine and saliva. P-GRAT is a platform technology and can easily be\r\nadapted for the ultra-sensitive detection and diagnosis of other diseases, such as Zika, Ebola,\r\nHIV and Cancer.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
