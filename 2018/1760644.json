 "awd_abstract_narration": "Natural disasters often force immediate and large-scale displacement of individuals from their homes and communities. These events result in more than just the loss of physical property, as community and neighborhood attributes encompass many different aspects of an individual's social relationships and the cultural institutions. Moving to a new community changes these attributes and will affect an individual's political attitudes and behaviors. This research is therefore able to address not just the immediate policy implications of such displacements but also a classic and important question in social science: how does local context affects political opinions and behaviors? The ongoing post-Harvey migration provides a unique opportunity to examine the effect of social contact and political context in a case where these encounters could not have otherwise been anticipated by the individuals affected. This project will examine the political consequences of Hurricane Harvey by studying post-Harvey migration patterns as an unexpected or exogenous shock. The exogenous shock will allow an understanding of (1) variations in the decision of displaced individuals to move to different areas and how this affects their associated experiences once they move, and (2) how people's political attitudes and behaviors change in response to rapid demographic shifts in their communities. \r\n\r\nThis research holds great significance because geographic residence is rarely if ever randomly assigned, which makes it difficult to establish whether observed correlations are the result of contextual effects or individuals' self-selection into particular ideological and social communities. Similarly, social contact may have a positive effect because those individuals willing to engage across social barriers are also the individuals who are more likely to change their minds on political issues. This research project teases apart these potentially confounding variables to truly understand their independent effects. To study these relationships, publicly available data from Twitter and the Texas voter registration file will be used. The ongoing post-Harvey migration provides a unique opportunity to examine the effect of social contact and political context in a case where these encounters could not have otherwise been anticipated. This work will build on results on the political attitudes of displaced individuals after Hurricane Katrina. As a result of New Orleans? unique racial geography, Katrina evacuees were more likely to be people of color and of lower socioeconomic status. The 2017 flooding in the greater Houston area, however, affected both rich and poor communities alike, as well as majority white and majority-minority communities. Examining the impact of these evacuees on the communities to which they relocate allows estimations of the effects of evacuee proximity separately from those of changes in racial demographics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Drawing on prior work linking victimization to political participation, we posit that following exposure to a climate disaster, the general population will become mobilized while underprivileged segments will exhibit the opposite pattern. To examine the impact of exposure to climate disasters on political participation, we use the case of Hurricane Harvey, which was the costliest environmental disaster in U.S. history, and look at how exposure impacted voter turnout in the Greater Houston Area. The event, which brought unprecedented levels of flooding, property damage, and displacement to the greater Houston area in late summer 2017, allows us to study pre- and post disaster behaviors of affected individuals. Using a difference-in-difference design with data from voter files and satellite flood maps, we show that the Harvey floods changed political participation patterns in Houston. Whereas exposure to flooding mobilized most segments of the population, leading to increasing likelihood of voting, individuals from poorer neighborhoods instead became less likely to vote.
