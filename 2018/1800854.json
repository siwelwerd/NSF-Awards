 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities-Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) Research Initiation Awards (RIAs) provide support to STEM faculty at HBCUs to pursue research at their home institution, at an NSF-funded Center, at a research intensive institution or at a national laboratory. The RIA projects are expected to help further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, to improve research and teaching at their home institution, and to involve undergraduate students in research experiences. With support from the National Science Foundation, an electrochemistry research program will be established at Albany State University (ASU) where teaching and research in this field are scant. Additionally, critical issues in sustainable energy research will be integrated into undergraduate education at this predominantly African American teaching institution, which serves mainly minority, underserved students. This program will link STEM education and research by integrating fundamental principles of electrochemistry with hands-on experience in renewable energy, to produce better learning outcomes and ensure success in both college and the job market for ASU graduates. \r\n\r\nThe long term goal of this project is to address issues related to renewable energy and its safe and sustainable conversion and storage in batteries for use in appropriate devices. The researchers hypothesize that electrolytes that can be used in non-polar solvents could expand the ability to test other redox-active materials, which may improve the performance of Organic Radical Batteries (ORBs) and Organic Redox Flow Batteries (ORFBs). ORBs and ORFBs offer the possibility of manufacturing lightweight and flexible devices with comparable performance but better safety than lithium-based batteries and for which increasing demands exist already. A series of weakly coordinating anions (WCAs) and cations (WCCs) featuring polysubstituted tetraarylphosphonium/tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate salts will be synthesized as novel electrolytes to enable electrochemistry in low-polarity media. Electrochemical measurement will then be conducted in non-polar solvents with electrolytes designed to be soluble in the solvents, having increased ion mobility and, therefore, improved relative conductivities. Pulse radiolysis experiments including time-resolved mid-infrared studies will be employed to determine redox potentials of redox-active molecules in non-polar solvents and, possibly to measure redox potentials in an electrolyte-free environment for the first time. Redox potential determinations in non-polar environments can be applied to a wider range of fields in science and engineering, including organic synthesis, petroleum handling in pipelines, energy, and biology. The energy community will benefit from the comprehensive results of this project as newly designed electrolytes and superior measurement of redox potentials will lead to a better understanding of energy storage by electron transfer, especially as ORBs and ORFBs. This project will be conducted in collaboration with the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and BNL's Laser Electron Accelerator Facility (LEAF).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Batteries, such as the ubiquitous Lithium-ion battery (LIB), are part of electrochemical energy storage (EES) systems that are necessary for achieving the full potential of integrating solar and wind power as part of the electric power grid. The development of novel systems capable of storing -and releasing when needed- the excess energy for immediate use offers promises of much improved energy density needed to power everything from high-mileage electric vehicles (EVs) to energy-hungry homes and businesses while also electrifying, and bringing development to large parts of the world at low cost. Battery technology is one of the important components in renewable energy to store produced energy. The performance of LIB is contingent to the electrolytes used. The electrolyte frequently used in LIB is carcinogenic and lithium is highly explosive with moisture. In order to address this pressing issue of battery safety, non-aqueous electrolytes are considered. Developments of novel electrolytes have impacts on many areas of sciences and technologies. We hypothesized that electrolytes that can be used in non-polar solvents could expand our ability to test other redox-active materials, which may improve the performance of other batteries or EES such as Organic Redox Flow Batteries (ORFBs). These offer the possibility of manufacturing lightweight and flexible devices with comparable performance but better safety than lithium-based batteries and, for which, increasing demands exist already. We planned to test this proposition by executing the following: 1) A series of substituted tetraarylphosphonium/tetrakis(pentafluoroaryl)borate (TAP<sup>R</sup>/TFAB where R is the substituent) salts was synthesized as novel electrolytes to enable electrochemistry in low-polarity media. 2) Electrochemical measurements were conducted in low-polarity solvents with electrolytes designed to be soluble, having increased ion mobility and improved limiting conductivities therein. The chemical push-pull between cation and anion afforded one highly conducting ion-pair in low-polarity solvents such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) and dichloromethane (DCM). This project led to the synthesis and characterization by X-ray single crystal structure (see image) of a novel TAP<sup>R</sup>/TFAB salt, the first of a new and versatile generation of supporting electrolytes which expands anodic applications by providing a dramatically different medium in which to generate positively charged electrolysis products The limiting conductivity value of the salt, namely tetra-<em>p</em>-methoxy-phenylphosphonium - tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate or TAP<sup>R</sup>/TFAB (R = <em>p</em>-OCH<sub>3</sub>) was found to be in the range of the conductivity of lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF<sub>6</sub>), currently the electrolyte of choice in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). This salt, and others being developed in our laboratory can potentially improve the efficiency and stability of batteries over the existing and commonly used electrolytes by optimizing conductivity tailored to the redox active molecules. Lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF<sub>6</sub>) is unstable with high voltage electrodes that are needed in order to achieve greater energy density. In contrast, the TAP<sup>R</sup>/TFAB (R = <em>p</em>-OCH<sub>3</sub>) salt proposed herein is stable, and has a good solubility profile in low-polarity solvents given its relatively great size. There?s already an increase in use of grid-independent, portable electrical devices that are slim, with tunable potentials such as a battery-on-the package that would be easy and ?green? to manufacture and to process, being made of resource-abundant organic material and environmentally friendly to dispose of. This novel TAP<sup>R</sup>/TFAB salt, in particular, constitutes a low-cost supporting electrolyte with improved performance that?s capable of bringing non-aqueous energy storage devices such as ORFBs to compete with existing technologies.
