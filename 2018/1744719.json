 "awd_abstract_narration": "The transit time of groundwater from recharge to discharge into streams is an important control on how quickly contaminants are flushed out of aquifers and into streams. Field studies and groundwater models both indicate that groundwater with a range  of transit times contributes to streamflow at any given time. However, field studies suggest the relative contribution of young groundwater (i.e., groundwater with short transit times) to streams is substantially less than calculated in modeling studies. This discrepancy in the groundwater transit time distribution (TTD) leads to a very different understanding of streamflow sources, fundamentally different predictions of the future impact of groundwater discharge on stream water quality, and potentially different perspectives on the design and assessment of efforts to manage non-point-source contamination in aquifers. This project will conduct field measurements and groundwater modeling to investigate differences in groundwater TTDs, and to determine and understand the processes that drive TTD at a range of spatial scales. Results of the project will assist water resources managers, regulators, and consultants to better understand and manage both water quantity and quality. Information will be disseminated through Cooperative Extension programs.\r\n\r\nThe overall goals of this project are to (1) evaluate why there is a discrepancy between TTDs derived from groundwater measurements (field sampling of age-dating tracers) and groundwater models, (2) investigate how these processes may be better understood by using both field measurements and models in nested watersheds at a range of scales (14-3900 km2 in this project) and (3) determine the processes that control the shape of the groundwater TTDs,. This project will be conducted in a watershed overlying the High Plains aquifer in the Nebraska Sandhills, where groundwater accounts for approximately 90% of the annual stream discharge. The TTDs will be determined using age-dating tracers for both young and old groundwater (3H/3He, SF6, 14C, 4He). Groundwater age information will be coupled with discharge measurements in streams and groundwater discharge measurement from tube seepage meters in streambeds. The tracer-based TTDs will be compared to groundwater TTDs derived from particle tracking simulations in a numerical groundwater model (MODFLOW), at both the reach and watershed scale. The model will be used as a tool to investigate differences that arise between tracer- and model-based TTDs. For example, the project will investigate the variation in groundwater recharge relative to the stream channel, and if a higher resolution and more accurate representation of recharge in the model leads to better agreement between field- and model-based TTDs. The model will also be re-calibrated using groundwater age data to evaluate how TTDs compare to field-based estimates after refinement and recalibration.  Information will be disseminated through Cooperative Extension programs, including interactive online training materials at www.nebraskawatershedscience.org.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Transit time can be viewed as the age of the groundwater coming out of the aquifer. Groundwater within an aquifer always has a range or \"distribution\" of travel times because groundwater following shorter shallower paths through the aquifer arrives at streams after shorter transit times compared to groundwater following longer deeper paths. Transit time distributions are a vital piece of information because they reveal how quickly dissolved chemicals move through an aquifer and come out into streams, where the chemicals can change the quality of stream water, downstream reservoirs, and estuaries.</p>\n<p>Transit times can be estimated with chemical tracers measured in groundwater and with computer models of groundwater flow. Historically, there have been discrepancies between transit time findings from field-based tracer methods and computer models. Our project in the Nebraska Sand Hills showed that tracers and computer models can give similar transit time results when applied carefully at the same site. Groundwater discharge from vegetated sand dunes and the High Plains Aquifer reaches streams after relatively short transit times (mostly less than 60 years) in the western part of the Upper Middle Loup River watershed. To the east, at our furthest downstream sampling site, the High Plains Aquifer discharges much older groundwater to the Middle Loup River. Average groundwater transit times were about 5,000 years based on field tracers and 1,500 years based on model estimates. Field-based tracers and computer models were in general agreement for these sites, showing that young groundwater discharge is significant in the upstream portion of the watershed and ancient groundwater discharge is significant in the downstream portion of the study area. At an intermediate sampling site, groundwater discharge to the stream is old (on average, 1,700 years, based on tracers) but seeps and springs along the streambank contribute some young groundwater as well. At this site, there were greater differences between the range of transit times derived from the computer model (0-300 years) and field-based tracers (4 &ndash; 2,700 years).</p>\n<p>Based on this project, we now understand that some streams overlying the High Plains Aquifer are fed by groundwater with a wide range of ages. Young groundwater discharge is substantial at the upstream end of the study area, but ancient groundwater is also an important contributor to today&rsquo;s river flow, and an important part of the modern hydrologic cycle in Nebraska. These results are strongly supported by both field tracer methods and computer models of groundwater flow. Differences between the field and modeling methods at an intermediate sampling site highlight a need for continued model refinement and method improvement for sampling and incorporating near-stream groundwater discharge (such as seeps or springs) into field estimates and models of groundwater transit times.</p>\n<p>An overview of project outcomes can be found in a story map entitled &ldquo;Groundwater and Sandhills Streams&rdquo; hosted at <a href=\"https://nebraskawaves.org/\">https://NebraskaWAVES.org</a>.
