 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve predictivity in preclinical pharmaceutical research and development to lower drug development costs and to improve drug approval rates. Recent cost estimates for developing a prescription drug is $2.6 billion over the 10-year development period, and the annual drug approval rate is as low as 20-30 drugs, while hundreds of drugs candidates fail each year. The failure rates of a large percentage of drug candidates at the clinical trial increase the overall costs of approved drugs. Replacing simplistic 2D cell culture models and animal models with human organ-on-a-chip (OoC) technologies will provide human-specific solutions for drug development. These tests can provide stronger predictions and confidence to advance the right drug candidates to clinical trials and also identify problem candidates early to save time and money associated with progressing the wrong compounds through expensive clinical trials.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project provides an integrative solution to the pharmaceutical industry for preclinical drug testing using Organ-on-a-Chip (OoC) technologies with companion computational tools. OoC technologies, which are micro-engineered systems combining living 3D human cells, fluidic channels, and biomaterials, emulate biological and physiological processes of the real organ in vitro. The need for more physiologically relevant in vitro systems for preclinical efficacy and toxicity testing has led to a major effort to develop OoC technologies. OoC approaches have been recognized as emerging technologies with potential to revolutionize medical research and drug discovery. However, OoC technologies require specialized operational infrastructure including instrumentation and an experienced tissue engineering team not common in industry. By providing a specialized service model, the benefits of human-relevant OoCs become accessible by bridging the gap between pharmaceutical companies, OoC companies, and academia.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe major goal of this NSF I-Corps project was to participate in immersive, hands-on learning about the innovation process; specifically, to learn about what is needed to translate academic knowledge into products and processes that can be put into practical use to benefit society.  This project involved a seven-week educational program as well as extensive engagement with industry, potential customers, users and other stakeholders. This I-Corps project explored the commercialization potential of an emerging technology that provides the real-world context for learning.  The technology concerns using human Organ-on-Chip (OoC) hardware to generate data in a pharmaceutical development process, and then use algorithms and computational biology tools to translate the in vitro OoC data into in vivo predictions of drug performance in humans.\n\nThe team conducted an intensive customer discovery and interview process, completing more than 150 interviews with potential customers, users, and stakeholders, and traveled over 20,000 miles, took 45 Uber rides, and took over 400 pages of handwritten notes to complete these interviews.  Significant results included identification of customer segments, roles of individuals in the decision-making process, and pivoting to accelerate adoption in light of current regulatory requirements.\n\nThe team explored safety testing for the government, as well as the chemical, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries.  We discovered that the chemical and cosmetic opportunities are smaller and not good beachhead opportunities for the capabilities and costs of our platform. Within the biopharma testing space, we explored the stages from discovery, to preclinical development, and to clinical development.\n\nOur interviews and market research helped us to better understand the activities, budgets, and measures of success for different stages of drug development.  Based on these interviews, there does exist a need in the late discovery, pre-clinical stage for better data.  Currently used testing models (either cell-based tests or animal-based tests) do not provide the quality of data that these scientists are looking for.  Potential customers expressed this repeatedly using the word ?confidence?.  They are looking for confidence to move a drug candidate to the next stage of the development process, to conduct further study, or to abandon that compound.\n\nIn addition to determining that there is a need and a budget, we also tested our hypothesis that pharma clients would outsource such testing to a specialty CRO.  We received confirmation both on a macro level and from the individuals we spoke with.  Outsourcing is a significant and growing trend in drug development.\n\nThis project greatly impacted our team?s thinking about commercialization and customer discovery.  The data we collected during our interviews and the way we framed the market, from opportunities and challenges, to ?knowns? and ?not-yet-knowns?, had a significant positive impact on our ability to secure seed funding.  Because we conducted 150 interviews, we had solid insights into our customer segments that our investors were able to affirm during their diligence process.  We not only had relationships with key individuals in our target markets, we secured the funding and established credibility with our investors. \n\nSince the completion of this I-Corps project, a company was formed and has closed a seed financing, spun the lab and employees out from MIT, and secured a 2-year NIH grant.  We continue to use the customer discovery framework and techniques learned during I-Corps to refine our hypotheses and strengthen our business plan. \n\nIn addition to incorporating the themes of I-Corps into future mentoring and teaching opportunities, the team are hopeful that the commercial success of this business can contribute to better, faster, and cheaper drug development that will ultimately have a positive impact on the health care system and patients.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/03/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Roman Lubynsky"
