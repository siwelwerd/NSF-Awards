 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neurons, the basic cells of nerves, are one of the most difficult to regenerate after disease or injury. If advances are going to be made in engineering systems that support nerve regrowth and regeneration, it is imperative that we develop a full understanding of how these cells respond to their biomechanical environment. This study will investigate how changes in the extracellular mechanical environment affects the development of neurons and the branching of dendrite -- the structure that receives signals from other nerve cells. Knowledge gained from this project will help to develop strategies that may eventually improve treatments for degenerative neural diseases or following nerve injury due to trauma. The research team will integrate students at all levels, from graduate school through high school, as well as teachers into the project. In addition, outreach will involve the development of hands-on projects and demonstrations that can introduce the public to concepts of neuroscience, imaging, and biomechanics. \r\n\r\nTwo hypotheses are being investigated related to neuron growth and development within this project. The first is that local structural changes associated with applied cell forces act to transduce extracellular mechanical cues to the cytoskeleton. The second is that local changes in cellular tension in response to changes in the extracellular mechanical microenvironment act to transduce extracellular mechanical cues to the cytoskeleton. The research team will make use of a vinculin force sensor for which the tension can be measured using Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET). This mechanical measurement will be combined with fluorescence imaging of the cytoskeletal dynamics. Thus, the specific aims of this project are to: 1) demonstrate that vinculin expression changes as a function of substrate stiffness and tension; 2) demonstrate that vinculin tension is altered in response to changes in substrate stiffness and investigate the role of integrin, cadherin, and neurotransmitter receptors in mediating this response; and 3) investigate the relationship between vinculin tension, microtubule assembly, and the resulting dendritic branching.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This lack of a well-defined pattern of vinculin expression has prevented us from arriving at clear conclusions regarding the precise function of vinculin in neuronal dendrites and its response to mechanical cues. However, consistent with this, our data show that vinculin is under low tension at the growth cones of cortical neurons, suggesting that neurons, unlike epithelial cells, do not form stable adhesions when cultured on two-dimensional glass substrates.

While this and other hypotheses generated by this project remain to be fully investigated, our data raise new questions about the function of vinculin in developing neurons.\n\nBroader impacts:\n\n\n\nThis is the first study investigating VinTS in neurons and provides a basis for future work involving the use of this molecular tension sensor in neuronal cells. Advancements in methods to measure FRET efficiency include simplification of instrument calibration techniques. The validity of a simple measurement of phase lifetime, achieved with a cost-effective confocal frequency-domain fluorescence lifetime microscope, was demonstrated to quantify accurately FRET efficiency in three-dimensional tissue models. Finally, in a new research direction initiated by this project, instrumentation is being developed with the aim of combining fluorescence microscopy of tension sensors with optical tweezers to facilitate the study of mechanobiology.
