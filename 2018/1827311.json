X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is an analytical technique that produces a chemical analysis of solid materials. The new XRF will be used to conduct basic geological and chemistry research and undergraduate student training in classes and projects in these subject areas. Suitably trained undergraduates at institutions with XRF instruments can perform accurate and precise chemical analyses of rocks and other solid materials. Undergraduate classes in geology, inorganic chemistry, materials science, and undergraduate research projects, guided by a faculty member, will benefit from incorporating the new XRF in the curriculum.\r\n\r\nThis grant supports the acquisition of a new, state-of-the-art X-ray fluorescence (XRF) vacuum spectrometer at Franklin & Marshall College. XRF instruments measure the major and trace element geochemistry of solid materials, including rocks, to provide the basis for understanding provenance, processes of formation in geological applications and material composition and purity in material science and chemistry applications. The new XRF instrument contains a 4 kW rhodium x-ray tube, which has been designed to conquer the sublimation of tungsten from the cathode to the region around the radiation exit window, thus providing virtually constant output over the entire tube life, coupled with a modern software package that is interfaced with all new electrical XRF components. Continued collaborative work with NASA, Canadian Space Agency, University of Alberta, Kansas State University, University of Winnipeg, University of Addis Ababa and others, will benefit from the much-improved data quality provided by this instrument. In addition to the research applications, the new XRF will be used as a teaching tool in undergraduate classes in geology and chemistry. Geology Department seniors will have access to the instrument for their senior theses on rock samples they collect during their summer field work between junior and senior year. In addition, students from other classes in geology and chemistry will complete independent research projects utilizing the XRF instrument.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

A mechanism to have the tungsten sublimate (a gas that forms a solid upon cooling never going through a liquid state) to a location in the tube other than the exit port for all radiation, means that the output radiation stays constant over the life of the tube; no more steadily declining radiation intensity as a function of time.
