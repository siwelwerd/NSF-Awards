 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support 14 U.S.-based graduate students to attend and participate in the 44th International Conference on Very Large Databases (VLDB 2018) to be held in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil from August 27-31, 2018 (http://vldb2018.lncc.br/). The International Conference on Very Large Databases (VLDB) is a premier international annual technical event that brings together technical research papers, tutorials, and workshops centered on various aspects of database research and practice. VLDB series provides researchers and practitioners from academia, industry and government agencies with an excellent opportunity to share their research and experiences on all aspects of data management and analyses at scale. VLDB has a goal to enable the next generation of students and researchers to identify scientific foundations for building large-scale database management systems that can work ever more effectively. The aims of the conference are multi-fold: (1) to provide an international forum for sharing research results related to the investigation of major challenges in next-generation database research; (2) to stimulate interactive discussions on research in the database area through panels, posters, tutorials, student scholar roundtables, etc.; and (3) to motivate and engage future generations of researchers via the many conference and workshop presentations, interactive poster sessions, and panel and breakout sessions. The conference will contribute directly to training the next generation of scientists who are both consumers and developers of technology in database management system design and implementation. Efforts will be made to engage a diverse body of students in order to broaden the participation of researchers from underrepresented groups. The student support will have direct impact in creating a highly-qualified workforce who can take on the emerging data science challenges of the future. \r\n\r\nThe rising use of cloud computing, the ability for users to create very large datasets, and the emerging field of data science have placed database research at the forefront of Computer Science. Database research is an integral component of a new approach to data-driven science and technology that stands to revolutionize almost all aspects of society by leading to new scientific discoveries and game-changing improvements to engineered systems that we use in our daily lives. Database research profoundly influences domains that include health sciences, the emerging field of IoT, service-oriented computing, real-time business analytics, and social computing. The VLDB 2018 Proceedings are will be broadly accessible at The Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment (http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
