 "awd_abstract_narration": "The IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT) is the premier international conference in information theory, the scientific discipline that studies the mathematical foundations of reliable communications, whether by telephony, television, wireless or optical systems, and the fundamental limits of data storage, such as CDs, DVDs, flash drives, or other semiconductor media. The symposium series has run since 1954, originally every two years, and yearly since 2000. This project funds the participation of US-based students in this event. Participation at this conference will enhance the research experiences for students and provide increased opportunities for new collaborations.\r\n\r\nStudents form an integral part of the Information Theory community, and the IEEE ISIT Conference continues to promote student participation through the ISIT Jack Kiel Wolf Best Student Paper Award, the creation of the ISIT tutorial series, and the Information Theory Society Student Committee. Students comprise about one-third of the participants at ISIT, and the travel funds offered through this award will support the attendance at the 2019 ISIT by students enrolled in a graduate or undergraduate program in the United States and whose papers have been accepted for presentation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
