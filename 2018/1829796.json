 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ocean has absorbed about a third of the fossil fuel carbon dioxide (CO2) that humans have emitted, slowing the accumulation of CO2 and its associated trapping of thermal energy in the atmosphere.  The research aims to improve our understanding of how this ocean uptake of CO2 will change when ocean circulation responds to continuing changes in climate.  Researchers will use observations of the isotopic ratio of carbon (13C/12C) of seawater and atmospheric samples, as a high signal/noise method to determine air-sea transfer rates and storage in the ocean interior of fossil-fuel CO2.  Also, a state-of the art ocean C-cycling model will be used to validate the model's air-sea exchange rates and upper ocean storage of fossil-fuel CO2.  The additional information provided by 13CO2 will establish important benchmarks on ocean-atmosphere and biosphere-atmosphere C exchanges in models used for forecasting future changes in climate.  Results would be incorporated into an outreach program through the University of Washington's Program on Climate Change to educate the public on the impact of human activity and climate on the ocean, atmosphere, and earth.  One postdoc would be supported and trained as part of this project.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo better understand the processes that control the evolution of the anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) signal in the ocean, we will utilize two characteristics of dissolved inorganic 13Carbon (DIC13) that distinguish it from DIC.  First, the 10x longer air-sea equilibration time for DIC13 yields a well-constrained air-sea 13CO2 flux in all basins that is resolvable on decadal time scales.  Second, the anthropogenic DIC13 accumulation in the ocean is quantifiable to better signal to noise than anthropogenic DIC itself. The availability of ocean del13C and DIC data from WOCE, CLIVAR and GO-SHIP provide the opportunity to quantify, based on observations alone, the evolution and transports of the anthropogenic DIC and DIC13 signal on regional and global scales in the ocean.  Implementation of the anthropogenic DIC and DIC13 perturbations into an ocean model, driven by interannually varying winds, will yield simulations of the DIC and DIC13 evolution that we will compare to observations, helping to identify likely processes causing interdecadal shifts in the rate of this evolution.  The combination of observations and model analysis tracking the decadal DIC13 and DIC perturbations are designed to improve our insight into the ocean's important role in modulating climate by taking up and storing anthropogenic CO2.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAbstract\n\nThe availability of ocean &delta;13C and DIC data from WOCE, CLIVAR and GO-SHIP provide the opportunity to quantify, directly from observations, the evolution of the anthropogenic DIC and DIC13 signal on regional and global scales in the ocean.  At the same time, implementation of the anthropogenic DIC and DIC13 perturbations into an ocean model, driven by interannually varying winds, yields simulations of the DIC and DIC13 evolution that can be compared with observations to help identify likely processes that cause interdecadal shifts in the rate of this evolution.  The combination of observational and model analysis tracking the anthropogenic DIC13 and DIC perturbations will improve our insight into the ocean?s important role in modulating specifically by establishing basin-wide budgets of ocean uptake and storage of anthropogenic CO2.\n\n \n\nOutcomes\n\nThis grant funded a postdoctoral researcher Mariona Claret's training in modeling and interpretation of 13C in the ocean.  An efficient gas-exchange and Iron, Light, and Nutrient controlled oceanic C-cycling scheme was adapted to include 13C and incorporated into the ocean component of an Earth System Model, ESM2M.  The model (BLING-13C) was driven to steady state followed by the anthropogenic 13C and CO2 perturbations.  The air-sea CO2 and 13C flux fields from this model were used in an atmosphere-terrestrial biosphere inversion to quantify spatial patterns and the seasonal cycle in terrestrial carbon uptake [Joyce et al., 2021].\n\nDr. Claret found that BLING-13C?s mean 13C is sensitive to model resolution and is critically sensitive to the rate and schematics of North Atlantic Deep and Antarctic Bottom Water formation. \n\nDr. Claret found that meridional and inter-basin trends in 13C in the ocean can be used to constrain the wind-speed dependence of air-sea exchange, as has been attempted before with 14C.  A companion manuscript to Claret et al. (2021) (manuscript in preparation) demonstrates improved model fidelity to oceanic 13C changes in response to the anthropogenic perturbation in comparison with prior MOM-based 13C models. \n\nWe used BLING_13C to test basin-scale anthropogenic 13C-budgets from the Pacific and North Atlantic subsampling the model output in the same (few) locations that are available in the data and found the approach to be accurate despite limited observations.  Dr. Claret has constructed basin-wide budgets of the air-sea d13C uptake and accumulation of the d13C perturbation for the South Atlantic and Indian ocean basins based on CLIVAR and GOSHIP 13C comparisons with the WOCE 13C dataset.  These efforts are detailed in the manuscript in preparation for Global Biogeochemical Cycles by Claret et al. \n\nGO-SHIP re-occupations of CLIVAR and WOCE (including TTO and GEOSECS, where appropriate) hydrographic sections that include the d13C tracer in the North Atlantic, South Atlantic, South Indian, and South Pacific Oceans indicate that ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 has been slowing in these regions.  In addition, while the air sea disequilibrium increased (became more negative) during the 1990s to 2005, the air-sea disequilibrium stopped growing during the CLIVAR (2005) to GO-SHIP era (~ 2015).  Both of these observations imply either a slowdown in upper ocean overturning or in air-sea gas exchange. \n\nThe model was used to evaluate the extent to which ocean d13C observations may be aliased by variability in the ocean.  A model variant driven by the Common Ocean Reference Experiments (CORE-2 IAF) interannual wind and buoyancy forcing simulation reveals that the d13C changes in the model, and likely the ocean, are very sensitive to the subtle changes in circulation.   The model?s inter-decadal trends in sea surface d13C indicate, for example, that the decade long d13C time series collected in the Drake Passage could be strongly aliased by inter-decadal trends in this location.  The Drake Passage and Hawaii time series measurements, partially supported by this grant, and the decadal trends in the oceanic 13C Suess effect from CLIVAR and GOSHIP, are to be included in a synthesis manuscript by the original PIs on this grant, Rolf Sonnerup and Paul Quay.\n\n \n\nPapers \n\nCarter, B.
