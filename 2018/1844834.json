 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be found in civil engineering infrastructure development projects where construction is undertaken in areas affected by expansive soils, i.e. soils that shrink and swell in response to changes soil moisture level.  Such shrink/swell activity in foundation soils is a leading cause of structural damage to roadways and other infrastructure systems built upon them. In the United States Texas, Colorado, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota are among the states with major problems due to presence of expansive soil. Expansive soils have reportedly caused problems in other parts of the world as well. Traditionally, lime and Portland cement have been used to stabilize such expansive soils. However, these traditional stabilizers cannot be used in all soil conditions. In such situations, the only viable solution is to remove the native soil and replace it with better quality materials. The proposed I-Corps technology involves a sustainable soil stabilizer that overcomes many of the limitations found in the traditional stabilizers.  It provides a more economical alternative in projects where remove-and-replace strategy is currently used.  \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project explores opportunities for commercialization of a novel soil stabilizer which uses an inorganic compound known as geopolymer as the key ingredient. Geopolymers are synthesized using abundantly available natural materials and/or industrial by-products such as fly ash and ground blast furnace slag. Unlike traditional soil stabilizers (viz. hydrated lime and Portland cement) which require vast amounts of energy during production, geopolymers are synthesized at or near ambient temperatures. Accordingly, the new stabilizer represents a more sustainable alternative to traditional soil stabilizers.  Extensive laboratory testing and microstructural studies conducted during the product development phase demonstrate that the new stabilizer can achieve more than 90% reduction in shrink/swell potential.  The experimental data also confirm that the geopolymer-based stabilizer can be used effectively to overcome a number of significant limitations that exist in the traditional stabilizers, such as inability to treat sulfate-bearing soils. Traditional lime stabilization requires a waiting period of 4-7 days for the stabilizing reactions to take place; this causes interruption in work flow and delay in construction.  In such situations, the new stabilizer can be used to treat the native soil and improve its engineering properties and thus eliminate need for expensive remove-and-replace operations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis NSF I-Corps project was undertaken with the primary goal of exploring opportunities for commercialization of a new soil stabilizer, described as gypsum modified geopolymer.  This new soil stabilizer was developed by our research team through previous study for the treatment of sulfate-rich clay soils with high shrink-swell potential.  Conventionally, the treatment of expansive clay soils is achieved through application of Ca-based soil stabilizers.  However, when sulfate minerals are present in the soil, treatment using Ca-based chemicals creates undesirable sulfate-induced heaving due to formation of highly expansive ettringite minerals.  Results obtained from comprehensive laboratory testing completed by this research team demonstrated that gypsum modified geopolymer can overcome this serious limitation found in traditional soil stabilizing agents.\n\nAs a part of this project, the members of this I-Corps project team completed more than 100 customer interviews. Customers included representatives from state agencies, consultants and contractors who deal with construction projects involving soil stabilization. The initial hypothesis used in the customer discovery process was that Departments of Transportation (DOTs) would be the primary customer segment. It was anticipated that, as the DOTs adopt the new technology, implement it and develop specifications, the secondary customers such as consulting companies and contractors will follow suit. To validate this hypothesis, the I-Corps team conducted interviews with 27 key decision makers in Texas and California DOTs and 52 engineering professionals in 26 consulting companies. These interviews helped in developing an understanding of the size of the total serviceable market and customer segments.\n\nThe key findings from the customer discovery process described above are summarized below:\n\n(a)   There was general agreement among various customer segments interviewed that sulfate-heaving tends to have disastrous consequences whenever it occurs.  However, sulfate concentrations in soil are highly variable and therefore, it is difficult to identify locations where sulfate minerals are present in large enough concentrations to cause sulfate-heaving.  As a result, identifying stabilization projects where gypsum modified geopolymer would be a better alternative to Ca-based stabilizers can be difficult.\n\n(b)   Many customers were of the view that the effectiveness of the new stabilizer would have been more convincing if results were available from a couple of large-scale pilot projects to demonstrate that laboratory conditions could be replicated in the field.  One primary concern was whether mixing between the treated clay and the gypsum modified geopolymer slurry could be achieved to sufficiently uniform levels.\n\n(c)   The need for reconfiguration of field equipment for on-site preparation of the new stabilizer was cited by some customers as a potential drawback of the new technology.  This may potentially offset some of the competitive advantage that gypsum modified geopolymer will have over conventional strategies for dealing with stabilization of sulfate bearing soils such as (i) removing and replacing, and (ii) double liming with delay time for mellowing.\n\n(d)   The overall consensus was that some supporting evidence from field trials were necessary before the new technology can be considered ready for field implementation.  One customer group, design-build contractors, showed interest in undertaking such effort in partnership with the I-Corps team.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/07/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Priyantha W Jayawickrama"
