 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Semiconductor materials have formed the foundation of microelectronic devices that drive a wide range of technologies, including information technology, energy applications and national security.  In an effort to improve energy efficiency and performance of existing microelectronics, semiconductors with strong magnetic responses, or ferromagnetic semiconductors, have been recognized as a possible alternative to current non-magnetic semiconductors. This project addresses the challenge of identifying and developing a new class of ferromagnetic semiconductors to enable improvements in energy efficiency and performance. One class of promising ferromagnetic semiconductors is based on a class of oxide thin films based on Sn, known as perovskite stannates. The research involves the design, synthesis, and characterization of stannate thin films with strong magnetic response. Additional research activities include the training of undergraduate and graduate researchers, including underrepresented minorities, who are likely to find future employment in the information technology sector. \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: This integrated research and education program is focused on the development of a new class of spin-polarized semiconductors in epitaxial stannate oxide thin films through incorporation of magnetic dopants. Research activities include unique approaches to magnetic doping, including incorporating concentrations of magnetic dopants beyond the solubility limits at thermal equilibrium and co-doping on both types of cation sites. This research is timely as it exploits the recent development of high mobility epitaxial stannate films and it may provide an avenue to a room temperature ferromagnetic semiconductor that could make spin-based semiconductor electronics a reality and may revolutionize the microelectronics industry. Education aspects of this project include the training of undergraduate and graduate students, and the development of an apprenticeship and modular materials physics curricular program for local high school students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

As the demands on current microelectronics for faster operation, smaller footprint and increased functionality continues, there is a need to develop new materials that provide new functionality. Materials with transparency, conductivity and magnetism would be a novel combination of functionalities. As a first step towards such multi-functionality, this project has sought to realize magnetism in the transparent semiconductor barium stannate BaSnO<sub>3</sub>. BaSnO<sub>3</sub> has already been identified as a complex oxide semiconductor material that can be modified into a transparent conductor. During the three-year project, magnetic dopants of Pr, Nd, Gd and Ru have been individually doped into BaSnO<sub>3</sub> thin films. The rare earth elements of Pr, Nd and Gd are substituted into the Ba site while the Ru is substituted into the Sn site. These modified BaSnO<sub>3</sub> thin films have excellent structural quality and exhibit a magnetic response that corresponds well to the presence of the magnetic elements. These films also show excellent transparency in the visible wavelengths. Together these results make these materials promising for a new kind of microelectronics. In terms of educational and training opportunities, this project has funded a full-time graduate student and provided the infrastructure for two high school internships during the three summers. High school interns participate in a program where we have a series of tutorials followed by hands-on activities learning about the magnetic thin film growth and characterization. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>@font-face \t{font-family:\"Cambria Math\"; \tpanose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:roman; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face \t{font-family:DengXian; \tpanose-1:2 1 6 0 3 1 1 1 1 1; \tmso-font-alt:&#31561;&#32447;; \tmso-font-charset:134; \tmso-generic-font-family:auto; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-1610612033 953122042 22 0 262159 0;}@font-face \t{font-family:Calibri; \tpanose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:swiss; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-536859905 -1073732485 9 0 511 0;}@font-face \t{font-family:\"\\@DengXian\"; \tpanose-1:2 1 6 0 3 1 1 1 1 1; \tmso-font-charset:134; \tmso-generic-font-family:auto; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-1610612033 953122042 22 0 262159 0;}p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal \t{mso-style-unhide:no; \tmso-style-qformat:yes; \tmso-style-parent:\"\"; \tmargin:0in; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:12.0pt; \tfont-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-font-family:DengXian; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}.MsoChpDefault \t{mso-style-type:export-only; \tmso-default-props:yes; \tfont-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-font-family:DengXian; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}div.WordSection1 \t{page:WordSection1;}</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/01/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Yuri&nbsp;Suzuki</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
