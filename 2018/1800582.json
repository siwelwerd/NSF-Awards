 "awd_abstract_narration": "A mesoscale convective system (MCS) is a collection of thunderstorms organized on a larger scale than the storms it contains, in which the individual thunderstorms act in concert to generate the atmospheric motion that organizes and sustains the system.  These large storm systems produce extreme weather including hail, floods, and tornados, but they also make an important contribution to water resources over the eastern two thirds of the continental US (CONUS) during the growing season.  This project seeks to understand MCS behavior in an aggregate sense, including the long-term contribution of MCS precipitation to the overall water balance of the CONUS and the importance of year-to-year variability in MCS activity for anomalously wet (flood) or dry (drought) conditions.  \r\n\r\nA key tool for conducting the research is the  Weather Services International (WSI) National Operational Weather radar (NOWrad) data set, a 20-year record (currently 1996-2015) created from the National Weather Service radar stations which provide continuous near-total coverage of the CONUS. A primary goal of the project is to develop and apply an automated procedure to detect and track MCSs in the radar data.  The algorithm identifies MCSs as contiguous or semi-contiguous features in radar maps over an area of at least 100km along the system's major axis exceeding a threshold reflectivity value.  MCS tracking is complicated by the the tendency of MCSs to split and merge as they propagate, and the algorithm incorporates a method for identifying mergers and splits. A further issue is that large regions of intense precipitation can occur in frontal cyclones and landfalling hurricanes, and a classification scheme is necessary to distinguish these regions from MCSs.  A machine learning technique to perform this classification is developed using expert judgement to train a random forest classifier (RFC) scheme. Further expert judgement is solicited through a survey which invites the research community to participate in the development and validation of the tracking and classification schemes.  The catalog of MCS events and their characteristics (intensity, duration, structure, etc) is then used to study MCS seasonality, interannual variability, and contribution to CONUS rainfall including floods and droughts.\r\n\r\nFurther work uses a global climate model (GFDL-CM3) in combination with a regional convection permitting model (WRF-ARW at 4km horizontal resolution) to simulate MCSs over the CONUS under present-day and projected future climate conditions.  The simulations are analyzed according to the tracking and classification schemes developed for the NOWrad data, and the model simulations allow examination of how MCS behavior depends on climatic factors such as tropospheric moisture, soil moisture, atmospheric stability, and large-scale atmospheric circulation.\r\n\r\nThe work has broader impacts due to the importance of MCS rainfall as a water resource for agriculture and the severe weather hazards related to MCS activity.  The algorithms and datasets produced for the project will be shared with researchers and operational climatologists and hydrologists through an online portal.  In addition, the project supports and trains a graduate student and provides summer  support for an undergraduate, thereby providing for the future scientific workforce in this area.",

This NSF award generated a novel, high-resolution, dynamically downscaled simulation dataset that helps inform regional and local stakeholders regarding potential impacts of climate change on extreme weather events. A high-resolution numerical weather prediction model configuration (horizontal grid spacing of 3.75 km; data output interval of 15-minutes) was used as a regional climate model for a domain covering the conterminous United States. Initial and lateral boundary data into the regional climate model originates from a global climate model simulation by NCAR&rsquo;s Community Earth System Model (CESM) that participated in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). Specifically, we used a version of these data that are regridded and bias corrected using 1981&ndash;2005 ERA-Interim reanalysis. To examine climate regimes, two 15-year downscaled simulation epochs were examined comprising of historical (HIST; 1990&ndash;2005) and future (FUTR; 2085&ndash;2100) time slices. The FUTR scenario was simulated using Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 to examine an agressive emissions scenario on the impact of mesoscale extreme weather. HIST simulations were able to admirably represent climatologies of temperature and precipiation dervied from a modern, state-of-the-art reanalysis system (ECMWF's ERA-5). FUTR scenario simulations indicatied regional spatial shifts in the climatologies of precipitation that may have significant impact on water resources, especially in the Southwest U.S. and the southern Great Plains. In addiiton to FUTR projections of temperature and precipitation, we have archived nearly two-dozen variables capable of explicitly or implicity resolving extreme mesoscale convective weather. Future publications from this award will focus on these exciting, novel results.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/31/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Vittorio&nbsp;A&nbsp;Gensini</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1800582/1800582_10516058_1630400889857_6--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1800582/1800582_10516058_1630400889857_6--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"city_deltas\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1800582/1800582_10516058_1630400889857_6--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"city_deltas\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Hydrologic year (1 October\ufffd30 September) cumulative precipitation accumulations for eight climatologically unique CONUS cities.
