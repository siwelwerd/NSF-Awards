 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be a reduction in food losses and waste.  Roughly one third of the food produced in the world gets lost or wasted.  A large portion of this waste is due to proper cold-chain infrastructure from farms to consumers.  Transport refrigeration is an expensive option that consumes large amounts of diesel fuel.  The transport industry can see significant cost savings by converting to energy-efficient refrigeration units that utilize waste heat rather than using dedicated diesel engines.  This could make refrigeration more accessible to farmers, retailers and food processors everywhere.  The project is has the potential significantly reduce food waste worldwide.\r\n\r\n This I-Corps project will explore the commercialization potential of a new material that can absorb up to 82% water by weight, nearly twice the amount of the previous best material.  This highly absorbent material also demonstrates a record cooling capacity per given volume.  These capabilities open up a new class of applications in transport refrigeration where equipment weight and size need to be minimized.  An adsorption refrigeration cycle operating with this material can efficiently harvest waste heat from a truck's engine to produce two times the cooling power of a conventional vapor compressor system without using additional diesel fuel.",

Low-cost air conditioners are inefficient and cost too much to run while high-efficiency ones are too expensive to buy.  Transaera?s technology will change this. Affordable and efficient air conditioning is possible with the help of recently discovered adsorbent materials called metal-organic frameworks (MOFs).  MOFs are highly porous materials that passively collect moisture from air thereby achieving the humidity targets with less energy.   Traditional air conditioners, in contrast, use an evaporator, or a cold coil to pull water out of the air through condensation. Keeping the coil cold enough to enable condensation requires a lot of energy.  Transaera's materials and heat exchanger designs can help air conditioners reduce their energy consumption by as much as 50% when compared to traditional air conditioners.\nBroader Impacts: \n\nAs the planet gets hotter, the number of air conditioners in operation worldwide is expected to grow by 3.5 billion units in the next 30 years. Without a significant improvement in cooling efficiency, this growth will overwhelm electricity grids and further deepen the climate crisis. Transaera is developing a new class of ultra-efficient air conditioners using a combination of novel materials and heat-exchanger designs that can achieve unprecedented system efficiencies.
