 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solar conversion of CO2 and water to useful chemicals and fuels can provide a pathway to a sustainable carbon cycle, while maintaining existing infrastructure in the chemical and transport industries. Efficient use of solar energy to break the stable CO2 bonds is the first step in this process and requires tailoring the photophysical properties of the catalysts used for that reaction. In this project, Profs. Gupta and Asthagiri of Ohio State University are working to understand the relationship between catalyst surface structure and solar energy transfer into the CO2 molecule. The goal is to understand the factors that promote this energy transfer and promote CO2 conversion. As part of this project, the PIs are training graduate students to combine experiment and theory to tackle important energy generation and conversion problems. In addition, the PIs are engaging students from the K-12 and undergraduate level as part of an outreach effort to diversify student participation in STEM careers. Graduate students, as part of Ohio State's TEK8 program, are developing modules to engage K-12 students interest in STEM careers. In addition, underrepresented undergraduate students are being recruited for summer research as part of Ohio State's Summer Research Opportunities Program. \r\n\r\n\r\nWith funding from the NSF Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Gupta and Asthagiri from The Ohio State University are developing a program that combines experiment and theory aimed to gain a fundamental understanding of the relationship between local surface structure of Cu oxides and the photoexcitation of CO2 molecules. Cu oxide thin films are grown in a controlled fashion in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) that allows for the introduction of various defects (e.g. vacancies, variation in Cu oxide film stoichiometry, and dopants). Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with local photoillumination provide direct images of the surface before and after illumination. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are assisting in interpreting both the images and spectroscopy from STM to link the relationship between the electronic states of the local Cu oxide site and the resulting CO2 photochemistry. In addition, DFT is being used to explore modifications to the Cu oxide films that enhance CO2 photoactivation; these predictions are being tested experimentally with the goal to establish a predictive model for optimal Cu oxide nanostructures for CO2 photoreduction. As part of this project, the PIs are actively engaged in the recruitment of underrepresented groups in graduate and undergraduate research and developing modules to foster the interest in STEM careers of K-12 students through Ohio State's TEK8 program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCopper oxide-based catalysts have shown the ability to selectively recycle carbon dioxide into useful fuels such as ethanol and methanol. Such catalysts could have a major impact on climate change with further improvements in efficiency and scaling. This NSF program was focused on a fundamental study of copper oxidation and carbon dioxide surface chemistry. Atomic scale theoretical models were developed and compared with atomic-scale microscopy imaging. Because copper oxidation is complex and not fully understood, our approach focused on oxidation of clean single crystal copper surfaces as a model system.  \n\n\nKey scientific outcomes included experimental and theoretical studies of the interaction of carbon dioxide molecules with metal and oxidized surfaces. Experimentally, we found that oxidation of clean copper surfaces is very sensitive to vacuum annealing, even at relatively modest temperatures. For example, significant reorganization of the surfaces takes place, yielding micron-scale oxide faceting of what would otherwise be flat surfaces. We also found that carbon dioxide is only very weakly bound when deposited onto these atomically-ordered oxide surfaces, even at very low temperatures. This highlights the important role of surface defects as ?anchoring points? for the molecules to stick to the surface, which is the first key step in the catalytic process. This finding was confirmed with theoretical modeling comparing the interaction of carbon dioxide molecules with bulk copper oxide and defects in the lattice caused by missing atoms. Theoretical models comparing the interactions of carbon dioxide with copper and gold surfaces also highlighted mechanisms which lead to selective surface chemistry.  \n\n\nThis NSF program also served as a training ground for a diverse team of 3 undergraduate and 3 graduate students who have gone on to a variety of careers in industry, academia and national labs. Students developed familiarity with both computational and experimental methods across two disciplines (surface physics and chemical engineering), and established a common vernacular through project meetings. Students also benefited from professional development opportunities, including public outreach and presentations at scientific conferences. Aspects of the research program were integrated into a new course that will continue to be offered to a mix of advanced undergraduate and graduate students. In particular, this course provides an introduction to advanced computational methods that are a foundation for a variety of careers in STEM and related fields.  \n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/09/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jay Gupta"
