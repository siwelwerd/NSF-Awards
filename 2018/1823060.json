 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of a special thematic semester in probability in 2018, the mathematics department at the University of Connecticut will be holding research workshops of national scope in three prominent areas of probability theory:  \r\n1) Recent Progress on Dimer Model and Integrable Probability, Aug 15-16 2018, Avery Point campus; \r\n2) Mathematical Finance, Oct 12-13 2018, Storrs campus; \r\n3) Functional Inequalities, Nov 2-3 2018, Storrs campus. \r\n\r\nThe research workshops are supported  by this grant and complement the other activities in the special semester (including a public lecture and colloquia series),  funded by the department.  Each workshop will feature a group of invited distinguished leaders in the respective area. The goals of the workshops are to bring together researchers from all parts of the country and at all stages of their career to disseminate ideas, collaborate and network, having direct access to the invited speakers.  Particular focus, attention and funding opportunities will be given to early-career researchers and researchers from underrepresented groups. Specifically, this grant will be used to support about ten early-career participants per workshop. Participants will have the opportunity to contribute to the proceedings from the special semester, to appear in a volume of the Birkhauser series Progress in Probability. The workshops will be widely advertised online (e.g. IMS meetings website and mathprograms.org), through email lists and networks, specifically the Women in Probability network (womeninprobability.org) and the mailing list of women probabilists in North America, as well as through announcements in meetings, emails to colleagues, and posters.  More details on the special semester and the research workshops can be found on probsem18.math.uconn.edu (temporary URL draft.probsem18.math.uconn.edu)\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
