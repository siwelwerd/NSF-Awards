 "awd_abstract_narration": "A workshop entitled \"Quantum Computing Workshop for Advancing Aerospace Sciences\" is scheduled to be held in Suffolk, VA at the Lockheed Martin Center for Innovation on November 7-8, 2017.  More details on the workshop can be found at http://www.nianet.org/quantumcomputing/.  The goals of the workshop are to understand the challenges and opportunities to develop a new type of computing methodology that significantly increases computer speed and can be applied to science and engineering problems.  This has implications on a variety of applications including machine learning, materials design, personalized medicine, advanced weather prediction, energy distribution and optimization, among others.  Quantum computers use an entirely different computing paradigm in comparison to conventional computers.  Conventional computer hardware uses silicon to process information in terms of \"bits\" that can be encoded in either zeros or ones.  Quantum computers use what is known as \"qubits\" which allow information to be encoded by both zeros and ones at the same time using the unusual behavior of quantum mechanics.  This quantum behavior has been measured in different experimental systems by controlling and measuring light and electricity, for example.  However, transitioning these prototype machines into a quantum computer with a large number of qubits that can reliably processes information is still in its infancy.  This workshop will bring together industry leaders, government laboratory researchers, and university researchers to define new goals and objectives to transition how small scale quantum computing testbeds can be scaled up using advanced hardware and quantum algorithms.  This is expected to provide a roadmap for solving practical problems of interests to the general public and national security.  The invited speakers will discuss challenges and opportunities centered around the following four topic areas: 1) Quantum algorithms, 2) Quantum computing hardware, 3) Control and error correction of quantum systems, and 4) Aeroscience applications.  Fourteen global experts, including two female speakers, will discuss current research related to these four quantum computing areas. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this workshop is to bring together experts on quantum computing and quantum information to discuss the challenges, opportunities, and latest developments in quantum algorithms, hardware, and its impact on supporting aeroscience computations.  The goal is to develop a roadmap for success that connects mathematicians, physicists, computer scientists, and engineers to collectively explore capabilities where quantum speed-up may impact domain specific problems in science and engineering applications.  These specific areas may include computational materials science, fluid dynamics, uncertainty quantification, machine learning, among others.  This will include discussions on the latest advances in algorithm development, scalability, universal logic, and error correction with the aim to understand the next set of mathematical challenges required to control quantum systems, measure their outputs, and preserve their properties from outside disturbances.  Quantum speed-up is well known in specific algorithms that lead to exponential increases in factoring prime numbers (Shor's algorithm) and quadratic speed increases in unstructured searches (Grover's algorithm).  More recently, it has been suggested that exponential speed-up can be achieved in linear algebra problems.  Similar research has focused on new Monte Carlo quantum algorithms. This research is focused on identifying efficient means to solve partial differential equations on a quantum computer.  Based upon the chosen topics, we will focus discussions on these topics where quantum algorithms and hardware may converge onto methods that allow for efficient solutions to partial differential equations relevant to a broad area of mathematics, physics, materials science, and engineering problems.  Through discussions among quantum computing stakeholders in industry, government laboratories, and academia, we expect to facilitate building partnerships across disciplines and provide opportunities for young faculty and graduate students to learn about quantum computing.  We envision developing a roadmap that defines the next set of realistic challenges that can be met over the next 10-15 years.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe outcomes of the Quantum Computing Workshop for Advancing Aerospace Sciences led to discussion and momentum in quantum computing algorithm and hardware development for engineering and aerospace applications.  The workshop was organized by university faculty and staff scientists at NASA and Oak Ridge National Laboratories to bring together researchers in academia, government agencies, and industry to discuss current opportunities and challenges in applying quantum computing in engineering sciences.  Invited talks included representatives from the Pittsburgh Quantum Institute, Yale, University of Maryland, NASA, Microsoft, IBM, Los Alamos National Lab, Yale, and several others.  \n\nThe one day workshop described the state-of-the-art in hardware and algorithms which led to discussions on directions for national iniatives on quantum computing research and development.  Optimization was emphasized as low hanging fruit for engineering and science problems while materials and chemistry problems were blue sky problems that are risky, yet could produce a high payoff in its societal impact.  Examples include understanding fundamental mechanisms of certain chemical reactions that occur in nature such as making ammonia.  The Haber-Bosch process is used to do this for fertilizer production, but it requires extraordinary heat and pressure, unlike natural processes.  Quantum computing could provide the tools to understand the fundamental energy pathways that could unlock its mystery and save large amounts of fuel in fertilizer production.  Many other examples were envisioned such as drug discovery and artificial intelligence which often require optimization algorithms of a vast number of possible solutions.  Lastly, experts in classical algorithms noted that the race to create the fastest quantum algorithm has also provided motivation for developing new classical algorithms that compete with quantum analogs.  An example is recent developments at Microsoft in tempered annealing which was motivated by quantum annealing research by D-Wave quantum annealing hardware.\n\nTravel support from NSF also greatly benefited several post docs and graduate students. These young scholars learned from leaders in the field from many enlightening talks, networking, and individual discussions.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/17/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William S Oates"
