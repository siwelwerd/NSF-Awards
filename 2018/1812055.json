 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops the geometric study of models of space-time, toward mathematical forms of fundamental concepts in particle physics. Two principal concepts from the theory of quantum fields are those of locality and duality. Locality generalizes the idea that there should not be so-called action at a distance in a complete quantum theory of nature. Duality occurs in two seemingly different quantum theories being fundamentally the same. The present project develops mathematical formulations of locality and duality in terms of a new theory of factorization homology. Factorization homology provides a mathematical means of articulating a physical theory on all of space-time in terms of physics in very small subregions, within which physics can be simplified in terms of combinatorics and higher-dimensional graph theory.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project develops the theory of factorization homology for variants of higher categories, and applications thereof to mathematical physics and differential topology. This theory can be thought of as the study of sheaves on moduli spaces of stratifications. One goal is to use factorization homology with adjoints to prove the cobordism hypothesis of Baez--Dolan and Lurie, which asserts that topological quantum field theories in the sense of Atiyah's axioms are uniquely determined by their value on a point. This would show that such a topological quantum field theory on space-time X comes from a sheaf on the moduli space of stratifications of X, and thus that the notion of locality can be understood in terms of the topology of such moduli spaces. A second goal is to show that this moduli space of stratifications of a manifold X satisfies an infinite-dimensional form of Poincar? duality.  This would then give rise to a duality among topological physical theories on X, once expressed as sheaves on the aforementioned moduli space. This duality is a form of Koszul duality for topological physical theories.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\nThis award enabled the PI, David Ayala, to conduct research in homotopy theory related to manifold geometry, deformation theory, and categorification.  This is an abstract approach to structural questions in quantum physics.  Specifically, the PI collaborated with John Francis, Nick Rozenblyum, Aaron Mazel-Gee, and Adam Howard on the development of factorization homology, which is a pairing between manifolds (geometry) and higher-categories (algebra).  Such manifolds abstrat world-sheets; such higher categories are generated through deformation theory; factorization homology codifies and abstracts global observables of a topologically-invariant quantum field theory.  The technical groundwork for these developments is that of stratifications: stratified spaces and stratified categories.  All of these developments are publically available as a series of nine articles.  \n\n\nThis award enabled the completion of four PhD theses in the subject of algebraic topology:\n\nConfiguration spaces and exit-path categories by Anna Cepek; \nA contact manifold is the quotient of a metric tree by a profinite group by Daniel Perry; \nAdditivity for factorization algebras by Eric Berry; \nA classification of immersions from surfaces by Adam Howard.\n\n\nThis award enabled the disemination of these research findings by way of a book, a book chapter, several peer-reviewed journal articles, organization of four international conferences and workshops, four international lecture series, and many conference and seminar presentations.
