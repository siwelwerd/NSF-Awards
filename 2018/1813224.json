 "awd_abstract_narration": "The powerful innovation and application of computing in the science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM) disciplines has increased the need for real-world, interdisciplinary, and computational preparation of students from the early grades through high school. Such interdisciplinary teaching and learning must be developed with the understanding of the needs and capacity of elementary school teachers and their students, and appropriate grade-specific integration in the elementary curriculum. This exploratory research will study the landscape of K-5 elementary teachers and how they engage students in computational thinking, and apply concepts associated with computing and computational thinking in their teaching of STEM content so implementation efforts are viable. By better understanding how computational thinking concepts and approaches integrate authentically into math, science and other subjects, policymakers and district leaders will be informed of how to intentionally support teachers and students to develop their core skills that will provide a strong foundation for computing applications in STEM teaching and learning. Outcomes of the research will include a better understanding of computational thinking concepts and approaches across the K-5 curriculum to inform future implementation efforts; increased awareness of computational thinking definitions for K-5 teachers so teachers are more prepared to apply computing in their practice; and inform the professional development needs of K-5 teachers. Findings will support computational integration in STEM education in elementary school built on evidence and best practices. This project was submitted to the DRK12-STEM+C DCL (17-149) and is supported by the STEM+C Program that focuses on research and development of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to the integration of computing within science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teaching and learning for preK-12 students in both formal and informal settings. STEM+C supports research on how students learn to think computationally to solve interdisciplinary problems in the STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThrough a convergent parallel mixed methods design, survey data will be collected concurrently with Design-Based Implementation Research (DBIR) activity artifacts and merged (1) to provide a holistic picture of how computational thinking (CT) concepts and approaches are currently being addressed in elementary classrooms and (2) to identify how new CT concepts and approaches in computing programs relate to those already applied in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Practitioners will engage in the process of research and will help to steer the exploratory study through a series of value mapping activities. Multiple correlation coefficient (R) and HLM statistical analysis of teacher survey data will explain where and when CT concepts and approaches are present in the current elementary classroom. By including educators and researchers from across the STEM+C fields, as well as including schools from urban, rural, and suburban areas, the project will explore what works and for whom. As the project is concerned with supporting and sustaining systemic change, the project's long-term sustainability goals will benefit from the infrastructure developed through an NSF Local Systemic Change grant that has matured over the past 20 years. The relationships between the University and 12 local school districts, as well as mechanisms for communication will be a key factor in the sustainability of the project. The research and activities will result in the dissemination of a multimedia model for interdisciplinary computing. The model will inform further research on the development and implementation of teaching computing as an integral, embedded component of STEM.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

While CT is understood as a core thinking process that can be integrated between and within all academic subjects (Henderson et al., 2007; Wing, 2006), there are variations for integration opportunities between disciplines. Math and science presented the greatest opportunities for integration, with teachers reporting that 58% of math and 51% of science lessons include a CT concept or approach.

Teachers reported teaching Ela (341 min.) and math (321 min.) for more than double the amount of time as science (149 min.) and social studies (106 min.), thus greatly impacting the total time for potential integration.

The only school-level factor that impacted the frequency of CT integration was the district's participation in </span><span>a research-practice partnership with the local University (the University of Rhode Island's GEMS-Net RPP: Guiding Education in Math and Science Network), in which they were more likely to integrate algorithms, debugging, and perseverance than the districts who did not participate.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>A diverse team of elementary teachers, administrators, and researchers met monthly throughout the project and created an interactive digital resource--a Bitmoji classroom--for elementary teachers to learn about and utilize CT in their teaching and learning practices. The Bitmoji classroom includes results from the survey, vignettes of math and science lessons with integrated CT for grades 1-5, a letter introducing CT to families, a Padlet with definitions and examples, a video of students describing CT for other students, a poster to print for the classroom, and other links and resources. The team came to understand CT approaches and concepts as tools to think about and develop meaning from the qualitative and quantitative data in our world. Toward the end of the project one teacher explained, \"I can't stop seeing CT in my life, it's everywhere, it's in the weather I check in the morning and how I decide on what clothes I wear each day.&nbsp; I find myself making mental maps throughout the day and identify them as 'oh' that's an example of decomposition or check out those patterns? (meeting notes 05/2021). This teacher's knowledge is not yet the norm for most elementary teachers. The survey showed that most elementary teachers are only just beginning to understand what computational thinking is and what it means for teaching and learning. This project provided the necessary foundation from which further implementation efforts could be created to support teachers to integrate CT across all disciplines and prepare young children to play and work in a continuously-developing, technology-rich society. Recommendations to increase CT integration in elementary classrooms based on the data from this study were made by the diverse team of researchers and practitioners. These recommendations included increasing time for science instruction, planning for CT integration into Ela instruction, developing partnerships for CT between K-12 schools and universities, providing teachers with accessible and applicable definitions of CT approaches and concepts, and providing professional development and resources for more intentional integration opportunities. </span></p>\n<div><span><br /></span></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/10/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Sara&nbsp;B&nbsp;Sweetman</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1813224/1813224_10574258_1639081973991_ComparingTotalTimeofTeachingPerSubjectWiththeAmountofTimeTeachersReportedIntegratingCT--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1813224/1813224_10574258_1639081973991_ComparingTotalTimeofTeachingPerSubjectWiththeAmountofTimeTeachersReportedIntegratingCT--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Teacher's Reported Time Integrating Computational Thinking into Math, Science, Ela, and Social Studies\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1813224/1813224_10574258_1639081973991_ComparingTotalTimeofTeachingPerSubjectWiththeAmountofTimeTeachersReportedIntegratingCT--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Teacher's Reported Time Integrating Computational Thinking into Math, Science, Ela, and Social Studies\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Teachers reported spending more than twice as much time on math and Ela compared to science and social studies.
