 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of the proposed research are to examine biological, chemical, and physical conditions in ice-covered Arctic lakes and the associated changes in dissolved gases by analyzing data  obtained from five lakes over three years.  The data will be used to 1) determine circulation and the resulting habitat for organisms living under the ice, and 2) how biological and physical processes interact to cause a loss of oxygen and the production of greenhouse gases. Despite the importance of mixing within lakes for maintaining healthy habitats, few scientists are trained in lake physics in the United States. This  project will provide such training for a postdoctoral scholar. \r\n\r\nArctic lakes are ice-covered for nine or more months of the year. With harsh winter conditions, few limnological studies have been conducted on ice-covered arctic lakes. The goal of the proposed research is to analyze an unprecedented dataset obtained from five lakes of different sizes from fall to spring over three years. The data will be used to describe and quantify the lakes' physical limnology and under ice metabolism and to develop scaling laws such that regional generalizations can be made. Analyses and modeling will focus on questions related to the extent to which fall cooling moderates under ice temperatures and circulation; the contribution of respiration and related increases in solutes to circulation patterns and development of anoxia; lake-size dependent controls on the retention of solutes introduced at snowmelt; and lake-size dependent controls on mixing dynamics, which moderate production of CO2 and CH4 in winter and emissions at ice off. Results will provide a basic understanding of circulation and mixing as needed to improve hydrodynamic models and are critical for quantifying the habitat of organisms under the ice and for accurate inclusion of arctic lakes in regional carbon budgets.",

Due to the difficulties of working in the Arctic in winter, little has been known about the conditions in the lakes under the ice. With this project, we took advantage of new high resolution sensors and profilers to characterize temperatures, solute concentrations, and distributions of oxygen so critical for persistence of organisms such as fish and zooplankton.  Temperatures are cold, generally between 0oC and 4oC, with the warmest temperatures near the bottom since 4oC is the temperature of maximum density of freshwater. In contrast to ice free conditions when wind energizes lakes from the surface, in winter flows are initiated by processes in the sediments.  They warm the overlying water and via the density increases, generate downslope flows. Bacteria in the sediments respire organic matter such as decaying phytoplankton or sedimented leaves that flowed in from the streams.  Respiration generates salts which also increase density causing downslope flow. These downward flowing currents are depleted in oxygen and enriched in CO2 such that the warmest water, highest concentrations of CO2, and water with lowest concentration of oxygen pools at depth in the lakes.  \n\nOn a worldwide basis, lakes contribute significant quantities of climate forcing trace gases to the atmosphere. The quantity produced under the ice in arctic lakes has been unknown, but the quantity emitted in summer was computed to be a significant fraction of the terrestrial carbon budget. Our calculations indicate the quantity of CO2 produced in winter is two or more times greater than that which evades in summer, indicating respiration under the ice contributes appreciably to the carbon budget of arctic lakes in Alaska. Whether the lower water column becomes depleted in oxygen, that is, anoxic, and unsuitable for fish, depends on the extent of upward flows under the ice. If anoxia forms under the ice, methane, a climate forcing trace gas eight times more potent than CO2, accumulates. If mixed to the surface in the ice free period, it can evade to the atmosphere. In subarctic lakes in Sweden, respiration under the ice produces 30% of the annual emissions of CO2 and more than half the annual emissions of CH4.\n\nThe value of research from one or a few lakes is increased when the results are generalized to other lakes.  To determine the growth of organisms under the ice and their subsequent effects in summer and the contributions of lakes to regional carbon cycles requires deciphering the mechanisms that enable upwards flow in winter, assessing how basin morphometry and wind moderate mixing in spring and fall, and quantifying controls on retention of incoming snowmelt enriched in dissolved organic carbon and nutrients. It also requires quantifying turbulence, which can mix oxygen into lakes and climate forcing trace gases to evade.\n\nOur project has focused on these goals with analysis of existing data.  We have shown that temperatures under the ice in winter depend on those in summer, that sediment respiration can be a key driver of flow under the ice and can help sustain the upward flow that reduces the extent of anoxia,  that the primary mechanism thought to cause mixing in spring is blocked in arctic lakes on older landscapes by the increased solutes from weathering.  Thus, mixing at ice off is mediated by internal waves, an inefficient process, and anoxia persists along with climate forcing trace gases.  However, that creates habitats for differing microbial populations. On younger landscapes, the lakes have lower concentrations of solutes and mixing is enabled. In these lakes, layers of phytoplankton are dispersed and may flow downstream, and climate forcing trace gases are mixed to the surface and can evade.\n\nScaling using dimensionless indices, which incorporate mixing mechanisms with a few easily measured variables, enables extension of findings such as those above other lakes. We have developed and tested algorithms using basic meteorological measurements to quantify turbulence near the surface and in the water column.  As these new equations are used in our studies and in those from other regions, estimates of the contribution of lakes to the climate system will be improved. Further improvement will be made as our descriptions of the dominant hydrodynamic processes operative in fall, winter and spring are added to hydrodynamic models including the processes operative in the sediments.\n\nThe approaches we have used in lakes in the Alaskan Arctic have been and are continuing to be extended via collaborations to sites in arctic and subarctic Canada, Sweden, and Finland.  Our project has contributed and is continuing to contribute to training of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars at those sites.  Via this extensive network, we are posed for a deeper understanding of how hydrodynamics moderates the environment in which organisms live and grow under the ice, the metabolism of arctic lakes, and regional carbon cycles.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/01/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sally Macintyre"
