 "awd_abstract_narration": "CREST Bioenergy Center\r\n\r\nThe Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) program supports the enhancement of research capabilities of minority-serving institutions through the establishment of centers that effectively integrate education and research. CREST promotes the development of new knowledge, enhancements of the research productivity of individual faculty, and an expanded presence of students historically underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. \r\n\r\nWith CREST program support, North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University will further develop its Bioenergy Center into a sustainable national interdisciplinary center for transformative bioenergy research and technology development, and for the professional development of underrepresented minority students and faculty. Partner institutions include the State University of New York at Stony Brook, Louisiana Tech University, Guildford/Alamance Technical Community Colleges, industry and National Laboratories. Center research will advance bioenergy science and contribute to bioenergy technology commercialization. Center research will also accelerate the transition to lower net-carbon energy systems with their environmental and public health benefits.\r\n\r\nThe Center articulates three research thrusts: (1) Biomass Gasification and Syngas Upgrading via Chemical Looping Technology; (2) Nanocatalyst for Fisher-Tropsch Synthesis using CO2-rich Syngas and H2 production from Bioderived Liquids; and (3) Electrocatalysts and Membranes Development for Fuel Cell Technology. The aim of the research thrusts is to gain fundamental understanding of the thermochemical conversion of biomass to bioenergy and biofuel. The Center will enhance STEM research and education at North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University, produce new knowledge, strengthen the research competitiveness of faculty and promote interdisciplinary collaborations within North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University and with partner institutions. Center activities will enhance the research and development enterprise and infrastructure at North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University, making it nationally competitive in the field of bioenergy. Students, traditionally underrepresented in the STEM disciplines, will be provided with meaningful research experiences at a readily accessible advanced research facility.  Center activities will emphasize the recruitment of community college students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
