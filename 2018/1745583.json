 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to provide fertile ground for training undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral fellows through the Georgia Tech Geometry and Topology (GTGT) group, resulting in an increase in the number of U.S. citizens pursuing advanced research in geometry and topology. The project includes activities to stimulate interdisciplinary collaborations among mathematicians and engineers. The GTGT group's proximity to numerous institutions serving underrepresented groups in mathematics will be leveraged to increase the number of minorities and women studying mathematics. The project intends to develop students and postdoctoral fellows who become well-rounded scholars, accomplished teachers, and valuable members of the mathematical community.\r\n \r\nThe GTGT group will provide comprehensive training to graduate students and postdocs through fellowships, expanded courses and seminars, and dedicated professional development activity. The GTGT group also will engage undergraduate students in REU projects, a directed reading program, and topics classes as well as in seminars about applying to graduate school. Each summer there will also be twelve summer REUs funded by the grant to provide a research capstone to the other undergraduate activities associated with the grant. The GTGT group will run a research conference each fall, allowing students and postdocs opportunities to interact with top researchers from around the country and to gain experience with organizing national activities. They will additionally run a biennial professional development workshop, undergraduate workshop, and summer school. It is expected that there will be significant interaction between trainees at all levels and that all parts of the project will work together to reinforce each other.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
