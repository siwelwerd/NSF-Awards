 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding how extreme events, like hurricanes, impact coastal ecosystems and the cycling of elements like carbon and oxygen, is important for improving our ability to predict how the global carbon cycle will respond to climate. This team of investigators, who have already been working together on understanding the carbon cycle in the Gulf of Mexico continental shelves, have important recent data against which to measure the effects of the passage of Hurricane Harvey in August, 2017. They will sample the waters and sediments of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico in September, October, and January to assess Harvey's impacts on a timescale of weeks to months. \r\n\r\nThe researchers pose three specific questions: 1. Will the region become a major source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, releasing carbon accumulated in the bottom water and sediments, and will this potential impact be faster and greater than during normal fall and winter mixing events? Will this process acidify the surface water and for how long? 2. Will the metabolic balance be substantially pushed toward net heterotrophy as a result of the storm in comparison to other years? 3. Can the amount of material delivered or redeposited across the continental shelf by a tropical cyclone be considerably larger than that related to winter storm systems? The PIs will measure water column nutrients, oxygen, organic carbon, and inorganic carbon system parameters; determine water column and benthic metabolic and nutrient flux rates; and sediment organic matter deposition rates. They will also collect end member river samples. They will compare the immediate (mid-Sept) but limited post-hurricane data and one-month post-hurricane, more detailed data with those collected in July and April to study the impacts of the storms. they will also compare 2017-2018 seasonal data to seasonal data over the same region collected in the past (2006-2008 and 2009-2010). They will also compare the impacts of Hurricane Harvey to those of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita (2005) and Tropical Storm Cindy (June 2017). The project will involve graduate and postdoctoral research and work to communicate results to the public.",

To analyze water samples for inorganic nutrient and dissolved organic carbon (on a subset of samples) concentrations during two cruises in the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM) following the passage of Hurricane Harvey. \n\n2.  To examine and compare these new observations with data acquired on cruises prior to the storm (April and July 2017) and following the storm (January 2018) and during similar times of the year from past studies in the same region of the nGOM.\n\n3.  To combine our data with collaborators to examine the integrated impact of major storm events on carbon cycling, community metabolism, and phytoplankton community composition. \n\nThe passage of Hurricane Harvey in late August and Hurricane Nate in October (during our cruise) resulted in the water column in the nGOM, particularly the western portions in the paths of both hurricanes, being largely mixed for extended periods.
