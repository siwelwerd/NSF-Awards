 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will explore electrochemical reactor technology capable of capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from power plants. Through a research collaboration between the University of South Carolina, the Pennsylvania State University, and Proton OnSite - a Connecticut small business that is a specialist at bringing electrochemical technologies to market - the project will combine elements of reactor design, catalysis, and separations to make critical scientific and engineering advances required for commercialization of CO2 capture at the industrial scale. The project will also provide opportunities for young researchers - including both high school and college students - to learn about electrochemistry, polymer science and applications of CO2 in academic, industrial and global contexts. The combined research and educational aspects of the study will help secure our Nation's future as a leader in clean energy technologies. \r\n\r\nThe project aims to advance anion-exchange membrane (AEM) based CO2 separation reactors through: 1) realization of advanced catalysts that improve the rate of CO2 reaction and separation; 2) design of membranes that can control the chemical pathways in the cell; 3) high-performance cell design - aided by computer modeling; and 4) construction of commercial-fidelity reactors for testing under realistic environments. The research combines engineered materials, catalysts, and membranes to control the chemical state of CO2 as it is transported through the AEM. This is important because the reaction kinetics dictate the operating voltage and a combination of mass transport and thermodynamics act to control the power requirements through the anionic balance in the AEM - with hydroxide, bicarbonate and carbonate anions all being present. Bicarbonate anions are the preferred species for CO2 separation. On the catalyst side, the surface chemistry of transition metal oxide catalysts will be investigated to uncover the reaction mechanisms for direct electrocatalytic (bi)carbonate formation. On the polymer side, new alkaline ionomers will be synthesized to control the effective base dissociation constant (pKb) of the polymer at levels needed to maintain the electrocatalytically derived bicarbonate anion in its native form during transport through the reactor. The project will also simulate the behavior of such a CO2 separation reactor as an integrated component of a 500 MW coal-fired power plant, and will assess its current and future economic feasibility. Thus, the intellectual drivers of this work will encompass both the physical science of materials and electrochemical systems, as well as engineering design and economic considerations. Beyond the immediate thrusts, the research will have relevance in the materials, catalysis, and electrochemical communities as well as broader areas of carbon capture and economics of fossil energy technology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe overall goal for this award was to understand how CO2 reacts and is distributed in alkaline membrane electrochemical reactors.  During the four years of this award, significant new scientific and engineering knowledge was gained.  In particular, the team developed a new understanding for how exposure to CO2 influences the thermodynamics, kinetics and mass transport in these reactors.  This understanding was used to develop a novel mathematical framework that quantifies contribution of the three effects on the cell operation voltage.  That mathematical framework was applied over a number of cell operating configurations.  This allowed for the effects of reactor operating parameters, such as temperature, reacting gas flowrates and current density, to be uncovered for the first time.  Additionally, this project was able to quantify the effect of membrane chemistry and was able to show that the membrane backbone and headgroup can change the cell response to CO2.\n\nWith a firm understanding of the behavior of CO2 in alkaline membrane reactors, a new reactor was designed that was able to capture CO2 from the influent.  The captured CO2 could act to purify either the feed (e.g. air) or concentrate the CO2 leaving the effluent.  Lastly, the research team created a process simulation in ASPEN PLUS that modeled various electrochemical CO2 capture configurations and performed an at-scale economic analysis (effluent from a 500 MW coal-fired power plant).\n\nThe outcomes of this work are expected have a broader impact on anion exchange membrane technologies, such as fuel cells, electrolyzers and unitized regenerative fuel cells.  It has also led to continued funding from industry in this area. \n\nLastly, this program allowed for engagement across several levels.  Graduate students were trained.  Undergraduate students were given hands-on research experiences during the school year and the summer.  The team hosted two high school girls in the summer of 2022 to work on this project.  The scientific outcomes were disseminated to the broader research community through peer-reviewed papers, public presentation and in the classroom. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/13/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William Mustain"
