 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Southern Ocean is often referred to as the window to the deep ocean.  This vast ocean around Antarctica is the primary location where the waters that fill the deep ocean are brought to the surface where they interact with the atmosphere and with sea ice.  Because of this unique role in the global climate system, the physical and biological processes that occur in the Southern Ocean have a disproportionately large impact on the properties of the global ocean, including the amount of heat and carbon dioxide that is trapped in the deep ocean for hundreds to thousands of years.  Extremely sparse observations of both the Southern Ocean?s circulation structure and biological properties, such as nutrient and biomass concentrations, have presented a significant barrier to understanding the modification of near surface waters and their subsequent exchange with the deep ocean. In recent years, the SOCCOM (Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling) project has used innovative robotic technologies, namely autonomous profiling floats, to provide observations of biogeochemical properties in the Southern Ocean with unprecedented coverage in space and time.  This advance marks a step change in our ability to mechanistically understand the Southern Ocean?s role in the global carbon cycle but many of the physical and biological processes responsible for generating the observed biogeochemical distributions are not adequately captured by the floats because of their relatively coarse sampling interval (10 days).  In this project, two ocean gliders will be piloted to track individual floats in order to measure the oceanic circulation features that impact exchange between the surface and interior ocean.  Gliders sample the upper 1000 meters of the ocean once every 4 to 5 hours and are able to resolve variations in fluid motion on time scales of about a day. On these scales, the variability of vertical velocities are quite large and thus the circulation at these shorter temporal and smaller spatial scales significantly influences the vertical transport of ocean properties.  An improved characterization of motions at these scales, and their impact on heat and carbon transport, will lead to a better understanding of the role the Southern Ocean plays in the global carbon cycle.\r\n\r\nTwo autonomous ocean gliders will be deployed in the Indian sector of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, coincident with one or more semi-Lagrangian Argo floats equipped with biogeochemical sensors through the SOCCOM project. The gliders will be piloted to track the Argo float for a period of at least four months, resolving the mesoscale and submesoscale structure surrounding the float as well as variability occurring at periods shorter than the float?s 10-day sampling interval. Measurements of the upper ocean hydrographic and velocity fields will permit an analysis of hydrodynamical instabilities within the mixed layer and their impact on vertical transport and exchange across the base of the mixed layer.  The glider data will also be combined with the float observations and remote sensing products to derive vertical tracer fluxes, with the goal of quantifying the partitioning of export between sinking and advective pathways.  Ultimately, this project will provide observations of the physical processes that contribute to high-frequency spatial and temporal variability in Southern Ocean tracer distributions and will provide a significant step towards describing the mechanisms that influence physical and biogeochemical distributions and transport pathways in the Southern Ocean.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe eastward-flowing Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) dominates the circulation of the Southern Ocean.  The ACC is the strongest circulation feature in the global ocean and by linking the different ocean basins sets global distributions of heat and nutrients.  Recently, variations in the fluid dynamical properties of the ACC as it flows around Antarctica have been highlighted as critical for regulating Southern Hemisphere climate.  In particular, when the ACC encounters underwater seamounts and ridges, the flow diverts from its eastward path, meanders, and develops regions where energetic ocean eddies are preferentially generated in a process similar to atmospheric storm tracks.  High resolution numerical models have suggested that the exchange of properties, such as heat and carbon dioxide, between the atmosphere and the interior ocean is enhanced in these energetic regions of the ACC.  This project seeks observational support for these modeling results.\n\nIn May of 2019, researchers from the California Institute of Technology and the University Washington teamed up to deploy two autonomous ocean gliders.  Gliders are robots, or autonomous vehicles, that can be piloted from land and have the ability to modify their own buoyancy to profile vertically through the upper kilometer of the ocean measuring temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen concentrations and other properties that provide insight into how biology influences the marine carbon cycle.  The gliders were piloted to track an autonomous float, equipped with a wider range of sensors, that passed through one of the energetic meanders of the ACC. \n\nThe observations from both these autonomous platforms, as well as remote sensing data, have shown that stirring by ocean eddies in these regions enhances exchange between the surface and ocean interior in two ways.  First, the regions between the eddies are associated with strong straining motions that generates strong fronts in the surface ocean.  These fronts give rise to enhanced vertical velocities can can carry surface properties to depth, especially across the base of the mixed layer where exchange with the atmosphere is cut off.  Subsequently, these near surface properties are effectively transported to even greater depths by the stirring motion of the eddies.  Together, these processes are referred to as ?ventilation? and were directly measured in one ACC standing meander in the Indian Ocean.  We then used insight gained from this study to analyze dissolved oxygen concentrations from a larger float data set and to show that ventilation is enhanced in all the major standing meanders within the ACC.  This study has implications for coupled climate model predictions of how the Southern Ocean's capacity to take up excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere will evolve in the future.\n\nThis project supported the work of Caltech graduate student Lily Dove.  Lily has gained experience deploying and piloting ocean gliders as well as processing and analyzing measurements from diverse from autonomous platforms and satellites.  Lily has led two scientific manuscripts and presented her work at both national and international meetings.  In addition to her research efforts, Lily has co-advised two Caltech WAVE students, Ellie Flint and Taylor Cason, on projects related to physical-biogeochemical coupling on the Southern Ocean.  Caltech's WAVE program is a summer undergraduate research fellowship awarded to underrepresented groups in science. Lily also earned her Certificate of Teaching Practice by completing a program designed by Caltech's Center for Teaching, Learning, and Outreach.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/09/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew F Thompson"
