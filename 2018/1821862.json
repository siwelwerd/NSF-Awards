 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomy is a fully international endeavor; we all share the same sky. To participate in the international scientific community, American researchers must meet and collaborate with researchers from around the world. Every three years, the International Astronomical Union has a General Assembly accompanied by topical symposia, joint discussions, working groups, and business meetings. The next such meeting will be held in August 2018. In order to ensure a vigorous participation by the US astronomical community, this award will fund small travel grants to enable approximately 150 US astronomers to attend the General Assembly. This award will also provide small travel grants to approximately 50 US astronomers per year to attend various international meetings over the next 3 years.  Preference will be given to early-career astronomers and astronomers from less-endowed institutions. Scientists supported by this program will come from a wide range of educational institutions, museums, planetariums, etc. The experiences they gain from this meeting will be shared with a broad segment of the US population, exposing them to the global nature of astronomy and the importance of international collaboration to the advancement of science and technology.\r\n\r\nThe small travel grant program will be administered by the American Astronomical Society (AAS), the principal professional organization for US astronomers. They have very successfully and economically administered similar programs in the past, and the proposed procedures ensure that these funds will provide the maximum benefit to the astronomical community at minimal cost. The AAS will solicit proposals, select awardees, issue funds to be used for airfare only, collect receipts and meeting reports from the grantees, and prepare a final assessment and report on the entire program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

received funding for the 31st General Assembly meeting of the IAU in Busan, South Korea. &nbsp;We expected more applicants for the Vienna meeting and were able to adjust our award budget to support additional non-IAU conferences &nbsp;We also expected more people to attend the Busan conference, but the pandemic severely impacted the number of travellers applying. &nbsp;We therefore were able to support additional travel beyond what was budgeted to non-IAU conferences.</p>\n<p>The reason this grant is important is that astronomy is a fully international endeavor and US astronomers must network with, collaborate with and learn from astronomers in other countries. &nbsp;The best way to do this is to attend focused and general scientific conferences that bring together astronomers from around the world for a week or so to share their results and build networks from which future research can emerge. &nbsp;By focusing particularly on early-career astronomers the program helps enhance the careers of these researchers by allowing them to be noticed by and dialog with foreign researchers. &nbsp;By focusing &nbsp;on supporting scientists with fewer resources from their home institution, we allow connections to be formed that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to establish. &nbsp;By supporting US astronomers who are playing a key role at a conference, we help spotlight US participation and research prowess on the international stage.</p>\n<p>The AAS has supported US scientists over many decades utilizing these support fund from the National Science
