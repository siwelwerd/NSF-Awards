 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bees contribute annually to the pollination of agricultural crops, providing substantially to successful agriculture in the United States, and their visits to wildflowers provide the foundation for many native plant communities helping to sustain native habitats and wildlife. Despite their economic and ecological importance, surprisingly little is know about how bees evaluate the composition of the nectar (their source of carbohydrates) and pollen (their source of protein and fat) they collect from flowers. The nutritional value of these resources varies across plants, so bees often combine visits to several species to achieve a balanced diet. This project asks how the composition of a given plant's resources affects bees' foraging decisions and behaviors. It involves experiments on bumblebee foraging behavior, analysis of variation in nectar and pollen chemistry, and drone-based techniques to describe the nutritional landscape bees encounter as they visit wildflower communities. A natural history museum exhibit will educate school groups about the importance of nutrition for pollinators, and help visitors decide which backyard plants provide the best food for bees. Research experiences for undergraduates and science teachers-in-training will help train the next generation of scientists and help disseminate findings widely through future courses science teachers will lead. Many native bee species and populations are in decline, driven in part by changes to the nutritional resources available to them. Predicting how bees will respond to the introduction of novel foods offered by invasive, ornamental, or agricultural plants requires understanding how nutritional need guides their foraging decisions. The information this project will uncover can thus help inform efforts to conserve bee populations, whose own food security is directly linked to that of Americans.\r\n\r\nFloral rewards mediate interactions between plants and their pollinators, shaping both plant communities and the evolutionary dynamics of mutualisms. Despite their functional significance, little is known about how the nutritional complexity of floral rewards structures species interactions, because most previous research focuses on a single reward type (most commonly, nectar). This project adapts a framework from the field of nutritional ecology to explore how foraging bumblebees balance the collection of multiple resources (nectar and pollen) from flowers. It investigates the strategies plants use to manage interactions with their pollinators via reward composition, and how the success of such strategies depends upon the offerings of co-flowering competitors. It explores the interaction between bees and the plants they visit under controlled conditions, involving floral surrogates. To test these ideas in field settings, analyses of floral rewards will be combined with observations of wild bee behavior to determine whether reward composition predicts which members of Sierra Nevada wildflower communities are co-foraged, and whether reward production depends on community context. The project aims to expand nutritional ecology beyond its consumer-centric focus, by asking how floral resource composition might alter forager/pollinator behavior to benefit the plant. This effort offers insight into pollen rewards, which are understudied despite their variation in composition and critical role in pollinator nutrition. Undergraduates are involved in research throughout, and this view of flowers as nutritional resources will be shared with the public via an exhibit, 'The Floral Supermarket' and the annual public Pollinator Festival at the University of Nevada, Reno's Pollinator Garden.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Although bees are well-known for their ecological and agricultural importance, much of what we know about their behavior is based on experiments involving nutritionally simplified sugar solutions. In fact, the nectar and pollen bees collect from flowers are chemically complex, and can vary substantially across plant species. Nutrition is key to bees' ability to cope with pathogens, pesticides, and other stressors. When selecting plants to support pollinators, making restoration decisions, or setting conservation priorities, it would thus be useful to understand the basic nutritional drivers of plant-pollinator interactions.</p>\n<p>We thus asked whether a nutritional perspective could shed new light on species interactions and help predict the relative success of a given plant's \"reward strategy\" in the face of competition with co-flowering neighbors. We used a framework from the field of nutritional ecology to generate hypotheses, which we then tested in lab-based studies of bumble bees and field-based studies of plant and bee communities in the Great Basin. Along the way, we developed frameworks for the study of nutritionally complex floral rewards, and launched multi-disciplinary collaborations to better characterize nectar and pollen chemistry.</p>\n<p>We generated the largest known dataset of pollen protein and lipid content from over 100 co-flowering plant species and collected data on visitation by 75 subgenera of pollen-collecting bees. We found that after accounting for variation in floral shape and plant relatedness, similarity in pollen macronutrient content predicted the degree to which plants were visited by similar bee communities. Ultimately, we discovered that pollen macronutrient content helped explain the structure of bee-plant interaction networks, revealing modules of frequently-interacting species defined by differences in pollen chemistry (nutritional niches). Plants that were protein vs. lipid-rich were equally likely to attract a diversity of bees, so nutritional diversity should be a key consideration in pollinator plantings. While working on this project, we developed an improved pipeline for the analysis of pollen chemistry, and began to uncover the climactic drivers of geographic variation in plants' pollen nutrition.</p>\n<p>Adopting a nutritional perspective also helped explain patterns of pollen transfer among co-flowering plants. We asked whether plant species offering similar resources (e.g. both rich in sugar) or distinct but complementary resources (e.g. lipid- vs. sugar-rich) were more likely to have pollen transferred between them. We characterized the macronutrient content of pollen and nectar of co-flowering wildflower species and quantified pollen transfer within and among them using more than 700 stigmas from ~150 individual plants to generate pollen movement networks. Combining information about both pollen and nectar traits revealed that species pairs offering the most nutritionally similar resources were more likely to have pollen transferred between them. We believe this is the first dataset to explore the functional ecology of nutritionally complex floral rewards in a community context.</p>\n<p>Lab-based behavioral assays showed how crucial it can be to consider the chemical complexity of floral rewards. For example, we found that nectar affected bees' responses to pollen by offering bees two-'species' arrays of artificial flowers. The effect of pollen chemical defenses depended on the presence and quality of nectar: bees discriminated against flowers with high pollen defenses when all flowers offered the same quality nectar. However, bees preferred flowers with highly defended pollen when they offered higher quality nectar, suggesting that attractive nectar chemistry can overcome the ecological costs of defended pollen. These findings presented a novel view of how plants might compete for pollination service and demonstrated that floral rewards may often interact to shape bee behavior.</p>\n<p>Nectar has its own complex chemistry, and we also explored how multiple dimensions of nectar chemistry influenced pollinator cognition. Sampling across a wide range of plant taxa, we discovered that the insect neurotransmitter octopamine is common in nectar. Octopamine modulated the behavioral effects of a co-occurring nectar chemical, caffeine, on bees in ways that might benefit plants. We continued to consider how multiple elements of nectar chemistry work together to influence bee cognition, with a special emphasis on these fascinating \"nectar neurotransmitters\".</p>\n<p>Collectively, this effort involved mentoring of two postdoctoral researchers, two PhD students, two NSF REPS fellows, and eight UNR undergraduates (including one REU project and two senior thesis projects). Graduate and Postdoctoral mentees went on to secure faculty positions or pursue careers at federal agencies, and gained teaching experience by developing their own courses or laboratory exercises. The project supported regular presentations to stakeholders (e.g. Nevada State Beekeepers Conference), and led to the creation of educational materials now used widely by the UNR Natural History Museum. Besides regular presentations at national conferences, we organized symposia relating to nutritional perspectives on pollination, participated in agency-led workshops on pollinator health, and presented multiple public lectures in Northern Nevada.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/29/2023<br>\nModified by: Anne&nbsp;S&nbsp;Leonard</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1755096/1755096_10565162_1703897191376_1__3_--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1755096/1755096_10565162_1703897191376_1__3_--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"UNR Pollinator Garden\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1755096/1755096_10565162_1703897191376_1__3_--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"UNR Pollinator Garden\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The UNR Pollinator Garden (only partly shown) was a tremendously valuable resource for our teaching, research, and outreach efforts.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Anne Leonard</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Anne&nbsp;S&nbsp;Leonard\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">UNR Pollinator Garden</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1755096/1755096_10565162_1703896937920_1__2_--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1755096/1755096_10565162_1703896937920_1__2_--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"On the hunt for bees and flowers\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1755096/1755096_10565162_1703896937920_1__2_--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"On the hunt for bees and flowers\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">On the hunt for bees and flowers: The pandemic led to some shifts in approach, as we pursued projects that were field-based and could be accomplished with social distancing.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Anne Leonard</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Anne&nbsp;S&nbsp;Leonard\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">On the hunt for bees and flowers</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1755096/1755096_10565162_1703896561891_1--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1755096/1755096_10565162_1703896561891_1--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"REPS fellows\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1755096/1755096_10565162_1703896561891_1--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"REPS fellows\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REPS fellows: We involved two post-graduates in independent research supported by an NSF REPS (Research Experience for Post-Baccalaureate Students) supplement.
