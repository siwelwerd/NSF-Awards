 "awd_abstract_narration": "NSF INCLUDES is a national initiative focused on the full participation of all of America's science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) talent in discoveries and innovation in the U.S.  By proactively seeking and effectively developing talent nationally, including among those in underserved populations, NSF INCLUDES projects affirm NSF's commitment to diversity, inclusion, and broadening participation in STEM. The NSF INCLUDES initiative is promoting collaboration among different groups committed to this common agenda with the goal of improving national coordination, sharing knowledge, and maximizing impact.\r\n\r\nThe NSF INCLUDES Coordination Hub will lead national coordination by building and sustaining a national Network among efforts to broaden participation in STEM, including but not limited to those funded by the NSF INCLUDES initiative. The Hub will strengthen the Network by fostering exchange among members; brokering connections among related efforts; offering professional learning to develop a broad leadership coalition; and devising coordinated, national-level strategy. The Hub will also support coordinated measurement of progress towards Network members' goals by developing shared measurement approaches and aggregated data analyses. By sharing the Network's results broadly, via academic journals and conferences, professional associations memberships, trade publications, and the popular press, the Hub will raise the visibility and impact of the NSF INCLUDES initiative.  In addition, the Hub will develop and share insights based on its study of the Network, through the lenses of broadening participation, network analysis, and organizational change. Together, the Coordination Hub's activities aim to build public will, advance policy, and mobilize funding across the Network.\r\n\r\nThe Hub itself is a multi-institutional coalition. SRI's partners are Education Development Center (EDC), Westat Inc., Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network, Equal Measure, the Constellations Center for Equity in Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and Digital Promise Global. ORS Impact will serve as the Hub's external evaluator.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
