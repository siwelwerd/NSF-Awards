 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prairie View A&M University and the Alief Independent School District are examining ways to recruit and retain underrepresented minority STEM teachers. Investigators will combine Community of Practice (COP) and Cultural Responsiveness (CR) theory into a framework to investigate the effectiveness of an innovation to better prepare students seeking to pursue careers as STEM teachers. They will use a mixed-methods research design to answer five research questions that a) bridge the COP/CR training with teacher efficacy, b) connect teacher competency with their mastery of the Texas College and Career Readiness standards, c) track how teachers' mastery of the Texas College and Career Readiness standards impact the performance of the students taught by the participants, d) capture the number of students transitioning to high school who select the STEM endorsement tract, and e) assess the effectiveness of the intervention.  The investigators will capture educators' confidence and ability to effectively teach and interact with middle schools via established self-report scales. Thus, the research will illuminate how these educators can affect student performance and their scores on the state's standardized tests. The underlying assumption is that teachers who undergo COP/CR training will positively influence students to pursue careers as STEM teachers and to remain in those careers.\r\n\r\nThe Community of Practice and Cultural Responsiveness practices adhere to the Framework for 21st Century Learning advocated by the Partnership for 21st Century Learning.  Approximately ten teachers will be recruited and trained, and five seventh grade science and five eighth math teachers will be placed in Alief ISD middle schools at the end of the project period. The study will address five research questions to achieve this outcome: (1) How does the infusion and training of COP/CR practices impact the efficacy of STEM teachers who teach minority students? A pre- and post-test design will be used to compare scores from the three subscales of the Teacher's Sense of Efficacy Scale. (2) To what degree do teachers who receive COP/CR training report enhanced knowledge of appropriate STEM practices as determined by the Texas Education Agency's College and Career Readiness standards?  Descriptive measures from teachers' self-report and lesson plans will provide indicators of the skills needed to motivate future teachers. (3) What are the math and science performances of students who are taught by the COP/CR training teachers? A causal-comparative design where classrooms with COP/CP teachers will be compared to classrooms taught by non-COP/CR trained teachers. Investigators also will use t-tests to test the difference in SAAR mathematics and science scores. (4) To what degree are students of the COP/CR trained teachers following a STEM endorsement path to enrolling in a STEM degree program? Investigators will apply a Pearson's Chi-square test of independence to analyze the data. (5) How has the initiative advanced the minimum Texas  STEM benchmarks for recruitment and retention of qualified STEM teachers and academic success in STEM-related subjects? Interview data from school administrators will be collected and analyzed. The project is expected to produce evidence about an effective intervention to increase the number of qualified underrepresented STEM teachers that could be replicated in other settings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Thus, we partnered with Alief Independent School District (AISD), an urban/diverse school district in Texas, to provide training in two robust teacher-training frameworks: Cultural Responsiveness (CR) and Communities of Practice (COP) principles.\n\n\nGiven that our immediate outcome was to ensure that teachers were better equipped to teach and motivate their students, at the end of the program we generated a survey that contained both quantitative and qualitative items that measured their response to the CR and COP training they received. Note that initially, some of the training was conducted face-to-face, but restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic prompted us to provide online training via recorded video modules. This allowed modules to be used by others. Below, we capture the results of the final survey that was designed to determine the degree to which participating teachers believed that both frameworks were able to impact their confidence and efficacy to teach STEM-related courses to diverse middle and high school students.\n\n\nQuantitative Questions\n\n\nWe posed items that addressed CR and inquired about COP. The 5-point response scale for each item was: Strongly Agree, Agree, Neither Agree nor Disagree, Disagree, and Strongly Disagree. The quantitative responses follow, starting with the CR principles.\n\n\nCultural Responsiveness\n\n\nThe CR items on the scale were intended to ascertain whether the training was able to address cultural responsiveness issues such as caring, high expectations, building relationships with students and their caregivers, creating lessons that cater to students learning styles, and building confidence in students to enhance their academic progress in STEM disciplines.\n\n\nFor each of the six items, no fewer than 93% of the respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the various cultural responsiveness tenets were addressed in a way that would help them better relate to their students and meet them at their point of need, and ultimately, safeguard their academic success.\n\n\nCommunities of Practice\n\n\nThe COP items were designed to capture participants perspectives of the saliency of the COP principles to which they were exposed. These included STEM classroom management essentials, creating STEM lessons for students to self-regulate their learning, and developing learning scenarios for building authentic STEM tasks.\n\n\nHere again we were pleased to learn that a vast majority of respondents expressed that they strongly agreed or agreed that the COP principles were addressed in a way that was meaningful for the success of students in STEM programs. For all six questions, no fewer than 93 percent of respondents were satisfied.\n\n\nCombination of CR and COP\n\n\nWe also asked three questions about the applicability of the combination of both sets of principles. The responses to all three questions are noteworthy in that they penetrate the heart of our intention. To illustrate, 96% of respondents believed that the combination of the two sets of principles would effectively maximize learning for students. Similarly, 91% of respondents expect to apply the principles, and 94% intend to share the information with other teachers.\n\n\nOpen Ended Questions\n\n\nWe concluded the survey by asking three open-ended questions about the efficacy of the principles. We were curious to know what about the videos was most compelling in motivating the participants to continue to grow as a STEM teacher, and how we could improve the training.\n\n\nThe responses indicated that the modules challenged teachers to apply meaningful activities for students, which was our aim. Another theme that emerged was the idea of including these modules in the schools professional development and having opportunities to model the principles in classroom settings.\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nOur intention was to provide modules that math and science teachers found useful in meeting the needs of diverse STEM students. By all appearances, over 90 percent of participants concluded that we met this goal for both the COP and CR components. They also believed that the inclusion of both was helpful in developing a more engaging and learner centered classroom culture. No doubt, there are areas for improvement. Certainly, creating more real-world experiences would help, and attempting to create professional development modules for all subjects would also be of value.
