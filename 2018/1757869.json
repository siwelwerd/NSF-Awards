 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Biomechanical Engineering Research (CBER) at the University of Delaware (UD) offers a renewal of the comprehensive Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site: \"Dare to BE FIRST\" Biomechanical Engineering Foundations in Impactful Research, Science and Technology (BE FIRST).  A rapid growth in biomedical research and related industries is projected to dramatically change the landscape for engineering in the U.S.  The employment outlook is projected to grow 23% from 2014 to 2024, which is much faster than average for all occupations (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2015).  Accordingly, there is an enormous need to provide appropriate training for the emerging workforce who will contribute to the process of translating new devices and engineering technologies from bench to bedside. This REU Site program will leverage CBER's strengths in cutting edge biomechanics research in order to expose undergraduate students to the power of quantitative skills in solving biomedical problems.    \r\n\r\nAnnually, CBER will host a total of 20 undergraduate students (10 students supported by NSF) who will spend 10 summer weeks involved in the following activities: a hands on research experience in a state-of-the-art biomechanical research lab, clinical site visits to broaden the scope of learning, scientific and professional development workshops, opportunities for networking and communication among interdisciplinary students and mentors, a research symposium where students synthesize results for diverse audience and an annual fall workshop to promote interest in biomedical engineering and the REU program. Students will be recruited from minority institutions and historically black colleges and universities around the U.S. as well as other institutions with limited research resources. The goal of this program is to improve students engineering and research skills which will influence the academic pursuits of this group of talented and diverse young engineers and scientists.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
