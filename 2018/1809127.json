 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Abstract: The exchange coupling is a fundamental property of the electron spins. The magnitude and sign of exchange coupling define the strength and direction of the interaction between spins, essential for the understanding of a variety of magnetic and spintronic phenomena. But so far the spatial dependence of exchange coupling has not been measured. This project uses homemade instruments and advanced calculations to probe in unprecedented details the exchange interactions among magnetic atoms and molecules. These activities provide fertile grounds for the training of researchers. Results from this research are transferred into the classroom for the teaching of quantum mechanics to undergraduate students in physics and engineering. In addition, the goal is to increase impact by transfer of selected results to the textbooks, similarly to previous results from the scanning tunneling microscope obtained by the investigators. Results may be applied in future magnetic technologies. Extensive commitments are made in the training of undergraduate students as summer interns and outreaching activities with the Hispanic middle school students in Southern California.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract: The Hamiltonian for a quantized spin system formed by interacting magnetic atoms and molecules adsorbed on a solid surface yields an energy spectrum (E) that depends on the exchange interaction J and the magnetic anisotropy (A). This project probes J and A between magnetic entities in four dimensions (E,x,y,z) with a homemade ultrahigh vacuum scanning tunneling microscope (STM) at 600 mK and up to 9 Tesla magnetic field. The study of the continuous interactions between two spin entities is achieved by attaching a magnetic molecule to the STM tip to sense different magnetic entities on the surface, from an isolated magnetic atom or molecule (such as metallocenes, porphyrins, and phthalocyanines) to nanoscale assemblies. The E-spectra at different tip locations, perpendicular and parallel to the surface, give the spatial dependence of J and A, and their visualization through spectromicroscopy. This project combines a joint experimental and theoretical effort to measure and understand the new information contained in the spin-spin coupling in four dimensions. The well-defined conditions of the probed systems enable rigorous comparison between experiment and theory to effectively understand spin-spin coupling at the most fundamental level. This effort has been impeded in the past due to unavailability of reliable, quantitative data.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

New techniques and methodologies based on the homemade scanning tunneling microscopes (STM) were developed to achieve these measurements. In addition, analyses of results and predictions were provided by first-principles density functional theory. As the number of atoms and electrons increased, the behavior of chemical system became harder to understand without knowing its structure through direct visualization of the chemical bonds and accurate knowledge of the excitations and energy levels. In consideration of the many-electron problem, the presence of different chemical bonds, from the weak van der Waals bonds to the strong covalent bonds, imposed particular challenges for experiment and theory to appropriately characterize them because of the diverge energy and length scales. Furthermore, typical intramolecular and intermolecular interactions had electron densities that varied at the subatomic scale. The goals in this research used recently developed inelastic tunneling probe (itProbe) to image the skeletal structure of individual molecules and the relatively weaker bonds that bound molecules together to form increasingly extended structures in self-assembly. These weak bonds included the van der Waals force, the hydrogen bond, and the halogen bond. In contrast to the stronger covalent bonds, multiplicity in bonding occurred for the weak bonds, including bifurcation in the hydrogen bond and interactions with multiple neighbors in the van der Waals and the halogen bonds. Real space imaging by the itProbe provided direct visualization of the unexpected multiplicity in the weak bonds. These results led to new understanding into the nature of the chemical interactions in molecular systems in chemistry, biology, and materials. In addition, these studies stimulated the development of terahertz (THz) spectroscopic and imaging techniques to probe low energies and excitations of these weak chemical bonds. This research sought in depth understanding of single molecule chemistry by integrating ab initio theoretical calculations and model analysis with the experimental spectroscopic and imaging efforts, leading to ?seeing is believing? and numerical values for the interaction parameters.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/11/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Wilson&nbsp;Ho</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1809127/1809127_10580026_1672194690513_Screenshot_20221227_060107--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1809127/1809127_10580026_1672194690513_Screenshot_20221227_060107--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1809127/1809127_10580026_1672194690513_Screenshot_20221227_060107--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(A to I) Series of constant-height d2I/dV2 images of a NiCp2 molecule acquired with a NiCp2-terminated tip at different sample biases.
