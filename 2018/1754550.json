 "awd_abstract_narration": "Serotonin is a neurotransmitter most commonly known for its role in depression. In mammals, serotonin can also cause the constriction of blood vessels, altering blood flow to organs throughout the body. Mammalian serotonin transporters in blood platelets remove serotonin from the blood plasma, thereby controlling serotonin's effect on blood vessels. In fishes as in mammals, serotonin levels within the blood plasma are low and elevation of circulating serotonin results in the constriction of blood vessels. However, in contrast to mammals, significant levels of serotonin have not been found within fish blood cells and it is not known how circulating serotonin levels are regulated in fish. This project will fill that gap by characterizing the serotonin transporter's role in controlling circulating levels of serotonin, and thus blood pressure and flow, in fish. Fish will be tested in water with normal oxygen levels, and in low-oxygen conditions when controlling blood flow to active tissues and organs such as the gills is most important. It is expected that this project will reveal the role of serotonin and the serotonin transporter in the control of blood pressure and flow in fish, contributing significantly to the field of cardiovascular physiology. Results may also help to answer existing questions about serotonin's role in blood flow control in mammals. The project will educate and expose underrepresented youth to science, enhance the participation of women and minorities in science, and strengthen collaborative partnerships. \r\n\r\nThe role of the serotonin transporter (SERT) in controlling circulating levels of serotonin (or hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) and, consequently, vascular resistance, in the Gulf toadfish (Opsanus beta) will be determined under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Three questions will be addressed: (1) What are the tissue distribution, transport kinetics, and pharmacological sensitivity of a teleost SERT compared to SERT of other vertebrates? (2) What is the role of systemic SERT in the control of circulating 5-HT? (3) What is the role of branchial SERT in the control of circulating 5-HT? The answers to these questions will support the central hypothesis that SERT plays an integral role in controlling circulating 5-HT and, as a result, vascular resistance, blood pressure, and blood flow in teleost fish. Advanced techniques, including fluorescent neurotransmitter imaging probes, will be applied to investigate SERT function at the cellular level. The research will reveal organs, such as the heart, and cell types, such as gill neuroepithelial cells, that are active contributors to 5-HT homeostasis. The potential role of SERT in controlling circulating 5-HT is important because uncontrolled circulating 5-HT levels would lead to an undesirable vasoconstriction of the gill and detrimental reductions in oxygen uptake, an effect that could reduce hypoxia tolerance and limit survival. Project outcomes will also contribute to understanding the possible implications of SERT activation or desensitization with environmental perturbations such as hypoxia and pharmaceutical exposure. The project's educational and outreach impacts include engaging underrepresented youth in marine science and enhancing the participation of women and minorities in science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We believed this was especially important to study because when oxygen levels in the water are too low, having too much serotonin in the blood may be harmful or even lethal in fish. This is because serotonin causes constriction of blood vessels, cutting off blood flow to important organs. We wanted to know if serotonin was removed from the blood during exposure to low oxygen to avoid reduced blood flow to important organs, and, if so, what organs might have the serotonin transporter that is responsible for removing the serotonin. In figuring this out, we could add to what is currently known about how fish respond to low oxygen in the water, an environmental condition that is happening more frequently and with higher severity due to nutrient pollution and a changing climate. We found that many organs have the serotonin transporter that is responsible for the removal of serotonin from the blood. Much to our surprise, the heart had the highest amount of serotonin transporter and the greatest serotonin uptake  and having high serotonin transporter in the heart might be a common trait amongst fish. We also found that when oxygen levels in the water were low, more serotonin is removed from the blood and blood serotonin levels are lower than when oxygen levels were normal. Our findings describe a paradigm shift to current thinking in which the role of circulating serotonin is underestimated or ignored. Another major outcome of this project was sequencing the Gulf toadfish genome, which has greatly contributed to known sequence information of the vertebrate serotonin system and has contributed to the overall understanding of the genome of a family of ecologically important fishes with unique life histories, behavior, and physiology that has made them popular model organisms. Combined with the genome, during this funding we figured out how to to breed Gulf toadfish in the lab, which could have potential impacts on other disciplines as toadfish could make a great model for the study of kidney function, muscle function, liver function, vocal communication, sickle cell disease, osmoregulation, and more. Having the ability to look at the development of these different systems in this fish could be extremely beneficial. During our project, junior scientists have learned various techniques including molecular biology, whole animal physiology, experimental design, critical thinking, scientific writing, and science communication. We continue to bring underrepresented groups in science into the lab so that research in the lab will make a positive impact on the development of minority scientists.The scientific outcomes have been incorporated into introductory-level chemistry courses and upper-level physiology courses.

We also gave  20 presentations to the general public, including elementary school children that are from groups that are underrepresented in STEM.
