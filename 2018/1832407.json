 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will address the relationship between the spatial organization of urban components and the delivery and distribution of urban ecosystem services such as air filtration, local climate regulation, and noise reduction.  To better identify how the spatial organization of urban structure interacts with environmental and ecological phenomena to produce and distribute urban ecosystem services, this project will help build the scientific foundation for understanding urban structure-ecological function interaction by testing the relationship between common compositions of urban structure classes, including the integration of the vertical dimension of building, and indicators of ecosystem services.  Modeling of urban structure-ecological function relationships at a fine spatial scale-will provide geographers, urban planners, and engineers with the scientific foundation necessary for planning effective interventions to promote urban sustainability and human well-being.  Project findings will benefit researchers and public officials working in the fields of urban planning and design, environmental health, environmental justice, and environmental modeling.  To complement the basic research components of this project, special educational outreach activities will introduce students from a diverse set of urban backgrounds, including members of groups underrepresented in STEM, to concepts and hands-on data-collection and -analysis activities relating to ecosystems services in their localities. \r\n\r\nRapid growth in the global urban population poses major challenges to the health and well-being of urban dwellers and requires innovative approaches to urban planning.  The investigators will conduct a multi-dimensional urban structure classification and comparative analysis of the relationships between urban structure and surface temperature in seven U.S. cities.  A more focused case study in Philadelphia will address the urban ecosystem services of air pollution and noise mitigation through a new mobile data-collection and analytic scheme. This project will explore answers to several critical questions regarding sustainable urban design:  Are common multi-dimensional urban structure classes similar across cities, and are they stable across scales of aggregation?  Are urban surface temperature signatures explained better by such urban classes than by individual land-cover classes?  How is urban structure associated with ecosystem services such as air pollution and noise mitigation?  How do different configurations of urban vegetation help mitigate air and noise pollution in cities such as Philadelphia?  The project will include the development and verification of the multi-dimensional, functional urban land-cover classification using multiple case study cities in the U.S.  Research activities will include spatial and statistical analysis of land use and land cover, elevation, and other remote sensing data as well as a stratified sampling scheme of fine-scale, spatially explicit measurements of a series of urban ecosystem service indicators, including surface and ambient temperature, air pollution, and noise.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Recent NSF-funded research has provided valuable insights into how urban structure influence key ecosystem services, such as temperature regulation and air quality, highlighting the need for informed urban planning to enhance sustainability and public health.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\"><strong>Urban Structure and Heat</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">The connection between urban structure and heat distribution is vital in combating the urban heat island effect. The Structure of Urban Landscapes (STURLA) classification was instrumental in this study, sorting urban areas by their physical components like vegetation, buildings, and water bodies. Through STURLA, we determined how diverse urban structures affect surface temperature. Dense urban areas like city centers tend to be hotter, while areas with ample vegetation and water are cooler. This trend holds true across cities like Philadelphia, New York City, and Berlin. Temporal analysis highlights the dynamic nature of urban climates. Changes in urban structures from 2008 to 2017 in New York City, such as alterations in water bodies, low-rise buildings, and pavement, significantly impacted surface temperatures. This underscores the necessity for adaptable urban planning to address the changing effects of urbanization on local climates. Additionally, a spatiotemporal model was developed to predict fine-scale air temperatures (AT) accurately using remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) data. Validated in Philadelphia, this model demonstrated a strong correlation between LST and AT, providing a detailed and continuous understanding of urban heat patterns.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\"><strong>Urban Structure and Air Pollution</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">Air pollution, particularly particulate matter (PM2.5) and black carbon (BC), poses severe health risks in urban areas. This project investigated how urban structure affect air pollution distribution and identified areas with high pollution levels, emphasizing the implications for environmental justice in the urban areas such as Philadelphia city with high percentage of minority population.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">Mobile monitoring technique, using portable air quality instruments on the roof of vehicles and driving around Philadelphia city (Figure 1), provided detailed insights into the spatiotemporal variations of air pollution. By continuously measuring pollutant concentrations across Philadelphia, we mapped air pollution hotspots (Figure 2). We show that pollution levels peak during morning rush hours and were most prevalent in districts like North Delaware and River Wards. This detailed mapping is crucial for effective air quality management in urban planning.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">Integrating STURLA with mobile monitoring data, we linked urban structures with air pollution levels. Certain STURLA classes, such as areas with a mix of grass, pavement, and low-rise buildings, had higher average PM2.5 concentrations. Similarly, areas with more trees, grass, bare soil, water, and pavement had higher BC concentrations. Machine learning models combined with STURLA were able to predict the spatial distribution of air pollution across the city (Figure 3). Using these predicted models, spatial analysis revealed that air pollution disproportionately affects marginalized communities. Higher concentrations of PM2.5 and BC were found in areas with a higher percentage of non-white populations and higher asthma prevalence, indicating environmental inequities (Figure 4). These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to reduce air pollution in vulnerable communities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\"><strong>Additional Findings</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">The research extended beyond heat and air pollution to explore urban ecosystem services like microbial diversity. Utilizing mobile monitoring, it assessed airborne microbe diversity across urban environments, including outdoor areas and indoor-transit systems (Figure 5). Findings showed outdoor air harbored more diverse microbial communities than indoor-transit systems, varying significantly based on urban structure. This diversity variation impacts human health and ecosystem functioning, emphasizing microbial considerations in urban planning. The study stressed using advanced statistical models considering spatial and temporal autocorrelation. Incorporating these dependencies improved temperature and air pollution predictions, highlighting the importance of sophisticated analytical techniques in environmental studies.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\"><strong>Conclusion</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The NSF-funded research significantly advanced understanding of how urban structures impact ecosystem services like temperature regulation and air quality. Innovative methodologies like STURLA classification, integrated with mobile monitoring and machine learning, provided insights for sustainable urban planning. Findings emphasize the need for targeted interventions addressing environmental justice issues, such as air pollution's disproportionate impact on marginalized communities. The research also highlights the dynamic nature of urban climates, underlining the importance of adaptive planning for managing heat-related challenges effectively.</p>\n<p>Overall, this research offers a comprehensive framework for urban planners and policymakers to create healthier, more sustainable cities by considering the intricate relationships between urban structures and ecosystem services. Moreover, the project provided training opportunities for undergraduate, graduate and middle school students, including a service-learning course named 'Ecosystem Service Learning' at Villanova University. This course facilitated interactions between undergraduate students and middle school students from nearby under-resourced communities, focusing on environmental justice and ecosystem services through activities like urban temperature measurement, mobile air quality monitoring, data visualization, and air quality mapping.</p>\n</div><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 06/11/2024<br>\nModified by: Peleg&nbsp;Kremer</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1832407/1832407_10558273_1718109155082_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1832407/1832407_10558273_1718109155082_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1832407/1832407_10558273_1718109155082_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 3.
