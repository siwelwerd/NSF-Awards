 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support travel for U.S. researchers to a US-China workshop on Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases in Shenzhen, China. The workshop has two objectives. The first objective is to review recent research progress in ecology and infectious disease research and identify key gaps in data, information, and knowledge. The second objective is to identify research priority areas and discuss possible mechanisms for joint research and education activities in ecology and infectious disease research between the US and China. The emergence and re-emergence of human, animal and plant infectious diseases around the world have been a major concern for various economic sectors (e.g., crop production, livestock production, forestry), biodiversity, and public health and security. For example, a number of large-scale epidemics of infection diseases (e.g., H5N1, H7N9, Ebola and Zika) in the past two decades have resulted in substantial losses of human life, as well as in increased economic burdens. Researchers from the USA and China have been at the forefront of research, education, surveillance, control and prevention of many infectious diseases, and this workshop brings together the leading researchers in this research area from the US and China to communicate and synthesize current knowledge of epidemiology, ecology and evolution of infectious diseases. \r\n\r\nBy identifying and assessing major gaps in data, information and knowledge in the EEID, this workshop is going to contribute to the global community's effort and advance our ability and skills in predicting and mapping hot-spots, hot-moments, emergence, spread, and persistence of infectious diseases in the near future. Specific broader impacts from the workshop include a white paper (to be published in a peer-reviewed journal) on the current status, gaps, and research priorities in ecology and evolution of infectious diseases, training opportunities for US faculty and students, and network building opportunities for researchers and institutions from the US.",

For example, a number of large-scale epidemics of infection diseases (e.g., highly pathogenic avian influenza, Ebola and Zika) in the past two decades have resulted in substantial losses of economy, human life and the society. Researchers from the USA and China have been at the forefront of research, education, surveillance, control and prevention of infectious diseases in China, USA, and many countries in the world. To address the emerging need for further broadening and strengthening collaboration between US and Chinese researchers in the ecology and evolution of infectious diseases (EEID), we organized a China-US (NSFC-NSF) workshop on the Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases in April 9-13, 2018, Shenzhen, China. The workshop was co-sponsored by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and China National Natural Science Foundation (NSFC), and the local host institution is the Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention Center (Shenzhen CDC).

Third, the workshop assessed and identified infectious diseases that are of interest to both China and USA participants.
