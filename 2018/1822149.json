 "awd_abstract_narration": "Moore's Law scaling of semiconductor technology has been the single biggest driver of economic growth worldwide through its revolutionary impact on communications and computation. At the same time, discovery and technological activity in the life sciences has exploded. Life sciences efforts have, however, benefited little from advances in semiconductor technologies beyond the dramatic improvements in computation infrastructure and higher performance cameras for microscopy. The Center on Biological Applications of Solid-State Systems (C-BASS) seeks to transform both the biotechnology and semiconductor sectors by forging new connections between these two largely disjoint ecosystems and by training a generation of scientists and engineers well versed in both fields. \r\n\r\nAt the City University of New York (CUNY), C-BASS the focus will be integration of nanofabrication methodologies with biological systems on order to create a seamless interface between devices and living systems. We have support integrated activities of a range of stakeholders including educational institutions, large and small companies, and international partners. The results of the C-BASS effort at CUNY will provide insights and techniques relevant to bio/device interfacing that will enable transformation of a range of fields including biology, biomedical engineering, semiconductor technology, and medicine.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
