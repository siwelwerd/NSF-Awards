 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project acquires a high-resolution scanner that can obtain detailed 3D images at the micron or sub-micron level of a broad range of samples (ranging from biological specimens to biomaterials to 3D printed objects to soil samples) without destroying or altering the sample. This investment supports some research communities in natural and biological structures, and advanced multi-user research in several departments.  Projects are being carried out with the instrument in the areas of biology, chemistry, geology and cybersecurity for 3D manufacturing.  The resources will be shared by researchers from the university and local small biotech and pharmaceutical industries.\r\n \r\nThe system replaces a 12-year-old micro Computational Tomography (micro-CT) unit, which will be relocated to a new facility on the Newark campus of the university. Investigators from the campus have been using the facility, but are hindered by the current location in Piscataway, requiring traveling to and from the facility for the projects that do not require the higher resolution, lower scanning times, and temperature controlled scanning conditions associated with the nano-CT to be acquired. The investigators are thus leveraging the purchase of a SkyScan 1272 nano-CT for Piscataway researchers that require its capabilities to extend micro-CT imaging resources to the Newark campus. This multi-user imaging facility will be managed by full-time staff having multimodal imaging expertise. The nano-CT system will become one of five complementary imaging modalities available at Rutgers University mult-iuser Molecular Imaging Center (RUMIC).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
