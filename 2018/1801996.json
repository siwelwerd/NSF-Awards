 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has and why there is no antimatter in the universe. One of the primary areas to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be, and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). Neutrinos are those elementary particles that interact with practically nothing else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless. Like other elementary particles, they were believed to have an antimatter counterpart, the antineutrino. Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they did undergo whenever there was an interaction. But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes as well as others form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model. This project focuses on the continued development and operation of new instrumentation for a detector based on liquid argon and the invention and incorporation of new analytical techniques to search for the so-called sterile neutrino, whose existence is suggested by BSM theories. \r\n\r\nThere is currently a large interest in experimental particle physics in Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPC) spurred in part by the proposed Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) project at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) and in neutrino physics in general. This award supports work which furthers the development and impact of LArTPC technology applications, using the MicroBooNE experiment at FNAL. This experiment will further the study of potential signals of sterile neutrinos. Sterile neutrinos are proposed BSM particles that could explain aspects of cosmology and astrophysics such as Dark Matter. MicroBooNE is in the process of making a variety of interesting physics measurements, as well as serving as a proving ground for new hardware techniques relevant for future experiments. Among MicroBooNE's primary physics goals is to provide a cross-check of the \"low-energy excess\" of electron neutrino events previously identified by the MiniBooNE experiment. There have been recent \"hints\" that there may be a new type of neutrino, the so-called sterile neutrino. The MicroBoone experiment, with its superior LArTPC detector, should clarify the situation: either rule out or confirm the sterile neutrino evidence. \r\n\r\nThe PI's Group has broader impacts aspects that address development of a globally competitive STEM workforce; increased participation of women and minorities; improved teacher development; improved undergraduate education; and increased public scientific literacy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe purpose of this grant was to search for indications of physics beyond the Standard Model, in the neutrino sector.     This is considered a promising place to look for new physics because anomalies--intriguing results that motivate new studies but do not rise to the level of \"discovery\"--have been observed in a number of short baseline (sbl) neutrino oscillation experiments.\n\nOur first area of study during this grant involved analysis of data from the MiniBooNE experiment.   This sbl experiment first reported an anomaly in 2007.    During this proposal, the MIT group led analyses of data from the final run of MiniBooNE.     These studies confirmed the previously observed anomalies,  raised the significance of the result to close to the discovery level (4.8sigma), and presented two-dimensional (2D) distributions of the kinematic quantities for the first time.     These papers now have more than 625 citations.\n\nOne common beyond Standard Model (BSM) explanation for MiniBooNE involves introducing a sterile neutrinos--that is, neutrinos without standard model interactions.  A model where one is added to the three known neutrinos, \"3+1\", is most commonly invoked.   However, our 2D studies disfavored a simple 3+1 model, as did a global analysis of the world's short baseline data performed during this grant period.   This global fit now has 158 citations, demonstrating its impact.  In that paper, we also studied 3+2, and 3+1+decay models.  In 3+1+decay, we introduce the idea that the 4th mass state introduced in order to include the sterile flavor can decay.    A modest extension of this is to also allow a heavier (MeV-scale) partner, called a \"neutrissimo\".     In the final two years of this grant we developed a neutrissimo model and showed that this not only explains the MiniBooNE data well if the neutrissimo mass is 300 MeV,  but it also is consistent with MINERvA data.   Two papers were published on this.\n\nWe explored for experimental explanations of the MiniBooNE result in two ways.  First, we analyzed data from the MicroBooNE experiment.   Second, we constructed the CCM experiment during this grant period.\n\nOur group was a founding member-group of MicroBooNE in 2008 and so it was very exciting to finally see results in 2022.   Our analysis was deep-learning based, leveraging developments on AI from industry, and actually giving back ideas too.      This was one of three analyses asking if the MiniBooNE signal is due to neutrino interactions. The conclusion of  our analysis was that the signal can be at most 40% neutrino interactions at 95% confidence level (CL).   When the three analyses were combined, the experiment set  a limit of 50% at 95% CL.   This has important impacts on BSM models.    For example, this means  that 3+1  can explain, at most, half the signal, which makes more complex models more likely.      The MicroBooNE paper was of great interest to the community and was featured as an Editors Choice in Physical Review Letters. MicroBooNE was a liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) detector.   Although it was only 170 tons, it represents a valuable source of \"lessons learned\" for the 17 kt DUNE modules proposed for construction in the late 2020's.\n\nCCM is also a liquid-argon based detector, but unlike MicroBooNE, it uses only light collection and does not include a TPC.    This experiment, running at LANL, was constructed on-time and on-budget during the covid crisis--a major accomplishment.   It is now running.    Our group is performing a neutrissimo search in this detector, as well as a search for the QCD axion.    We constructed the wavelength-shifting foils for the prototype detector and assembled and tested the veto PMTs for the final detector during this grant period.\n\nThe above has summarized the work that we published during this grant period in 22 papers to which we made direct and essential contribution.     These papers now have more than 900 citations.   This grant resulted in two Ph.D. theses and supported four graduate students.   The group supported by the grant was consistently had more than 33% minority and female participation.      The broader impacts of this grant included multiple outreach talks by the PI.    \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/11/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Janet M Conrad"
