 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I project will explore the potential benefits of a sine wave shaped wheel compared to a traditional circular wheel for the central pivot irrigation industry. The central pivot irrigation industry is an essential segment of the agriculture industry and this project aims to deliver a superior wheel that solves the persistent issue of trench-digging that leads to equipment breakdown, down time, lost profits, and crop-loss. The broader significance of eliminating trench-digging would be significant savings for farmers, distributors and consumers. Agriculture is the largest industry in the world, and developing a wheel that eliminates an issue that plagues the industry is the central goal of this project. The development of a sine wave wheel also potentially impact other fields as the technology can be used in over one-hundred different industries.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe technical innovation of this project is creating a wheel that is non-circular. The wheel will exhibit the blending of multiple shapes in one design including a sine wave, cube, circle and hexagon. It will be approximately 4.5 feet tall, and weighing approximately 400lbs for use in the farming industry. The concept is to create two wheels in tandem where the sine waves are out-of-phase from one another. The front wheel would create a left-right-left path into the soil, much like the path a snake would leave behind traversing soil. The rear wheel would move in an opposite right-left-right configuration leaving a double helix footprint in its wake. The opposing wheels would push the soil back toward center, eliminating the largest issue plaguing the industry: trench digging. The sine wave wheel technology has already been scientifically proven on a smaller scale in the skateboarding industry to reduce friction, increase longevity, increase off-road ability, and increase speed. Multiple wheel iterations will be manufactured and subsequently tested in this project using off-the-shelf hubs within the industry and rubber tires. The wheel will not be pneumatic and will never go flat.",

Shark Wheel took its reinvention of the wheel with scientifically proven advantages and applied for the SBIR NSF Phase I grant to develop a wheel that could solve the pain points of many farmers.</p>\n<p>After performing dozens of customer discovery interviews, Shark Wheel came to understand the market and the needs and desires of farmers. A non-pneumatic, modular wheel design that minimized rutting and still provided a cost-effective solution was desired by every single individual from distributors to end users. Shark Wheel began the R&amp;D process incorporating the requested parameters into its patented sine wave wheel geometry.</p>\n<p>The Shark Wheel is named after the shape of shark jaws and through many iterations, Shark Wheel created another biomimetic design for its tire based on the shape of seagull wings. The flexing non-pneumatic, modular lugs of the tire design approximated the flotation of a pneumatic tire. The sine wave shape of the Shark Wheel was placed in the standard tandem configuration on central pivot irrigation machines and the result was a wheel that did not go over the same track as the wheel in front of it. The front wheel moved left-right-left, while the rear wheel moved right-left-right effectively creating a helix shape in the soil. In contrast to a traditional wheel that continues to move along the same track over and over again digging a rut, the Shark Wheel disrupted the soil in a snake-like shape, while the rear wheel pushed the soil back to where it began. This greatly minimized the industry-wide issue of rutting. Shark Wheel estimates an average farmer can save over $27,000 by switching to a sine wave wheel geometry because of less down time due to flat tires, less rutting and greater crop yield.</p>\n<p>Shark Wheel anticipates that its sine wave wheel technology will advance scientific knowledge. The Shark Wheel was invented by observing how nature prefers alternating motions. This is seen in how radio waves and ocean waves move, to how fish and sharks swim, to how the planets move around the sun and even how humans walk with an alternating gait. Similar to how Tesla proved the advantages of an alternating current over direct current, the Shark Wheel will show that alternating physical geometries have inherent advantages.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Shark Wheel believes that its technology will advance knowledge across a variety of industries by rewriting old rules. The circular wheel was seen as a starting point and engineers attempted to figure out how to improve a circular wheel. Shark Wheel aims to inspire the next generation to think outside the box and question if the circular wheel should even be the starting point.</p>\n<p>The broader impact of the Shark Wheel will be seen on a national scale. A technology with the potential to save $27,000 per farming season for over 2 million farmers nationwide has a large impact on the economy. Not only will farmers be less reliant on current government subsidies, but a higher crop yield per farm will drive down food prices due to the basic laws of supply and demand. More nutritious foods, higher cost foods will be available to lower income families, for example. There will be a trickle-down effect on the economy as a whole.</p>\n<p>The wheel is a ubiquitous part of society and can be seen in everything from military vehicles to strollers to wheelchairs to roller conveyances in the oil and gas industry and even inside printers. Shark Wheel has plans in place to enter over 100 industries and impact each in a significant way. Imagine military vehicles using a wheel that can save fuel and have amphibious characteristics. Imagine electric buses across the country that needs to be charged 20% less often because of its wheel geometry. Imagine a wheelchair user being able to go over wet grass at a soccer game or soft sand at the beach. Shark Wheel considers its wheel a technology that can be applied to many things in our everyday lives. Shark Wheel is eager to make a positive, wide-spread impact.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/09/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Zack&nbsp;Fleishman</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1747188/1747188_10526662_1541743207827_modularfarmingwheelinfield--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1747188/1747188_10526662_1541743207827_modularfarmingwheelinfield--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Shark Wheel Modular Pivot Wheel\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1747188/1747188_10526662_1541743207827_modularfarmingwheelinfield--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Shark Wheel Modular Pivot Wheel\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Sine wave shaped, non-pneumatic, modular farming wheel.
