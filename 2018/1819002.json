 "awd_abstract_narration": "New computational algorithms are developed for solving sparse optimization problems. These are large, complex problems that arise in science, engineering, and industry where the goal is to operate a large interconnected system in an efficient way.  Applications range from power grids to air traffic control systems to the fabrication of computer chips. A target area in the project is optimal control, a technology which has a wide array of uses that include space flight maneuvers, the optimal design of aerodynamic shapes, the optimal design of manufacturing processes, and biotechnology; for example, the development of effective vaccination and treatment plans for a disease. The optimization algorithms are targeted to sparse problems which often arise when a dynamic process which evolves continuously in time, such as the motion of a robot's arm, is replaced by discrete movements that are computationally tractable.  The algorithms are faster and achieve greater accuracy than was previously possible. The research has impact on the development of human resources through the training of students with both gender and ethnic diversity. To maximize the impact of the research, high-quality software will be developed and made widely available.\r\n\r\nA new framework will be developed for solving large-scale sparse constrained nonlinear optimization problems based on a new fast robust accurate solver for polyhedral constrained problems. At the same time that the new optimization framework is developed, it will be used in a new approach for solving optimal control problems based on hp-orthogonal collocation.  The optimization research will focus on the extension of techniques for solving polyhedral constrained optimization problems to the treatment of general nonlinear constraints. The solver will require only first-order information and will be built around a new tight bound for the error in a solution to an optimization problem in terms of the violation in the first-order optimality conditions.  Sparsity in the constraints will be exploited throughout the solution process.  Phase one of the solver seeks to identify active constraints, while phase two strives for superlinear convergence using a gradient-based method such as the conjugate gradient method.  The switch between the two phases is controlled by the error estimator.  The new optimization framework will be used to continue the development of hp-orthogonal collocation techniques for solving optimal control problems.  In particular, the fast and accurate optimization scheme is instrumental in the hp-techniques since better estimates for the error in the discrete approximation to the control problem yield a better choice for the mesh, and a much faster solution of the control problem. Mesh placement techniques, as opposed to mesh refinement techniques, will be used to further improve the mesh.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
