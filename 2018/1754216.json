 "awd_abstract_narration": "Streams and rivers are important for the removal of organic matter transported from land as water moves across landscapes.  Many questions remain about how organic matter is removed from freshwaters.  A key challenge is that not all organic matter is the same.  Organic matter dissolved in freshwaters is made up of many different compounds. These compounds range in age, source, and chemical composition, all of which can influence how fast they are processed.  To overcome this challenge, researchers will collect real-time sensor data and design field-scale experiments to measure how fast organic matter is removed by streams. The project aims to test hypotheses about what processes control the removal of different types of organic matter from streams and rivers.  This is important because organic matter provides energy that supports food webs, and can pollute downstream ecosystems. Organic matter processing can also determine rates of greenhouse emissions from streams and rivers to the atmosphere. This research will also provide valuable opportunities for high school teachers to engage in investigations that will enhance their ability to meet Next-Generation Science standards.\r\n\r\nWhat processes drive organic carbon removal in streams, and how does organic carbon removal regulate the degree to which running waters are biological reactors versus exporters of organic carbon?  These are key unresolved questions in carbon cycle research.  This project will develop a proof-of-concept approach to test the hypothesis that non-additive effects of mixed organic matter sources (i.e. priming) control organic carbon removal in streams.  Data products will include estimates of organic carbon turnover distance derived from ecosystem metabolism and stream chemistry, as well as empirical measures of organic carbon removal from ecosystem-level experiments that use single-source and mixed organic carbon additions.  Project data and computer source codes will be shared openly via HydroShare and GitHub, respectively.  The research will be conducted at Flathead Lake Biological Station and the researchers will partner with the Station?s recently funded SensorSpace, a community facility for construction and testing of novel environmental sensors, as well as a test bed for integrating sensor-based data into Next-Generation Science curricula.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary goal of this project was to understand how dissolved organic carbon fuels microbial activity in streams and rivers.  This is important because inland streams and rivers are often sources of atmospheric carbon dioxide, an important greenhouse gas.  We received funds to conduct proof-of-concept data collection.  Toward this end, we experimentally added dissolved organic carbon to streams in Montana, USA and measured microbial conversion of the organic matter to carbon dioxide.  The materials we added were glucose (a simple sugar) and plant leachate (more complex dissolved organic carbon) that were labeled with the stable isotope 13-C.  We were able to detect the 13-C label in the carbon dioxide pool in both types of experimental addition.   Both types of organic material were quickly used by microbes, with 20-40% of the added substrate being used within minutes.  Much of the rest of the added substrate was used by microbes within 24 hours of addition.  Our experiments produced interesting results that show dissolved organic carbon use by microbes in streams can support much of what is measured as community respiration, and that microbes have a large role to play in the emission of carbon dioxide from streams.  The project also provided important training opportunities to undergraduates, graduate students, and a postdoc though collaborative work among three universities: Utah State, Virginia Tech, and University of Montana.  The project collaborated with SensorSpace at Flathead Lake Biological Station, to inform future sensor designs for water quality studies.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/02/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michelle A Baker"
