 "awd_abstract_narration": "This National Science Foundation award provides support for a CBMS Regional Conference in\u00a0the Mathematical Sciences on the topic \"Applications of Polynomial\u00a0Systems,\" to be hosted at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, TX,\u00a0from June 4, 2018, to June 8, 2018. Sponsored by the Conference Board of\u00a0the Mathematical Sciences, each five-day conference in this Regional\u00a0Conference series features a distinguished lecturer who delivers ten\u00a0lectures on a topic of important current research in one sharply focused\u00a0area of the mathematical sciences; the lecturer subsequently prepares an\u00a0expository monograph based upon these lectures. The principal lecturer\u00a0for this conference is David A. Cox, the William J. Walker\u00a0Professor of Mathematics at Amherst College.\u00a0\u00a0Professor Cox is a\u00a0world-renowned master expositor and award-winning author of several\u00a0popular and highly-cited books in the mathematical area of applied\u00a0algebraic geometry. While this field of mathematics dates back at least\u00a0as far as the 18th century, developments in the affordability of\u00a0computers with substantial memory and parallel processing power have led\u00a0to a modern renaissance in both practical applications and new\u00a0computational questions. Professor Cox's lectures will discuss\u00a0historical developments of the area in light of modern perspectives,\u00a0leading up to current research and applications to such diverse\u00a0fields as computer aided design, rigidity of mechanical linkages, and\u00a0chemical reaction networks. Each pair of lectures by Professor Cox will\u00a0develop a chosen topic and be followed by a further lecture by a\u00a0specialist he has hand-picked to provide a deeper look at the forefront\u00a0of current research on that topic. Additional conference activities will\u00a0help participants develop a broad and deep understanding of current\u00a0research problems while also providing opportunities for young\u00a0researchers and members of underrepresented groups in mathematics to\u00a0interact with leaders in the area and with each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Cox will lecture on the study of polynomial systems via\u00a0methods of algebraic geometry and commutative algebra, including 1) a\u00a0history of results underpinning computational methods in algebraic\u00a0geometry and commutative algebra; 2) modern computational approaches to\u00a0solving polynomial systems and recent advances; and 3) a selection of\u00a0current applications, with an eye toward helping participants solve\u00a0their own applied problems. Specific lecture pair topics will include\u00a0Elimination Theory, Polynomial Systems in the Real World, Geometric\u00a0Modeling, Geometric Constraint Theory, and Chemical Reaction Networks.\u00a0Supplementary conference activities will include a poster session, a software demonstration, a panel discussion, and a problem session\u00a0designed to help new researchers enter the field through active\u00a0participation. The conference is also anticipated to have significant\u00a0regional impact by bolstering collaboration among the strong\u00a0concentration of researchers in applied and computational algebraic\u00a0geometry in the Texas area.
