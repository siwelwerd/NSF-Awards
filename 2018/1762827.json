 "awd_abstract_narration": "Living organisms, such as fish, birds, insects, tend to organize themselves into well-defined patterns while performing collective tasks. The current project seeks to understand the role of the environment on the patterns and modes of swimming that can be observed in schools of fish, including the gaits of locomotion, geometrical organization, and synchronization. When fish swim and interact in a viscous fluid media, they experience the flow-mediated drag forces that affect their efficiency and the energy expenditure. The current project is devoted to a search of specific swimming modes that are best suited for certain tasks, for example, in providing the lowest energy expenditure, or the highest speed of motion, given certain constraints, of a collective swimming unit. The fundamental questions are whether, how and why these modes differ or don't differ depending on the task at hand, and how the disturbances in the fluid media, such as wakes, currents, etc., will affect them. This knowledge will help manage and protect natural fish habitats, and assist in engineering and design of autonomous bio-inspired robotic vehicles for various missions. As a part of an educational and outreach program, an interactive software Virtual Robofish will be developed to demonstrate the principles of pattern formation in fish schools to high-school students.\r\n\r\nThe current project seeks to combine fully-resolved hydrodynamic simulations of flexible swimming bodies that self-propel in a viscous fluid media, with gradient-free optimization procedures, in order to reveal and understand the optimal modes of collective bio-locomotion that optimize certain objective functions. Among the objective functions to be considered are the swimming efficiency, swimming speed, and an acoustic signature of a collective swarm. The optimum patterns found via fully-resolved viscous flow simulations will be compared with a low-order finite-dipole potential flow model in order to understand the importance of morphology, kinematics, inertial and viscous effects, omitted in a low-order model, on dynamics of collective swimming. Both the full Navier-Stokes model and the low-order potential flow model will be enhanced to introduce the effect of flow disturbances, such as vortex wakes, velocity currents, etc. The effect that such disturbances have on the optimized swimming modes will be investigated. The generated knowledge will lead to a greater understanding of the principles of self-organization in biological systems, and to practical advances in design, engineering and control of underwater robotic swarms for national security and health applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

To this end, an optimization algorithm was developed [1, 2] and coupled to a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver that calculates the hydrodynamic forces on the swimmers' surfaces and estimates efficiency of collective swimming in a specific schooling configuration. The optimization algorithm then selects the most efficient kinematic gaits and synchronization patterns in a school. The optimization for a start-up acceleration condition (acceleration from rest) was performed in this project. For a single swimmer, the optimum kinematic gait was identified as the one that produces a reverse von Karman vortex street wake (Figure 1), conducive of an efficient propulsion as observed in live fish [3]. For fish swimming in a phalanx school arrangement (side-by-side), an optimum configuration has been identified [4] that retains the following features: a) An optimum kinematic gait for a collective swimming in a phalanx school is identical to an optimum swimming gait of a single swimmer (Figure 2), irrespective of a separation distance between fish within the range investigated (between one and four fish lengths) , b) The synchronized motions (i.e. either in-phase or an anti-phase) are preferred over the other phase lags, with the anti-phase motion corresponding to a global optimum (Figure 3), c) There is an optimum separation distance between the swimmers, about two fish lengths, where the propulsive efficiency in school is maximized (and is higher than the efficiency of the individual swimmer) for the parameter range considered (Figure 4). While denser schools result in a continuous increase of the group thrust performance, the input energy of swimming also increases in dense schools (Figures 5, 6). The optimization results regarding the schooling performance will thus depend on a precise definition of the objective function whose minimum or maximum is sought. The current study suggests that one of the potential driving factors for fish to swim in schools might be the considerations of the energetic benefits.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The identified optimum strategies of undulatory propulsion and phase synchronization during collective locomotion will be useful for design and control of underwater swarms of autonomous vehicles performing a range of scientific or defense-related tasks.&nbsp;The current project&nbsp;provided an opportunity for workforce development and education: several graduate and undergraduate students were involved in a scientific research, conference presentations and academic publishing.
