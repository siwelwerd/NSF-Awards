 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science and the University of Connecticut Neag School of Education will develop a comprehensive online professional development program for high school science and mathematics teachers. The program model will be designed for teachers to integrate computational thinking into their science and mathematics practice. The research will study how and under what conditions integrated science, mathematics, and computational approaches will effectively develop teachers' understanding of computational thinking; improve teachers' instructional practice; and will transfer computational thinking concepts to their math and science students. As a result of the project, teachers will be able to enhance student learning in science and mathematics using computation to develop their own models, algorithms, and tools to analyze real-world data and associated problems. Teachers will engage in this online professional development model from across the country, with research results and educational materials shared online, through publications and education journals, and professional science and mathematics education conferences. This project was submitted in response to the NSF Dear Colleague Letter DRK12 Advancing STEM + Computing (17-149) and is supported by the STEM + Computing Program that advances research and development of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to the integration of computing within science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teaching and learning for preK-12 students in both formal and informal settings. STEM+C supports research on how students learn to think computationally to solve interdisciplinary problems in the STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThe research and development will combine an online teacher professional development program with research that investigates how well teachers learn computational thinking in an online setting and how and under what conditions they transfer the computational thinking concepts to students in their math or science classes. The research will result in a well-designed model for an online, scalable teacher professional development for the integration of computational thinking in science and mathematics education and how teachers gain content knowledge and pedagogical skills. Project results will include a cadre of teachers who understand how to engage students in computational thinking concepts within the traditional HS science and mathematics curriculum and who are able to use computational approaches within the science and mathematics disciplines with their students to solve disciplinary problems. Research results and professional development materials will be available for use by teacher educators, professional developers, and others developing HS programs in computational thinking.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The project consisted of four primary activities: 1) design and development of an online professional development (PD) course in computational thinking; 2) delivery of the course to teachers around the country though in-person workshops followed by the online course; 3) research testing the efficacy of the PD; and 4) sharing both the online materials developed and research results. The project combined creation of a primarily online PD program with research that explored how well teachers learn CT in an online setting.</p>\n<p>The online course uses compelling examples to demonstrate CT concepts such as modeling and abstraction of complex problems, reformulating and decomposing difficult problems into simpler ones, representing and managing problem data, designing efficient and effective procedures, and assessing heuristic procedures. The notion that computing is a tool that offers capabilities that can augment and enhance human thinking is a recurring theme woven throughout the course, as is the notion that most teachers already include many CT practices in their teaching.</p>\n<p>The course consists of the ten regular units, plus an introductory unit that introduces the course goals, online platform, and basic concepts in CT. Each unit follows a similar pedagogical sequence from initial context and problem to computational perspective to concept generalization and transfer. Some units take an inquiry-based approach, while others take a more narrative approach. Most units include interaction with computational artifacts, such as spreadsheets, that are integrated into the lessons. Of the ten units, the first six are required, and the final four are optional, with participants selecting two to complete the course. The course units are:</p>\n<p>Unit 0: What is Computational Thinking?</p>\n<p>Unit 1: Privacy</p>\n<p>Unit 2: Electric Car</p>\n<p>Unit 3: Network Capacity</p>\n<p>Unit 4: Heart Transplant</p>\n<p>Unit 5: DNA Sequencing and Sorting</p>\n<p>Unit 6: Recurrences</p>\n<p>Unit 7: Tomography</p>\n<p>Unit 8: Cryptography</p>\n<p>Unit 9: Streaming Data</p>\n<p>Unit 10: Weather Generators</p>\n<p>The course was delivered to eight cohorts of 20-25 teachers for a total of 172. Some cohorts took the course over four weeks during the summer, while others took it for eight weeks during the school year. As teachers proceeded through the course, their comments and responses were recorded within the Canvas learning management system, which offered rich data for project research.</p>\n<p>The central question driving project research concerned what teachers learned from their experiences in the PD course. Research considered: 1) evidence of participant engagement; 2) teachers&rsquo; motivations for participating in the PD (especially during the trying times of the pandemic); 3) evidence of teachers&rsquo; learning and implementation of ideas from the PD in their classrooms; and 4) challenges that limited teachers&rsquo; learning or hampered use in the classroom.</p>\n<p>Participants entered the PD with a broad set of hopes. When asked about their aspirations for the PD experience, they mentioned wanting to learn more about instructional activities and resources, empowering students as problem solvers, and learning more about CT. Most were aware of the push to integrate computational thinking into their curricula (either given a state mandate or NGSS science standards). Given the current emphasis on student- and inquiry-oriented curriculum and instruction (e.g., NGSS), participants were especially interested in &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; resources that were applicable to their curriculum. They frequently mentioned their desire to make learning relevant, inquiry-oriented, creative, and active for their students. In light of these goals, participant engagement was high. Of the 172 teachers in the course, only five failed to complete at least 80% of the assignments, and the vast majority completed well over 90%. As they progressed through the course, even participants who started with little prior understanding of CT were quickly able to identify the CT skills they were using and demonstrated increasing ease with doing so, especially when referencing decomposition, modeling, and the use of data.</p>\n<p>Participants left the PD excited to try out the ideas and materials in their own classrooms, and they were encouraged to report back on how they did this. We received about 20 reports of CT implementation in a wide variety of science and mathematics courses, with considerable variation in how these participants used the ideas from the PD. Some directly used activities without adapting them; some created a new activity inspired by one of the PD units; others took materials they already used and tinkered with them to include CT. Such variation reflects the project&rsquo;s overarching goal to equip teachers with the knowledge and resources to fold CT skills into their existing practice as they see fit. It invited them to proactively pick and choose what they would use and positioned them not as targets of instructional reform but as agents of it.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/30/2023<br>\nModified by: Tamra&nbsp;J&nbsp;Carpenter</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1812982/1812982_10567076_1703112089640_CTPD_3--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1812982/1812982_10567076_1703112089640_CTPD_3--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Course developers discuss an activity from the tomography unit.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1812982/1812982_10567076_1703112089640_CTPD_3--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Course developers discuss an activity from the tomography unit.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Course developers discuss an activity from the tomography unit during a team meeting in June 2019.
