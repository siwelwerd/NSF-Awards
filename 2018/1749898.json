 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 'gut microbiome' is the complex community of microorganisms that inhabits animal gastrointestinal tracts and performs functions vital to host survival. Most research on the gut microbiome has focused on human and rodent models. This doctoral dissertation project takes a broader, comparative perspective by examining gut microbiome characteristics in non-human primates, to better understand microbiome variation across species, diets, and habitats. Beyond providing new, relevant animal models for understanding human health, this multi-species research will provide fundamental knowledge about primate-microbiome relationships relative to host ecology and evolution, and will inform husbandry practices for improving the management of endangered species. The results of this study will be shared with the scientific community via publication in peer-reviewed journals, specific conservation organizations, such as the IUCN Primate Specialist Group, and the Duke Lemur Center, and with the general public via commitment to educational science outreach. The project will also provide training for undergraduate students in field and laboratory methods, bioinformatics and statistical analysis, and data dissemination.  \r\n\r\nFor leaf-eating primates, one critical role of the gut microbiome is to convert ingested plant fiber into essential nutrients. Indeed, upwards of 57% of daily energy demands in folivorous primates are met by microbially-synthesized compounds. Yet, our understanding of the influence of host ecology and evolution on the primate gut microbiome remains limited, as there is a paucity of available comparative data. To boost comparative power, the co-PI's dissertation research is focused on the structure and function of the gut microbiome in multiple lemur species that vary in relatedness, the proportion of foliage in their diets, the type of forest they inhabit, and their endangerment. The investigators will explore gut microbiomes in two wild populations of Coquerel's sifakas living in northwest Madagascar, and the captive population housed at the Duke Lemur Center in NC. Combining two methods of powerful genetic sequencing, that respectively determine microbial membership and metabolic function, this project address three specific aims: (1) a phylogenetic comparison across several wild primate species, (2) determination of normative gut microbiome variation across populations of a host species, and (3) investigation of the effects of captivity on sifaka gut microbiome. Ultimately, this study will improve understanding of the fragility of the folivore gut microbiome and offer insight into primate nutrition, with potential applications to primate husbandry and human healthcare.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The gut microbiome is the complex community of bacteria and other microscopic organisms that inhabit animal gastrointestinal tracts. Gut microbes perform vital digestive functions for their hosts and contribute to animal health. Sifakas are critically endangered lemurs from Madagascar who eat a diet rich in leaves (and some fruit), and tend to suffer from fragile health in captivity. Gut microbes help render leaves nutritious to the lemurs, by breaking down tough plant fiber and toxins, and by synthesizing nutrients and vitamins. By comparing gut microbiomes across wild and captive sifakas, we can learn how much variation naturally exists between sifaka populations in the wild, and how captive conditions may disrupt the relationship between sifakas and their gut communities, and thereby contribute to health challenges. Such information can inform strategies for the care and management of captive lemur colonies, for example by helping us optimize the diets fed to captive lemurs, and can also inform our understanding of the evolutionary and ecological relationships between primates and their gut microbiota.</p>\n<p>The methods for this project involved collecting fresh fecal samples during animal observation from sifakas living in the Anjajavy Protected Area and Ankarafantsika National Park in northwest Madagascar, and from those housed at the Duke Lemur Center in Durham, NC.
