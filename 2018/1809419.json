Size, morphology, surface chemistry and method of preparation govern how C-dots interact with biological tissues.  C-dots derived from carbon powder are unique in that they bind to mineralized bones with high affinity and specificity.  By characterizing the physical and chemical properties that confer these C-dots their unique bone-binding properties, this project will advance our understanding of the interactions between C-dots and mineralized tissues.  This is an essential step towards developing C-dots as tools for bone imaging and diagnostic tools, and for the treatment and repair of bone fractures and degenerative diseases (e.g., osteoporosis) that would impact US health.  Additionally, this work will support the training of graduate and undergraduate students, fostering inquiry-based research and scientific collaboration essential to develop the skills needed in a thriving US scientific workforce. \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe goal of this work is to understand the physical and chemical properties of Carbon nanoparticles (C-dots) for their development as bone-specific drug carriers.  C-dots are a new emerging class of nanomaterials whose biological applications in imaging, diagnostics and therapeutics critically depend on their size, molecular structure and material of origin.  One particular class of C-dots synthesized from carbon powder have the unique property of binding to mineralized bones in vivo.  To advance our understanding of the interactions between C-dots and mineralized tissues this project will (1) determine the intrinsic chemical and physical properties of C-dots that are related to their high affinity and specificity towards mineralized bones, (2) determine how different surface functionalities influence the interactions between C-dots and mineralized bones, and (3) functionally test the ability of C-dots to deliver drugs to bones. By characterizing C-dots' unique bone binding properties, this work will not only uncover the physicochemical principles that allow C-dots binding to bones, but will also discern the molecular principles need to target new nanomaterials to mineralized tissue at the exclusion of other tissues. Thus, the findings of this work will have broad intellectual implications for nanomaterial chemistry and engineering, as well as advancing the development of bone imaging and diagnostic tools for the repair and treatment of bone fractures and degenerative diseases.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Currently, the only available medications to treat osteoporosis prevent further bone erosion without restoring the loss of minerals and bone mass. And yet, many available drugs that can promote bone growth are not used as medications because their non-specific effects in other tissues could lead to undesirable side effects such as cancer. Thus, there is an urgent demand for developing novel therapeutic approaches to bypass these non-specific side effects and deliver drugs to bones selectively. Nanomaterial-based approaches are one promising strategy to deliver drugs to bones. This collaborative project aimed to characterize the physical and chemical properties of a class of carbon dots (C-dots) nanomaterials that have the unique properties of binding to bones, for their application in biological systems, bone imaging, and therapy. To achieve these goals, we aimed to understand (1) the properties that allow C-dots to bind to bones, (2) determine how changing the surface properties of the C-dots affect their binding to bones, and (3) analyze the effect that attaching molecules to C-dots have on C-dots physical and biological activities.

C-dots specifically bind to areas of bone growth without interfering with normal physiological processes. C-dots? interaction with bones was analyzed using the zebrafish model system, as this organism has the remarkable capacity to regrow its tail bones after damage. Using this system, we showed that the C-dots binding to bones was highly specific and restricted to an area of bone growth known as the appositional growth zone. C-dot deposition was fast, occurring within 30 minutes after delivery, and was highly selective. Significantly, the binding of the C-dots to bone did not affect normal bone physiology, such as mineral recycling, regeneration, and repair.

C-dots were connected to cargo molecules of different sizes and shapes and analyzed for changes in physical and biological activities. We found that the ability of the C-dots to absorb and emit light changes after it has been connected to a cargo molecule, increasing or decreasing in a cargo-dependent manner. Therefore, if one were to use the light-emitting properties of C-dots to monitor the delivery of drugs to bones, one needs to be aware that the light-emitting properties of the C-dots may have changed due to the cargo molecule itself.
