 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address the design, prototype and testing of a modular tension control device for individual tension regulation in the composite manufacturing sector. Composites are increasingly used in mission critical applications where the material and the product must perform reliably, while at the same time improving productivity, increasing product quality and lowering cost. By precisely and consistently controlling tension, there are fewer voids, skips or uneven tows, resulting in a higher quality product. This is particularly important when safety is dependent on the structural integrity of the materials. Overall, composite applications are greener and have a positive environmental impact. Comparably priced but safer automobiles from composites will be lighter and consume less fuel. Composites further reduce reliance on fossil fuels, as they are the building blocks to harness renewable energy. Wind blades, solar panels and underwater turbines are all made from composites. This is a rapidly growing multi-billion-dollar market, and the projected share of the targeted tension control market is in the range of $200 million, growing equally fast, if not faster. \r\n\r\nThis project will solve a problem that has plagued the composites industry since its inception. Tension control is especially difficult (and yet very important in the composites industry), as multiple materials with different tear strengths and varying elasticity are combined to make stronger products. Lack of cost effective tension control has, up to this point, limited the speed and quality of finished products. Phase II objectives are to prototype and develop the manufacturing process for the Modular Tensioning Cartridge. The Phase II Objectives are: 1) Control package design - the goal is to create a central base station to provide power, communications and a central interface for the use of multiple Modular Tensioning Cartridge units; 2) Finalization - all successfully tested components must be assembled into a singular industrial grade prototype unit and then tested; 3) Product release - upon final prototype testing, field trials will be conducted to validate and finalize technology leading to full production. In phase I, feasibility of the individual components to meet performance requirements was successfully demonstrated. In Phase II, prototype units will be developed and tested refining the design to meet the performance expectations of the customers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
