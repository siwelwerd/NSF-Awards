 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project advances the sophistication, robustness and usefulness of the DETERLab testbed, a key scientific laboratory for cybersecurity research and education.  Advances in the research, educational and operational missions of the testbed directly benefit the hundreds of research projects, and thousands of classroom users currently using DETERLab. All proposed activities directly impact users, enabling them to experiment faster, more easily, with higher fidelity and repeatability, and in more sophisticated environments. The research and development efforts taken together  expand capacity for both the research and education communities and are necessary to meet the growing need for cybersecurity professionals in our country today, and the growing need for repeatability, reproducibility and reuse of testbed experiments.\r\n\r\nThe project is comprised of 16 tasks across three mission objectives to (1) advance  DETERLab's research mission  - these include operationalization of new experimental capabilities, and addition of new tools for users, to allocate and manage experiments, (2) activities that  advance DETERLab's education mission  - these include creation of containerized versions of existing exercises, creation of new shared materials from various sources within and outside of DETERLab, and customization of lab exercises for each student, to prevent cheating, (3) activities that advance DETERLab's operational mission  - these activities improve DETERLab's security, streamline experiment allocation and management, and allow for fast and automated handling of many errors. Many of the planned activities already have 1st generation prototypes, that are  improved, generalized and operationalized under the project. All the source and binary code developed under this proposal is released publicly. All experimental and educational materials are released via DETERLab's sharing portal.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We leveraged our existing open-source agent modeling platform DASH, and integrated these models with the testbed experiments. DASH provides support for several key aspects of agents that can respond to their environment and incorporate a number of human traits, including reactive planning, spreading activation for shift of attention, mental models and a dual-process model of reasoning. DASH agents were integrated with testbed experiments by allowing them to generate real e-mail and vulnerability scanning traffic, which flowed over the experimental network. This way, DASH agents become integral parts of DeterLab experiments, and can be used to emulate human behavior in experiments.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-af013e66-7fff-8018-c1fd-248c39e178a0\"> </span></p>\n<div><span>Our binary analysis platform is hosted at&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://binary.deterlab.net\">https://binary.deterlab.net</a>, and supports the same login process as DeterLab testbed. The platform allows users to&nbsp;upload binary files, and then explore various analyses we provide. No prior experience with binary analysis, nor software installation is required. Currently, our platform provides several useful services including: visualization of function-call graphs and control-flow graphs, debug symbol extraction, and backward slice data-dependency track.&nbsp;</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We leverage angr and Neo4j with Ruby on Rails to build our online binary visualization tool. The construction of function-call graphs, control-flow graphs, and data-dependency track are all completed with angr. After performing all the required analysis, we store the data into Neo4j Graph Database. Finally, we choose to use Ruby on Rails, a web-application framework, as a web server to host our services.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Another analysis service we provide is the debug symbol extraction. When a source code is compiled to the executable program or a binary, adding debug information helps analyzers to understand the program at the binary level. At the binary visualization project, we make a platform for reverse engineers to map binary to source code level using debug information in ELF binaries, in the section called DWARF. We automate some manual analysis tasks in DWARF analysis to display local variables? types and return values of functions in our platform.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<div>We have advanced our *educational* mission by adding more education materials to our shared repository.

We have analyzed the entire DeterLab's code base and located and patched multiple vulnerabilities. Our user message improvements have added instructions to users how to self-rectify the problems they are facing, which has significantly reduced the number of new tickets on the testbed. We have written a custom software module to detect critical failures of the testbed, which manifest themselves in multiple projects being unable to allocate experiments in a short time period. The module monitors attempted experiment allocations and their outcomes and detects when conditions may signal a critical failure.

There are approximately 2,000 users per semester, out of which approximately 1,300 are students enrolled into cybersecurity classes, which use DeterLab. Our activities have provided more repeatable, reusable and robust experimentation capabilities to research users. They have also enable new ways to experiment in domains of binary analysis, human factors in cybersecurity, Internet-scale emulation, wireless emulation and connectivity impairments. Our education materials rovided more diverse and gradated set of hands-on exercises to students, thus contributing to development of cybersecurity workforce.
