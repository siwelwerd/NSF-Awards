 "awd_abstract_narration": "This a collaborative synthetic and computational research program between the groups of Profs. Simon M. Humphrey and Graeme Henkelman at the University of Texas at Austin, which focuses on the preparation and studies of new nano-catalyst materials. Catalysts reduce the total energy used in large-scale chemical processes, including the synthesis of fuels, polymers and textiles, drugs, and the remediation of environmental pollutants. Catalysts also reduce the amount of waste by-products that are generated. The majority of catalysts currently in use are based on precious metals, which are unfortunately also both scarce and expensive. Therefore, it is critically important to find ways to prepare modern catalysts that can operate using less total metal, whilst maintaining their catalytic performance. With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program in the Division of Chemistry, this project directly addresses these issues by studying the synthesis and properties of metallic nanoparticle catalysts that comprise only a few thousand atoms per entity; nanoparticles are attractive compared with bulk metals because they exhibit superior reactivity, as well as having very large surface areas compared to their volumes. The project also studies the use of scalable and environmentally-sustainable synthesis methods, such as microwave heating, to prepare new nanoparticle catalysts comprised of previously unstudied mixtures of precious metals. The fundamental properties of these new catalysts are assessed using experimental and theoretical (computational) methods, in order to understand how composition relates to performance improvements in real chemical reactions. The ultimate aim is to apply experimental and computational expertise to predict new catalyst compositions that should have optimal properties for given industrial processes. The project is also significantly enhanced through integration with an innovative new undergraduate educational program, called the Austin-International Framework in which undergraduates travel overseas to collaborate with world-renown research group. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis highly collaborative synthetic and computational research program between the groups of Profs. Simon M. Humphrey and Graeme Henkelman at the University of Texas at Austin focuses on the synthesis and studies of new noble metal nanoparticle catalysts with unusual compositions. The major objectives of this research activity are to make direct connections between the structure and function of novel metallic nanoparticles that are comprised of unusual binary and ternary combinations of precious metals. There are significant intellectual challenges to achieve this goal. First, determining the atomic structure of supported multicomponent metal nanoparticles is difficult. A combination of electron microscopy, total X-ray scattering to generate pair distribution function data, extended X-ray fine structure spectroscopy, and temperature programmed desorption/reaction will be used to experimentally quantify structural parameters. This data will be used to inform realistic theoretical models at the atomic scale. Second, structural information with atomic detail is also critical to building theoretical models of active site, reactivity descriptors, and predictions of selectivity. It is also important to have feedback in terms of predictions from theory that can be tested experimentally, so that the models can be validated and calibrated. The ultimate goal of this work is to be able to rationally predict optimal structures and compositions of new catalysts that should have desired reactivity for specific applications. Meanwhile, differences between predictions and experimentally observed reactivity are equally valuable for improving the computational methods developed in this work. The project is also significantly enhanced through integration with an innovative new undergraduate educational program, called the Austin-International Framework (AIF). The AIF is an innovative and modern-thinking program that provides a fully immersive, scholarship-supported international exchange experience to UT Austin undergraduates. It provides students the unique opportunity to broaden their horizons by witnessing first-hand the global nature of science. The students involved in this program receive course credit for their research experiences and scholarships are provided to cover their basic cost-of-living expenses while doing research overseas.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit: Outcomes\n\nOver the duration of this award, we determined chemical routes to synthesize a family of new and previously unstudied metallic alloys, in the form of well-defined nanoparticles, which were studied as novel catalyst materials in a range of industrially relevant applications.  The new alloy nanoparticles were primarily prepared using scalable and energy-efficient microwave heating methods.  We focused our efforts on preparing nanoalloys that combine a so-called 'earth abundant', cheap and readily available metal along with a more scarce, but catalytically important metal.  For example, in the image shown, we prepared the first examples of copper-iridium nanoparticles, which were shown to be highly reactive in catalytic hydrogenation reactions, but greatly reduced the amount of expensive iridium metal required, while also improving the shape and stability compared to pure iridium analogues.  Other examples of catalysts prepared under this project include, silver-iridium and copper- and silver- palladium alloys, which again employ cheaper coinage metals to dilute precious metals, while enhancing reaction selectivity and activity.  The palladium-based catalysts were shown to be highly active catalysts for potential use in the removal of (potentially toxic) nitrates and nitrites from drinking water, by direct hydrogenation to give nitrogen gas and water as inert by-products.  Throughout our studies, we employed computational chemistry to help us better understand observed trends in reactivity, and to relate these trends to atomic-level effects at the nanoparticle surfaces.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts: Outcomes\n\nThe experimental and computation work conducted through this award has supported the professional training of six different graduate students?three of whom earned their Ph.D. degrees as a direct result?and provided multiple undergraduate students with the opportunity to participate in hands-on research alongside their graduate student mentors.
