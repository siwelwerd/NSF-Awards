 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Experiences in Solid Earth Science for Students (RESESS) is an internship program dedicated to increasing the diversity of students entering the geosciences. The mission of the internship is to increase the diversity of students entering the geosciences. The primary activity of RESESS is to provide a summer research experience for undergraduates from groups historically underrepresented in the geosciences. Following the summer internship, interns have the opportunity to present their research at a professional scientific conference. Conference attendance provides the opportunity for exposure to a diversity of scientific ideas, people, and approaches. Conference attendance is also a valuable opportunity for students to speak with experts in their current research fields and/or their desired fields of study. Additionally, the value of interactions with potential graduate school advisors or employers is critical for the ongoing professional development of students. RESESS alumni connect through the annual alumni networking dinner at both GSA and AGU. These events facilitate the ongoing connections of the alumni network, and create an inclusive environment within large, potentially intimidating meetings. Finally, the attendance of geoscience-focused interns at broader science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) meetings raises the visibility of the geosciences within communities that are historically underrepresented in the discipline. This travel proposal seeks to support conference attendance for the eight 2018 RESESS interns.\r\n\r\nThis travel proposal builds on the support provided via the GAGE Facility award (EAR-1261833, ending 30 September 2018) and associated supplements, which outlines the support for geo-workforce development at UNAVCO including summer internships. Since 2005, UNAVCO has managed the Research Experiences in Solid Earth Science for Students (RESESS) internship. The mission of the internship is to increase the diversity of students entering the geosciences. UNAVCO has funding in the GAGE award to provide staff support for the 2018 summer experience, and has received a supplement to the GAGE award to support the summer program. This travel award will support the post-GAGE fall conference travel for the 2018 RESESS student cohort. Specifically, this request will support conference attendance for the eight 2018 RESESS interns. Conference attendance for interns provides the opportunity for intern exposure to a diversity of scientific ideas, people, and approaches. Conference attendance is also a valuable opportunity for students to speak with experts in their current research fields and/or their desired fields of study. Additionally, the value of interactions with potential graduate school advisors or employers is critical for the ongoing professional development of students. RESESS alumni connect with past participants through the annual alumni networking dinner at both GSA and AGU. RESESS alumni are invited to join the most recent interns for networking, information sharing, and mentoring. These events facilitate the ongoing connections of the alumni network, and facilitate an inclusive environment within large, potentially intimidating meetings. Finally, the attendance of geoscience-focused interns at broader STEM meetings raises the visibility of the geosciences within communities that are historically underrepresented in the discipline.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
