 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to improve quantum information processing with optical systems.  In it the PI will investigate theoretically a hybrid approach to photonic qbits by combining features of previously studied linear and nonlinear quantum logic gares.  New approaches for quantum communication and quantum computation are expected to result from the work.  This is important because it will lay the foundation for technologies that can improve national security and economic competitiveness. It will also advance the field of quantum information science.  Broader impacts of this project include training of a graduate student in theoretical quantum optics methods and providing research experience for undergraduate students who will become part of the next generation of scientists.  Public lectures for non-scientists, and several science outreach activities for high-school students are also part of this project.  \r\n\r\nQuantum information processing with quanta of light (photonic qubits) is a promising direction for new technologies.  However, it is challenging to make quantum logic gates with photonic qubits.  This award is for a theoretical investigation of a hybrid optical approach that combines the best features of the linear and nonlinear quantum logic gates previously studied. Linear optical techniques, such as postselection, heralding, and feed-forward control will be applied to nonlinear devices to reduce the gate error rates. Although the resulting devices will be probabilistic in nature, the use of nonlinear effects can increase the probability of success for photonic qubit gates. This approach will lead to robust devices with a low error rate and a high probability of success, as needed for further advances in quantum information processing. In addition to quantum logic gates, this team will also investigate hybrid devices that are specifically designed for quantum communications tasks, such as entanglement distribution. As part of this project, this team will also investigate new techniques for probabilistic quantum cloning.  This will advance the progress of science by providing a deeper understanding of quantum information processing with photonic qubits.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n     Quantum mechanics allows practical applications that would be impossible according to classical physics.  These include secure communications that cannot be intercepted, quantum computers that can solve problems that cannot be solved on a classical computer, and a quantum internet.  Our work was focused on the theoretical analysis of new techniques that could be used to help achieve these goals. \n\n     Quantum computers and quantum communications both require logic gates that can perform calculations using quantum bits or \"qubits\".  During the course of this project, we proposed a new form of a quantum logic gate that has better performance than previous logic gates.  This device combined both linear and nonlinear optical elements in a \"hybrid approach\" to achieve better performance.\n\n    We also developed a technique for generating so-called \"Schrodinger cat states\" using simple resources.  A Schrodinger cat is a quantum state that is macroscopic in size but still corresponds to a superposition of two different situations.  We showed that these highly nonclassical states could be generated using an initial state containing a specific number of photons, or particles of light, combined with a beam splitter (half-silvered mirror), which is one of the simplest optical devices.\n\n     We also investigated a technique for transmitting qubits over large distances in optical fibers without the usual degradation due to photon loss.  On the more basic side, we developed a more general theory of quantum optics that is necessary to understand the performance of certain quantum devices. \n\n     Eight scientific papers were published and numerous presentations were given at scientific conferences.  Two graduate students were educated, one of whom has received his Ph. D and the other should receive it in a few months.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/12/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James D Franson"
