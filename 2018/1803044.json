 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will study the immediate effects of Hurricane Maria on the dynamics of organic carbon and nutrients in a tropical forest and the streams draining that forest to better determine how short-term impacts affect the long-term trajectory of forest and water resources following single and repeated disturbances. Hurricane Maria led to widespread canopy damage and litter deposition on the soil surface and in stream channels within the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) in Puerto Rico. Understanding how organic carbon, phosphorus, and nitrogen within plant detritus are modified during their movement through soils and into streams, including any exchanges with the atmosphere, is critical to determining long-term ecosystem response to disturbance. The research conducted as part of this project will provide insights into the resilience and resistance of the LEF ecosystem, part of the El Yunque National Forest in the US National Forest System.  The PI team will work closely with scientists and students in Puerto Rico and facilitate local student and faculty research needs. The investigators will build the project results into a portfolio of presentations and outreach activities centered on the impacts of climate variability on terrestrial ecosystems. The project will promote diversity in science by supporting Puerto Rican students as laboratory personnel, providing training to other Hispanic students and post-doctoral scientists, and promoting gender equity in science through outreach and mentoring activities.\r\n\r\nThis research makes use of a pre-existing hurricane simulation experiment allowing the researchers to test hypotheses about the effects of single and repeated hurricane disturbance on ecosystem processes, including biogeochemical translocations of carbon and nutrients through soil profiles and microbial activities in response to substrate availability and moisture conditions.  The research team will quantify the amount of litter deposited on the soil, measure soil carbon and phosphorus fractions, nitrogen mineralization, iron species, aluminum, and pH in soil profiles, soil lysimeters, and stream water. Microbial activity will be assessed while also targeting gene expression related to macromolecular carbohydrate degradation and nitrogen and phosphorus cycling. Transcript data sequenced via Illumina HiSeq will be mapped to assembled scaffolds from pre-existing metagenomes and provide a means of assessing changes in gene expression.  The research will provide the first comprehensive experiment of hurricane effects that characterizes the pre- and post-environmental conditions and biogeochemical cycling with soil depth, and across single and repeated disturbances. This group will also be the first to employ novel analyses of microbial activity, transcriptomics, and link this directly with biogeochemical indices in the context of disturbance and recovery.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm, led to impacts on Puerto Rico's forests that were profound.  Hurricane Maria made landfall in southeastern Puerto Rico on Sept. 20, 2017 and passed over the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) with wind speeds of up to 155 miles per hour. The storm led to widespread canopy damage and organic debris deposition on the soil surface.  As the climate changes, Atlantic hurricanes may become more frequent and/or more severe. These new disturbance regimes could prevent tropical forests from full recovery and lead to changes in terrestrial C stocks.  \n\nThe primary objectives of this project were to investigate the short-term impacts of Hurricane Maria on carbon and nutrient dyanamics in Puerto Rico's forests, relative to the longer term data being collected as part of the NSF-sponsored Long-term Ecological Research (LTER) program.  Since Hurricane Maria made landfall, we have conducted extensive monthly sampling of soil biogeochemistry, in which we tracked soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), iron (Fe), pH, microbial communities, and soil and ecosystem abiotic conditions.  We used existing research plots from the Canopy Trimming Experiment (CTE), a hurricane-simulation experiment in the LEF that has been ongoing since 2002, and a running sensor field measuring belowground variables to test hypotheses about how Hurricane Maria is altering biogeochemical cycling. Monthly soil samples (0-10 cm depth; 1 m depth quarterly) were sampled for C, N and P variables, Fe species, and pH. Soil moisture, temperature and oxygen probes tracked belowground abiotic conditions over time (0-15 cm).\n\nOur results showed short-term changes in soil micro-climate, and a longer-term change in the variability of temperature in surface soils. These changes in the soil abiotic environment likely contributed to observed changes in litter decomposition and litter N stocks, soil Fe pools, and pH. Plots that had experienced repeated disturbance (CTE hurricane simulation) had more reduced iron and periodically lower acidity.\n\nPrevious data and modeling results suggest that short-term dynamics are likely to be critical for understanding patterns of long-term change. The presence of research plots with known disturbance history and a wealth of pre-Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico data provided an unprecedented opportunity to test hypotheses regarding controls on biogeochemical cycling after single and repeated disturbances. This type of work will be critical as climate change and associated disturbances progress.\n\nThis grant also supported outreach into the community and broader impacts in Puerto Rico and beyond. The initial months of this grant involved working closely with scientists and students in Puerto Rico to aid in recovery efforts for the scientific infrastructure and facilitated student and faculty research needs until local facilities returned to operation. In addition, four early-career scientists were supported by or involved in research on this project, three of whom are women, two of whom are Puerto Rican, and three of whom are from under-represented minorities.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/04/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Whendee Silver"
