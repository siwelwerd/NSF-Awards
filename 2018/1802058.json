 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 32nd Automorphic Forms Workshop (AFW) will be held March 19-22, 2018 at Tufts University. Automorphic forms play a central role in number theory and related areas, including the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. The AFW provides a setting for researchers to discuss new developments, learn from other researchers, and begin new collaborations. Many researchers in automorphic forms give their first research talks at the AFW, and many senior researchers attend as well. The workshop has historically also sparked research collaborations leading to new developments in the field. To increase accessibility to a wider audience, the organizers have introduced a \"bootcamp\" to be held March 18th. \r\n\r\nDue in part to the location of the conference just outside Boston, the 32nd Automorphic Forms Workshop will attract active researchers for whom attendance at other recent AFWs was impractical because of geographical constraints, time constraints, or lack of sufficient funding. This will ensure that a mix of attendees will contribute new perspectives to the workshop, which also attracts attendees who have participated annually for many years. Typically, about half of the attendees at the AFW are at early stages of their careers, and about one-quarter to one-third of the participants are women. The AFW will continue to provide a supportive and encouraging environment for giving talks, exchanging  ideas, and beginning new collaborations.  In addition to research talks, the AFW will have two professional development panels on topics such as proper mathematical writing, starting a tenure track job, forming collaborations, and transitioning from one career stage to the next. The organizers are committed to continuing to facilitate an inclusive, vertically integrated environment; to this end they are introducing a bootcamp to enhance the experience of early-career researchers attending the workshop. The workshop website is http://automorphicformsworkshop.org/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
