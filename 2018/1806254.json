 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cornell Topology Festival is held each May at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York.  This grant will support participants in the 54th, 55th, and 56th such festivals.  The 54th will be held May 11-13, 2018.  This conference gives an opportunity for researchers in topology to find out about the latest developments in the field and connect with potential collaborators.  It is the only topology conference of its length and breadth held regularly in the Northeastern United States.\r\n\r\nTopology is an extremely broad field, and so a key aspect of the Festival is the annual choice of an \"area of emphasis\": some narrower subdiscipline or application of topology.  Around one third of the speakers are chosen to represent the area of emphasis and among these two are chosen to give introductory talks about the area, in order that regular attendees might learn about the area in greater depth than they might only from research presentations.  Recent areas of emphasis were \"Groups Acting on Hyperbolic Spaces\" (2015), \"Topological Combinatorics\" (2016), and \"Topology and Physics\" (2017). The area of emphasis for the 54th Cornell Topology Festival is \"Representation Theory and Topology\".  More details about the upcoming and previous festivals can be found at the website:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.math.cornell.edu/~festival/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award supported participants in the 2018, 2019 and 2022 editions  of an annual mathematics conference on topology held at Cornell  University. \n\nTopology is the study of those aspects of spaces  which remain unchanged by deformation.  This central subject is  connected in some way to every other branch of modern mathematics and  also to many of the sciences.  Often the conference is organized around a  theme; for example the 2018 conference had the theme \"Representation  Theory in Topology\" while the 2019 theme was \"Groups and Spaces\".  Our  2020 theme was chosen as \"Dynamics in Topology\" -- that conference was  postponed to 2021 and then held online because of the pandemic.\n\nEach  conference had ten plenary lectures, some on recent breakthroughs and  some describing the progress of ideas in some area at a high level.   Names of the speakers and the abstracts of their lectures are archived  on the conference web site.  Before the plenary lectures began, there  was a day of introductory talks aimed at graduate students and  non-specialists.  There was also a panel discussion on recent advances  in the field.\n\n \n\nThese activities were designed to have  the following broader impacts: (a) a more broadly-trained community of  topologists able to transcend the boundaries of sub-specialties; (b) the  selection of participants looked towards achieving a more diverse  mathematical workforce; (c) much of the participant support went to  graduate students or early career researchers with a view to the rapid  integration of younger topologists into areas of current research; and  (d) gathering communities of researchers served to enhance collaboration  in different areas of topology. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/20/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jason F Manning"
