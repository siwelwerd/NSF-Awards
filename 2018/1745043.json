 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current ice mass loss in Antarctica is largely driven by changes at glacier grounding lines, where inland ice transitions from being grounded to floating in the ocean. The rate and pattern of glacier retreat in these circumstances is thought to be controlled by the terrain under the ice. This project incorporates evidence of past ice-retreat events and other field data, such as grounding-line positions and dates, subglacial topography, and meltwater features, into numerical models of ice flow to investigate the influence that grounding-line processes and subglacial topography have on glacier retreat rates over the past 15,000 years.\r\n\r\nRecent observations suggest that Antarctic ice mass loss is largely driven by perturbations at or near the grounding line. However, the lack of information on subglacial and grounding-line environments causes large uncertainties in projections of mass loss and sea-level rise. This project will integrate geologic data from the deglaciated continental shelf into numerical models of varying complexity from one to three-dimensions. Rarely do numerical ice-sheet models of Antarctica have multiple constraints on dynamics over the past ~15,000 years (a period that spans the deglaciation of the Antarctic continental shelf since the Last Glacial Maximum).  The geologic constraints include grounding-line positions, deglacial chronologies, and information on grounding line-ice shelf processes.   The models will be used to investigate necessary perturbations and controls that meet the geological constraints. The multidisciplinary approach of merging geologic reconstructions of paleo-ice behavior with numerical models of ice response will allow the research team to test understanding of subglacial controls on grounding-line dynamics and assess the stability of modern grounding lines.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
