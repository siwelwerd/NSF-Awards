 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Ocean Observatory Initiative (OOI) has been developed by NSF to provide continuous measurements at a wide variety of locations for unprecedented access to the world's oceans and marine atmospheric environment. A major theme of the OOI is Ocean-Atmosphere Exchange, which was identified during OOI planning as \"critical to improving the predictive capabilities of storm forecasting and climate-change models.\" This project will allow access to new quality-controlled and continuous high-wind measurement of fluxes, waves and ocean currents at the OOI DC flux moorings under moderate to high wind conditions - data that should open new windows for evaluation of these forecast models as well as support for ongoing and future process studies at the OOI Pioneer, Endurance and Global sites. This project will take advantage of these observations to improve our detailed understanding of the interaction between the atmosphere, the surface wave field, and the underlying ocean, as well as to test, improve and validate parameterizations which estimate the critically important wind stress as a function of other, more easily observed or modeled parameters. Expected broader impacts from this research include STEM training of high school students, an enhancement to the OOI research infrastructure, and increased partnerships between academia, industry and federal agencies. These will be achieved through participation in a WHOI program aimed at developing a senior-level capstone course in Oceanography for high school students, dedicated OOI flux data development activities to support expanded science investigation using these platforms, and provision to the broader research community of widely sought after high-wind condition field measurement datasets including wind stress and buoyancy flux. \r\n\r\nThis research will investigate the turbulent exchange of momentum that drives waves and\r\ncurrents at moderate to extreme wind speeds. The primary objectives of this project are (1) validate\r\nand/or improve bulk air-sea flux algorithms that parameterize the momentum flux at moderate to high wind speeds to reduce the uncertainty resulting from the scarcity of measurements in the 15-25 m/s range; (2) conduct process studies to investigate wind-wave feedback mechanisms that address the impact of wave-age, wave-steepness and directional differences (e.g., between the wind, wave and stress fields) using OOI directional wave spectral data and high-rate co-spectral flux estimates; and (3) use the sum of these investigations to test existing parameterizations of surface fluxes being employed in LES and numerical wind and wave modeling activities at several forecast centers. This study is expected to advance the evaluation and improvement of drag coefficient parameterizations and explore new ones based on physical arguments and insights gained from the continuous OOI measurements. The improvement of these parameterizations is a crucial component in the development of coupled ocean-wave-atmosphere models.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Improving and validating the accuracy of these bulk method models requires this combination of directly measured fluxes and bulk observations.  Major achievement of this project is the improvement of the COARE bulk flux algorithm and the creation of high-quality post-processed buoy measurement datasets used in the analyses and shared with our colleagues on several on-going projects.\n\nScientific Impacts:\n\nThe most significant findings coming from this work concern the behavior of the transfer coefficients for heat and momentum at moderate to high wind speeds.
