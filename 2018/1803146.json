Additional information about the conference can be found on the website http://www.math.wisc.edu/fricci2018\r\n\r\nThe 2018 CIHAG meeting is devoted to recent developments in harmonic analysis and many applications to other disciplines. This week-long conference will bring approximately 25 internationally-recognized analysts to Cortona, Italy. Each of them will give a one-hour talk. The 2018 CIHAG meeting will also provide numerous junior participants with the opportunity to give short talks or present posters about their work. The 2018 CIHAG meeting will include a session for discussions of important open problems in harmonic analysis. Priority for funding will be given to early career mathematicians, women, members of underrepresented groups and those without other means of support. This is an important conference in harmonic analysis and its applications that will offer participants the opportunity to learn of state-of-the-art research in harmonic analysis with applications to engineering and other sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
