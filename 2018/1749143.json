 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines the extent to which there is a link between language abilities in a first and second language with the goal of providing a better understanding of the factors that predict successful reading comprehension across languages. Although language skills are critical for both economic security and national security, the U.S. is in a foreign language 'crisis,' with only 30% of high school students and 8% of college students taking foreign language courses (A National Security Crisis, 2012). Improving our ability to predict successful language learning will provide a better understanding of the skills that need to be reinforced in order to provide a stronger foundation for language learning, allowing the development of pedagogical practices that can potentially increase the number of successful learners. The project will address theoretical debates regarding whether or not the processing of a second language is fundamentally different from the processing of a native language by taking a unique approach in which both the first and second languages are examined within the same individuals. This project will provide educational opportunities within both the university and the larger community. At the university level, the project will provide training opportunities for undergraduate students from under-represented minority groups. At the community level, the researchers will give presentations at local high schools and at the public library in which the social, cultural, educational, economic, and cognitive advantages of being bilingual will be discussed and information about the resources available for language learning will be provided, emphasizing resources for both English native speakers and immigrant populations who may be interested in resources for maintaining their home languages.\r\n\r\nThe project examines the processing of pronouns such as \"she\" in short stories as a test case for complex language processing. Linking a pronoun such as \"she\" with a noun that has come much earlier in the discourse has long been recognized as challenging for both native speakers and second language learners but the two bodies of research have proceeded independently. The current study examines the processing of pronouns in two groups of learners, English-speaking learners of Spanish and Spanish-speaking learners of English, testing all participants in both their first and second languages.  The project uses event-related potentials (ERP), a brain imaging measure that allows the examination of the precise mechanisms that are used during language processing. All participants will also take an extensive battery of individual difference measures which assess both linguistic and cognitive skills. The goal is to develop a better understanding of the contexts and conditions under which native speakers and second language learners are successful in reading comprehension. In utilizing ERP, a more fine-grained characterization of the processes underlying comprehension in the first and second languages becomes possible, leading to a better understanding of whether the processing of a second language is truly qualitatively different from the processing of a native language.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The first expression, referred to as the antecedent, introduces the entity into the discourse, and the second expression refers back it. For example, in the sentence <em>John and Kate went to the store, and she bought eggs</em>, <em>Kate</em>, the antecedent, and <em>she</em>, the pronoun, are coreferential. Establishing reference is a necessary part of successful language comprehension, but it is a complex process as it requires that information relevant to the discourse be tracked and updated, often across the span of several sentences. We investigated the processing of reference in two different studies, which focus on overt pronouns (e.g., <em>she</em>/<em>ella</em>) in English and Spanish. We examined both English-speaking learners of Spanish and Spanish-speaking learners of English, and all participants were tested in both their first and second language. The study used event-related potentials (ERPs) which provide a measure of neural activity, recorded directly at the scalp. ERPs allow a more fine-grained characterization of the processes underlying language comprehension, enabling us to see whether the individuals in our study showed qualitatively similar patterns when processing pronouns in their first and second languages. The novelty of this approach is that the processing of the first and second language were compared within the same individuals as opposed to designs which compare second language learners with an independent group of monolingual native speakers, who may differ from the learners with respect to many dimensions. Our experiments presented participants with two kinds of story contexts that were referentially challenging and compared the processing of pronouns in those two contexts with a baseline context in which reference could be more easily established through a gender cue. The first context, which examined whether participants were sensitive to referential ambiguity, included stories in which a given pronoun had more than one potential antecedent in the discourse. The second context examined whether participants could successfully &lsquo;update&rsquo; the discourse, including stories in which successful coreference involved tracking which discourse entities participated in the main event of the story. The first study asked participants to read stories and answer comprehension questions while their brain activity was recorded but the questions did not draw any attention to the pronouns themselves. In the second study, the comprehension questions explicitly asked participants to think about who the pronoun referred to. Results for the processing of the native language in both studies showed that both referentially challenging contexts modulated a brain response linked to semantic integration such that the processing of the pronoun in the baseline showed a reduced effect as compared to the ambiguous context and the context that required updating in both English and in Spanish. The results for second language processing showed similar brain responses, particularly when the task in the second study drew explicit attention to reference, suggesting that similar mechanisms underlie the processing of a first and second language, but that second language processing is impacted by the extent to which attention is drawn to metalinguistic information. In terms of broader impacts, the project provided critical scientific training opportunities in both second language acquisition and cognitive neuroscience for two undergraduate students, one from an underrepresented group, and three graduate students.
