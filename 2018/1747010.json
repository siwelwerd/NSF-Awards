 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project objective is to overcome weaknesses of current composite materials due to delamination and develop composites with more than 100% improvement in interlaminar toughness. The project aims to accelerate the innovation of epoxy/resin nanoadditives for composite materials in order to solve this problem. Composites are expected to be the fastest growing application segment in the global epoxy resin market, with an estimated compounded annual growth rate of ~6% and an expected market value of $14.5 billion by 2024. The key drivers in the market are the end-use industries which include aerospace, automotive, transportation, and coatings. There is a critical need to make these materials safer and more reliable by increasing their low velocity impact resistance, and to increase the adhesion between laminar layers. The product could have an obtainable market volume of $36 million in the US alone by 2021.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project is in the development of new hybrid nanofillers based on Graphene Oxide (GO) and Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxane (POSS). These nanofillers can be added to epoxy/vinyl ester/polyester matrices through a \"Master Batch\" process to enhance the interlaminar fracture toughness of commercial composites. This increase in fracture toughness can be more than 100% at extremely low addition levels (~0.2% by weight of the composite) without any changes in current manufacturing processes. Nanofillers such as carbon nanotubes and nanoclays are difficult to add to composite matrices because of their tendency to agglomerate and result in poor dispersion, apart from major changes in current manufacturing practices. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated that it is possible to develop these hybrid nanofillers based on GO and POSS that can be added to composite matrices with excellent dispersion in composite industry standard solvents. The challenges of dispersion are overcome through hybridization and Master Batching. Characterization of the cured Master Batches as well as measurement of physical properties of sample composites will be carried out to optimize the nanofiller content and the processing parameters.",

GO is a single atomic layered material made by oxidation of graphite. It is an oxidized form of graphene, contained with oxygen-containing groups (Fig.1). It is dispersible in water and other polar organic solvents. It has high surface area (theoretical specific surface area 2630 m<sup>2</sup>/g). GO and its modified forms can be mixed with different polymers and other materials to enhance properties of composites materials like tensile strength, elasticity, conductivity, thermal properties, toughness and other properties. POSS is a hybrid organic and inorganic material with a core shell structure of silica (Fig. 2). The rigid inorganic core provides the strength and oxidative stability. The organic part provides processability and compatibility with other materials. By incorporating POSS into plastics and thermosets, improvements in mechanical properties, thermal properties and light weight can be achieved. Taking advantages of those properties of GO and POSS, MITO has developed novel hybrid nano-fillers (GO-w-POSS) (Fig. 3). MITO has scaled the nano-fillers synthesis to&nbsp;<strong>70 g/batch from lab scale of 6 g/batch.</strong>&nbsp;To make MITO hybrid nano-fillers, GO was chemically modified to GO-amine to make it compatible with most common and least expensive variety of POSS (EP0409 POSS, Fig. 2). The modified GO (GO-amine) was then reacted with EP0409 POSS. Purified scaled&nbsp;GO-w-POSS nano-fillers were characterized using various techniques like Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). GO-w-POSS nano-fillers prepared in this project, showed&nbsp;<strong>excellent dispersion in polar organic solvents and common industrial resins like epoxies, vinyl esters and polyesters</strong>. Master batches of GO-w-POSS nano-fillers (1 to 15 wt.%) were prepared by dispersing it in different resins like epoxy, vinyl ester and polyester using a three-roll mill. Composites of resins (epoxy, vinyl ester, polyester) and GO-w-POSS nano-fillers were prepared and dynamic mechanical properties were measured. In all resins (epoxy, vinyl ester and polyester) system,&nbsp;significant increases in glass transition temperatures (T<sub>g</sub>)&nbsp;were observed at 0.1 wt.% of nano-filler concentration in the composites. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) of epoxy/GO-w-POSS, vinyl ester/GO-w-POSS and polyester/GO-w-POSS composites, showed in average&nbsp;<strong>6.1, 11.4 and 11.6&nbsp;<sup>o</sup>C rise in T<sub>g&nbsp;</sub>at 0.1 wt.% nano-filler concentration</strong>. Similarly, average&nbsp;increase in storage moduli were found to be&nbsp;<strong>9, 25.5 and 30.2%&nbsp;</strong>for epoxy/GO-w-POSS, vinyl ester/GO-w-POSS and polyester/GO-w-POSS nano-fillers composites respectively, at 0.1% nano-filler concentration.&nbsp;In this research project, fiber reinforced composites were prepared using different type of fabrics and GO-w-POSS nano-fillers dispersion in polymer carrier. Double cantilever beam (DCB) tests were performed to test those composites. DCB results of those tests revealed that&nbsp;mode I interlaminar&nbsp;fracture toughness (G<sub>IC</sub>, mode I energy release rate) increased from&nbsp;<strong>48 to 73.6%&nbsp;</strong>for fiber reinforced composites with 0.1 wt.% or less amount of nano-fillers in the composites compared to neat composites samples without GO-w-POSS nano-fillers. Single edge notch beam (SENB) tests results on composites of resins and GO-w-POSS nano-fillers showed&nbsp;increases in&nbsp;the toughness of polymer composites in term of critical-stress-intensity factor, K<sub>IC</sub>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<strong>4 to 14%&nbsp;</strong>at 0.1 wt.% of nano-fillers concentration in the composites.&nbsp;All these results suggest that MITO product is a novel material that enhances thermal properties, storage moduli and toughness of polymer composites, especially fiber reinforced polymer composites, at extremely low nano-fillers loading (0.1 - 0.2 wt.%) without sacrificing polymer properties.</p>\n<p>On the commercialization side, over the past 12 months, MITO has conducted over&nbsp;200 customer interviews&nbsp;alongside the ongoing scale up initiative. Since scaling up,&nbsp;MITO has started testing with&nbsp;<strong>four different customers with at least 15 other companies&nbsp;</strong>interested in testing.&nbsp;MITO has been collaborating with&nbsp;<strong>OLIN&nbsp;</strong>(world's largest epoxy producer/formulator),&nbsp;<strong>PRO-SET&nbsp;</strong>(cutting edge mid-market epoxy producer/formulator),&nbsp;<strong>Seriforge&nbsp;</strong>(startup that has a patented a method to 3D print carbon fiber parts), and&nbsp;<strong>Basanite&nbsp;</strong>(composite reinforcement for infrastructure).&nbsp;Alongside these scaling efforts, MITO has also&nbsp;raised $490,000 in a convertible note and should be closing on the remaining $360,000 within the next few months. With this money,&nbsp;MITO was able to hire on an intern and another full-time employee, bringing the&nbsp;<strong>total of jobs created by MITO to five</strong>. With the combination of investment and the NSF fund, MITO was able to pivot from selling to the original equipment manufacturers to the epoxy formulators/producers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/08/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Bhishma&nbsp;R&nbsp;Sedai</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1747010/1747010_10526629_1546873419530_Grapheneoxidelayer--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1747010/1747010_10526629_1546873419530_Grapheneoxidelayer--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Graphene oxide layer\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1747010/1747010_10526629_1546873419530_Grapheneoxidelayer--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Graphene oxide layer\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A schematic diagram of graphene oxide layer</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">MITO</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Bhishma&nbsp;R&nbsp;Sedai</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Graphene oxide layer</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1747010/1747010_10526629_1546873541091_POSSstrucuture--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1747010/1747010_10526629_1546873541091_POSSstrucuture--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"EP0409\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1747010/1747010_10526629_1546873541091_POSSstrucuture--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"EP0409\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Structure of EP0409 POSS</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">MITO</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Bhishma&nbsp;R&nbsp;Sedai</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">EP0409</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1747010/1747010_10526629_1546873696533_GO-w-POSShybridnanomaterial--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1747010/1747010_10526629_1546873696533_GO-w-POSShybridnanomaterial--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"GO-w-POSS nano-fillers\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1747010/1747010_10526629_1546873696533_GO-w-POSShybridnanomaterial--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"GO-w-POSS nano-fillers\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A schematic diagram showing GO-w-POSS nano material</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">MITO</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Bhishma&nbsp;R&nbsp;Sedai</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">GO-w-POSS nano-fillers</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
