 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a growing need in biomedical research to observe biological structure and processes on the length scales smaller than 100nm. Conventional optical systems cannot effectively provide such information, however, due to the infamous diffraction limit. The formulation of the diffraction limit fundamentally relies on the presumed linearity in the interaction between the illuminating light and the object. The goal of this project is to overcome the diffraction limit by exploiting nonlinearities from a modern signal processing perspective. This project will lay out theoretical, algorithmic, and instrumentation foundation for nonlinear diffractive imaging. The outcome of this project can open up many possibilities of high-resolution imaging in highly scattering media that are ubiquitous in science and medicine, including histology, cytometry, brain mapping, and drug discovery. The proposed activities will also promote education through the training of students in a wide range of topics within signal processing, computational imaging, and optics, and through related curriculum development efforts where the basic themes of the proposed research will be incorporated in courses taught by the investigators.\r\n\r\nThe focus of this research is to develop computational imaging methods that fully harness the information encoded in two types of nonlinearities: object-light interactions and prior assumptions on the objects. Concretely, the work will focus on: (a) efficient schemes for data acquisition, (b) scalable algorithms for 3D reconstruction, and (c) two novel application platforms for validation. Results from this research will lead to a single, holistic signal processing framework that can maximally extract the information encoded in nonlinear measurements.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It is based on the idea that one can break the traditional limit established on linear theory by exploiting two types of nonlinearities arising from both multiple-scattering physical models and nonlinear image priors. Towards this goal, this collaborative project has made the following major advancements:</p>\n<p>1) Development of two nonlinear multiple-scattering physical models and its accompanying iterative reconstruction algorithm that incorporates sparsity priors and their demonstration on real holographic measurements.</p>\n<p>2) Development of nonlinear priors that are implicitly parametrized by neural networks and several \"model-based\" deep learning algorithms and their demonstration on real optical diffraction tomography experiments.</p>\n<p>3) Demonstration of several scalable and efficient inversion algorithms to enable high-speed large-scale optical tomography reconstructions.</p>\n<p>4) Development of a novel adaptive deep learning framework to perform 3D descattering at different scattering conditions and its demonstration on real experimental holographic measurements.</p>\n<p>5) Development of a novel diffractive imaging technique that combines a novel optical system, novel acquisition strategy, and a reconstruction algorithm and its pilot study for computational funduscopy on artificial retinals.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong></p>\n<p>The project has made intellectual advancements in the following areas:</p>\n<p><strong>1) Novel forward models for efficient and accurate computation of large-scale multiple scattering process. </strong>&nbsp;Significant progress has been made to design advanced signal processing techniques based on classical linear scattering models. Through several theoretical, algorithmic, and experimental studies, the nonlinear multiple-scattering forward models developed in this project may further advance the model-based imaging field to enable novel nonlinear diffractive imaging techniques and achieve super resolution imaging in 3D.</p>\n<p><strong>2) Scalable model-based deep learning algorithm for nonlinear diffractive imaging.</strong> By innovating on scalable and efficient reconstruction algorithms that embed advanced neural network-based image priors, this project has led to a deeper understanding of how deep learning-based priors can trigger practical impact in large-scale, high-resolution 3D imaging.</p>\n<p><strong>3) Adaptive deep learning framework.</strong> Existing deep learning models are limited for descattering applications, since individual \"expert\" networks have to be trained for each condition. This project developed a drastically different approach, termed dynamic synthesis network, that can dynamically adjust the model weights and adapt to different scattering conditions. This new framework not only can be used for \"end-to-end\" descattering, but also can be used in the model-based deep learning framework to further integrate the nonlinear multiple-scattering models.

The project has been in close collaboration with Dr. Ulugbek Kamilov's team (Washington University in St. Louis) in the form of regular tele-conference meetings.&nbsp; During this process, they have gained practice and feedbacks in improving efficient communication skills. Additionally, they have been gained extensive training in all aspects of this project, including formulating the signal processing theory, algorithmic development and implementation, and optical imaging device development.&nbsp; In addition, three undergraduate students (including one female) have worked on different aspects of this project through the Boston University Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP). Furthermore, one high-school student has worked on developing the diffuser funduscopy prototype through the Boston University Research in Science &amp; Engineering (RISE) program.&nbsp; The project has provided invaluable opportunities to these students on learning and hands-on experiences on modern signal processing and machine learning skills.</p>\n<p><strong>Education.</strong> The topics studied in the project has been continuously integrated and revised as three course modules into the PI's graduate-level course <br />\"Computational Optical Imaging\" in Boston University.
