 "awd_abstract_narration": "The I/UCRC Science of Heterogeneous Additive Printing of 3D Materials (SHAP3D) will serve the diverse interests of industry, government, and academia to address fundamental challenges to meet the commercial needs of industry for heterogeneous 3D printing of materials. The additive manufacturing (AM) is viewed as a research area for global competitive advantage by industries such as automotive, medical, aerospace, and consumer products. SHAP3D aims to accelerate expansion and competitiveness of the domestic AM industry and its customers by addressing two critical market needs: (1) the growth of AM into more complex topologies, heterogeneous, and multi-functional applications that command high margins commensurate with their increased performance, and (2) the expansion of AM into lower margin industries via order-of-magnitude improvements in throughput, material-per-performance cost reductions, and ease-of-use design rules that enable small and medium-sized enterprises and large companies to rapidly adopt advanced techniques. The Center will disseminate its design, material and process research to industrial members and the broader academic community. SHAP3D will provide a technically trained workforce, with industrial perspective, through the close collaboration between industry and academia. GT site-specific educational programs include collaborating with an AM-related REU site and outreaching to K-12 through NSF research experience for teacher (RET) program. \r\n \r\nThe SHAP3D research supported by Georgia Tech (GT) will be driven by the performance requirements of industry, built from a technical foundation of the fundamental structure-processing-property relationships associated with the voxel-level control and integration of diverse processes and materials. The enormous number of material combinations possible in these multi-material systems multiplied by the parameter space represented within processes with voxel-level state-variable control requires a fundamental understanding of the material (constituents, fillers, interfaces) properties, processing protocols, and design rules to reliably predict the properties of products. Despite the diverse materials and process combinations, they are unified by many underlying physical principles related to melting, processing, and solidification, and interfacial physics for heterogeneous additive printing of materials. The Center will support members' choice of AM methods and research that encompasses numerous additive printing methods, including fused filament fabrication (FFF), stereolithography/digital light processing (SLA/DLP), inkjet, and other additive approaches. GT-site will use its expertise to support research related to 3D printing-based design methods, modeling for the 3D printing process, novel resins, and functional devices.  The Center and GT-site will add significant value for the industry by addressing their vision to additively manufacture dissimilar materials into heterogeneous, valued-added products imbued with previously unattained biological, chemical, electrical, and mechanical functionality.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
