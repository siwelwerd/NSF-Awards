 "awd_abstract_narration": "The manufacturing workforce is one of the largest sectors in the nation's workforce. In the state of Ohio, employment in industries such as food manufacturing and computer and electronic product manufacturing are expected to continue to grow. In this project, Columbus State Community College will collaborate with Lorain County Community College, other educational institutions, as well as state and industry partners to address this growing need. The project will build a statewide network to advance experiential work-based learning programs and recruitment for the advanced manufacturing field. The work-based learning model will focus on students applying their skills in a specific occupation. The network will promote best practices for this model and support faculty in using the principles of work-based learning at community colleges. The project will enhance the preparation of students, increase the number of skilled technicians, and help strengthen the regional workforce.\r\n\r\nThis project will aim to increase the supply of qualified advanced manufacturing technicians by creating new opportunities for work-based learning and outreach to students through a collaborative, structured statewide network. Three objectives will guide the work of the project. First, the project team will create a work-based learning online platform to collect and share best practices and resources, and provide promotional tools for companies, educators, and students. Second, the team will form a statewide network for community colleges and an industry leadership team for developing public-private partnerships. Third, the principal investigators will develop an outreach and recruitment strategy that community colleges can utilize to increase the number of students entering advanced manufacturing career pathways. The online platform will allow educators to form a community of practice for work-based learning to determine the best-practice models that align with their institutions and obtain advice from peers on adapting and launching work-based programs. Students will be able to use the platform to explore these programs and learn how to prepare for these experiences. Companies will also be able to participate on the platform to learn about benefits of various work-based learning models, how to become involved, and specific opportunities and contacts at local community colleges. The project will incorporate wide dissemination of results and sharing of best practices to recruit and retain under-served populations, focusing on students in economically disadvantaged high schools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nProject Summary \n\n\nThe Manufacturing Experiential Advancement Readiness Network Project (EARN) (DUE 1800612) was a collaboration between Columbus State Community College and Lorain County Community College to build-upon existing models of Earn-and-Learn programs, to create resources, and to build relationships with institutions and industry partners to disseminate and replicate the model across Ohio. The implementation of these programs is designed to maximally affect student employment outcomes upon graduation while minimally impacting existing curriculum and academic processes. Program participants are uniquely set up for success after earning their degree from participating in on-the-job training and experiences for at least a year prior to entering the manufacturing workforce full-time. \n\n\nKey Accomplishments \n\n\n\nEarn-and-Learn Replication Guide - Leveraging the different perspectives and approaches to Earn-and-Learn models, Columbus State and Lorain County created a replication guide that resides in Ohio Tech Net, an existing network of manufacturing educators and companies. The guide details the underlying need for and purpose of Earn-and-Learn programs, best practices for implementation, and instructions for each step of the process from ideation to evaluation. Additionally, the guide includes templates, tools, and resources that will allow institutions to jumpstart their programs.  \n\n\nEARN Network - Through partnerships and outreach with institutions across Ohio in addition to consortia like the Ohio Tech Net, Ohio Manufacturer's Assocation, and the Central Ohio Manufacturing Partnership, the EARN project team-built relationships to replicate what CSCC and LCCC had pioneered with other institutions. Co-sponsoring the Ohio Cooperative Education Association 2022 Conference was the most tangible manifestation of this network.  \n\n\nEarn-and-Learn Program Growth - The EARN project is only successful through the continued growth of Columbus State's Modern Manufacturing Work Study (MMWS) and Lorain County's Training Recruitment Acceleration Innovation Network of Ohio (TRAIN OH). Persistent improvement in both these Earn-and-Learn programs resulted in cultivating sustainable relationships with employers; in positive indicators of success for student performance, retention, and conversion to full-time status after graduation; and in building reputations among industry partners as leaders within the sector.  \n\n\n\n\n\nImpact \n\n\nThe EARN grant project's greatest impact was the relationships that the team developed in the manufacturing field where there previously were none. Having built an industry and educational presence of the Earn-and-Learn model from the ground-up means that areas bereft of engineering and manufacturing programs now have a model to grow community members in those fields. Institutions are now more in-tune with the needs of industry partners and employers, which will better set students up for success post-graduation. Outcome metrics across the board in retention, academic progress, and job placement and satisfaction have increased as a result of the grant. E&amp;L programs will continue to sustainably grow across Ohio as a direct result from the work of the EARN project team.  \n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/19/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark Gerko"
