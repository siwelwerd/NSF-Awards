 "awd_abstract_narration": "Volcanic eruptions pose one of the principal hazards at tectonically active continental margins, such as the Pacific northwestern United States, which are of ever increasing economic and existential importance to expanding populations. The project will enhance knowledge of the conditions that lead to eruptions of silica-rich magmas, which can be large and impactful. Achieving this goal is contingent upon the integration of observations through reliable physics-based models that have been tested in their predictive capabilities. This is the project's principal focus and it will advance understanding of the fundamental processes that determine the progression of volcanic eruptions, from inception to cessation, which remains difficult to forecast. Consequently, the project transcends the purely academic and is societally relevant by advancing natural hazard assessment capabilities. Furthermore, the project supports education by enabling the interdisciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students as well as a postdoctoral scholar, thus contributing to the development of a diverse and globally competitive workforce.\r\n\r\nThe project's objective is to advance fundamental knowledge of how volcanoes work by simulating a volcanic eruption from initial explosive activity through lava effusion, to termination of the eruption and post-eruptive inflation, using the 2011/12 Cordon Caulle eruption in Chile as a case study. For this eruption the run-up, the syn-eruptive evolution, and the post-eruptive reconfiguration of the volcanic system were documented in unprecedented detail. The eruption was initially explosive and over time eruption rates decreased with activity shifting from purely explosive to effusive, resulting in the formation of a large lava flow and shallow laccolith. The current view about these types of eruptions is that over some range of identical conditions effusive or explosive activity is possible and with potentially rapid transitions from one to the other. One goal of the project is the assessment of conditions resulting in transitions in eruptive activity in order to test this explosive-effusive bistability hypothesis. Moreover, rapid post-eruptive inflation was observed and a further goal is to assess the extent to which the system has been driven back toward a critical state. These goals will be achieved by integrating the different observational data within extensive physics-based model simulations that will lead to improvements in model reliability and further our understanding of underlying processes at Cordon Caulle and similar hazardous volcanic systems elsewhere. The project as such is multi-disciplinary and encompasses geochemistry, petrology and geodesy, in addition to numerical simulation of magma storage and eruption. As a consequence, the project is also multi-institutional and in addition to existing observations, new data will be acquired through efforts led by the other collaborating institutions. The portion of the project that Rice University will focus on - in collaboration with the other institutions - are the numerical simulation and the integration of the different types of observational data.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

(2) Modeling of the effusive (ash venting) during 2011/12 at Cordon Caulle, in order to understand how abundant magmatic vapor escapes from the erupting magma to form a dense obsidian flow. (3) Modeling of magma storage complex beneath Cordon Caulle in order to test a new hypothesis for the cause of ongoing inflationary deformation. (4) A preliminary analysis of stream water temperature data collected at Cordon Caulle to improve our understanding of the heat budget of Cordon Caulle.</p>\n<p><br />A key variable that governs volcanic eruptions is the geometry of the volcanic conduit through which magma flows to the surface. There are virtually no observational constraints and predictions of eruptive activity through numerical modeling usually make broad assumptions about conduit geometry. The rate at which magma pressure decreases, as it flows toward the surface during an eruption, is controlled by conduit geometry and, in turn, determines the rate at which magmatic vapor (predominantly water) is lost from the magma through bubble nucleation and growth, leading ultimately to magma fragmentation within the conduit and explosive eruptive activity. We have developed a new model that avoids a priori assumptions about conduit geometry and in addition explicitly models bubble nucleation and growth. The latter occurs because the magma, at depth prior to eruption, contains about 5% of dissolved water. The solubility of such volatiles decreases with pressure and leads to the formation of bubbles as magma erupts. Because our model incorporates bubble nucleation and growth, it represents a new advance in simulation capabilities, enabling us to leverage observations of vesicle size and number density in erupted pyroclasts to constrain eruption models (Figure 1). These data are obtained from sampling of the Cordon Caulle tephra and we find that they are best explained by volcanic conduits that are larger at depth and decrease in size going upward, resulting in multiple episodes of bubble nucleation that ultimately drive the magma to fragment and result in a sustained explosive eruption.</p>\n<p><br />The explosive eruption at Cordon Caulle transitioned over time to lava effusion, and for the first time observed closely at Cordon Caulle. In contrast to expectations, this phase of the eruption was surprisingly vigorous with continuous high-speed jets of ash-laden water vapor and small explosions taking place at the vent. This ash-venting activity has also been called hybrid explosive-effusive and is thought to be the consequence of water vapor bubbles inside the magma bleeding off to form intermittent hydraulic fractures that transport the water vapor to the surface. This allows the magma to erupt as dense obsidian instead of highly vesicular pumice, as would be the case if the water vapor were not to escape from the erupting magma. We found that this outgassing through intermittent fractures is a viable hypothesis based on&nbsp; combined analysis of video footage (Figure 2) and numerical modeling (Figure 3) of this eruptive phase.</p>\n<p><br />In 2012, toward the end of the eruption, Cordon Caulle started to undergo inflationary uplift of about 3 inches per year, which is continuing to date. Based on the observation that erupted lava contains inclusions of mostly crystallized magma with interstitial glass of identical composition as the crystal-poor magma that was erupted, we hypothesize that the eruption was fed from a layer of crystal-poor magma that segregated from a deeper and much larger crystal-rich magma reservoir. We further hypothesize that magma withdrawal from the crystal-poor layer during the eruption lowered shallow magma pressure, led to the upward percolation of interstitial melt from the crystal-rich deeper reservoir, and is causing the observed inflationary uplift. We have tested this hypothesis through numerical modeling of the magma storage system beneath Cordon Caulle (Figure 4). We find that our hypothesis is plausible and have identified the range of parameters, such as chamber size and properties of the magma within, that are consistent with the observed deformation.</p>\n<p><br />The water temperature of the streams that are draining the site of the 2011/2012 eruption (Figure 5) is approximately 90 degrees Fahrenheit and considerably higher than would be expected without the addition of geothermal heat from the volcanic system. We started collecting stream temperature data during the projects field campaigns. Over the course of several years water temperature shows rapid drops during rain/snow storms followed by exponentially decaying rates of recovery toward average high temperatures (Figure 6). In an ongoing monitoring and data analysis effort, this data is being used to constrain the heat flow from Cordon Caulle's shallow magmatic system as well as the slowly cooling lava flow.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/20/2024<br>\nModified by: Helge&nbsp;M&nbsp;Gonnermann</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1824252/1824252_10568755_1732120729634_Crozier_Fig3--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1824252/1824252_10568755_1732120729634_Crozier_Fig3--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1824252/1824252_10568755_1732120729634_Crozier_Fig3--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Video analysis of hybrid phase of the 2011/12 Cord\ufffdn Caulle eruption.
