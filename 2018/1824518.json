 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the proliferation of wireless applications and devices, the demand for wireless data, and hence for wireless bandwidth, is growing exponentially. Unfortunately, these growing demands need to be met via the available radio spectrum, which is limited and therefore has to be efficiently shared among various wireless systems and devices. Effective spectrum sharing demands enhanced capability and increased intelligence at the wireless devices, capable of operating over multiple frequency bands through multiple radio access technologies (RATs); this is becoming a reality thanks to the continuous advances in the industrial sector. Therefore, the globally interconnected wireless networks are evolving into a large-scale system that simultaneously supports billions of user and trillions of devices and exhibits huge heterogeneity in all aspects. The goal of this proposal is to realize efficient spectrum and energy utilization in this huge, dynamic and heterogeneous system. In contrast to existing approaches, a new angle is taken in this project that exploits the richness and complexity of the multi-RAT, multi-band environments to our advantage, in a multi-layer fashion, so as to achieve dramatic improvement in resource utilization and system performance. The expected outcome will be valuable to all players in the wireless industry, as well as to all sectors of the national economy that benefit from wireless innovation. The inter-disciplinary nature of the proposed research will naturally help promote cross-disciplinary education and well-rounded training of the future information technology workforce.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research is comprised of four thrusts: (i) acquisition and analytics of real-time spectrum activities to build multi-layer spectrum snapshots, which we call SpecSnap, (ii) building a fundamental framework to construct distributed and time/energy-efficient spectrum allocation algorithms under heterogeneous environments with multi-RAT in a principled manner, both for single-hop access to infrastructure and multihop access for device-to-device (D2D) communications, (iii) studying how to achieve fast rendezvous in multi-layer spectrum environments, and (iv) exploring abundant opportunities in multi-layer networks for efficient pairwise and broadcast communications via intra- and inter-layer topology design. The main challenge lies in the extreme heterogeneity of spectrum band occupancy and quality-of-service requirement of devices operating on diverse frequency bands with different channel characteristics over a wide range of spatio-temporal scales. The proposed research will be evaluated through theoretical analysis, numerical and network simulation, prototype implementation, and experimentation on real testbeds.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Based on our measurements of 4  million samples, we are able to find the detailed association among user  ID (that is, Radio Network Temporary Identity), packet size, resource  blocks, and time advance (TA) values, as well as user mobility and user  data rates. This outcome was presented in IEEE INFOCOM 2020 and appear  in IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing (2022). Therefore, this reseach  result fullfills our vision in the original proposal to take 'spectrum  snapshot' in each time interval of 10ms for spectrum monitoring and  management. Based on U-CIMAN, we are able to develop a spectrum  prediction framework, and further develop a spectrum mobility model (<em>FluME), </em>which  takes the advange of recent developments in machine learning, e.g.,  Q-learning to predict spectrum usage in subsequent 40ms, for which the outcome are in preparation for final submission to IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications. These outcome can  broadly benefit spectrum allocation and further improve spectum  efficiency toward high data rates in future wireless systems.</p>\n<p>Second, we explored efficient Content Delivery in User-Centric and Cache-Enabled Edge Networks appear in IEEE Tran. on Vehicular Technology (2023). We consider that&nbsp; modern mobile users frequently require diverse types of content for mission-critical decision-making and entertainment. These contents are required to be fully delivered to the requesters within stringent deadlines that the existing radio access technology (RAT) solutions may fail to ensure. Motivated by the above consideration, this work exploits content caching in vehicular edge networks (VENs) with a software-defined user-centric virtual cell (VC) based RAT solution for delivering the requested contents from a proximity edge server. Moreover, to capture the heterogeneous demands of<br />the connected vehicles (CVs), we introduce a preference-popularity tradeoff in their content request model. To that end, we formulate a joint optimization problem for content placement, CV scheduling, VC configuration, VC-CV association and radio resource allocation to minimize long-term content delivery delay.</p>\n<p>Moreover, we propose a generic system model for a special category of interdependent networks, demand-supply networks, in which the demand and the supply nodes areassociated with heterogeneous loads and resources, respectively. Our model sheds a light on a unique cascading failure mechanism induced by resource/load fluctuations, which in turn opens the door to conducting stress analysis on interdependent networks. Compared to the existing literature mainly concerned with the node connectivity, we focus on developing effective resource allocation methods to prevent these cascading failures from happening and to mitigate/confine them upon occurrence in the network. To prevent cascading failures, we identify some dangerous stress mechanisms, based on which we quantify the robustness of the network in terms of the resource configuration scheme. Afterward, we identify the optimal resource configuration under two resource/load fluctuations scenarios: uniform and proportional fluctuations. We further investigate the optimal resource configuration problem considering heterogeneous resource sharing costs among the nodes. To mitigate/confine ongoing cascading failures, we propose two network<br />adaptations mechanisms: intentional failure and resource re-adjustment, based on which we propose an algorithm to mitigate an ongoing cascading failure while<br />reinforcing the surviving network with a high robustness to avoid further failures.
