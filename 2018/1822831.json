 "awd_abstract_narration": "The employment landscape is changing and expanding, creating uncertainty as individuals navigate decisions regarding career preparation and continuing education.  This project develops technology to provide guidance for college students to access high quality information and guidance within a large and complex decision space. The approach includes integrating social support from human career coaches or peers to increase confidence and motivation in the problem solving and decision making process. The approach is fundamentally data driven, built upon computational modeling while informed by theories of human behavior, embodied within a novel machine learning paradigm termed Socially-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning (SSRL). Based on this new paradigm, the system will generate guidance to support students while being sensitive to student needs and preferences so that there is a high probability that students will accept and benefit from the guidance. The project targets nontraditional students who embark upon or advance STEM career paths and aims to broaden participation in STEM.\r\n\r\nThe project contributes to both human-computer interaction and machine learning and takes an interdisciplinary approach in its modeling of human interaction and sociotechnical support for learning. It comprises a three pronged solution: (1) a computational modeling strand proposes new computational paradigms that continually map best practices and inform data-driven recommendations in support of effective decision making; (2) a behavioral research strand provides insight through qualitative and quantitative investigations, uncovering properties of recommendations as well as recommenders that are associated with whether guidance is accepted and how it influences success in career advancement; and (3) an intelligent coach development strand embodies findings from the other two strands in the CareerScope Intelligent Coach Agent (ICA), designed as a sociotechnical solution leading to impact student decision making. The partnership with Western Governor's University (WGU) facilitates transition of research into practice at large scale through research with WGU students and deployment on the WGU platform. While the research will be housed within a single platform, the technical innovations will ultimately be integrated into a wide range of platforms. The results of this project will broaden understanding of the limitations and opportunities for ICAs to guide learners, particularly non-traditional learners, through their career paths. These results can inform both online and brick-and-mortar universities how to best coach/train/mentor students or integrate peer/professional mentorship and peer interaction into current advising practices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe employment landscape is changing, creating uncertainty as individuals navigate decisions regarding both career preparation and continuing education. These issues were exacerbated during COVID.  The broad impact goal of this proposal was to develop technology support to pave the way for increasing the ability of individuals to move into more financially viable career paths.  Our work has focused on partnership with the nation\u2019s largest fully online university, Western Governor\u2019s University (WGU), to increase its success in providing opportunities for working individuals to attain credentials for career advancement.\n\nThe intellectual merit of the proposal consists of fundamental contributions to two subfields of Computer Science, including Human-Computer Interaction and Machine Learning. The more human-centered strand has sought to gain insight regarding student engagement on the platform and their interactions with university faculty and staff, thus uncovering trends that point to avenues for increasing success.  A series of classroom studies of online university level instruction were partly supported by this grant and produced insights specifically related to the impact of types and timing of prompts introduced into computer-supported collaborative learning activities in order to increase learning outcomes.  A synergistic computational modeling strand built on these insights by proposing new technical infrastructure for hosting computer-supported collaborative learning activities, especially in terms of automated adaptation of support strategies to the specific needs of collaborative groups through interaction tracking and strategy adjustment. PhD students, Masters students, and technical staff contributed towards this work.  In order to magnify the impact of the research, we developed basic technologies that not only supported the research and interventions that were formally part of this research but that are freely available for other researchers and practitioners to utilize in their own work. \n\nCOVID provided the impetus for a shift in focus as well as opportunities.  As education across the globe was experiencing an emergency move to online education, WGU was proceeding as usual in terms of its completely online engagement with students, but addressing the new needs of students that arise because of COVID and not because of the learning mode per se.  This placed the research team in the unique position of being able to separate effects of the emergency move from effects of the pandemic itself.  As we conducted the research in close partnership with Western Governor's University, and especially in light of COVID, we focused more and more on the opportunity to boost student success on the platform through increasing the level of social support available. \n\nOne of the scientific outcomes of the grant was findings from an analysis of over a million student-weeks of data collected during the pandemic, which prompts specific directions for technology enhancement of online degree platforms like WGU.  WGU Students are assigned a program mentor who mentors them, as a continual provision of social support, through their program from enrollment to graduation.  We conducted an analysis of student engagement by tracking active students between January 2019 &ndash; April 2020. Based on an automated analysis of student records, we were able to divide students into those most hard hit by the pandemic &ndash; through their own illness or of close family members or because of being healthcare workers -- and those who were not.   Overall, there was a statistically significant positive relationship between intensity of interaction with the program mentor and activity on the platform and success in courses.  In comparison with previous semesters, overall, students at WGU did not achieve less academic success on the platform during the most intense period of the pandemic than earlier periods of time. \n\nThe insights from the pandemic analysis prompted the aim to increase available social support on the WGU platform, where apart from interaction with the program mentors, student experience is relatively solitary.  We did this by developing an onboarding intervention where students were able to complete an activity with another student, guided by an intelligent conversational agent, which is a computer program that can act as a discussion facilitator.  This lightweight intervention can be deployed at scale, thus, if successful has the potential to dramatically impact the campus community.  A randomized control trial was conducted in Fall of 2021.  Students were randomly assigned to one of 3 conditions: (1) no intervention control, (2) onboarding activity with computer agent but no other student, and (3) onboarding activity with computer agent and another student.  Students in condition 3 were significantly more likely to enroll in and complete a course within 30 day of the onboarding than students in the other two conditions.\n\nThe PI of this grant is launching a fully online certificate program in Computational Data Science, which will make use of the technology and findings that have come from this grant.  The findings have been disseminated through numerous invited talks and publications.  And the tools are freely available through Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Simon Initiative Toolkit.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/09/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Carolyn P Rose"
