 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many states across the developing world lack the capacity to provide their citizens with basic human welfare needs, a trend linked to internationalized violence, illegal economic activity, and other deleterious dynamics. Yet welfare outcomes often starkly diverge within these country cases. Moreover, differences often manifest between cities or villages with similar ethnoreligious demographics and official political party representation. This project draws upon local-level data on social service provision, qualitative interviews, and an original survey to understand this variation in the context of contemporary Lebanon. Of particular interest to the researcher is why some Lebanese cities enjoy access to local \"public\" goods, such as waste management and consistent street lighting, while in others attempts to provide such services stall or are actively blocked. The author argues that local relationships between elite family networks play a crucial role in shaping how people access services. Specifically, in areas where one elite family or an alliance of families monopolizes political power, such public services are an effective way to ensure the support of local constituents. In areas with higher levels of competition between families, however, more individualized attempts at vote-buying predominate. The project disaggregates and thus provides a more micro-level understanding of so-called \"weak states,\" where policymakers have recently begun to investigate the conditions under which non-state governance succeeds or fails.  \r\n\r\nIn many lower and middle-income countries, the central government fails to provide even basic social services, yet welfare outcomes drastically diverge at the sub-national level. In the case of Lebanon, explanations focusing on the role of national electoral institutions, official parties, or religious categories fail to explain important micro-level variation in distributive politics. This project uses a multi-method research design to explain why local political elites extend a variety of critical quasi-public (club) goods in certain Lebanese municipalities, while resorting to more transactional vote-buying in others. Drawing upon fifteen months of fieldwork across numerous Lebanon cities, over a hundred interviews, quantitative spatial analysis, and an original survey, the author argues that the relationships between local kinship networks - nested within political factions and religious communities - shape opportunities for elite collective action. Specifically, areas where one elite family or a familial coalition has excluded rivals from political power consistently provide more local public services, though usually via informal means that allow elites to secure private economic benefits. In areas with consistent inter-familial competition, highly individualized exchanges occur, while local infrastructure and communal goods are neglected. These findings suggest that formalized local institutions intended by the state to promote order, such as municipal councils and associated elections, are often co-opted and supplanted by informal social networks, producing counterintuitive outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
