 "awd_abstract_narration": "Supernovae are the most energetic explosions known. The very most energetic supernovae (SNe) are thought to form from the direct collapse of a rapidly rotating star into a black hole. The types of stellar systems which produce these SNe are not well understood. The very hot, massive stars known as Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are capable of producing features observed in such SNe explosions. However, the role of WR stars in binary star systems in producing supernovae has not been observationally studied in detail. The investigators will use large telescopes to show how the light from such SNe explosions is polarized; this will help determine how the explosion occurred. They will then use computer models to better understand and interpret material flowing out from the supernovae. They will organize a summer camp for middle-school girls of color, following up with mentoring throughout the school year. They will then assess the feasibility of establishing such a program at USNA. \r\n\r\nThis project uses the method of spectropolarimetry to observationally determine the morphology of the winds in WR binaries. Spectropolarimetry probes the scattering history of polarized emission lines, revealing their formation and scattering locations within the system. Existing polarimetric observations of the V444 Cyg system, a prototypical WR+O eclipsing binary, suggest that a shock-cone structure exists due to the collision of the two stars' winds. The study will quantify this behavior in similar systems and determine the range of morphological characteristics winds in WR+O display. Monte Carlo modeling will allow the team to interpret the results, predict polarimetric signatures from interacting binary stars, and compare the results to current theories of WR winds and binary evolutions. They propose to continue a successful pilot project using the RRS instrument on the South African Large Telescope to construct well-sampled polarization phase curves for ~15 WR binary systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

But although the process by which a single massive star explodes as a supernova is well understood, the effects of a close binary companion on this process are still the object of intense study. Binary interactions strongly influence the life cycle of a massive star, giving rise to complex configurations of gas and dust surrounding these systems and creating a wide variety of supernovae, including possible gamma-ray bursts. This project measured the polarization of light emitted from 18 massive Wolf-Rayet binary star systems over their entire orbital cycle to obtain a 3-D view of the shapes, composition, and distribution of material in the colliding winds between the stars. The results are helping us investigate how binary interactions create different kinds of supernovae, as well as how these massive stellar systems influence their surroundings through their winds.</p>\n<p>Polarization in these systems occurs when light from the stars and hot, shocked material in the wind collision region interacts with ionized gas in the outer winds; measuring its behavior over time gives us clues to the specific shape, composition, and density of the winds. My students and I analyzed the observational polarization data (obtained with the RSS spectropolarimeter on the Southern African Large Telescope) and created 3-D computer models to interpret the measured polarization from the binaries in our sample.

Campers contributed to a study showing that invasive cheatgrass preferentially grows under streetlights, implying that light pollution is linked to ecosystem change.
