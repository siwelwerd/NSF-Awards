 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Clark Atlanta University seeks to improve students' mastery and use of mathematical concepts through course redesign, assessment, and implementation of evidence-based teaching strategies. Undergraduate students are involved in the project as researchers and supplemental instruction leaders.\r\n\r\nThis project has the objectives to: redesign and implement a one-semester Pre-Calculus course; implement active learning courseware in Pre-Calculus and Calculus I courses; conduct student enhancement training; institute a supplemental instruction program; and conduct faculty development. School of Education faculty participate in the project by assessing and studying which intervention or combination thereof is most effective. This new approach is designed to improve the quality of STEM education for all undergraduate STEM majors, thus increasing the minority STEM talent pool of rigorously prepared students for the workforce, graduate or professional school.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project achieved its major goal of a re-design of the first year Pre-calculus mathematics courses for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) majors.  The re-designed Precalculus course aimed to help increase the pass rate in Pre-Calculus as well as on-time STEM degree completion. The two-semester Pre-Calculus courses were re-designed as an accelerated one-semester course option for STEM majors. Along with the re-design, adaptive learning (using ALEKS), Supplemental Instruction (SI) sessions, and both student and faculty sessions in growth mindset training were implemented. The impacts of the Covid pandemic on class hours, course schedules, learning format and expectations, student engagement, faculty preparedness and efficacy, clearly interrupted the work of the project in its second year.  Although student engagement in the supports decreased in the second half of the project, the supports continued to be available and helpful to those who participated.\n\nRelated to the effectiveness of adaptive learning, across four academic years, the percentage of topics mastered by students in ALEKS correlates strongly with the grade obtained in Pre-Calculus.  The findings indicate that despite the challenges African-American students face in their pursuit of completing their STEM majors, using adaptive learning tools such as ALEKS in Pre-Calculus can alleviate and even nullify the challenges these students face in college STEM gateway courses.  Only in two of the four fall semesters analysed during the project did the use of adaptive learning result in improved pass rates for Pre-Calculus, as compared to the fall semesters when students did not use adaptive learning.  It is possible that the lower than expected pass rates for Fall 2021 are explained by the weaker mathematical foundation provided to students in high school during the emergency remote learning triggered by Covid19.  The pandemic affected not only high school preparation for college-level mathematics, but also the implementation with fidelity of two interventions that were originally planned to support students: supplemental instruction and growth mindset.\n\nThe correlation between Pre-Calculus grades and gain in topics mastered in ALEKS over the semester was higher for males than for female students, which suggests that males might benefit more from using ALEKS as far as numeric grades are concerned.
