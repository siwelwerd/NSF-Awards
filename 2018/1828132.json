 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum information science (QIS) gives rise to new, exciting paradigms for communications, sensing, and computing.  The research and development of QIS-enabled science and technologies in the U.S., however, is impeded by the limited availability of quantum resources that require specialized expertise to generate and maintain. The INterdisciplinary QUantum Information REsearch (INQUIRE) central-campus instrument removes the barrier to access quantum resources for a broad scientific and student pool at the University of Arizona (UA). The INQUIRE instrument is the world's first shared major facility as a test-bed to foster interdisciplinary research and student training in QIS, an area identified as both a national and NSF-wide priority. This new instrument enables the convergence of QIS with diverse fields. INQUIRE is an accessible, multiuser, networked platform that communicates quantum resources over a unique fiber network between campus buildings, colleges, and scientific disciplines. Quantum entangled photons arrive from INQUIRE on demand to various laboratories conducting research in photonics, quantum-communications, bioimaging and sensing, and materials science. These laboratories use entangled photons in experiments and then route the processed light back to the INQUIRE instrument for ultrasensitive measurements. In doing so, groups with no QIS expertise enjoy state-of-the-art quantum resources to greatly foster the incorporation of QIS into diverse fields and create unprecedented research and education capabilities. Diverse early-career researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students in the UA Colleges of Engineering, Science, and Optical Sciences, and visiting researchers from other regional and national institutions benefit directly from advanced research and research training with the INQUIRE instrument, and pursue QIS-enabled science and technologies to benefit the society. Teaching laboratories at UA use INQUIRE to inspire STEM students to pursue QIS education and careers, and to develop the next-generation workforce who can apply the essential concepts of QIS to benefit U.S. society. In addition, middle-school and high-school students visit the QIS teaching laboratory to participate in QIS-based experiments, and open-house events provide local community tours of INQUIRE.\r\n\r\nThe INQUIRE instrument has: 1) three high-brightness entangled-photon sources operating at telecommunication wavelengths; 2) fiber optic links over a significant fraction of the UA campus that link five different buildings and disciplines; 3) optical switching to route entangled photons to multiple users and then back to INQUIRE's single-photon detectors for ultrasensitive measurements; and 4) a robust, safe, and accessible user and administrator software interface. This central instrument delivers unique light sources to multiple scientific disciplines such as biomedical engineering and materials science, and offers a first-of-its-kind platform to explore the beginnings of quantum information processing (QIP) and sharing. Research examples include QIP with two-dimensional materials, broadband quantum-communication networks, photobleaching-free biomedical imaging, and photonic quantum computing. The unprecedented capabilities include: 1) all resources are remotely accessed without requiring prior experimental QIS background to seamlessly integrate into a variety of end users' experimental pursuits; 2) the INQUIRE resources can be simultaneously accessed by multiple users, thereby maximizing the instrument's utilization; 3) a user-friendly software interface enables end users to remotely and safely configure the entangled-photon sources and take measurements; and 4) the administrator has a software interface to maintain and monitor the state of INQUIRE. Such an infrastructure provides highly automated management of this unique multiuser resource, and ensures the long-term stability and robustness of the instrument.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

INQUIRE is first-of-the-kind infrastructure for a U.S. university to offer novel functionalities and capabilities for a variety of research endeavors such as quantum communication, quantum sensing, quantum information processing, biomedical imaging, materials discovery and characterization, and optical and photonic sciences. The INQUIRE infrastructure comprises over 120 fibers links that connect 6 buildings on the University of Arizona (UA) campus&rsquo;s many departments and laboratories, including Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), Materials Science and Engineering (MSE), Optical Sciences, Physics, the BIO5 Institute, and the Biosciences Research Laboratory. The central hub of INQUIRE residing in ECE 111 offers entanglement routing, switching, and control as well as remote access to an array of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs). Users have been using the SNSPD system in their own research project via the fiber connections. Single-photon counting data are acquired at INQUIRE&rsquo;s central hub and subsequently shared with individual users for their research and workforce training. INQUIRE has developed a highly interactive graphic user interface (GUI) to visualize the reservation, allocation, control, and management of the quantum resources. In accessing the GUI, users can reserve the quantum resources via a web-based platform, and the backend control software coordinates the allocation and recycling of quantum resources. The GUI and backend control software enable simultaneous user access to different quantum resources with minimal interference and conflicts. In addition, the INQUIRE facility offers a testing platform for solid-state quantum memories to support the initialization, manipulation, and readout of the stored quantum states. The quantum-memory testing platform bolsters programmable control of solid-state spins to precisely measure a variety of physical parameters such as the relaxation and coherence times. The quantum-memory testing platform has become an essential component of the NSF Engineering Research Center for Quantum Networks (CQN) and has underpinned a wide range of characterization and testing studies on new quantum materials and devices such as the silicon-vacancy center in diamond and silicon carbide and the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. The quantum-memory testing platform also entails a characterization module for single photons produced from solid-state defects, as a critical step toward the creation of long-range entanglement. In a foreseeable future, the INQUIRE infrastructure will play a major role in multidisciplinary research to lay the foundation of a quantum internet as well as to set the stage of distributed quantum data processing, entangled sensor networks, and entanglement-based communication. INQUIRE has also been leveraged to shift the landscape of the education and training of the next-generation QIS workforce by helping students and junior researchers gain extensive hands-on experience with quantum-light sources, quantum measurements, quantum memories, quantum channels, and the supplementary classical synchronization and processing units. INQUIRE has created an avenue for researchers from diverse backgrounds to interact and collaborate to usher in an era of a profound scientific and technological revolution sparked by QIS.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/05/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Zheshen&nbsp;Zhang</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1828132/1828132_10583257_1675632004057_INQUIRE_overview--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1828132/1828132_10583257_1675632004057_INQUIRE_overview--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"INQUIRE_overview\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1828132/1828132_10583257_1675632004057_INQUIRE_overview--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"INQUIRE_overview\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Overview on the INQUIRE infrastructure</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Zheshen Zhang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Zheshen&nbsp;Zhang</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">INQUIRE_overview</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1828132/1828132_10583257_1675632073276_SNSPD_array--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1828132/1828132_10583257_1675632073276_SNSPD_array--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SNSPD array\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1828132/1828132_10583257_1675632073276_SNSPD_array--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SNSPD array\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Shared superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) array as a principal component of INQUIRE.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Zheshen Zhang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Zheshen&nbsp;Zhang</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SNSPD array</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1828132/1828132_10583257_1675632149827_Entanglement_distribution--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1828132/1828132_10583257_1675632149827_Entanglement_distribution--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Entanglement distribution\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1828132/1828132_10583257_1675632149827_Entanglement_distribution--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Entanglement distribution\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Entanglement distribution and routing experiment carried out in INQUIRE.
