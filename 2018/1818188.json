Poor performance in gatekeeper chemistry courses adversely affect retention and graduation rates, particularly for minority students. Through data collection and analysis on key data points such as math placement data for incoming students, pass/fail rates in chemistry and math and student progression data, the project aims to develop co-requisite remediation for gatekeeper courses. The project will also implement a Faculty Learning Community to promote curriculum transformations and provide faculty with pedagogical training.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nChemistry courses are a major challenge for STEM students at Norfolk State University (NSU).  Student progression, retention and graduation rates are adversely affected by chemistry failure rates.  Preliminary data from a three-year review that was conducted by the Ad Hoc Biology-Chemistry Intervention Committee at NSU suggested that for both biology and chemistry majors? poor math skills, critical thinking skills and students? ability to interconnect biology, chemistry and mathematics concepts are the primary factors that contribute to poor performance in chemistry.  The goal of this one-year planning grant was to further investigate factors associated with high chemistry failure rates and establish a plan of action.  The specific goals of the project were 1) conduct data analysis to identify factors that contribute to high failure rates 2) establish a Faculty Learning Community (FLC) to promote curriculum transformations and provide faculty with pedagogical training 3) conduct a pilot run of the MTH 151L-B course which emphasizes integration of math and biology concepts.\n\nIt was initially thought that poor math skills were the primary obstacle for biology and chemistry majors.  The Department of Chemistry created a new course, Introduction to Chemistry, that focuses on math skills and familiarizing students with the language of chemistry.  Students take this course before taking General Chemistry.  Interestingly for biology majors there was no positive correlation between the Introduction to Chemistry course and performance in General Chemistry.  Feedback from the instructors for the Introduction to Chemistry and General Chemistry courses suggests that a greater issue is students? mindset with regard to learning.  Students have a very fixed mindset; they are not motivated and exhibit very poor study skills.  These feelings seem to stem from a belief that they are ?just not good at chemistry?.  The Department of Chemistry has added recitation sessions and peer supplemental instructors, but the issue of fixed mindset is still a major concern.   \n\nThe establishment of the FLC that included faculty from the departments of Biology, Chemistry and Mathematics improved communications between the departments and helped to facilitate curriculum transformations.  Each department was working on individual initiatives but through the FLC departments were able to work together and support curriculum transformations in each department.  The mathematics department after consulting with other STEM departments removed Elementary Algebra from the curriculum for STEM majors.  Students who do not place in College Algebra now take Essentials of Algebra which is a course that combines the concepts of Elementary Algebra and Intermediate Algebra.  This is a significant change for biology majors since based on math placement exams, many incoming biology freshmen placed in Elementary Algebra.  This is a hinderance to their progression because students must complete College Algebra and be enrolled in College Algebra and Trigonometry before they can start General Chemistry 1.  Placement in Essentials of Algebra means students who do not place in College Algebra will only have to take one remedial math course instead of two before beginning the math required for their curriculum. This change is expected to have a positive impact on student matriculation and graduation rate.    \n\nTwo factors previously identified were biology majors failing to see the relevance of mathematics and chemistry to their curriculum and poor math skills.  A new course MTH 151LB was created to address both issues.  The course is a special lab that accompanies the College Algebra lecture class.  The goals of the course are to integrate math and biology concepts emphasizing the importance of math in biology.   Biology faculty presented topics such as linear regression of respiration, population genetics, glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma clearance and preparing solutions in the lab.  The course was well received by students who indicated in a survey that the course helped them grasp math concepts better and connect them to the concepts presented in their biology courses.  Faculty reported that students were excited to learn about the biology topics and seemed less intimidated by the math when presented in this format.  The FLC is now discussing if this course should continue and become part of the curriculum for biology major or if the concepts taught in the course should be integrated into biology courses. Some faculty have expressed concerns that students are only exposed to the math-biology integration during MTH 151LB and believe it may be more beneficial to integrate the material into biology courses so that students have consistent exposure to the integration of math and biology concepts. \n\nIn summary, the results of the one-year planning grant suggest that we need to utilize strategies that promote a growth vs. fixed mindset, continue the use of recitation and peer supplemental instruction for General Chemistry courses, continue to facilitate discussions and curriculum transformations via the FLC and determine if it will be more beneficial to integrate math concepts into existing biology courses.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/28/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Malikah T Abdullah-Israel"
