 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Congo River Basin is the second largest in the world and the hydrological balance of the River is poorly defined.  Runoff from rainfall is significantly smaller than is expected and evapotranspiration is the dominant water cycle flux.  Thus, it is anticipated that upstream deforestation (for hydropower production) will have significant impact on downstream discharges.  Furthermore, migration of the rainbelts will change as the northern hemisphere warms more than the southern.  This conference will bring 18 Congolese scientists to Washington DC to interact with their North American and European counterparts. The conference topics of discussion will range from the impact of climate variability and human changes on the Congo River Basin system to sharing of data within and outside the Congo River Basin to elucidate water balance unknowns.  \r\n\r\nConference attendees will assess the current state of knowledge on the Congo Basin water balance using historic and ongoing observations, and identify where key information is lacking. They conference will focus the unknown magnitudes of hydrologic processes including rainfall, evapotranspiration, climate variability, human changes in the Basin, and power generation.  The project will enable best design of hydrologic measures for the region which will benefit both the Congo Basin Region as well as better define the impact of variable climate and water sustainability in the region. This information exchange will be used to design plans for collecting new information and for distributing historic and ongoing data. The key design for hydrologic data collection is toward specific hydrologic targets that are designed to enhance discovery and definition of the inner workings of the Congo Basin hydrologic cycle.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFour decades ago, we knew more about the hydrology of the Congo Basin than we did about the Amazon Basin.  Yet today the situation is reversed: we have an order of magnitude less published knowledge about the Congo.  We were awarded a Chapman Conference by the American Geophysical Union to overcome this lack of scientific understanding.  We were also awarded NSF funds to ensure the fullest participation by research colleagues from sub-Saharan countries.  Together, during our Chapman, we addressed the following hypotheses.  The hydraulics of the world?s second largest river are disconnected from its wetland.  The carbon flux from the waters is greater per unit area than the Amazon. Runoff from rainfall is less than expected.  Migration of the rainbelts and their precipitation amounts will change as the northern hemisphere warms more than the southern.  During our Chapman, we made initial assessments on whether or not each of these hypotheses were true or false.\n\n \n\nOur Chapman conference outcomes are significant.  (1) We overcame economic and language barriers that have separated sub-Saharan scientists from the rest of the world. The NSF funding ensured that we could all meet face-to-face, and we used that funding to leverage additional moneys from other sources (a) to ensure live English-French interpretation and (b) to fund researchers from the U.S. and around the world to also participate in the conference.  These are firsts for essentially any scientific meeting. (2) Teams of researchers, including U.S., European, and especially scientists from sub-Saharan countries, are now working together on each of the hypotheses.  They will collect new measurements and build new models to fully test the true or false nature of each hypothesis.  (3) As a direct result of our Congo Chapman Conference, funding and research agencies in several countries are now providing moneys for new research positions. (4) Congo focused peer-reviewed publications, in particular a monograph, are now being assembled.  These will be available in both English and French and will be freely available to anyone around the world.  (5) Perhaps the most important outcome from our Chapman Conference and the related NSF funding is that we are now a cohesive community with specific goals to create new research field stations in the Congo that will operate 24/7; to create airborne and river campaigns to collect new hydrologic, climate, and carbon measurements across the Congo; and to create long-lasting fellowships to bring together researchers from sub-Saharan countries and the rest of the world.\n\nThese actions will result in new scientific discoveries, guided by the hypotheses now being honed as a result of the Chapman.  The global community of researchers are most welcome to be a part of this exciting future.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/08/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Doug E Alsdorf"
