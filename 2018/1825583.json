 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation project will investigate the impact of kinship in shaping patterns of present-day human genetic diversity and explore ancestries of individuals in the African diaspora in the United States. The investigators will characterize the genomic diversity of archaeological individuals and descendant populations from the 17th century Chesapeake colonies of Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware.  This project's interdisciplinary approach combines DNA data from past and contemporary descendant populations with archeological, archival and historical information to better understand how demographic processes in the past have shaped present-day genetic variation. The investigators will work closely with historical and genealogical societies and hold outreach workshops discussing the application of genetics to inform historical, family, and personal genealogical research questions. These workshops will contribute to public science education for adult learners, enhancing scientific literacy surrounding the interpretation of genetic ancestry results.\r\n\r\nThe investigators will conduct a diachronic assay of genetic variation to assess the impact of kinship in shaping patterns of human genetic diversity in colonization contexts. They will collaborate with historical and genealogical societies to recruit 150 study participants with genealogical ties to the 17th century Chesapeake colonies and characterize mitochondrial DNA, Y-chromosome and autosomal SNP variation using the GenoChip 2.0 microarray. Complete mitochondrial and whole nuclear genome shotgun sequencing will also be conducted on 29 individuals from two archaeological sites, Patuxent Point (1650-1680, Maryland) and Avery's Rest (1680-1710, Delaware). Patterns of genetic ancestry and levels of endogamy within these sample populations will be characterized to determine geographic origins and possible kin relations. The results will provide insights into the population dynamics of the first 100 years of European colonization and the genetic legacy of colonization in the Chesapeake region, and provide ancient DNA data from 17th century European colonists and enslaved African individuals from colonial North America.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
