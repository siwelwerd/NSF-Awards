 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 9th International Crustacean Congress will be held in Washington, DC, in May 2018 and for the first time, technical sessions featuring paleontology will be a part of the meetings. Research presented at this meeting will bridge the gap between biologists studying modern organisms and those examining the fossil record. The interaction of these two groups is critical to increasing our understanding of patterns of evolution and extinction, as well as placing questions related to biodiversity in an historical context. Crustaceans are a particularly important group economically, and more fully understanding their history and their community interactions will promote refined management procedures. This award will support the participation of 10 student and avocational scientists.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to support meeting registration and subsistence costs for 10 recipients, as well as defray the costs of a field trip that will stimulate interaction between participants and likely lead to the generation of novel research questions. Announcement of the application procedure for this support will be broadcast as widely as possible through established mailing lists and websites. Applications will be judged on the nature and significance of their proposed contribution as well as need for support. A summary of the results of the meetings will be submitted broadly amongst the paleontological and biological communities. Finally, student and avocational scientists who participate in the congress will benefit from an increased network and additional professional development opportunities.",
