 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in a workshop on the mathematical programming system Macaulay2 to be held April 14-17, 2018 at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Macaulay2 is a free, open-source technical programming language for computation in research mathematics. Macaulay2 is developed through an \"app\" model: individual researchers write packages with specialized capabilities that are then made available (for free) through Macaulay2's website, for use by other researchers. These workshops provide a setting where groups of less-experienced programmers learn to develop high quality packages with the support of Macaulay2's core developers. In addition, the workshop includes professional development activities for early career mathematicians, including opportunities to speak on their own research, and panel discussions on jobs and developing a research program. More details are available at the conference website: https://juliettebruce.github.io/M2-Wisconsin-2018/ \r\n\r\nAt last count, Macaulay2 had 119 built-in packages, many of which have been developed at workshops such as this. The capabilities of Macaulay2 grow in response to research interests of the community, and this allows Macaulay2 to quickly create and distribute resources for new and emerging fields. At this workshop, the packages to be developed will include: FI-modules, Schur functors of complexes, the simplex method, random monomial ideals, and more. In addition, this meeting will be unique among Macaulay2 workshops because it will engage researchers from number theory and applied algebra, which have not been traditional foci of Macaulay2's development. This presents a unique opportunity for Macaulay2 to develop capabilities that will be useful to those communities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWe held a workshop at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, April 14-17, 2018, focused on creating new packages for Macaulay2 -- an open source computer algebra system -- by bringing together developers and users of all skill levels and experience.  The workshop had 50 participants from 20 different institutions (primarily focused on Midwestern institutions) and included a wide range of Macaulay2 users.  It included numerous experts and numerous novices and everyone in between.  It included many (42/50) early career participants (student or postdoc).  The workshop lasted for 5 days and included ample time for package development, as well as several professional development activities.\nThis event was organized by Juliette Bruce, Daniel Erman, Steven Sam, and Jay Yang.
