For these student attendees, the meeting serves as a valuable educational experience, both for the technical content of the talks and for the opportunities for networking that it provides. \r\n\r\nThe award will provide partial support to approximately seven students, partly defraying the cost of travel and lodging. Efforts will be made to support students from under-represented groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
