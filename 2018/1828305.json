 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the New York Institute of Technology (NYIT) to acquire a micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) scanner for visualizing, reconstructing, and analyzing organic and inorganic objects in three dimensions. Micro-CT utilizes X-rays to reveal the internal structure of objects at the microscopic level, without having to section them. It has fostered countless transformative projects in biology, engineering, and medicine. The acquisition will enable opportunities to engage high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, as well as the general public, in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Faculty involved in this program will mentor high school students through NYIT's Science & Technology Entry Program (STEP), which introduces economically disadvantaged and traditionally underrepresented students to STEM fields. In addition, faculty and students in Engineering will incorporate CT-based technology into the Cultivating Resources for Employment with Assistive Technology (CREATE) program to develop technologies that help people with disabilities in their work environments. To engage with the broader community, NYIT will collaborate with \"Through the Lens Initiative\", an innovative science art competition, to showcase compelling 3D visualizations of student research using micro-CT data. \r\n\r\nAccess to the micro-CT facility will stimulate groundbreaking research in biology, paleontology, nanotechnology, engineering, and life sciences and will foster a network of collaborations among local universities, ultimately strengthening the larger scientific community. Micro-CT technology has been widely adopted across archaeological, biological, and materials sciences over the past decade. Moreover, recent methodological advancements, such as contrast-enhanced CT imaging of soft tissues, promise enduring and novel applications for the future. The new micro-CT facility at NYIT will have a significant impact on the scientific community on Long Island, one of the most academically dense areas in the U.S.A with an enormous and diverse research community. Thirty-two researchers from Long Island and the New York Metropolitan Region have already submitted projects for scanning. These projects will utilize micro-CT imaging on structures that span five orders of magnitude in size (from nano-cement to dinosaur bones), 200 million years, and a wide spectrum of organic and inorganic materials. At NYIT, these studies will promote interdisciplinary collaboration across three colleges and provide outstanding research opportunities for students at all academic levels, promoting future scientific advancements within the New York Metropolitan Region and beyond.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
