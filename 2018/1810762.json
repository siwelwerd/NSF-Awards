 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through the development of highly competitive students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African-Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.  The goal of the LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity is to increase the quantity and quality of STEM graduate students from underrepresented populations, with emphasis on PhD matriculation and completion.  BD programs implemented in the nation's institutions of higher education contribute to addressing one of the objectives in NSF's 2018-2022 Strategic Plan, namely to \"foster the growth of a more capable and diverse research workforce and advance the scientific and innovation skills of the Nation.\"  The vision of this grant is to provide a national model to produce underrepresented scientists and engineers with doctoral degrees in STEM.\r\n\r\nThe performance site for this LSAMP BD activity is the University of Virginia (UVA), one of the 12 partners included in the Virginia-North Carolina Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (VA-NC LSAMP).  UVA, the lead institution for the alliance, will host the first BD program for VA-NC LSAMP; providing doctoral-level study for a cohort of 12 graduates from LSAMP undergraduate programs.  In addition to affording substantial financial support to enable students to focus full time on doctoral course work and research, the project provides an integrated set of activities designed to advance BD students toward completion of doctoral level studies.  Activities include: 1) a 3-week summer bridge enrichment program; 2) professional development opportunities; 3) training and preparation of applications for competitive graduate fellowships; and 4) extracurricular mentoring support that prepares the students to become STEM professionals.  These activities address barriers that limit the increase of students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM fields, particularly at the doctoral level.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Despite the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic that coincided with the BD fellows' time in their graduate programs, at the time of this project outcomes report, one BD fellow had defended his dissertation and earned his Ph.D. in Materials Science &amp; Engineering while three had earned a Master of Teaching - Science, a Master of Science in Materials Science &amp; Engineering, and a Master's in Biological &amp; Physical Science.</p>\n<p>The BD program at UVA has supported cohort members in earning their STEM graduate degrees through financial support for the fellows' stipends, tuition, and fees.

BD fellows also participated in PhD Plus activities, a university-wide initiative offering activities and trainings to PhD students and postdoctoral scholars to prepare them for their long-term career success (https://phdplus.virginia.edu/). Moreover, the BD management team offered writing support through small group and one-on-one consultation for assistance with papers and/or dissertations.
