 "awd_abstract_narration": "Termites have the remarkable ability to survive on a diet of wood. From one perspective, this can be a big problem, costing billions in damage repair to man-made structures and termite eradication. On the other hand, it is also an opportunity to understand how energy can be efficiently extracted from wood. Termites rely on a complex community of microorganisms in their hindgut to break down wood and provide energy for themselves. However, the identity of many of these organisms, and the specific roles they each play in wood digestion, are still unknown. This research focuses on a highly invasive and destructive subterranean species of termite, and aims to identify the community diversity of their associated microorganisms and to understand their specific roles in the wood digestion process. This can be achieved in part through genome sequencing, as each microorganism's metabolic capabilities can be predicted from its genome sequence. This information is fundamentally important for science and society as it may enable exploring alternative approaches to biological termite control as well as biofuel and biomaterial production. In addition to providing research training for students, this project also develops an interactive outreach module for K-12 students to help spark appreciation for science, technology, and engineering research.\r\n\r\nThe Coptotermes formosanus hindgut community includes large, complex eukaryotic microbes called hypermastigotes. Their genomes are unexplored but are expected to be very large, necessitating deep sequencing. The hindgut community also includes bacteria, archaea, and viruses, at highly variable abundances. To adequately sequence microbes from each of these \"domains\" of life, enrichment steps will be performed before sequencing, namely isolation of hypermastigote nuclei, isolation of viral particles, and rolling-circle amplification of lower abundance bacterial genomes. Assembled microbial genomes will be identified by 16S or 18S ribosomal RNA genes, so that carbohydrate active enzyme genes can be assigned to microbial species. Nitrogen fixing capability will also be inferred by quantitative real-time PCR of nifH genes. For the most abundant bacteria, their symbiotic status (ectosymbiont, endosymbiont, or free swimming) will be determined through fluorescent in-situ hybridization. By identifying and inferring the metabolic capabilities of each microbe in the hindgut bioreactor, this project will lay the groundwork for a deeper understanding of efficient wood digestion.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We aimed to survey the diversity of all the major players in this symbiotic system, namely the viruses, archaea, bacteria, and especially protists. We used four different sequencing methods to capture their genetic diversity, one with short read sequencing technology, one with long read sequencing technology, one that enriched for virus sequences, and one that enriched for protist sequences. We found and published new microvirus sequences. We did not find any sequences belonging to archaea, which was surprising because archaea have been reported to inhabit this termite species before. This might be because of differences in the hindgut community between <em>C. formosanus </em>in Japan, where archaea were previously reported, and Florida, where our termites were caught. Our assembled bacterial sequence data included eleven distinct lineages of spirochetes. One of these lineages, <em>Treponema</em>, formerly known as termite cluster II <em>Treponema</em>, was not previously reported from <em>C. formosanus</em>, further highlighting differences between termites from Japan vs. Florida. The other ten lineages belong to <em>Breznakiellaceae</em>, formerly termite cluster I <em>Treponema</em>. We found that one of the <em>Breznakiellaceae </em>lineages makes up the majority of bacterial cells that adhere to the protist <em>Holomastigotoides </em>in a characteristic tuft, while another lineage of <em>Breznakiellaceae </em>never adheres to <em>Holomastigotoides </em>cells. The <em>Treponema </em>lineage cells also adhere to <em>Holomastigotoides</em>, but as a minority of cells in the ectosymbiotic tuft. We also uncovered sequence data from the genus <em>Endomicrobium</em>, which are predominantly endosymbionts of termite gut protists. The <em>Endomicrobium </em>in <em>C. formosanus </em>attaches to the surface of <em>Holomastigotoides minor&nbsp;</em>cells, but among the flagella, not among the tuft of spirochetes. For the protists, we first characterized their diversity using single cell isolation techniques. We confirmed the presence of four known species, and discovered and described a fifth species, <em>Cononympha koidzumii</em>. Next, we estimated their genome sizes using Fuelgen image densitometry. Our results indicate genome sizes of 147 pg for <em>Pseudotrichonympha grassii</em>, 56 pg for <em>Holomastigotoides hartmanni</em>, 29 pg for <em>Holomastigotoides minor</em>, 12 pg for <em>Cononympha leidyi</em>, and 6 pg for <em>Cononympha koidzumii</em>. Our genomic data from these protists mostly consisted of repeat elements and did not assemble well, perhaps unsurprisingly given the very large estimated genome sizes. We mapped protist single cell transcriptome data to the genomic data in order to determine gene structure. This mapping revealed hundreds of gaps that could represent introns, but our PCR experiments revealed that none were genuine introns. Instead, we determined that the gaps were due to sequence variability among transcripts and genomic contigs, underlining the highly repetitive nature of the protist genomes.
