This work will educate young scientists in the combined issues of field measurements, high-resolution modeling, and representing high-resolution processes in regional and global models. In addition, it will collect high quality field measurements that will advance Arctic system science for years to come.\r\n  \r\nThis research will synthesize three interrelated science contributions: (1) Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) field observations will identify governing physical processes, fluxes, and linkages within the Arctic climate system. (2) Realistic-resolution (meters-scale), physically based modeling tools (e.g., MicroMet, SnowModel, EnBal, SnowPack, SnowTran-3D, SnowDunes, SnowAssim, SeaIce-3D) will quantify the behavior, interactions, and sensitivities among the Arctic system components. (3) Field observations and high-resolution modeling will be integrated to define what is missing or poorly represented in Earth System Models and guide the parameterization of the associated snow-related processes and fluxes for the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and the Los Alamos Sea Ice Model (CICE).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
