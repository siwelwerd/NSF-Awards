 "awd_abstract_narration": "Colloids consist of micron-sized particles dispersed in a fluid.  Due to the small size of the particles, their motion is affected by collisions with the fluid molecules. Colloids are found in a broad range of engineered products, such as pharmaceuticals, dairy foods, and oil slurries. Despite their ubiquity, traditional engineering approaches have not accounted for the fact that these particles possess rough surfaces. This difference in shape from a perfect, idealized, smooth sphere does not cause problems when the particle loading is low. However, when such particles are packed more closely, large disagreements between experimental data and theories are found. These deviations have hampered the engineering of processing flow conditions for suspensions containing rough particles that generate frictional interactions due to solid-solid contact. The goal of this project is to investigate the effect of colloidal surface roughness on a variety of flow phenomena. Connections between dynamics, microstructure, and properties of the suspensions will be made using a specially constructed apparatus mounted on a confocal microscope.  The results from this work will lead to design rules for industry for the use of colloid particles with rough or irregular surfaces in their products. In addition, knowledge gained from this project will be used in outreach activities that utilize social media for STEM education. A series of Reddit interactive outreach activities that present complex scientific concepts about the flow and texture of materials in an interesting and digestible way will be made available to the general public. The goal is to capture the imagination of the nation's younger generation and to guide them towards the wonders and discoveries present in today's science and engineering careers.\r\n\r\nThis award aims to understand the microscopic dynamics of model polymeric colloids with well-controlled surface anisotropy. The central hypothesis is that the translational and rotational diffusion of colloids with various surface features becomes independently decoupled at high particle loadings. The decoupling of dynamics leads to significant departures in the linear and nonlinear rheology from current theoretical predictions. This work will generate new physical understanding of how particle diffusivity affects the linear and nonlinear rheology of concentrated suspensions. In this regime, fluid suspensions become increasingly glassy in their mechanical properties. The fundamental rationale behind these phenomena is still not well understood, particularly when particles make solid-solid contacts with one another. This work will investigate the microscopic mechanisms by imaging smooth and rough colloids flowing within a fast confocal rheometer setup designed to concurrently capture rotational dynamics during shear flow. Brownian Dynamics simulations with short-range hydrodynamic interactions will be incorporated to support experimental observations of dynamics and connections to glassy rheology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In particular, this project focuses on rough surfaces and how it changes their diffusion and rheology properties. Results showed that the roughness hinders the rotational dynamics of these rough colloids, especially if their roughness length scale is greater than 10% of the particle size. This rotational slow down is correlated with the linear elasticity of the material, meaning that when a concentrated suspension of rough particles is gently perturbed, it will flow much more slowly and act like a solid material as opposed to smooth particles. Rheological studies further showed that at a microscopic level, the rough particles interact with one another through enhanced hydrodynamic effects, which locks them into small \"cages\" that relax very slowly over time (Fig. 1). These effects explain why the elastic modulus of suspensions of rough colloids is three orders of magnitude higher than that of smooth colloids. The results were published in a 2022 article in the Journal of Rheology and included an undergraduate student as a co-author.</p>\n<p>Another successful outcome of this project is in the shear thickening of rough colloids. This flow phenomenon is different from linear elasticity in that when very large stresses and rates are applied to the material, the viscosity increases by orders of magnitude. This is best embodied in the popular science activity where people are able to run across a pool of cornstarch at high speeds but sink when they slow down. Experimental work performed on a confocal rheometer in the PI's lab showed that the elevated shear stress cause particles to form connected networks that support large viscosities, and that rough colloids are especially effective because of their interparticle friction (Fig. 2). The sensitivity analysis method used to define \"contact\" between two rough particles in a confocal microscopy image was published in a 2021 Soft Matter paper. In collaboration with a simulation group, the PI's team generated a correlation between shear thickening power and distance from jamming, a material prameter that indicates how far the material is from a solid. This correlation is widely useable by industry partners and technologists without the need of a microscope, thus surpassing the original goals laid out in the proposal. The results were published in a 2021 article in Physical Review Letters.</p>\n<p>An ongoing study supported by this project is the investigation of creeping flow, where suspensions are subjected to a small but finite stress over long periods of time. This study is especially relevant to the manufacturing and longevity of polymer coatings that contain particles, with gravitational forces imposing this type of small but ever-present stress on the material. Preliminary work showed that suspensions of rough colloids exhibit 4-5 times higher strain deformation compared to the smooth colloids at all applied stresses during creep (Fig. 3), which is surprising given their enhanced linear and nonlinear shear properties in the previous studies supported by this project. Unlike suspensions of smooth colloids, suspensions of rough colloids also showed a non-monotonic trend during recovery, with peak recoverable strains observed just below the yield stress followed by a steep decline with increasing stresses. Such a response is speculated to be due to the collective tumbling of clusters formed by rough particles. The work is being written up and will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal. All results generated in this project has been disseminated by PI and students at &gt;20 conferences, workshops, and invited seminars.
