 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program funds innovative research, approaches, and resources for use in a variety of settings. This Research in Service to Practice project will study how visual immersion and interactivity in augmented reality (AR) affects visitors' engagement and understanding of science. The research involves creating different versions of an AR exhibit to communicate paleontology research from the La Brea Tar Pits to the general public. Different versions of the exhibit will be compared to learn how design choices for immersion and interactivity impact visitors' engagement and understanding of science. The result of this study should be a model to follow for similar public exhibits, as well as design principles that generalize to AR experiences for a broader range of informal learning environments. This project will also demonstrate and report on specific AR mechanisms that help visitors understand the scientific process and increase knowledge about paleontology research. \r\n\r\nThe study includes a user-centered design and evaluation process with both formative and comparative studies. This project investigates two high-level design factors for mobile AR: visual immersion and interactivity. These impact the learning experience and the development so extensively that multiple versions are seldom compared. These factors also have unique considerations for informal settings, such as how to balance immersion against situational awareness (e.g., 3D viewers reduce field of view). One goal of this project is to systematically compare qualitatively different AR designs that convey equivalent science content and study these tradeoffs empirically. The second goal is to leverage these findings to publicly release an AR experience that promotes engagement, increases understanding of science, and reduces scientific misconceptions. This research will also contribute to understanding usability and logistical issues for different AR designs for public, outdoor, informal settings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

To accomplish this, two \"Tar AR\" experiences were developed and studied:</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>1) Pit 91 Experience: A tabletop AR experience was developed and tested at Pit 91, based on fossils found at La Brea and Pit 91 specifically. This portable AR interaction has learners \"dig\" up fossils and use them to reconstruct a simulated environment based on fossil evidence. Each fossil cycle supported structured hypothesis testing, where they revise their hypotheses about the climate at La Brea during the Ice Age.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>2) Field Experience: A life-sized AR experience was developed (animals and plants \"to scale\") and tested outdoors at a large field in the park that is part of La Brea Tar Pits.

The research involves creating different versions of an AR exhibit to communicate paleontology research from the La Brea Tar Pits to the general public. Each experience used an iterative, design-based research beginning with paper prototypes, usability testing and usability studies, and a randomized comparison study with 5 conditions: AR Headset with High Interactivity, AR Headset with Lower Interactivity; Phone-Based AR with High Interactivity Phone-Based AR with Lower Interactivity; and an excellent-quality poster that was content-equivalent (Control).</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Key Results</em><span>. All conditions showed strong engagement and highly significant learning, with nearly all major content areas well-understood. AR conditions also showed benefits in the Field Experience for length and content of visitor's verbal explanations of scientific content and processes vs. the Control, but showed similar knowledge on multiple choice knowledge items. Across both the Pit 91 and Field Experience, handheld AR using smartphones produced comparable or better learning outcomes than low-cost Headsets which embed phones. Analysis of self-reported emotions showed potential advantages for Headset AR, such as higher Interest and positive sense of Surprise. However, this must be balanced against findings where Headsets also increased negative emotions such as Frustration.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Implications on AR Design</em><span>. The results of this work indicate that when designing AR experiences: a) both small-scale and life-sized AR can produce strongly significant learning gains and reduce misconceptions using only smartphone hardware; b) phone-based AR (without headsets) offers comparable outcomes, with fewer logistical hurdles; and c) AR headsets may produce greater affective engagement, particularly in larger-scale/immersive&nbsp; environments such as outdoor settings, but may have tradeoffs with negative emotions that may affect certain populations or contexts (e.g., unfamiliarity or discomfort with headsets, heat/humidity effects). The evaluation team has also released a review of 72 AR and VR projects in museums, with further insights on where AR has been most effective in general (e.g., outdoor, inaccessible, historical sites; evoking interest and emotional responses).</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Scientifically Grounded Paleoart</em><span>. As a broader impact for the process of science, this work rigorously documented and published the process for developing the 3D paleoart (virtual plants and animals from the Ice Age). This is an important contribution that should be followed for paleoart more generally, because artistic depictions are often a primary way that the general public learns about prehistoric animals and scenes. By documenting and referencing what scientific sources influenced paleoart, that art can be more easily updated or replaced to reflect new discoveries and communicate our best current understanding from scientific findings.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>AR Filters</em><span>. In addition to the full experiences, we released AR filters allowing a phone to overlay an animal for limited interactions and \"selfies.\" These allow users to view and interact with the 13 extinct species of Pleistocene animals on any smartphone, at any time. Filters were created and shared for multiple platforms: Snapchat, Instagram/Facebook, and using app-less AR from Sketchfab.&nbsp; In the year that they have been active they have been implemented in events at La Brea Tar Pits and LA County Natural History Museum, outreach events both museums have participated in, site tours at the Tar Pits, and in classrooms. The filters are accessible through LBTP and NHM social media and both websites. Signs on-site at La Brea Tar Pits also provide the AR filters with fun facts about each of these animals in Hancock Park for visitor use. These filters have been accessed over 500,000 times in approximately 1 year since their release.</span></p>\n<p><em>NTSA Short Film</em><span>. A documentary-style video communicating how this project used AR for science learning was created and shared at the 2023 National Science Teacher Association conference (NSTA), which presents how AR was leveraged as a pedagogical tool.
