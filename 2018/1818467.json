 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on design of efficient and robust numerical methods to solve partial differential equations with unbounded singularities, with potential applications in astrophysics, biology, combustion, electrical engineering, and oil recovery. The numerical techniques under development can be extended to systems with multi-species fluid mixtures such as gaseous detonation and reacting flows. The project includes training of graduate students through involvement in the research. Research results will be integrated into new courses on numerical analysis and multidisciplinary computation.\r\n\r\nThe focus of this project is the study of high-order numerical methods for solving convection-diffusion equations with unbounded singularities. It contains two parts. The first part is to study the error behaviors of the numerical schemes and ensure the boundedness of numerical approximations before blow-up occurs (where the exact solutions are sufficiently smooth). The second part is to use high-order numerical methods to solve convection-diffusion equations involving delta-singularities and other blow-up solutions. Special bound-preserving techniques will be constructed to ensure that the numerical approximations are physically relevant. The strategies in this work do not depend on the maximum principle, and they ensure L1-stability of the numerical schemes. For problems with blow-up solutions, the blow-up criteria, blow-up locations, blow-up time, and blow-up rates will be studied. The project aims to develop a general approach to numerically approximate exact blow-up times and to elucidate the relationship between blow-up time and significant system parameters.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The detailed information is as follows:<br /><br />1. The PI constructed special discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for the chemotaxis model, pressureless equations and obtained energy stability and optimal error estimates before the blow-up appeared. Moreover, the PI developed a special algorithm to define numerical blow-up time and theoretically proved its convergence to the exact one.

The PI applied the $\\delta$-function to the permeability tensor in the Darcy law and constructed the Reinterpreted discrete fracture model (RDFM) for single-phase flow in fractured porous media. In addition, the PI developed high-order bound-preserving techniques in petroleum engineering. Several models were discussed, such as the miscible displacements in porous media and wormhole propagations. Such problems can be mathematically modeled as a coupled system involving a pressure equation and the concentration equation. Most cases, the pressure equation may contain extremely large diffusion coefficients, leading to significantly limited time step sizes and substantially large computational cost. To solve this problem, some implicit pressure explicit concentration (IMPEC) methods were discussed for general Darcy and non-Darcy flows. The stability and error estimates were discussed for wormhole propagation.<br /><br />3. The PI introduced the local DG (LDG) method on overlapping meshes. The method solves the primitive and auxiliary variables for convection-diffusion equations on different meshes. Hence, the numerical approximations at the interfaces of the other meshes are continuous. As a result, the method is flux-free for most of the convection-diffusion equations. The LDG methods on overlapping meshes work perfect for the chemotaxis model and the miscible displacements in porous media as the convection coefficient contains the unknown variable, and the well-developed upwind flux cannot be applied in the traditional LDG method. Such difficulty does not exist if the mesh is overlapping.The PI proved the stability and suboptimal error estimates of LDG methods on overlapping meshes. Moreover, the third-order maximum-principle-preserving technique for convection-diffusion equations were developed.<br /><br />4. The PI constructed conservative modified exponential Runge-Kutta (CMERK) methods for multispecies and multireaction detonations. The scheme is third-order accurate, pi/4-stable and satisfies the decay property. The scheme is steady-state preserving and is also conservative, namely keeping the summation of the mass fractions to be one during the time evolution. The PI successfully extended the bound-preserving technique to multispecies and multireaction detonations based on the CMERK time integration method and applied the idea to Allen-Cahn equations. Moreover, the PI modified the CMERK method for shallow water equations with stiff fraction terms and the pattern formation dynamical model in polymerizing actin flocks where the conservative property is not necessary. In these two models, the PI used different parameters introduced in CMERK in different equations and proved optimal convergence rate.
