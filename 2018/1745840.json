 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the rapid, cost-effective detection of natural gas leakage to improve public safety, mitigate global climate change, and decrease product loss.  Natural gas is the largest provider of power in the United States.  However, more than 80 Tg of leakage occurs at well pads and pipelines during production alone.  Such leakage poses a public health risk, with 1300 significant incidents reported from 1997 ? 2016, resulting in 50 fatalities, 180 injuries, and $2B in costs. Additionally, methane is a greenhouse gas with a warming potential that is 84 times higher than CO2.  In 2015, natural gas leakage accounted for 198 million tons of CO2 equivalents, corresponding to a carbon tax value of more than $2B.  Finally, energy companies want to reduce leakage to avoid product loss, with 80 Tg of methane having a value of $12B.  This project will directly impact the aforementioned areas by improving the efficiencies and costs associated with natural gas leak detection.  With over 2.2 million miles of local utility gas distribution pipelines 1.2 million well pads in the U.S. alone, the commercial prospects for an improved natural gas leak detection system are very promising with expected revenues exceeding $70M.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will involve the development of a comprehensive natural gas leakage detection solution that integrates compact, low-cost sensors with state-of-the-art analytics.  The solution, which can be used in drone-based and handheld monitoring, will enable energy providers to detect natural gas leakage from well pads and pipelines.  In Phase I, technical feasibility will be demonstrated by the development of a lightweight gas sensor based on incoherent, cavity-enhanced spectrometry and a natural gas camera based on filtered infrared imaging. These sensors will be integrated with global positioning system, wind speed/direction, and data analytics platform.  The Phase I solution will be laboratory tested to characterize its analytical performance, before undergoing field testing on controlled natural gas leaks.  In Phase II, the sensor hardware, electronics, and firmware will be refined to meet the stringent size, weight, power, and environmental constraints of drone-based and handheld deployment.  Likewise, the analytics platform will be refined to incorporate the STTR sensors, interpret the infrared camera data, and provide comprehensive leak detection reports.  The Phase II prototypes will be field tested under real-world conditions with a variety of potential customers for both well pad monitoring and pipeline distribution system monitoring.",

After selecting an optimal measurement strategy, Nikira Labs developed two low-cost natural gas sensors capable of measuring ambient methane levels with precisions of better than &plusmn;20 ppb in 1 second.  Both analyzers provide highly linear response (R2 &gt; 0.99), allowing for accurate methane measurements. \n\nThe instruments were first deployed as part of a 2-node mobile sensor network on both vehicles-of-convenience and survey vehicles.  The resulting data was analyzed by the CSU data analytics package to identify and verify several small natural gas leaks throughout the city. \n\nOne of the analyzers was then used for handheld monitoring in both residential and landfill settings.  The latter showed localized leaks in the landfill caps.\n\nContingent on continued support, Nikira Labs anticipates selling a commercial product shortly.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/23/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Manish Gupta"
