 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will investigate the pathways by which early adversity affects outcomes later in life. Investigators will examine whether and how negative consequences of early adversity may be transmitted across generations. The project will enhance basic understanding of the epigenetic processes by which early adversity generates negative developmental consequences, and it will expand knowledge about the potential for such epigenetic changes to be transmitted interegenerationally.  The ultimate goal, and broader impact, is to shed new light on underlying mechanisms of transmission, in order to inspire new policy approaches aimed at reducing, and potentially reversing, long-term deleterious effects of early life adversity.\r\n\r\nExposure to environmental factors can get under one's skin and alter how one's genes function. There is growing interest in how changes in gene functionality may account for the association between early adversity and later outcomes. Moreover, little is known about whether those changes in functionality can be reversed or whether they can be transmitted across generations. Using pre-existing data on health and behavioral outcomes as well as pre-existing biological/genetic samples obtained from multiple generations of differentially reared macaques, investigators will explore mechanisms and developmental processes involved in linking early adversity to subsequent outcomes later in life. The goals are to examine the developmental consequences of early adversity and underlying epigenetic mechanisms; and to test the intergenerational transmission of adversity. Because macaques share 93% of their genome with humans, the study will help clarify how early life adversity affects later outcomes in humans. The methylation profile of DNA will be analyzed, and RNA will be extracted in order to examine gene expression. Investigators will conduct bioinformatics analyses to assess biological characteristics of differentially expressed gene sets.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This was done using Rhesus macaques raised in natural mother-infant dyads (i.e., mother-rearing or MR), to those hand-reared in a nursery by human caregivers with differing amounts of peer-contact (early life adversity groups: peer-reared PR or surrogate-peer-reared SPR). Samples were taken across the lifecourse of these infants, allowing for a longitudinal study design and to better understand at a more granular level the development and possible persistence of, if any, adverse effects of early life adversity. The aim is to better understand the effect of rearing conditions on later life inflammation and aging outcomes between the mother-reared and early life adversity groups.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Both whole blood and white blood cell samples were taken from the infant group at various time points to allow for a longitudinal study design. These samples were then run on Illumina MethylationEPIC arrays, Mammalian methylation arrays, and NanoString Non-human Primate (NHP) Immunology panels to measure both DNA methylation and the expression of genes related to immune pathways. In total, 472 samples were run on the EPIC arrays (Figure 1), 111 on the Mammalian array (Figure 2), and 358 on the NanoString NHP Immunology panels (Figure 3). Most samples with EPIC data have corresponding NanoString data and were selected from the white blood cell samples to optimize longitudinal study of the same set of individuals, whereas the mammalian array included the samples from older animals run on EPIC, as well as additional samples selected from whole blood drawn from older animals, to maximize the number of individuals included in the aging study. In total, there are 42 individuals with samples represented on all three platforms, 69 on the NanoString and EPIC, and 8 on the mammalian array and EPIC, with 1 sample being represented only on the EPIC, 59 only on the mammalian array, and none uniquely represented on the NanoString platform (Figure 4).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This data from the three platforms will then be integrated and analyzed to assess the impact of rearing conditions on the later life health outcomes and inflammation signatures of the individuals. The genome-wide methylation data from the EPIC arrays will be used for epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) to uncover the genetic pathways associated with early life adversity. The mammalian methylation array data will be used to measure the epigenetic age of adult individuals, with the resulting epigenetic age acceleration values correlated to rearing conditions, to investigate whether early life adversity impacts aging. Additionally, the gene expression data that was measured in the same individuals with DNA methylation data will be used to test the hypothesis that changes in DNA methylation correlates with changes in gene expression, and to determine whether this mediates phenotypic differences. Overall, it is the goal of these analyses to probe the effect of early life adversity and the epigenetic mechanisms by which it might lead to increased inflammation or accelerated aging throughout the life course.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/22/2024<br>\nModified by: James&nbsp;Heckman</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1749548/1749548_10571183_1731971949722_NSF_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1749548/1749548_10571183_1731971949722_NSF_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 2 Mammalian Array for White Blood Cells and Whole Blood\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1749548/1749548_10571183_1731971949722_NSF_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 2 Mammalian Array for White Blood Cells and Whole Blood\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">111 white blood cell and whole blood NHP samples were run on Mammalian Methylation arrays.
