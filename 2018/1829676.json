ICSE is the flagship conference in the field. The grant will provide travel and registration support for students, researchers and early-career faculty to participate in three programs at the 2018 International Conference on Software Engineering?the Student Volunteers Program, the Doctoral Symposium, and the New Faculty Symposium.\r\n\r\nThe award will make possible the technical exchange of information and research collaborations, as well as advances in the field made possible by these interactions. The funded activity promotes education, training and mentoring of the participants. The international nature of this conference helps develop a globally-aware workforce of research and educators within the US and helps build the community of researchers in the field of Software Engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
