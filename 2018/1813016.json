 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding how galaxies and black holes grow out of and impact the larger cosmic environment is the underlying goal of much of extragalactic astronomy. The aim of this proposed project is to use giant gaseous nebulae as a window into the galaxy formation process, building an efficient method for finding these systems and then studying both the forming galaxy properties and the physical conditions in the surrounding intergalactic gas. In doing so, the program will leverage both the power of the Big Data era as well as the latest astronomical instruments to provide a synthesized view of galaxy formation and black hole growth in action during the first few billion years of cosmic time. The project will provide research experiences for two undergraduates per year at a Hispanic serving institution. It will also develop training packages that will help inspire underrepresented students to realize their potential in the sciences. These packages will be used in the classroom as well as in public outreach. The EPSCoR program is helping to fund this project.\r\n\r\nThe project will use existing and future big data sets of broad band imaging to identify giant Ly-alpha emitting clouds that are associated with galaxy forming regions. Using existing high-resolution images and catalogs, the project will then take a census of the galaxy population around these clouds. The team will apply for telescope time to obtain spatially resolved spectroscopy of the clouds to map out the kinematics and physical conditions within the diffuse gas clouds. The project will support graduate students and undergraduate students from a Hispanic serving institution. It will also develop \"growth mindset training packages\" for use in introductory astronomy courses (impacting over 500 students over three years) and in public observing events (reaching over 3000 people over three years). The project is being co-funded by the EPSCoR program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
