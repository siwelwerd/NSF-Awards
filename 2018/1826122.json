 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cement-based materials are known for their load-bearing capacity and ability to be shaped into large complex forms, while ensuring cost-effectiveness. However, concrete is a poor thermal insulator. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, energy loss through inefficient building envelopes inflicts excessive financial burden on homeowners. In this research, heat transport will be studied in a novel lightweight concrete that possesses superior intrinsic thermal resistance. If successful, the results will benefit our society with a new multifunctional building material that can lower heating and cooling energy consumption, while maintaining structural performance, with a collateral benefit that it is lightweight. The acquired knowledge can be utilized by industry and academia in development of highly needed energy efficient and resilient building envelopes. Furthermore, this new material can bolster our national energy security, as well as offering positive socioeconomic and environmental impacts.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be offered unique multidisciplinary learning experiences across fields of heat transport, atomistic simulation, materials synthesis and characterization. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to nanoengineer high efficiency scattering mechanisms into the molecular structure of calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) using short-chain organosilanes molecules to achieve a novel lightweight concrete with high thermal resistance and load bearing capacity. This research combines materials synthesis and characterization methods with atomistic simulations to study fundamentals of heat transport and cohesion in C-S-H crosslinked with size-specific organometallic molecules. Molecular simulations will be performed at University of California, Irvine, to scientifically-inform the experimental synthesis efforts carried out by researchers at the University of Houston. Multi-scale methods of materials characterization will be applied to assess thermo-mechanical properties of novel lightweight cement composites incorporating C-S-H organo nano-laminates and micro-cenospheres.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Through this award, scientists at the University of California, Irvine and University of Houston developed a new class of materials, called organically cross-linked Calcium Silicate Hydrates, that have lower thermal conductivity than those reported and measured for the calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H), the glue of cement that binds aggergates in copncrete. The scientists performed synthesis and characterization experiments and coupled those with molecular modeling and micromechanics theory to understand the physics behind the reduction of thermal conductivity in this new class of materials. The findings indicate that the population of heat carriers (propagating, diffusing, and localized modes) changes fundamentally bewteen organically cross-linked and conventional C-S-H and such redistribution of heat carriers can explain the experimentally measured increase in heat resistivity. A graduate student dedicated his PhD research on this topic and successfully defended his PhD on the subject.
