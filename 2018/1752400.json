 "awd_abstract_narration": "Additive manufacturing (AM), often referred to as 3D printing, is an exciting technology that can offer more flexibility and efficiency in the production of complex metal parts compared to conventional manufacturing. However, the path to AM as a viable and safe alternative in applications where structural components must carry loads (in some cases, where components must sustain repetitive loading over long periods of time) is at a critical junction. The widespread incorporation of this transformative manufacturing technology is hampered by the fact that it is currently not possible to predict when and why an additively manufactured metal component might fail, and to design the component accordingly to mitigate risk of failure. This presents a major problem for many industries that are looking to use AM to produce metal load-bearing components. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award supports fundamental research to address this pressing need and to enable the expanded, yet safe, use of metal AM in many industries, including aerospace, automotive, biomedical, manufacturing, and national defense. The research is closely integrated with a unique outreach program that will engage students across different age levels and backgrounds, including middle-school students from rural locations in Utah.\r\n\r\nThe research supported by this CAREER award is a fundamental step toward expanding the use of AM to fatigue-critical applications through the discovery of 3D, microstructure-sensitive, fatigue-crack driving mechanisms in additively manufactured aluminum. Two parallel research thrusts will be carried out. One thrust will focus on experimentally characterizing the microstructural features in 3D neighborhoods of fatigue cracks observed in aluminum specimens produced by laser powder bed fusion. The second thrust will focus on numerically characterizing the local micromechanical fields that evolve in 3D as a function of underlying, manufacturing-induced microstructure and defect distribution, with particular focus on residual-stress incompatibility, porosity, and surface roughness. Data-driven approaches will be leveraged across the experimental and numerical data sets to provide new insights into the mechanisms responsible for fatigue failure among the specimens. While the research focuses on aluminum alloys, it is anticipated that the findings regarding the relative importance of geometrical defects, like pores and surface roughness, versus intrinsic material defects on fatigue failure of additively manufactured parts could be broadly applicable to other metals as well.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Two processing-parameter metrics were observed to dominate high-cycle fatigue life: build orientation and laser-energy density. Build orientation affected surface roughness which, in turn, affected fatigue life. The decrease in fatigue life observed for specific build orientations exhibiting high surface roughness was associated with an increased number of surface-crack initiation sites. For a fixed build orientation, an optimal laser-energy density value was identified to maximize fatigue life. Outside of this optimal range, lower fatigue life was associated with increased presence of sub-surface defects, including lack-of-fusion pores at low laser-energy densities and secondary cracking and pores (possibly related to keyholing) at high laser-energy densities. Consequently, guidelines were offered to improve fatigue life of additively manufactured alloys in the as-built, non-heat-treated condition.</p>\r\n<p><em>New Models of Microstructure-Sensitive Fatigue Crack Growth</em></p>\r\n<p><span>New computational tools were developed for predicting microstructure-sensitive fatigue cracking in polycrystalline materials (including AM metals). The tools are broadly categorized as ``physics-based'' and ``data-driven''. The physics-based simulation framework, which was extended as part of this CAREER project to predict 3D crack propagation in polycrystals containing defects, was applied to study the fatigue-crack driving mechanisms in various alloys. Specifically, crack growth was simulated and studied in a Mg alloy that was experimentally characterized using synchrotron-based measurements, and in an aluminum alloy that was synthetically generated for the purpose of acquiring statistically significant ``virtual observations''. From the latter set of simulations, new insights were generated regarding the crystallographic nature of fatigue crack growth at microstructure scale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>The data-driven tools that were developed included an interleaved physics-based deep learning (PBDL) framework, in which the deep-learning component of the framework consisted of a bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network that was shown to outperform other candidate machine learning models in the task of accurately predicting microstructurally small fatigue crack growth. The Bi-LSTM network was later integrated into a new interleaved PBDL approach as a way to mitigate&nbsp;error and uncertainty accumulation that can occur when using a succession of deep-learning-only predictions.</span></p>\r\n<p><em>A New Analytical Model to Characterize the Influence of Void Defects</em></p>\r\n<p>Based on our virtual observations of failure in samples containing void defects, we derived an analytical function called the Void Descriptor Function (VDF). The VDF is a scalar-valued function that describes the relative severity of a given location in a sample based on network-wide attributes of voids in the sample, including void size, aspect ratio, orientation, and clustering. The VDF has been shown to uniquely characterize void networks and to correlate strongly with locations of failure initiation in metals containing void defects (viz., AM metals).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p>\r\n<p><span>From a technical standpoint, many of the scientific findings and models developed under this CAREER grant are applicable across a broad range of AM metals, not just aluminum. For example, the established VDF model was shown to strongly correlate with failure initiation locations for a variety of AM metals. Additionally, the deep-learning architecture that was initially developed to link micromechanical and microstructural parameters to local fatigue crack growth in an aluminum alloy can generally be applied (with additional training data) to other alloys. From an educational and outreach standpoint, this grant supported the development of instructional materials for a graduate level course in Fatigue and Fracture at the University of Utah. Of note, 20 graduate students enrolled in that course in 2017 participated as a class in the Third Sandia Fracture Challenge, marking the first classroom participation in any Sandia Fracture Challenge. The students' involvement in the international modeling challenge culminated in a publication in the&nbsp;<em><span>International Journal of Fracture</span></em>, on which all 20 students contributed as co-authors. The experience was transformative for many of the graduate student participants and served as a model for subsequent Sandia modeling challenges. From a workforce development standpoint, this CAREER grant has supported four undergraduate and seven graduate student researchers who have had a broad range of opportunities, including conducting experiments at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), carrying out supplementary internships at national laboratories, presenting research at international conferences, and publishing their works in impactful journals. The grant has also supported the PI in efforts to acquire the first LPBF machine at the University of Utah and to participate in the development of a new high-throughput high-energy X-ray diffraction microscopy beamline at the APS (with funding leveraged from NSF MRI #1726375); these infrastructure developments will continue to have impacts within the broader scientific community long after completion of this CAREER award.</span></p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/13/2025<br>\nModified by: Ashley&nbsp;Spear</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1752400/1752400_10532714_1736379668306_3DMgReconstruction--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1752400/1752400_10532714_1736379668306_3DMgReconstruction--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"HEDM reconstruction near fatigue surface\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1752400/1752400_10532714_1736379668306_3DMgReconstruction--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"HEDM reconstruction near fatigue surface\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">3D reconstruction of high-energy x-ray diffraction microscopy measurements collected near a fatigue failure surface in a Mg alloy.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Brian Phung</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ashley&nbsp;Spear\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">HEDM reconstruction near fatigue surface</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1752400/1752400_10532714_1736380837513_SFC_IJF_article_2019--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1752400/1752400_10532714_1736380837513_SFC_IJF_article_2019--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Outreach: Sandia Fracture Challenge\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1752400/1752400_10532714_1736380837513_SFC_IJF_article_2019--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Outreach: Sandia Fracture Challenge\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A notable outreach effort included a classroom participation in the Third Sandia Fracture Challenge, which culminated in a published journal article featuring all 20 graduate students as co-authors. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10704-019-00366-w</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">International Journal of Fracture (2019) 218:171-194</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ashley&nbsp;Spear\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Outreach: Sandia Fracture Challenge</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1752400/1752400_10532714_1736379530118_AI49_cs_comparison--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1752400/1752400_10532714_1736379530118_AI49_cs_comparison--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Deep Learning Predictions of Crack Growth\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1752400/1752400_10532714_1736379530118_AI49_cs_comparison--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Deep Learning Predictions of Crack Growth\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Predictions of microstructurally small fatigue crack growth in an aluminum alloy: a,c) physics-based simulations, b,d) deep learning predictions.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Vignesh Babu Rao</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ashley&nbsp;Spear\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Deep Learning Predictions of Crack Growth</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1752400/1752400_10532714_1736659342899_figure5--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1752400/1752400_10532714_1736659342899_figure5--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Experimental Fatigue Life Results\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1752400/1752400_10532714_1736659342899_figure5--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Experimental Fatigue Life Results\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Experimental results of total fatigue life plotted as a function of laser energy density for different build orientations.
