 "awd_abstract_narration": "The magnetic field that threads through the gas and dust in the Milky Way Galaxy has been mapped by the awardees using their own instrument, Mimir. Mimir was built over a decade ago with support from NSF, NASA, and the W.M. Keck Foundation. Mimir measures the polarization of infrared light produced by the dust in the Milky Way. Most of the dust (and gas) is found in large clouds that drift through space. These clouds collapse under their own weight to form new stars. Careful analysis of the polarized light from these dusty clouds teaches us about the magnetic fields that control the shapes and sizes of each cloud. The magnetic fields also affect the way the clouds collapse to make stars. Much of the data has already been collected. The awardees now need funding to support the careful examination of the data. The data will be used, together with observations from other telescopes such as the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) and NSF's Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), to test models of Milky Way clouds and star formation. Students from Boston University will be trained on how to take the Mimir data and examine the polarimetry results. A graduate student will use Mimir, SOFIA and ALMA data to complete their PhD project. Undergraduate students (including many who are not majoring in astronomy) will be brought to Arizona to operate Mimir on the Perkins telescope. These telescope trips often inspire students to follow careers in science. Other students will participate in the observing by videoconference. The team will also pursue outreach opportunities at the Boston Museum of Science, where the Department of Astronomy at Boston University holds weekly open nights.  \r\n\r\nMimir is being used by the awardees to survey the magnetic field structure along the galactic plane and in various star forming regions via background starlight polarization measurements in the near-infrared H-band. Their survey, dubbed the Galactic Plane Infrared Polarization Survey (GPIPS), covers 76 square degrees of the inner disk and probes up to 20 magnitudes of extinction. Complementary mid-IR polarization measurements are used to probe star forming clouds up to 50 magnitudes of extinction.  Various well-known techniques (Zeeman splitting, the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, etc.) will be used on these and complementary archival data to infer field strengths and orientations across the surveyed areas.  Analysis of these data will provide quantitative tests of models of galactic B-fields and constrain theories of star formation in dense molecular clouds.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Using the Mimir multi-function near-infrared imaging polarimeter instrument on the 1.83m Perkins telescope in northern Arizona, the Galactic Plane Infrared Polarization Survey (GPIPS) was conducted and the data were analyzed and interpreted. Two key findings were that the magnetic field in the galactic disk is tilted with respect to the plane and is much more complex than seen in previous, lower angular resolution, studies and surveys. The full GPIPS data sets have been published and made available to the public and researchers. A second thread for this project was to examine the magnetic fields in the dense, but not densest, parts of dusty clouds of interstellar gas that will go on to form stars. Samples of both low-mass clouds and higher mass, actively star-forming, clouds were developed and the sky fields containing the clouds were observed for near-infrared polarization using Mimir and the Perkins. Interestingly, we see some of the magnetic fields located in the envelopes of the clouds exhibit signs of being impacted by the relative motion of the clouds and their much less dense interstellar surroundings. Yet, for the lower mass clouds, their internal magnetic field orientations are not very different from the similar orientations of the magnetic fields in the cloud envelopes and even out into the general interstellar medium between the clouds. For the higher mass clouds, though, the internal magnetic fields are often very complex and bear little resemblance to the magnetic fields in the cloud peripheries. Analysis of the data obtained under this project will continue for some time as we seek to understand the role the magnetic field plays in cloud formation, cloud evolution, and the formation of stars and planets within the clouds.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/18/2023<br>\nModified by: Dan&nbsp;P&nbsp;Clemens</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1814531/1814531_10580104_1702937137713_3.GPIPS_Zoom--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1814531/1814531_10580104_1702937137713_3.GPIPS_Zoom--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"GPIPS Zoom\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1814531/1814531_10580104_1702937137713_3.GPIPS_Zoom--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"GPIPS Zoom\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Zoom of GPIPS, from a single field (A) including a zoom of a portion of that field (B) to where that field fits relative to its nearest neighbors in galactic coordinates (C) and finally to the full GPIPS survey zone (D).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dan Clemens</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Dan&nbsp;P&nbsp;Clemens\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">GPIPS Zoom</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1814531/1814531_10580104_1702936835438_1.Mimir--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1814531/1814531_10580104_1702936835438_1.Mimir--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Mimir Instrument on Perkins Telescope\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1814531/1814531_10580104_1702936835438_1.Mimir--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Mimir Instrument on Perkins Telescope\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Mimir instrument (silver cylinder with top connections) being attached to the back end of the Perkins telescope autoguider unit (in black).
