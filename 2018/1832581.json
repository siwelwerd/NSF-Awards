 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of Women in Cognitive Science is to improve the visibility of women in the field and to create an environment that would invite discussion of the issues that all scientists, but women in particular, may be required to negotiate in the trajectory of creating and sustaining a successful career. Several workshops are designed for women in cognitive science, especially women in the early stages of their academic career. The workshops focus on developing international collaborations, negotiating challenges to scientific advancement, and successfully navigating the workplace culture. Workshops will take place at meetings of the Psychonomic Society, the Cognitive Science Society, and the Association for Psychological Sciences. The workshops will take the form of public forums with invited speaker-panelists to initiate discussion about best practices for the professional advancement of women in cognitive science at the individual and institutional level. These workshops will be live-streamed to increase exposure, and will also feature \"speed-mentoring\" for personalized assistance to young faculty. By partnering with the above-mentioned established societies, the workshops will maximize the outreach potential to a group that continues to be underrepresented in senior academic positions in the cognitive sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
