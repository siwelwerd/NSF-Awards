The postdoctoral fellow would be embedded within the research and scholarly community at Tulane University. The postdoctoral fellow will receive mentoring from senior faculty, participate in an interdisciplinary scholarly community, and mentor undergraduate student research assistants.\r\n\r\nThis project will nurture a scholar in law and society studies by fostering close research, mentoring, and networking interactions. Interdisciplinary scholarship in law and society takes place within several disciplines, including law, sociology, political science, psychology, and anthropology. Thus, this project will facilitate the intellectual development of the law and society communities at Tulane University by expanding the university's capacity, with a goal of drawing a diverse assembly of scholars, policy makers, and the legal community to its base in New Orleans.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
