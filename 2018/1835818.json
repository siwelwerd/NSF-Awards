 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the design and implementation of a software framework to simulate the movement of water at various scales. Understanding the movement and availability of water locally and across the country is of paramount importance to economic productivity and human health of our nation. Hydrologic scientists, are actively tackling these challenges using increasingly complex computational methods. However, modeling advances have not been easily translated to the broader community of scientists and professionals due to technical barriers to entry. This software platform draws from computer models and employs supercomputers capable of analyzing big data to provide unprecedented simulations of water movement over the continental US. Combining hydrologists and computer scientists the team behind the project envision a broad community of users who will have multiple ways to interact with the software framework. For the hydrologic scientist who is interested in generating their own scenarios the framework will facilitate direct interaction with the hydrologic models and the ability to generate simulations on the fly. Conversely, the framework will also provide a set of static output and a range of tools for a broader set of users who would like to evaluate hydrologic projections locally or extract model data for use in other analyses.\r\n\r\nContinental scale simulation of water flow through rivers, streams and groundwater is an identified grand challenge in hydrology. Decades of model development, combined with advances in solver technology and software engineering have enabled large-scale, high-resolution simulations of the hydrologic cycle over the US, yet substantial technical and communication challenges remain. With support from this award, an interdisciplinary team of computer scientists and hydrologists is developing a framework to leverage advances in computer science transforming simulation and data-driven discovery in the Hydrologic Sciences and beyond. This project is advancing the science behind these national scale hydrologic models, accelerating their capabilities and building novel interfaces for user interaction. The framework brings computational and domain science (hydrology) communities together to move more quickly from tools (models, big data, high-performance computing) to discoveries. It facilitates decadal, national scale simulations, which are an unprecedented resource for both the hydrologic community and the much broader community of people working in water dependent systems (e.g., biological system, energy and food production). These simulations will enable the community to address scientific questions about water availability and dynamics from the watershed to the national scale. Additionally, this framework is designed to facilitate multiple modes of interaction and engage a broad spectrum of users outside the hydrologic community. We will provide easy-to-access pre-processed datasets that can be visualized and plotted using built-in tools that will require no computer science or hydrology background. Recognizing that most hydrology training does not generally include High Performance Computing and data analytics or software engineering, this framework will provide a gateway for computationally enhanced hydrologic discovery. Additionally, for educators we will develop packaged videos and educational modules on different hydrologic systems geared towards K-12 classrooms.\r\n\r\nThis award by the NSF Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the Cross-Cutting Activities Program of the Division of Earth Sciences within the NSF Directorate for Geosciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\r\n\n\nThe goal of this project was to create an integrated software framework for continental scale hydrologic simulation and data analysis built with multi-scale configurable components. This was a collaborative project spanning multiple institutions, and the collaborative component reported here represents contributions from researchers at the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc (CUAHSI). Efforts were aimed toward advancing components of the integrated software framework to enable adoption and use within the broader water science community. This included modifying and integrating CUAHSI-hosted community software services to align with the continental scale modeling capabilities that were developed by our collaborators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nContinental scale simulation of water flow through rivers, streams and groundwater is an identified grand challenge in hydrology. Decades of model development, combined with advances in solver technology and software engineering have enabled large-scale, high-resolution simulations of the hydrologic cycle over the US, yet substantial technical and communication challenges remain and it is difficult for researchers such as graduate students with limited high-performance computing and computer science expertise to set up and apply these models. Over the project duration the team has focused on two major activities: (1) developing the hydrologic models and simulations over the Continental US domain; and (2) developing workflows to help others interact with these datasets and simulations. The contributions from CUAHSI researchers largely fall into the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nWe developed the capability to interactively collect subsets of the large modeling datasets that are necessary to configure and execute simulations in the National Water Model (NWM) and Parflow CONUS (PF-CONUS) systems. This was accomplished by exposing the software tools and libraries developed by the NWM and PF-CONUS modeling teams via a map-based web interface known as the CUAHSI Data Subsetter (subsetter.cuahsi.io). The capabilities of this web interface enable researchers to align local and regional modeling studies with the large-scale efforts of the core NWM and PF-CONUS teams, by providing access to the large, painstakingly curated, datasets needed to construct simulations. These datasets are created and maintained by expert modelers and are necessary to align individual research with larger-scale efforts in a manner that supports intercomparison. The web interface was developed to support multiple model versions to further enable comparison as the individual models evolve. By adopting modern cloud capabilities, this work can be extended to support similar functionality for other community models in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nTo encourage open science, we integrated project software (web interfaces, libraries, and code examples) such that derived datasets can be seamlessly saved to the HydroShare data repository. This was done to enable the archival, sharing, and publication of hydrological model datasets with the broader community. HydroShare was developed with support from prior NSF awards and is now operated by CUAHSI, on behalf of the hydrology research community. Additionally, using HydroShares cloud computing functionality, we demonstrated how reproducible workflows can be created to analyze data and run model simulations after collecting domain data through the web interface. The HydroFrame website outlines all project capabilities and serves as a central hub for tools and resources related to national hydrologic modeling and datasets. Our aim is to make hydrologic understanding and analysis more accessible across the United States by connecting innovative research tools and capabilities with the water science community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/28/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: AnthonyCastronova\n"
