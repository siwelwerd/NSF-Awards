 "awd_abstract_narration": "As Moore's law relationship between computing cost versus performance gradually plateaus, and the need for large scale computing is increases, novel computing paradigms need to be urgently explored. In this larger scenario, this project attempts to address the specific problem of scaling up high performance scientific computing applications via a novel paradigm that is based on silicon CMOS technologies. The results from this high-risk endeavor will be used in the classroom at an advanced graduate and undergraduate levels, with the experience gained from the project enabling these students to become the new workforce of future computing technologies. \r\n\r\nConventional digital computing for solving large scientific problems runs into problems of energy efficiency and computing delays. Analog computing has the potential to solve these problems, but has other potential drawbacks namely that of scalability to large problems, noise susceptibility etc. This project will combine the benefits of analog and the digital world by designing a mixed analog-digital hardware. Solution of nonlinear stiff systems of differential equations arising in high performance scientific computing problems will be attempted as a first target application. The goal is to utilize analog processing to quickly get to an approximate solution first, and subsequently refine the solution by a small number of iterations via clock-less digital hardware. In this way, while the scalability issue is addressed and at the same time convergence of the digital iterations to an optimal solution is to be achieved faster and at the expense of lower energy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our research results in two chip prototypes. First, we designed INTIACC, an accelerator for solving various PDEs. It features 16 programmable processing elements with 32-bit floating-point arithmetic units. This architecture supports high-order numerical integration methods and nonlinear function evaluations, providing high-precision solutions to different PDEs with a broad dynamic range. Our hybrid global-local clocking scheme allows each processing element to operate using a fast local clock and a slow global clock, reducing clock distribution power and timing constraints. Prototyped in 65-nm technology, INTIACC offers a single-precision computation throughput of 9.12 GFLOPS. Second, complementing INTIACC, we developed SPADES, an SpMV accelerator that addresses the significant energy consumption associated with off-chip memory access. By incorporating on-the-fly GZIP decompression, SPADES reduces off-chip data movement by an average of 3.36 times, significantly lowering overall system energy consumption. To address the throughput and latency penalty of the GZIP decompression, we developed a parallel decompression process and hardware. Fabricated using 28-nm technology, SPADES offers high computational accuracy while optimizing off-chip memory utilization, reducing the required memory space by 70%. Lastly, we investigated incorporating GZIP decompression hardware into modern GPU architecture to improve the GPU&rsquo;s effective off-chip memory bandwidth.
