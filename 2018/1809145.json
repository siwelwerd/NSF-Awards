 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Description: In this project, a class of materials known as \"two-dimensional (2D) Van der Waals materials\" are being studied. These materials consist of individual sheets (planes) of atoms, with the sheets bonded to each other with only very weak bonds (Van der Waals type bonds). In such materials, the electrons move mainly within a sheet, producing special properties for the electron orbitals (that is, the \"quantum states\" of the electrons). It is very interesting from a fundamental physics point of view to study these orbitals of the electrons, and the orbitals have potential application in electronic devices such as low-power, high-speed transistors. An instrument known as a low-temperature scanning tunneling microscope (LT-STM), recently installed at Carnegie Mellon University and funded through the NSF Major Research Instrumentation program, is being used for the research. With this instrument, the individual atoms on the top atomic plane of the material are imaged, and the electron orbitals are also imaged. The research also includes: (i) study of magnetic properties of the materials, using a magnetic \"probe\" in the LT-STM instrument; and (ii) assembling of stacks of atomic sheets, containing different types of atoms in one sheet to the next. Forming such \"heterostructures\" leads to new type of orbitals for the electrons, again with potential application in variety of electronic devices. The project personnel are involved in graduate and undergraduate student training on this unique LT-STM instrument operation, as well as in assisting external users, and demonstration on nanoscience to visiting middle school children.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description: Initial studies are focusing on transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) materials, such as MoS2 and WSe2. Typically in heterobilayers composed of atomic layers of two different materials, the lattices in the two layers are rotationally aligned, but nevertheless an interference pattern forms due to the different lattice constants (separation between atoms) in the two layers. This pattern is found to have a large influence on the electronic states in the heterobilayer. In particular, states near the valence and conduction band edges are found to be confined within the unit cell of the interference patterns, i.e. analogous to confined states of \"quantum dots\". The relatively large size of the unit cell (about 10 nm) leads to strong confinement of the lowest energy states, leading to a very flat (width of less than 1 meV) electronic bands that are split off from the usual valence and conduction band edge. New types of physics phenomena may be manifest in these materials at low temperature, due to instabilities arising from the large density of states of the flat bands; conceivably, the confined states of the heterobilayers could find application, e.g., in quantum computing. The research effort utilizes low-temperature spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to investigate the band structures of a variety of two-dimensional materials, including heterostructures, that exhibit magnetic, superconducting and charge density wave phenomena. The spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscope offers unique opportunities for the students involved and benefits other research projects by being available to external users.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Such materials are of use in advanced electronic, optical, and magnetic devices, with the work performed here being aimed at understanding the fundamental properties of the materials. The measurements directly reveal the quantum states associated with the electrons in the materials, mapping these states both in space and in energy. The resulting experimental data consists of images (revealing atomic-scale structure of the states) and spectra (showing the number of states, at a given location, as a function of energy). Importantly, the studies are performed not just on single atomic layers of a specific type of material, but usually on \"heterostructures\" consisting of stacks of atomic layers of <em>differing</em> types of materials. The properties of the heterostructures are oftentimes different than those of the constituent single layers, in a manner that can lead to interesting (and useful) properties.</p>\n<p>Four major projects have been performed during the period of this NSF grant (along with several additional projects involving more minor amounts of time):</p>\n<p>1) MoS<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub> heterostructures - Single atomic layers of MoS<sub>2</sub> on top of WSe<sub>2</sub> produce a so-called moir&eacute; pattern in their combined structure, with periodicity of 8.5 nm, arising from interference between the atomic positions of each of the lattices of the constituent layers. This moir&eacute; pattern had been studied prior to the start of this grant (by one of the PIs), revealing a special type of electronic state that is localized within the moir&eacute; unit cell. However, in the period of the present NSF grant, additional measurements were performed on new heterostructures that revealed, among other things, spatially varying strain in the heterostructure. It was demonstrated how knowledge of this strain permits an understanding the specific spatial  location of the localized states.</p>\n<p>2) WTe<sub>2</sub> on NbSe<sub>2</sub> - Single atomic layers of WTe<sub>2</sub> are well-known to have a somewhat unusual 1T' lattice structure, which leads to a special electronic state called a topological edge state. This state was revealed in the present work under the NSF grant, in agreement with prior results. Additionally, it was found that superconductivity which originates from the NbSe<sub>2</sub> material below the WTe<sub>2</sub> can extend up into the WTe<sub>2</sub> itself. Furthermore, evidence was found for this effect not only far inside a layer of the WTe<sub>2</sub>, but also near the <em>edge</em> of such a layer. Hence, tentative observation of induced superconductivity in a topological edge state was found. This sort of effect is important, since in principle it provides a route for realizing a so-called Majorana mode of a type that can be utilized in quantum computers.</p>\n<p>3) Twisted bilayers of WTe<sub>2</sub> - It is well-known that the relative orientation (twist) between adjacent atomic layers can produce interesting effects in the electronic properties of the materials. This was studied during the period of the NSF grant utilizing bilayers of WTe<sub>2</sub> that have a twist between the layers. The toplogical edge states which occur in individual, single atomic layers may or may not survive in a twisted bilayer. Various bilayers were studied, leading to a general understanding of the robustness of the topological edge states.</p>\n<p>4) Rhombohedral graphite - single atomic layers of graphite are known as \"graphene\", with graphene layers normally stacking together in a hexagonal manner to form common (hexagonal) graphite. However, an alternate stacking arrangement is also known, producing rhombohedral graphite. During the present NSF grant, measurements were performed on the electronic states of this material, formed by stacking a specific number of graphene layers (5, 9, or 14 layers). A topological surface state that exists in this material was studied in detail, and additional states were also observed that form a series of peaks in the spectra. This series has interesting behavior as a function of the thickness of the stack, which was observed and theoretically modelled.</p>\n<p>In many of the above projects, an underlying phenomenon that occurs is \"tip-induced band bending\" in the semiconducting layer(s), in which the electric field that exists between the STM probe-tip and the semiconductor actually extends slightly into that material, thereby distorting the electronic states that are being probed. Such effects have been quantified in this work, leading to an understanding of the effect as it occurs in single atomic layers in general. Beyond these projects, several other studies in which samples from other, collaborating groups were studied have also been performed. These collaborative studies are one aspect of <em>broader impact</em> of this work. Additionally, the studies have partially supported 3 graduate students (1 through an AGEP supplement to the grant) and a postdoctoral researcher. Furthermore, both PIs are active in utilizing results from the work in presentations to undergraduate students and to audiences of K-12 students.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/28/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Randall&nbsp;M&nbsp;Feenstra</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1809145/1809145_10540432_1666972526523_Luepke-Waters-Proximity-inducedsuperconductinggapWTe2_Page_2-fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1809145/1809145_10540432_1666972526523_Luepke-Waters-Proximity-inducedsuperconductinggapWTe2_Page_2-fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fabrication and morphology of the WTe2-NbSe2 heterostructure\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1809145/1809145_10540432_1666972526523_Luepke-Waters-Proximity-inducedsuperconductinggapWTe2_Page_2-fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fabrication and morphology of the WTe2-NbSe2 heterostructure\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(a) Schematic of the sample fabrication, using a dry-transfer flip technique.
