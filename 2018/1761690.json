 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nanoparticles are present in many aspects of everyday life, from food, drugs, cosmetics, textiles, and wood preservatives to tires, electronics, and engines. Regardless of a nanoparticle's type, its formation, growth, and eventual destruction involves physical processes that lead to distributions of particles of many different shapes and sizes. In most cases, industry wants better means to control the particle distributions; in other cases, the objective is to prevent the formation of particles. Either way, one needs to understand how particles behave and evolve over time to accomplish those goals. This project aims to improve the predictive capabilities of software for simulating the transport and evolution of populations of nanoparticles in complex flow fields (e.g., nanoparticles in a combustion engine). The improved tools developed in this project will benefit the combustion field by enabling better predictions of the formation, growth, and destruction of soot particles. This will support the design of cleaner internal combustion engines, gas turbine engines, and furnaces. Beyond combustion, the tools developed and understanding gained through this project could advance manufacturing by identifying which environmental properties can be leveraged to enhance/trigger certain particles, increase the formation of certain types of particles, or suppress them altogether. Finally, the software to be developed is not limited to solid-oxide nanoparticles and soot. In fact, any dispersed phase of nano- to micro-size materials can be described by the tools developed here, including dispersion of aerosols, dust, charged particles in plasmas, and even \"particles\" representing large objects in astrophysics. In addition to the scientific objectives of the project, the PIs will engage in public outreach and education efforts, including producing videos explaining computational fluid dynamics for the public, running workshops teaching software skills to researchers, and involving undergraduate students from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds in research.\r\n \r\nThis project will improve the predictive capabilities of numerical frameworks for simulating the transport and evolution of populations of nanoparticles in complex flow fields. The research objectives include: (1) Solving the population balance equation (PBE) for nanoparticle number density functions with no compromise in physical accuracy. The approach provides not only the full distribution of particles but also all their relevant properties; (2) Evaluate a computationally efficient numerical implementation of a coupled flow solver and PBE solver; and (3) Enable new physical and chemical insights into nanoparticle distributions across a wide range of fields by sharing the software developed and working with other research groups. These objectives will be achieved by leveraging the strengths of the underlying computer architectures: using traditional central processing units (CPUs) to solve the flow fields and particle transport, while performing the temporal evolution of the population of particles on graphics processing units (GPUs) using a Monte Carlo solver.  The PIs plan to release the NGA software as open source and build a user community around NGA by ensuring that interested researchers are able to contribute to the codebase. This will allow a wider growth of the project. This aspect is of special interest to the software cluster in the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure, which has provided co-funding for this award.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFireworks represent one of the most beautiful and widely seen uses of small metal particles.  Metal oxide particles, and more generally nanoparticles, are used in and formed by many engineered and natural phenomena.  Some nanoparticles serve as white pigments, water repellents, catalysts, adsorbents, and food additives; others are byproducts of combustion with a detrimental impact on human health and the environment.  All of them are formed in a complex flow field where various physical and chemical phenomena interact.  The strong sensitivity to the environment in which they evolve results in particles with a wide range of shapes and sizes.  Capturing the actual distribution of shapes and sizes places stringent restrictions on the numerical methods used to simulate the processes.\n\nThe goal of this project was to improve the predictive capabilities of numerical frameworks in simulating the transport and evolution of populations of nanoparticles in complex flow fields.  This was achieved by leveraging the strengths of the underlying computer architectures.  Namely, traditional central processing units (CPUs) are used to solve the flow fields and particle transport, whereas the temporal evolution of the population of particles is performed on graphics processing units (GPUs) using a Monte Carlo solver.\n\nFrom a mathematical point of view, the transport of particles in the flow field is accomplished using a Lagrangian Particle Tracking (LPT) method.  The project saw two implementations of the LPT module with the second implementation exhibiting strong improvements over the first: a source code about 10% shorter, a reduction of about 25% in the required memory, and an order of magnitude reduction in disk requirement.  \n\nThe implementations of the LPT module were verified and validated in a wide range of flow fields, from canonical uniform and steady flows to unsteady laminar flows to various three-dimensional turbulent flows.  The verifications and validations were also caried out in Cartesian and cylindrical configurations.  The accuracy of the Lagrangian transport was assessed by comparing the results against traditional Eulerian methods.  The various key components of the LPT module were evaluated separately, including the accuracy of the time integration, the multi-dimensional interpolation of the velocity field at the particle locations, and the resolution of the underlying computational grid. \n\nThe project led to unintended, yet consequential improvements in tangential engineering fields.  This included a novel mathematical framework to perform turbulent boundary layer simulations and new insight on turbulent mixing in jets.\n\nThe source code of the LPT module was uploaded on GitHub, and the various components of the work were disseminated to the scientific community via several presentations at national conferences and publications in peer-reviewed journals.  An educational video of particle transport in a turbulent boundary layer was made by an undergraduate student and submitted to the album of fluid motion of the American Physical Society (APS). \n\nThe project was carried out by two graduate students and led to the training of five undergraduate students.  The undergraduate students were included in the research group and gained a deep knowledge of the research field.  They wrote a proposal, asked for recommendation letters, performed research, met regularly with the PI and co-supervising graduate student, wrote interim project reports, submitted abstracts, and gave presentations.  In co-supervising the undergraduate students, the graduate students gained a more complete picture of what it means to teach, educate, and guide a student.  This is invaluable training that one does not get from traditional coursework.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/22/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Guillaume Blanquart"
