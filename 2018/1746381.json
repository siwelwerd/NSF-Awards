 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable the high sample testing throughput necessary for quantum magnetic bioassay technology to be used for medical diagnostics, precision health and point of care patient care. Ultrasensitive detection of low-concentration biomarkers, many of which are currently undetectable by existing technology, offers new diagnostic capability for improved clinical decisions and better patient health. Existing high-sensitivity diagnostic instruments are very complex to use, expensive and require lengthy sample processing steps - all of which increase health care costs. A new class of magnetic-based assays combining high sensitivity and low sample processing using NV diamond quantum sensors has been developed. Magnetic assay platforms can deliver equivalent results to current biomarker assays faster and at significantly lower cost. A dramatic reduction in sample processing, combined with direct detection of magnetic tags, will provide rapid test results, a critical component for point of care diagnostics. A remaining challenge for this approach is delivering bioassay samples to the sensor quickly and repeatedly - a challenge to be addressed in this project. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a rapid sample transfer mechanism to enhance the sample throughput of bioassays using a quantum magnetic sensor. Quantum sensing enables revolutionary magnetic sensitivity and spatial resolution in a modality compatible with biological samples. However, the sample must be delivered close to the diamond sensor for analysis, and transfer between samples must occur in seconds, all while maintaining sensing performance. Prototype sample transfer systems designed and fabricated in this project will implement an innovative new process to rapidly transition between assay samples. The hardware will be compact, require little power, and be manufacturable at low cost. Prototype sample transfer hardware developed in Phase I will form the basis for subsequent engineering of quantum sensor based bioassay devices, with initial applications to the research use only (RUO) sector, and later to clinical in vitro diagnostics. This advance will bridge the gap between the capabilities of quantum magnetic sensing and the sample throughput needs of clinical applications.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nQuantum Diamond Technologies Inc. (QDTI) demonstrated in this Phase I project the feasibility of a rapid sample transfer technology that integrates with QDTI's quantum magnetic sensing platform to provide high sample throughput for bioassays.  Quantum sensing with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond provides unprecedented magnetic field sensitivity at room temperature, allowing for high-resolution, megapixel-scale magnetic imaging of samples at the sensor surface.  Magnetic bioassays leverage this sensing capability and the negligible magnetic background of biological samples to provide ultrasensitive quantitation of low-abundance biomarkers with simplified sample handling and a compact instrument.\n\nClinical and research applications require sufficient analysis throughput to measure many samples each day, with minimal transfer time between samples.  In this project, QDTI developed a prototype rapid sample transfer cartridge that allows 96 samples to be prepared in parallel wells and sequentially analyzed, requiring only seconds to transition between samples.  The cartridge loads into a quantum magnetic sensing instrument for automated analysis, where each cartridge well interfaces with a diamond quantum sensor.  The samples do not contact the sensor directly, preventing inter-sample contamination.  This feasibility study included stages of modeling and prototyping that explored key risks and acceptable parameters for cartridge fabrication.  QDTI identified assembly processes suitable for producing robust and functional cartridges, starting with smaller-format prototypes and testing alternative materials before moving to full 96-well cartridges.  Analysis of the costs associated with different choices of cartridge materials and assembly strategies guided the design process, to ensure that a cartridge capable of meeting benchmarks of technical feasibility could also be realistically manufactured at scale with appropriately low cost.  After settling on a prototype cartridge design, QDTI conducted functional testing of sample transfer time and imaging precision, as well as a final magnetic assay demonstration using cartridge-loaded samples.\n\nThe Phase I prototype cartridge produced in this project shows this cartridge technology can feasibly provide high sample throughput without sacrificing magnetic assay performance.  QDTI has used this prototype design for ongoing high-throughput assay development.  In addition, this study provides the basis for cartridge development in Phase II to improve performance and establish a process for fabricating cartridges in larger volumes with reliable quality and low cost.  A robust cartridge manufacturing process will enable QDTI to deliver the unique capabilities of quantum sensing based bioassays -- including ultrasensitive detection, low sample volumes, minimal sample processing, rapid time to result, and low cost -- while also providing the sample throughput demanded by research and clinical users.  With this effort, quantum sensing will drive discovery, advance clinical care, and improve patient health.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/11/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Colin Connolly"
