 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project features the development of a novel, high-performance, low-field Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) system. The system is designed to enable groundbreaking research in imaging technology, as well as in the science and technology of human spoken communication and the science of sleep, that is not possible with any conventional MRI configuration. The work includes developing signal processing methods for MRI that enable rapid imaging in low signal-to-noise ratio environments.  This will alleviate artifacts that occur at air-tissue interfaces, which will make it possible to track tissue boundaries with high precision during dynamic imaging studies, particularly those adjacent to air space such as the tongue, velum, and pharyngeal airway, which are not easily accessible by other instrumentation. The new MRI system will also have a much lower level of acoustic noise than conventional systems, making it possible to perform real-time conversational speech studies and studies during natural sleep.  It is anticipated that the new system will advance the field of speech research, by enabling direct investigation of the dynamic human vocal tract during communication, and will support innovative research in speech technology.\r\n\r\nDynamic imaging research is deeply multidisciplinary and connects computational and informational sciences with physics, biology, linguistics, communication, and engineering. The deployment of a novel magnet dedicated to dynamic imaging on the host campus represents a contribution to infrastructure for research and teaching.  Data from the new MRI system will be used in a course that teaches basic physical reasoning and quantitative thinking by using theoretical and empirical descriptions of the physical mechanisms of speech.\r\nThe course uses dynamic MRI data to allow students to understand speech production of vowels and consonants. The new system will allow for data of higher quality and, for the first time, acoustic recording of analyzable speech audio.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The new instrument is a commercial high-performance MRI that was <em>ramped down</em> to 0.55 Tesla. All subsystems (e.g. spectrometer, console, software, gradients) are state-of-the-art with only the polarizing field reduced and the radiofrequency subsystem replaced. &nbsp;It is augmented with several custom-made radiofrequency coils, a real-time interactive console that allows rapid prototyping of new imaging methods, and a wide array of physiological monitors that can be synchronized with the dynamic images.&nbsp; This instrument overcame two major limitations of pre-existing MRI configurations. First, it is essentially free of artifacts at air-tissue interfaces. This makes it possible to track tissue boundaries with high precision during dynamic imaging studies, particularly those adjacent to air space such as the tongue, velum, and pharyngeal airway (e.g., during speech), which are not easily accessible by other instrumentation. Second, the instrument is essentially free of acoustic noise, making it possible to perform real-time audio feedback, conversational speech studies, and studies during natural sleep.

This project has a high potential for engaging our community into the enterprise of science given the inherent interest in human body and human performance combined with the existing collaborative University-community environment. The system is installed in the Michelson Center for Convergent Biosciences, in very close proximity to all our major user groups.
