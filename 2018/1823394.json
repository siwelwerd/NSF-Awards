 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide travel funds for locating a suitable base of operation for the Asian summer monsoon Chemical and Climate Impact Project (ACCLIP) field campaign.  This field campaign suggests to use the NSF/NCAR research aircraft Gulfstream V and the NASA WB-57 to characterize the Asian Summer Monsoon's (ASM) impact on global chemistry and climate.  ACCLIP is planned to take place during July-August of 2020 with aircraft based in Japan. \r\n\r\nThe goal of ACCLIP is to measure the unique chemical composition, water vapor, and aerosol content in air processed in the ASM anticyclone from a base in the western Pacific in order to evaluate its global impact on atmospheric chemistry and radiation.  The ASM anticyclone has been shown to contain an enhanced aerosol layer at the upper troposphere - lower stratosphere (UTLS) level - the Asian Tropopause Aerosol Layer (ATAL).  The coupling of the ATAL to the UTLS dynamical system through deep monsoon convection in the NH summer season has the potential to generate significant chemical and climate impacts.  Potentially large black carbon (BC) enhancements in the ATAL also may affect dynamic processes in the region by generating in situ heating, potentially reducing precipitation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
