HPDC, the premier venue for presenting the latest research on the design, implementation, evaluation, and use of parallel and distributed systems for high performance and high end computing, will take place over the week of June 27th in Tempe, AZ. \r\n\r\nThe experience will include a set of co-located full-day workshops with topics that include\r\n       o Fault-Tolerance for HPC at Extreme Scale (FTXS)\r\n       o Software Engineering Methods for Parallel and High Performance Applications (SEM4HPC)\r\n       o The Ninth Workshop on Scientific Cloud Computing (ScienceCloud)\r\n       o The Eighth Interntional Workshop on Runtime and Operating Systems for Supercomputers (ROSS)\r\n\r\nThe main conference takes place Wednesday through Friday. This is a single-track conference that will include keynotes, paper sessions, a poster session, a panel, and an industry/institutional session.  The recruitment strategy encourages diversity in participation.  Active involvement in major conferences is a valuable experience for students.",
