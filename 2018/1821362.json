 "awd_abstract_narration": "Northwestern University proposes to provide logistic and travel support for two workshops (one in Chicago, the other in Los Angeles) that will give technical assistance on designing and implementing effective researcher-practitioner partnerships (RPPs) that aim to bring sustainable, scalable and equitable computer science (CS) education to preK-12 schools. Participating teams will include education researchers and preK-12 practitioners (teachers, administrators, and counselors), possibly augmented with other community, foundation, policy, and industry partners. Through the course of the workshop, they will begin to co-design the goals, metrics, and implementations, that they will need to  strengthen the capacity of their schools to produce successful CS education outcomes for diverse groups of students, educated by different teachers from varied organizational contexts. \r\n\r\nThe Principal Investigator, directs the Office of Community Education Partnerships (OCEP) in the School of Education and Social Policy at Northwestern University. OCEP will handle all the event logistics for 160 participants, including but not limited to website design and hosting, registration, arranging meeting room space, catering, and A/V support, and conducting reimbursement for travel costs for participants. The content and delivery of the workshop will be planned and delivered by the Research + Practice Collaboratory centered at the University of Washington.",
