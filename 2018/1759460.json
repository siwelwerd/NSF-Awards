 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics & Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Clifford Kubiak of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) is developing new classes of inorganic materials for use in next generation computers.  The goal of this research is to develop and study new complexes that undergo picosecond (a trillionth of a second) electron transfer or structural rearrangements that occur in electronic grounds states.  Such ultrafast  molecular changes may be used to make novel molecular devices including those for information storage. This project has the potential to impact the broader scientific and engineering communities involved in electronic device technologies where a critical goal is to extend information processing by the current Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) platforms. The Kubiak group is well-positioned to provide a highly technical level of education and training for students.  Outreach activities involving K-12 students, especially those from the Preuss School at UCSD and Torrey Pines High School. \r\n\r\nThe focus of the project is the investigation of ultrafast (picosecond) electron transfer in mixed valence systems. Mixed-valent complexes typically consist of two identical redox active centers that are separated by a bridge. In their mixed-valent state, the redox centers differ only in their oxidation states and are stabilized relative to disproportionation by electron self-exchange. The group has showed that when the bridging interaction is composed of a hydrogen bond, electron transfer (ET) in the mixed-valent state stabilizes hydrogen-bonding interactions by about 5 kcal per mole relative to the neutral, isovalent, hydrogen-bonded dimers. A core question of this project is whether the hydrogen bond precedes, follows, or occurs in concert with ET. The specific goals are: to develop a complete physical description of how ET occurs across hydrogen bonds; to continue the synthesis of new complexes to better understand the interplay between electron delocalization and hydrogen bonding;  and to investigate the switched-on self-assembly of supramolecular structures that can form stronger hydrogen bonds when reduced.  A collaboration with a 2-dimensional infrared spectroscopy lab (2D IR)  provides new spectroscopic insights into the dynamics and mechanisms of ET and molecular rearrangements that occur in ultrafast ground state molecules.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

One of the major impacts of the project was the determination of the strengths of hydrogen bonds in the presence vs. absence of electron transfer reactions across them.  This work demonstrated for the first time how normally weak hydrogen bonds can be significantly strengthened by electron delocalization.  These ideas were extended to prepare new stable mixed valence complexes formed by electron delocalization across hydrogen bonded and biologically relevant pyrimidinone ligands.  We also employed the spectroscopic method of two-dimensional IR (2D IR) spectroscopy, and made the first direct observation of the the intermediates in ultrafast molecular rearrangements of five-coordinate ruthenium complexes.  Importantly, this high-level 2D IR experimental study validated rate constants estimated previously in our NSF sponsored research by simulation of 1D IR lineshapes.
