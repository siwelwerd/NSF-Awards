 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent natural disasters are reminders that the next generation of buildings should minimize economic and social consequences of extreme loading with minimal environmental impact. This research investigates a new integrated structural-architectural wall system which utilizes tessellated patterns, an arrangement of repetitive elements, to produce buildings that can be efficiently constructed, repaired, reconfigured, and deconstructed. Tessellated Structural Architectural (TeSA) systems can contribute to resilience through rapid repair and reoccupation after an extreme event, as well as to sustainability through reuse and adaptability of materials, structural elements, and buildings. Among the benefits of TeSA systems is to facilitate building adaptation and deconstruction, which are strategies for mitigating obsolescence, a primary cause of building demolition, and limiting the environmental footprint of demolition debris while increasing the lifecycle of buildings as they are flexible to adapt to future uses. The need for these benefits will likely increase as urbanization continues to increase. University coursework and practitioner workshops will be used to disseminate research results and encourage their application in the construction industry.\r\n\r\nThis research project will study and understand fundamental differences of multiple classes of TeSA systems. The structural behavior of diverse classes of tessellated wall systems, including 1D and 2D topologically interlocking tessellations will be investigated through validated models. Analytical models, physical experiments, and probabilistic assessments will be used to focus on localization of damage in tessellated structures and the effects of repair/replacement of damaged elements at the building scale. Research will also create a decision framework whereby integrated teams of architects and engineers can utilize fragility curves as a visual means of communicating the effects of design decisions concerning materials and building systems. It will provide architects and engineers with validated methods and a demonstrated framework for designing TeSA systems of their own creation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
