 "awd_abstract_narration": "The open source network simulation (ns-3) tool is used widely by researchers to evaluate the performance of computer networks. Over the past decade, user demand for new ns-3 capabilities has centered on simulating rapidly emerging wireless networking technologies including Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) and Long Term Evolution (LTE) cellular systems. New capabilities are essential for exploration of emerging 5th Generation (5G) cellular network technologies.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to 1) extend the core wireless capabilities of ns-3, positioning the simulator as the research tool of choice for 5G wireless network simulations; 2) improve usability and create new educational/training materials; and 3) better align ns-3 with experiments on wireless network test-beds. The latter project goal is expected to contribute to recently announced National Science Foundation-funded Platforms for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR) city-scale advanced wireless infrastructure testbeds. New wireless technology coexistence scenarios for heterogeneous networks as well as the ongoing challenge of scaling due to network densification are main research thrusts for this effort.  In addition, a key project goal is improving usability and development of new ns-3 educational material to ease adoption of these new modules (and ns-3 broadly) by the next generation of users. The project extends an existing collaboration between investigators at the University of Washington and the Centre Technologic Telecomunicacions Catalunya (CTTC Barcelona).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
