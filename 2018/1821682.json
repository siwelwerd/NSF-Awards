 "awd_abstract_narration": "Public cloud computing is rapidly becoming the foundation of our information-based economy. Users are\r\nadopting cloud platforms in lieu of maintaining dedicated computing infrastructure primarily due to the\r\nresulting savings in costs. Since cloud platforms earn revenue from utilizing their infrastructure by\r\nrenting it out to customers, and earn no revenue if their infrastructure is idle, their goal is to maximize\r\nutilization. The increasing complexity of cloud markets raises new research\r\nchallenges for both users and providers that are inherently economic. This award will support the\r\norganization of a workshop to bring together researchers from computer systems and networks and from\r\nthe fields of economics, finance, and operations research to define important research challenges at the\r\nintersection of economics and cloud computing over the next 5-10 years.\r\n\r\nThe research agenda of the workshop has the potential for broad and transformative impact on the US and\r\nbeyond by fostering a new interdisciplinary community in this nascent area, identifying its key research\r\nchallenges, and laying the foundation for future innovations that increase the efficiency of using cloud\r\ncomputing resources. Furthermore, the workshop will engage early career scholars and those from\r\ndiverse backgrounds and underrepresented groups to connect them with a broad community of academic\r\nand industrial researchers interested in the intersection of economics and computer systems and\r\nnetworking.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
