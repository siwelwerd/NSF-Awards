 "awd_abstract_narration": "The developmental environment can have profound impacts on an individual. For example, in many non-mammalian vertebrates including some fish, most turtles, and all crocodilians, environmental temperatures occurring during a specific period of incubation will determine if individuals develop as either a male or female. Previous findings have revealed a critical role for the endocrine system and epigenetics, heritable changes in gene function without changes in DNA sequence, in determining how the environment impacts traits. This project will determine the mechanisms by which environments and hormone signaling act on epigenetic processes to shape developmental trajectories and produce phenotypic diversity. The project focuses on species displaying temperature-dependent sex determination, to address how temperature induces and coordinates radically different phenotypic trajectories. The study will support the training and mentoring of two graduate students and two undergraduate researchers, with recruiting efforts aimed at under-represented groups in the sciences. The project will develop a primer focused on communicating common misperceptions about epigenetics. The findings will be presented to students at area schools as part of an established outreach program. Together, this work will advance the understanding of the mechanisms that determine how organisms interact with the environments and will provide training opportunities for the next generation of scientists. \r\n\r\nThe work will employ state of the art sequencing approaches to advance a developmental- and endocrine-based understanding of how adaptive epigenetic responses occur in nature, and how epigenetic responses are disrupted by environmental stressors for which a shared evolutionary history is absent. The Parrott Lab has previously observed widespread sexually dimorphic DNA methylation patterning across the gonadal genome. However, the developmental and molecular processes by which a bipotential genome acquires a sexually dimorphic epigenome is unclear. Developmental windows of environmental sensitivity will first be identified by resolving the temporal dynamics of the DNA methylome during temperature-dependent sex determination and reproductive development. Combinatorial treatments of temperature and hormones will then reveal the degree to which temperature and endocrine signals act on overlapping or distinct regions of the epigenome. Finally, the project will investigate the influence of environmental quality on the sexually dimorphic methylome. Given the inherent environmental sensitivity of temperature-dependent sex determination, it is hypothesized that environmental variables (other than temperature) also influence this process to affect the development and subsequent function of the reproductive system. Together, experiments will reveal how environmental and biological signals are integrated into developmental processes that result in phenotypic diversity. Findings from this work will be disseminated in peer-reviewed publications, presentations at national and international scientific, and more broadly via outreach activities in partnership with area schools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
