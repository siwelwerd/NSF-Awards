 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mass timber technologies, with their promise of improved resource utilization and sustainability, have brought a new excitement to the U.S. building industry. These technologies are allowing a renewable resource to enter into areas of construction that were previously not feasible due to a variety of technical constraints. Despite the promise that mass timber holds, wood is ultimately a natural material with inherent variability and peculiarities. Before a new engineered wood product can be brought to market, extensive and expensive laboratory testing is required to establish its reliable properties. This project will enhance the opportunities for increased use of timber by understanding the fundamental mechanics necessary for accurate performance prediction, including response and behavior under extreme events.  The work will exploit advances in both computational modeling and materials characterization techniques, such that structural performance can be reliably predicted.  The outcomes of the work will benefit both the manufacturers of wood products, by allowing them to better optimize their fiber resource, and the architects and engineers who develop new structural systems.  For these parties, the new predictive capability will streamline both structural/architectural innovation and product development. Existing ties with both the wood products industry and the architectural community will ensure appropriate dissemination of results.\r\n\r\nIn order to realize the above outcomes, specific research activities will focus on a computational framework that will feature a novel mechanisms-based, isogeometric embedded-lattice model approximating the internal structure of mass timber. It will simulate the mechanical behavior at multiple scales including the effect of interfaces and defects. This computational model, which explicitly incorporates material morphology, will be calibrated through an experimental program that isolates and measures the micro- and meso-scale morphological features that dictate material behavior, and it will be validated through structural component-scale testing. Since the approach is designed to capture the physical mechanisms that dictate behavior, larger scale phenomena, such as size effects, will be predicted as a natural outcome of the simulation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project made significant advances in our ability to predict structural performance properties of wood elements relevant for mass timber construction.  These advances were accomplished through a computational modeling approach that mimics the morphology of wood such that the critical features that dictate structural properties are explicitly represented.  The model properties were assigned based on small scale fracture tests.  Additional work led to a model that captures the time and moisture dependent properties of the material that affect long term serviceability of structures.\n\nThe intellectual merit of the work lies in the innovative way the computational model can capture material properties at a scale approaching the individual wood fiber (see accompanying figure), which is in fact the scale that is relevant for numerous structural properties, but is typically glossed over due to the computational expense. The experiments complemented the modeling effort by quantifying the magnitude of the different failure mechanisms at the fiber scale.\n\nThe broader impact of the work lies in the way we have enhanced our predictive capabilities for mass timber construction.  Mass timber in general, and cross laminated timber (CLT) in particular, is structural technology that can provide immediate reductions in the carbon footprint of the building envelope.  The results of this research will enable designers to further push the boundaries of what is possible in wood construction, and will provide better predictive abilities for innovative new designs.  Additional broader impacts lie in the collaboration of the research team with the Northwestern Architecture Design and Engineering undergraduate program, where students applied new timber design technologies into their class projects.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/01/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric N Landis"
