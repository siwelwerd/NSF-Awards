 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many biosensors used in point-of-care devices suffer from selectivity and sensitivity limitations that restrict their application in detecting and monitoring infectious diseases (such as HIV and certain cancers). To mitigate these limitations, a new electrochemical biosensor with high sensitivity and selectivity will be developed. The improvement in selectivity and sensitivity will be realized through packing nanostructures between electrodes to generate high shear forces. The expected outcome is a biosensor which detects, identifies and quantifies multiple breast cancer biomarker proteins at very low concentrations. The related science opens exciting new avenues such as electrochemical measurements for the detection of opioids in water and the development of new manufacturing techniques for therapeutic drugs. The principal investigator will seek close integration among research, experiments and education. The PI will train the next generation of scientists and engineers who are interested in the area of biosensing technology, and mentor researchers (including minorities and female) at undergraduate and graduate level, as well as inspire K-12 students in science and engineering fields at the early stage of their learning career through hands-on demonstrations. \r\n\r\nBiosensors for early diagnostics of infectious diseases or cancer are vitally important for early intervention, patient care, and reduction of patient mortality. Current biosensors often fail at low concentrations, as they are not sufficiently sensitive (to prevent false-negatives) nor selective (to prevent false-positives). The overall objective of this project is to develop a new electrochemical sensing method that uses a shear-enhanced, flow-through, nanoporous and capacitive electrode technology, resulting in a very sensitive and selective biosensor. The performance of new biosensor will exceed that of current biosensors as (i) the electrode nanoporosity will facilitate the development of shear forces of the order of a hydrogen bond that will significantly increase selectivity by mitigating non-specific adsorption; (ii) the design of the biosensor will negate signal artifacts such as the parasitic double layer capacitance, thus facilitating rapid, high-resolution characterization of the binding signal with a significant reduction in noise leading to increased sensitivity; and (iii) the nanoporous electrode architecture will increase convective transport of the analyte of interest to the sensing element, thus overcoming diffusion limitations and reducing assay times. To facilitate the development of the biosensor, the PI will investigate, analyze and model the electrochemical response of the biosensor from the binding of a single species of target biomolecule to its complementary biological sensing element. The effects of physiochemical characteristics of the nanoporous capacitive electrode along with the enhanced shear forces will be studied in detail. A multiplexed electrochemical characterization method will be developed to test for breast cancer biomarker panel using real-world, complex samples and to validate the biosensor technology against commercial assays. The multidisciplinary nature of this project will be used to train students at all levels in laboratory and experimental techniques, and increase the likelihood that they would choose interdisciplinary research as a career path. This outreach effort will harness social media, leverage our existing educational relationships, and include classroom demonstrations, teacher training, and educational peer-mentored conference with NJIT Honors College. Among the target populations of this STEM awareness campaign are inner-city high schools in the locales of Newark, NJ and Union, NJ that primarily serve largely underrepresented student bodies. Statistical training workshops and related tools will be also developed for graduate students to increase statistical evidence-based training. Validated assessment tools will be used to evaluate the success of these outreach and educational activities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In the project, we have developed ESSENCE, a new Electrochemical Sensor that uses a Shear-Enhanced, flow-through Nanoporous Capacitive Electrode, which overcomes current electrochemical sensors' response limitations, selectivity, and sensitivity limitations. The ESSENCE platform uses nonplanar interdigitated microelectrodes as opposed to the conventional co-planar interdigitated electrodes, enabling enhanced and uniform electric field penetration. Microelectrode geometries are crucial for the performance of microfluidic electrochemical sensors (&micro;FESs), with interdigitated ultramicroelectrode arrays (UMEA) offering benefits like miniaturization, rapid steady-state, and improved signal-to-noise ratios.

The microfluidic channel can also be made using parafilm, a ubiquitous lab supply item. In the microchannel, between the non-planar interdigitated electrodes, functionalized carbon nanotubes are packed using simple micropipetting. These carbon nanotubes are functionalized with either single-stranded DNA or antibodies, enabling them to capture both proteins and nucleotides with a large degree of selectivity. Using a combination of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and microfluidic flow, the amount of target material like target single-stranded DNA and breast cancer biomarker proteins like the p53 protein can be captured and quantified at concentrations as low as 10<sup>-11</sup> M and 10<sup>-7</sup>g/l respectively.&nbsp; To enable the use of this chip as a point-of-care biosensor, the microfluidic flow and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were fully automated using modular systems, allowing us to create a demonstrable fully enclosed prototype powered by open-sourced hardware and software enabling ease of use and mass production. The technology developed using the carbon nanotube-packed sensor was also extended for the detection and quantification of emerging contaminants like per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). By replacing the carbon material with a novel porous material like metal-organic frameworks, we were able to detect perfluorooctanesulfonate concentrations as low as 0.5ng/L. The ESSENCE platform can also be used for the detection of zoonotic diseases like bovine spongiform encephalopathy.

Research has shown that the presence or elevated concentrations of specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath can be used for the early detection of cancer. To this end, one of the secondary goals of this project was to develop an electrochemical microfluidic platform aimed at detecting VOCs in breath samples. As an initial step, Basuray lab explored the potential of using the electrochemical microfluidic platform combined with ionic liquids, an emerging gas-sensing material, for detecting model gas CO<sub>2</sub>. The findings from this study suggest that integrating microfluidics, microelectrode technology, and ionic liquids as sensing materials can enable the development of an impedimetric sensor platform with sensitivity in the low parts-per-million (ppm) range.

This method introduces errors and biases into the analysis due to the uncertainties associated with the selection of a good ECM.
