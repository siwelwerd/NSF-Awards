 "awd_abstract_narration": "This professional development conference, \"Opening the Pathway to Technician Careers: A Conference for Biology Teachers of Deaf Students\" will address the compelling need for a diverse workforce in the United States by specifically targeting the educational needs of a group of students with unique learning and communication characteristics. The conference will bring together high school teachers, community college biology faculty, and American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters to improve biology education for deaf and hard-of-hearing (deaf/hh) students. Through a focus on Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles and literacy-building case-based learning pedagogy, the conference will improve learning not only for deaf/hh students but for all students in the biology classroom. Biology courses impact large numbers of students because high school or introductory college biology courses are often the only exposure of non-science majors to science. In technician education, biology serves as a gateway course for students interested in technical fields such as agricultural technology, biotechnology, and environmental sciences, where the deaf/hh population is underrepresented.\r\n\r\nThis conference will provide participants with: 1)Education in the use of case-based pedagogies and their potential for enhancing literacy and world knowledge for students within the context of learning biology; 2) Multiple ways to implement principles of UDL in biology classrooms; 3) Best practices for teaching biology to deaf/hh students; 4)Information about technician careers requiring a biology foundation; 5) A community of biology instructors of students who are deaf/hh; and 6) A stronger biology content knowledge.  \r\nThe projected outcomes of this conference include the collection and dissemination of best practices for teaching biology to deaf/hh students using UDL principles, case-based pedagogies, and literacy improvement practices. The conference design will support sharing effective educational resources within and beyond the conference community, continued collaboration of participants, and promoting connections to the broader community of biology educators. Findings from the conference will be presented in a white paper so that best practices and the needs of the deaf/hh community with regards to biology education will be more broadly understood.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nTechnician careers in areas related to biology, such as agriculture and biotechnology, are a well paid and growing sector of the economy throughout the United States.  The educational requirement for these positions is often a two-year Associate's degree, providing a relatively short and accessible pathway into the workforce.  In order to fill these positions, more students must be aware of these educational and career options, particularly students from groups that are currently underrepresented in science.  In addition to a lack of awareness of career options, another potential barrier to pursuing a technician career is student success in introductory biology. As a group, deaf and hard-of-hearing (deaf/hh) students are drastically underrepresented in science majors and technician careers.  The Opening the Pathway conference was designed to address the low rate of deaf/hh students in technician career tracks by providing biology faculty who teach deaf/hh students professional development in science teaching and information about biology related technician careers.  \nThe conference brought together hearing and deaf/hh instructors from high schools and community colleges across the country for a unique opportunity to focus on providing biology education in both American Sign Language and English.  Interpreters who work in science classrooms also participated, as interpreters are an integral part of students? educational experience and learning environment.  Participants were introduced to the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework, which helps educators prepare for the variety of students in every classroom.  In addition, participants gained experience with case based learning, an effective pedagogical approach for engaging students in inquiry based learning, and explored a collection of relevant educational resources.  Panelists shared their career pathways and experiences, and keynote speakers addressed important aspects of engaging deaf/hh students in science pathways.  \nThe conference also answered the need for community, bringing together a group of 43 people with a shared disciplinary interest and commitment to educating deaf/hh students. Such a community provides a way for educators to share ideas and resources to support their education efforts.  The conference website remains available to the community, and the educational materials developed for this conference are publicly available open educational resources, and as such may be used in any biology classroom (https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/opening_the_pathway). Deaf/hh students in other science fields are faced with many of the same challenges and opportunities addressed at this conference, and the methods presented will have the same beneficial outcomes in all science classes.  Many of the participants at this biology focused conference are the sole science teacher at their institution and are teaching all of the sciences.  The information from this conference should help those faculty provide more effective learning environments for all their students.  \nSolutions to many of the major challenges facing society today will be found in science.  Making science accessible to all contributes to a scientifically literate populace who can contribute to finding, evaluating, and implementing these solutions.  UDL and evidence based pedagogies, such as case based learning, support the participation of all students in science education, strengthening our future workforce as well as our ability to respond to challenges in scientifically informed ways. In addition, this conference demonstrated the value of diverse backgrounds and viewpoints.  Studies have demonstrated that diverse groups develop more creative solutions, enhancing the likelihood of addressing complex world wide issues such as climate change and emerging infectious diseases.  Finally, effective, inclusive teaching addresses social justice issues.  When some students are excluded, all students lose opportunities for collaborative learning, enhancing group skills, and understanding broader world views.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/06/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Donna Lange"
