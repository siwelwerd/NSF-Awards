 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project includes the development of an imaging system which addresses the current clinical need for a non-invasive imaging methodology that could image the skin over its depth with high resolutions while offering large histopathological contrasts between malignant and normal tissues. This will provide invaluable assistance to dermatologists with respect to improving tumor detection accuracies. The target market for this device would be the global dermatology diagnostic devices market which is expected to reach a value of USD 5.3 billion by the year 2025. Medical professionals who practice dermatology in clinics, established equipment manufacturers, and product distributors are the main stakeholders of this market. The proposed system will be ultimately integrated in a single framework, resulting in a compact (handheld) and real-time imaging device at very low manufacturing costs. By diagnosing tumors at an early stage, the proposed device will save tremendous amounts of time, effort, and patient discomfort and provide significant cost reductions for both the individual patient and the nation?s healthcare system.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project investigates potential commercial markets for a new skin cancer imaging device developed based on the \"Synthetic Ultra-Wideband Millimeter-wave Imaging\" approach. In this approach, an ultra-wide imaging bandwidth in the millimeter-wave regime that cannot be realized by any conventional design method is assembled synthetically, resulting in significant improvements in the resolution of the acquired images. This approach is expected to enable the millimeter-wave imaging technology to be applied to skin imaging and skin cancer detection. The proposed technology has proven to be effective through proof-of-concept experiments. Firstly, statistically significant contrasts have been observed between the millimeter-wave dielectric properties of normal skin and two of the most common types of skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. These results verify the potential of the proposed system to provide histopathological-contrast-based evaluations of skin lesions. Furthermore, the feasibility of employing the proposed imaging method for skin cancer detection has been confirmed using realistic skin-mimicking phantoms containing spherical tumor models. The final developed product will be a hand-held, point-of-care millimeter-wave imaging device which provides significantly higher image resolutions compared to the state-of-the-art technology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The imager is based on the millimeter-wave imaging technology and employs a new imaging technique which improves millimeter-wave image resolutions. The improvement in image resolutions enables the millimeter-wave technology to be applied to tissue diagnostics, and a prime candidate in this regard is the early-stage detection of skin cancer. To evaluate the potential product-market fit around this technology, the I-Corps team members, consisting of the Entrepreneurial Lead, the Technical Lead (PI), and the Industry Mentor engaged in the following activities:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Participated in a 7-week long I-Corps cohort in New York City metro area in Summer 2018. During the cohort which consisted of an in-person kick-off workshop and a weekly online curriculum, the team learned the essentials of a business model and customer development process. For instance, the team learned how value propositions are different from the features of the technology.</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conducted over 100 interviews with potential customers and partners including dermatologists, medical centers, and medical imaging companies from 43 different cities in the United States to better understand the market need, reimbursement factors, and possible licensees of the device.</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attended the 2018 American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Summer meeting in Chicago, where over 2000 dermatologist and over 200 dermatology device companies from all around the world were present. During this meeting, in addition to several face-to-face interviews, the team joined dermatologists in a few hands-on training workshops to better understand the challenges of the current state of skin cancer detection and management.</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attended the 2019 annual meeting of New Jersey life sciences and healthcare industry sponsored by the New Jersey Affiliate of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BioNJ). In this event where over 400 research-based life sciences companies and stakeholders were present, the team interviewed several biotechnology professionals and potential partners with substantial experience in the life sciences industry.</p>\n<p>The main outcome of the interviews was that it is crucial for a skin cancer detection tool to reduce the number of false-positive detections. Currently, dermatologists perform biopsies for most suspicious lesions, resulting in a large number of unnecessary biopsies (almost 2 out of 3 skin biopsy procedures performed in the United States are unnecessary as the lesions turn out to be benign).</p>\n<p>As another result of the customer discovery process, a business model was developed which included customer segments, value propositions, key activities, key resources, key partners, channels, and revenue streams (Image 1). Dermatologic surgeons and dermatologists who practice skin cancer detection were identified as early-adopter and mainstream customers, respectively (the customer workflow is shown in Image 2). The target market was determined as the global dermatology diagnostic devices market which is expected to reach a value of USD 5.3 billion by 2025 (Image 3). The stakeholders of this market comprise medical imaging equipment manufacturers (e.g. Siemens Healthineers, Ambra Health, GE Healthcare, IBM Watson Health, and Philips Healthcare), product distributors, and insurance companies.</p>\n<p>The proposed imaging tool will save procedure time for dermatologic surgeons (30 minutes of time is expected to be saved on average for each procedure). Furthermore, the ability of the device to differentiate between benign and cancerous tissues will result in a significant decrease in the number of unnecessary biopsies, saving time for dermatologists (10 minutes of time is expected to be saved on average for each patient).</p>\n<p>Finally, the revenue model was determined as a recurring model, i.e. it will include a one-time upfront fee for the hardware purchase and an annual subscription fee for the software.
