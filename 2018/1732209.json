 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grnat seeks funds to renew support for research and operation of Jicamarca Radio Observatory (JRO) between January 1 2018 to December 31, 2022. JRO is situated on the magnetic equator, a prime location for studying the ionosphere from plasma backscatter. The observatory's main asset is a 50 MHz VHF radar system with an antenna consisting of 18,432 cross-polarized half-wavelength dipoles. The antenna system can be subdivided, steered, and attached to up to four transmitters and sixteen receivers. JRO's exceptional versatility has defined the facility as a testbed of radio science innovation and discovery.\r\n\r\nThe radar measures electron  density, electron and ion temperature, ion composition and vertical and zonal electric fields in the equatorial ionosphere. JRO also measuring echoes from equatorial irregularities generated in the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, equatorial electrojet, E and F regions. In accordance with guidelines provided by a number of geospace community documents, the research activities will focus on topside ionosphere, high-altitude scattering, vertical (perpendicular to B) measurements, aperature-synthesis imaging, mesosphere-lower thermosphere winds, and space weather forecasting. JRO will continue its tradition as a center of training and education for an international community of physics and engineering students.",
