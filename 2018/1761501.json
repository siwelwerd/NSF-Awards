 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increasing the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the nation's Indigenous students is a major goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities program. The \"2017 Stone Child College Targeted STEM Infusion Project\" directly addresses these goals through the development of an instructional model that incorporates new ethnobotany curriculum materials and research experiences across the STEM disciplines at Stone Child College (SCC). This work will expand STEM offerings, improve the academic environment for Native students, and encourage them to pursue challenging and rewarding STEM degrees and careers, thus leading to a more diverse national workforce and strengthening our country's prosperity and security. The lessons learned about the efficacy of the project in supporting Native students' STEM outcomes will contribute to our understanding of best practices for attracting and preparing underrepresented students in STEM as the next generation of STEM professionals.\r\n\r\nThe \"2017 Stone Child College Targeted STEM Infusion Project\" at Stone Child College will develop an ethnobotany course and student research experiences that address core botany concepts and traditional plant knowledge of the Chippewa-Cree as a means to engage Native students in STEM studies. The project will update and enhance a forty-year-old book on Chippewa-Cree ethnobotany and develop a video to complement the book for use in the course, which will be offered across the STEM disciplinary degrees at SCC. The project will also develop and test a student cohort model that employs near-peer mentoring of high school students by college undergraduates as they complete the course and engage in culturally relevant ethnobotany research. Cultural experts from the tribal community will collaborate with college STEM faculty members in the design and delivery of the course and research experiences. The project's evaluation will collect evidence of the efficacy of the project in supporting improved STEM outcomes for Native students. Knowledge generated will be disseminated in publications and presentations and will contribute to the knowledge base on means for increasing the representation of Native people in STEM degrees and careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSCC\u2019s Targeted STEM Infusion Program (TSIP), TSIP program year 7/1/20-6/30/21 was different than any other year.  As this was during the COVID-19 pandemic.  SCC moved to online learning in March of 2020; all programs also went online including the SCC TSIP program.  SCC gave all program participants Ipads so that they could use them to participate, the classes and contacts was all done through Microsoft Teams for Summer 2020 and Fall 2020.  During this program year the challenge was recruitment and retention.  The Rocky Boy\u2019s Community was shut down for 2 weeks at a time during this time period.\n\n \n\nEven with the pandemic, the SCC TSIP program was able to maintain their students at both local high schools, Rocky Boy and Box Elder and of course the SCC students.  Students continued to learn the Cree language, we also were able to take students out to gather pictures of the plants in May and June of 2021.  The travel funding was moved into consultants, SCC TSIP worked closely with Native Teaching Aids, www.nativeteachingaids.com.  Because of the pandemic travel was not possible, Native Teaching Aids took the vides and pictures of the native plants to the Chippewa-Cree people and developed an App for the plants, a game with the native plants, came on campus and showed the TSIP participants how to take photographs so when they submit them they are of good quality.  SCC TSIP had purchased a camera and video camera, which was used throughout the project period to document the program activities.  SCC and Native Teaching Aids allowed the TSIP participants to use their cameras so that all students could have the opportunity to use professional equipment while also gathering the pictures so that the development of the Plants of the Rocky Boy\u2019s Reservation Book can be completed with updated plants and those pictures were found within the Rocky Boy\u2019s Reservation. \n\nThe travel for this period did not occur due to the pandemic.  Students were kept busy with other projects, presentations were given to students by local elders as to the importance of the native plants along with their use for healing.  This is all part of the holistic approach that Chippewa-Cree people have used for years, often times medicine given from the clinic or hospitals do not work for our people.  One example of the use of native plants was used for the COVID pandemic.  Bearroot, peppermint mixtures were used by SCC students, staff and faculty to help to overcome COVID.  Bearroot is not Native to the Rocky Boy\u2019s Community, but is Native to the Flathead Reservation.  Although it is found on another reservation, many community members of Rocky Boy go and pick them and bring them back for use.  Bearroot tea has helped so many community members overcome their COVID illness.  It really would have been nice to have taken the SCC TSIP participants to Salish Kootenai College on the Flathead Reservation so that they could pick their own Bearroot, however participants were given the location of the root and the many uses for it for Chippewa Cree people.\n\nThis pandemic proved many things, that SCC TSIP program staff and participants are resilient, and can overcome any obstacle that may get in their way; especially with the transition to on-line learning and the staff and students that kept engaged with the program activities.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Cory Sangrey-Billy"
