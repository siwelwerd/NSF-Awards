 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research project aims to understand the chemical mechanisms during pyrolysis of waste oils, as well as mixed waste oil and plastics streams, for the production of fuels. The interaction between competing mechanisms and the development of a continuous process for fuels production from the pyrolysis of waste oil, grease and plastics will be studied with the objective of identifying operating conditions maximizing the production of high-value products. The project will improve the access of undergraduate students from underrepresented minority groups to research and facilitate international collaborations on environmental sustainability.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research is motivated by the need to better understand the mechanism of waste oil pyrolysis and the effects of the temperature profiles on the product distribution. The focus will be on studying the pyrolysis of orange grease extracted from municipal waste to convert it into fuel. The development of brown and orange greases as a fuel source can have a significant effect on eliminating them from municipal waste streams. That benefit will be multiplied by adding waste plastics as a feedstock and studying the pyrolysis of streams consisting of mixed waste oil and plastics as a source of petrochemicals and fuels. The work can be extended to other sources of waste oil, plastics, rubber, and other materials that currently are buried in landfills or pollute the environment. The fundamental knowledge on chemical reaction mechanisms will enable the development of a pilot plant by selecting the best reactor types and separation processes without excessive trial and error. The proposed project will contribute to the establishment of an energy track in the Environmental Science program at CUNY-Medgar Evers College, enable international cooperation, and help prepare students to enter the workforce or start new businesses. The project will offer opportunities for students to be involved in research and increase the retention rates of minority students in a STEM field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBrown grease, also called sewer grease, is a greasy byproduct of the sewage treatment process.  Brown grease may collect in sewer lines as grease bergs, or may float to the top in the early stages of sewage treatment.  During this and previous awards, we have shown that brown grease can be pyrolyzed (treated with heat with little or no air) to form a series of hydrocarbons in the boiling range of diesel fuel, home heating oil, kerosene, and gas oil.  The primary products of this process are alkanes mixed with some alkenes, as well as residual water, unreacted or partially reacted fatty acids, long chain hydrocarbon waxes, and ketones.  Traces of alcohols, aldehydes, and other products may also be formed.   Water is easily removed, but fatty acids can cause corrosion problems when burned in an engine.  Waxes and ketones will burn, but not efficiently in a diesel engine due to their low volatility.  Instead, they may precipitate as solids in the fuel system and cause blockages.\n\nThe reaction mechanisms of hydrocarbon formation were examined, and consist primarily of known reactions for chain cleavage, as well as for hydrocarbon degradation.  Ketones are formed by a known but obscure reaction in which fatty acids form a ketene intermediate, which reacts with another fatty acid to form the ketone byproduct.\n\nWhen the process is carried out at atmospheric pressure, components of the mixture and some partially reacted compounds can distill out of the reaction vessel, increasing byproduct formation.  That problem was greatly reduced by running the reaction in a pressure vessel, where the entire contents would reach the optimum reaction temerature of 375 to 400 degrees C. \n\nThe brown grease pyrolysis reaction was also performed in the presence of a zeolyte catqlyst, but the product distribution was nearly the same as with the uncatalyzed reaction, with no advantage being found for the catalyst. \n\nWaste material from palm oil production also consists largely of fatty acides.  Similar conditions were employed to pyrolyze this palm oil waste.  A series of hydrocarbons were formed, but with a different molar mass distribution from the brown grease products.\n\nThe study of brown grease pyrolysis is essentially complete.  The remaining problem is one of engineering, to set up a plant to produce and separate the products on an industrial scale.\n\nThis project included collaborations with research groups in Malaysia and Vietnam.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/30/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lawrence M Pratt"
