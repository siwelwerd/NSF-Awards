 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gene regulation affects when, where, and how much a gene is expressed in an organism. This doctoral dissertation project will study changes in DNA methylation (a chemical mark on DNA that influences gene expression levels) in different baboon species, to better understand how changes in DNA methylation affect gene expression, how DNA methylation has diverged between species, and the role of natural selection in this process. Differences in how particular genes are expressed are thought to be important in explaining many differences among primate species, including some traits that are unique to the human lineage. Novel data on gene regulation and expression can therefore help to advance knowledge about the development of our own species. The project will support student training and mentoring at the K-12, undergraduate, and graduate levels, and the development and dissemination of interdisciplinary approaches using genomic methods that can be applied to a number of other fields of study.\r\n\r\nThis project will investigate the effects of genetic ancestry on DNA methylation by leveraging genetic admixture in 150 adult baboons from a wild baboon population in Kenya. Admixed individuals (baboons with ancestry from two distinct but closely related taxa) provide the opportunity to test how genetic variation from different ancestries influences DNA methylation when placed in a common environment. Furthermore, because the study population has been affected by both recent and historical admixture events, it can be used to test hypotheses about the legacy of archaic hominin admixture with modern humans. Finally, this project will ask whether between-species differences in DNA methylation translate to changes in gene expression, testing an important assumption of models that link DNA methylation to trait variation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This hypothesis has been supported by comparisons between distantly related primates, but may also contribute to differences between closely related groups, such as humans and our extinct close relatives, the Neanderthals. However, comparisons involving humans are limited because Neanderthals and other archaic hominins disappeared tens of thousands of years ago. To investigate how gene regulation diverges between closely related primates, we therefore examined the evolution of DNA methylation (a chemical mark that can affect gene activity) and gene expression levels in wild baboons?another highly social, large-bodied primate, where closely related yellow baboons (<em>Papio cynocephalus</em>) and anubis baboons (<em>P. anubis</em>) still intermix to form hybrids.</p>\n<p>Specifically, we characterized yellow versus anubis baboon ancestry genome-wide for hundreds of baboons in a Kenyan hybrid zone, in conjunction with DNA methylation and gene expression data for a large subset of the same individuals.

We also found that genetic differences between species, which are mostly due to differences in the frequencies of genetic variants, can be used to predict differences in gene expression and DNA methylation differences between those species?thus demonstrating that differences in gene regulation are the product of genetic evolution. Finally, we found that natural selection against introgressed ancestry has been stronger in regions of the genome where gene expression differs most between yellow and anubis baboons. Our findings support hypotheses about natural selection against gene regulatory variants after archaic hominin-human interbreeding. Additionally, because hybrid baboons often successfully survive and reproduce, they show that selection against hybridization can be detected at the genetic level, even if it is not obvious from field observations.
