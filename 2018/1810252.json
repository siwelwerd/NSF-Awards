 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part A:\r\nThis project aims to develop tunable metamaterials driven by integrated microelectromechanical system (MEMS) actuators for dynamic control of terahertz and infrared light. Photonic metamaterials have proven to be a powerful tool to manipulate light propagation. However, there is an existing challenge concerning the development of random access metamaterials with on-demand effective properties. In order to overcome this grand challenge, MEMS actuators will be integrated with metamaterial unit cells, enabling on-demand light manipulation. The physics of phase control, design of unit cells, micro-/nanofabrication, and system integration schemes will be investigated to realize metamaterial devices that can manipulate the wavefront of terahertz and infrared light as desired, enabling, for example, dynamic beam steering and tunable focusing. The metamaterial devices that will be developed are multifunctional, compact, and dynamically tunable, offering significant potential in comparison to conventional optical devices. The success of this project will boost the development of opto-electronic systems in areas such as spectroscopy, high-resolution imaging, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR), which are widely used in healthcare and national security and defense. This project provides a platform to educate young researchers, including women and underrepresented minorities, fostering their passion in fundamental optics and photonics research and applied engineering technologies.\r\n\r\nPart B:\r\nMetamaterials have revolutionized electromagnetism during the past decade resulting in myriad new phenomena including cloaking, negative refractive index, and tunable electromagnetic composites. The goal of this project is to develop dynamically reconfigurable metamaterials to manipulate the wavefront of terahertz and infrared light, which is enabled by integrating MEMS actuators in metamaterial unit cells. For efficient wavefront manipulation, the key is to achieve full-span phase coverage with constant amplitude in the response of metamaterial unit cells. However, the amplitude and phase response of the majority of metamaterial designs are bounded, making it challenging to achieve high-efficiency wavefront manipulation. In the proposed work, the coupling effect between the metamaterial layer and a ground plane or two layers of metamaterials will be studied to design structures that can modulate the phase response with little effect on the amplitude response, i.e. decoupling amplitude and phase modulation. Fabrication processes will be developed to construct metamaterial devices based on both surface and bulk micro-/nanomachining techniques. The integration of metamaterial unit cells and MEMS actuators will be investigated and optimized to make each unit cell accessible individually by employing advanced MEMS integration and packaging techniques including three-dimensional wire routing, through silicon vias (TSVs) and flip chip bonding. Finally, tunable metamaterial devices exhibiting multifunctionality will be demonstrated to manipulate terahertz and infrared light. This includes dynamic beam steering and focusing, which cannot be achieved with state-of-the-art techniques, for a variety of applications, such as spectroscopy, imaging, and LiDAR.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

By integrating advanced materials and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), we created compact, tunable, and efficient devices with applications in sensing, communication, and advanced optics. Below, we highlight key accomplishments.</p>\r\n<p>Tunable Toroidal Response in Reconfigurable Terahertz Metamaterials: The toroidal electromagnetic response, distinct from traditional electric and magnetic multipoles, is an exciting phenomenon with potential for advanced sensing and communication. We designed a reconfigurable terahertz metamaterial that integrates artificial toroidal metamolecules and MEMS-driven cantilever structures. By thermally actuating these cantilevers, we precisely controlled their bending angle, enhancing the toroidal dipole intensity by up to five orders of magnitude out-of-plane and nearly an order of magnitude overall. These tunable properties were verified with terahertz time-domain spectroscopy and advanced simulations. Our work demonstrates a new level of control over toroidal moments, paving the way for next-generation functional devices.</p>\r\n<p>Broadband Terahertz Silicon Membrane Metasurface Absorber: Metasurface absorbers are critical for applications like sensors, photovoltaic cells, and coatings. We engineered a silicon-based metasurface featuring periodic elliptical holes, achieving more than 90% absorption over a broad 500 GHz frequency range at normal incidence. This was confirmed both theoretically and experimentally. The broadband absorption comes from the electric and magnetic dipole resonances, as explained by effective medium theory. Additionally, we showed that photoexcitation allows tuning of absorption properties. This CMOS-compatible, ultra-thin metasurface offers a compact, efficient platform for terahertz devices such as modulators, switches, and detectors.</p>\r\n<p>Enhanced Modulation with Vanadium Dioxide Metamaterials at Terahertz Frequencies: Dynamic materials like vanadium dioxide (VO&#8322;) enable tunable devices. We integrated VO&#8322; with metamaterials to develop a structure that enhances terahertz transmission modulation. A complementary split-ring resonator array on a VO&#8322; substrate achieved a 62% increase in modulation amplitude at 0.47 THz during the insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) at around 340 K. The significant redshift in resonant frequency during phase coexistence could not be explained by effective medium theories, but a Drude model incorporating increased effective permittivity aligned with our observations. This integration of metamaterials with quantum materials unlocks new functionalities for tunable photonic devices.</p>\r\n<p>Tunable Bound States in the Continuum in Reconfigurable Terahertz Metamaterials: Bound states in the continuum (BIC) are non-radiative states embedded in radiative spectra, ideal for applications like lasers, sensors, and filters. We developed a MEMS-driven metamaterial capable of dynamically tuning BIC states. By thermally actuating cantilever structures, we adjusted the bending angle to transition between quasi-BIC and true BIC states. This tuning allowed us to modify the device's electromagnetic response, such as blueshifting the resonant frequency of the LC mode while maintaining the dipole mode. Our work highlights bi-layer cantilever-based structures as promising platforms for tunable BIC metamaterials, enabling applications in nonlinear optics and terahertz light-matter interactions.</p>\r\n<p>All-Silicon Active BIC Terahertz Metamaterials: Metal-based metamaterials often suffer from energy losses due to ohmic losses, especially at terahertz frequencies. We addressed this challenge by developing all-silicon metamaterials that leverage BIC states for high-quality-factor optoelectronic phenomena. By introducing structural symmetry breaking and varying the incident angle, we achieved quasi-BIC states, confirmed through coupled mode theory and terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. Additionally, we demonstrated optical tuning of the quasi-BIC response using low-fluence 1.5 eV optical pulses. These findings highlight all-silicon metamaterials as promising platforms for terahertz sensing and high-speed communication.</p>\r\n<p>On-demand terahertz surface wave generation with microelectromechanical-system-based metasurface: Metasurfaces have emerged as powerful tools for controlling the phase, amplitude, and polarization of electromagnetic waves. We demonstrated dynamic switching between surface wave (SW) and plane wave (PW) modes at terahertz frequencies using a MEMS-based metasurface. This device consists of micro-cantilever structures, which can be individually actuated to achieve full 2&pi; phase control. Full-wave electromagnetic simulations, validated by terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, show that the device achieves a conversion efficiency of nearly 60% and a working bandwidth of about 100 GHz. This reconfigurable metasurface holds great potential for applications in beam steering, spatial light modulation, dynamic focusing, and beam combining, all essential for future \"beyond 5G\" communication systems.</p>\r\n<p>Conclusion: Our research demonstrates the transformative potential of combining metamaterials with MEMS technology. These devices offer precise control over electromagnetic waves, enabling breakthroughs in sensing, communication, and photonic applications. From tunable toroidal responses to broadband absorbers and dynamic surface wave modulation, our findings pave the way for next-generation technologies in a wide range of industries. Compact and reconfigurable, these devices represent a significant step forward in terahertz photonics, driving innovation across fields such as telecommunications, healthcare, and advanced materials. The project has offered graduate students valuable opportunities to engage in both fundamental and applied research, mentor junior team members, and publish their findings in prestigious journals. Additionally, undergraduate students have actively contributed, gaining hands-on experience and inspiration through their involvement in the design, fabrication, and testing of micro-electromechanical systems integrated with metamaterials at terahertz frequencies.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/31/2024<br>\nModified by: Xin&nbsp;Zhang</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1810252/1810252_10551386_1735688721384_NSF_ECCS_1810252_Images_Page_2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1810252/1810252_10551386_1735688721384_NSF_ECCS_1810252_Images_Page_2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cantilever-based Reconfigurable Metamaterials\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1810252/1810252_10551386_1735688721384_NSF_ECCS_1810252_Images_Page_2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cantilever-based Reconfigurable Metamaterials\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A MEMS-based metasurface combining metamaterials with cantilever structures generates surface waves by adjusting the gap under applied voltages.
