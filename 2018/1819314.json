 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the creation of a control system that enables the next generation of high capacity lithium metal batteries to replace current lithium ion battery technology. The global lithium-ion battery market is expected to grow to $67.70 billion USD by end of 2022 from $31.17 billion USD in 2016. However, lithium ion batteries cannot store sufficient energy required by the applications contributing most to that growth (i.e., electric vehicles) as demonstrated by the slow adoption within the largest battery powered product markets today.  Lithium metal batteries were conceived decades ago and are capable of storing three times the energy of lithium ion batteries.  Yet inherent chemical instability renders them extremely dangerous to recharge, preventing their use.  This project is the next phase of work to develop a system that monitors and maintains the stability of lithium metal batteries during charging, enabling safe and reliable use by consumers, businesses, and government.  The complete solution will consist of licensable hardware and software which can be tailored to specific battery powered applications, integrating with battery cells or charging systems for consumer electronics, long range electric vehicles, medical devices, and grid storage systems.  \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project funds the continued development of a new paradigm in battery healing: maintaining battery electrode health from the outside in. The system uses software and electronics that control surface issues on battery electrodes which otherwise cause permanent loss of capacity and life during normal use.  As an important part of the overall solution being developed, the key technical hurdles addressed by this proposed SBIR project are focused on real-time electrode surface sensing and mapping capabilities and control strategies to suppress dendrites, as well as advanced characterization methods to monitor and share electrode health information with other components to ensure safety, reliability and durability of the overall energy storage system. The R&D plan will include development of live mapping of electrochemically active surfaces, control software to develop an algorithm and feedback system, and machine learning to improve sensing-mapping-control strategies.  The most promising set of solutions will be demonstrated and validated in an operando visualization test cell that allows observation of the formation and suppression of dendrites on lithium metal electrodes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Replacement of graphite with pure lithium as lithium metal anodes is urgently needed for batteries to continue enabling compelling products while meeting multiple market-driven requirements of &lt;$100/kWh, 400-mile driving ranges and &lt;10 minute charging times.  \n\nThe primary obstacle to achieving these objectives is the immediate formation of mossy and needle-like roughness on the anode, frequently in the form of dendritic structures, during charging cycles. Dendrite growth on the lithium metal anode leads to erratic voltage and rapid failure in ten or fewer charging cycles as the operating voltage decreases, shorting occurs and heat builds up with the potential for dangerous outcomes.  Though currently lithium metal batteries are significantly more prone to failure than lithium ion batteries, their enablement would result in up to 10x increase in energy density for electronics, transportation and grid storage.  This requires an effective approach to stabilizing the anode surface.\n\nAlligant Scientific has developed a prototype of the primary Phase 1 deliverable: Software and hardware for sensing the internal state of a battery and adaptively controlling the anode condition during charging.  Initial focus was on control of dendrite growth across zinc anodes as a pre-step to working with lithium.  Similar to lithium, rechargeable zinc metal batteries are hindered by the growth of dendrites.  Zinc is less expensive than lithium and its ease of use allowed high-throughput experimentation and the rapid development of Alligant's solution.

After 8 hours of charging activity, the sample treated with Alligant's process remains free of large, mossy dendrites and maintains a smooth surface roughness distribution.  Analysis from the University of Michigan (Phase 1 sub-awardee) provides a closer look at the surface structure as well as validation of the transferability of the process.  Figure 3 uses optical and scanning electron microscopy to compare plating of zinc onto copper with and without Alligant's treatment.  The treated sample remains free of rough growths with the potential to propagate as dendrites or other forms of surface roughness detrimental to battery performance.\n\nWork performed during Phase 1 by Alligant and the Dasgupta Group at the University of Michigan has successfully confirmed the capability of Alligant's technology to suppress anode surface roughness by eliminating 90% of the peaks found on the non-Alligant samples, including dendrites, as well as eliminating &gt;85% of unplated/nonuniformly plated space on the anode surface.
