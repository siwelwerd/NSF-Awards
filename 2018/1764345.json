 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Trevor Hayton of the University of California Santa Barbara is developing new methods for the synthesis of double and triple bonds (\"M=E\" bonds) between certain metals and nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms. These new bonds are highly reactive and, consequently, they undergo unprecedented reaction chemistry with industrially useful chemicals, such as those that bear carbon-carbon double and triple bonds, nitric oxide, and carbon monoxide. However, because these molecules and bonds are so reactive, scientists do not fully understand how to make them selectively without making a large number of unwanted side products. In this project, Dr. Hayton is developing new chemical strategies to limit side reactions and form only the desired M=E bonds. With this high level of control, the reactivity of these bonds can be explored in a systematic way, opening the door to new catalytic transformations. Dr. Hayton is actively engaged in the mentoring of women and under-represented groups via the SoCal Organometallics (SCOM) meeting. By organizing and participating in this annual meeting, Dr. Hayton provides students with presentation and networking opportunities. Industry involvement at SoCal Organometallics also provides these students with access to potential employers.\r\n\r\nDr. Hayton is developing the \"Reductive Deprotection\" methodology for the synthesis of late metal-ligand multiple bonds, such as terminal sulfido complexes of copper and zinc, terminal oxo complexes of nickel, and terminal nitrido complexes of group 10 metals. Reductive deprotection involves the reductive removal of a protecting group from a chalcogen or pnictogen atom, unmasking a latent M=E bond. The target complexes allow them to quantify the extent of pi-bonding within the M=E linkage as they traverse the periodic table from Fe to Zn, giving chemists a better understanding of the \"oxo wall\" concept. Additionally, reactivity studies with alkenes, alkynes, NO, and CO reveal unprecedented small molecule transformations, opening the door to new catalytic reactivity with these industrially relevant substrates. This research provides excellent training to undergraduate and graduate students in the synthesis and characterization of air sensitive metal complexes, preparing them for careers in academia, industry, or the national laboratory system.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe central goal of this project was to develop new methodologies for the generation of metal ligand multiple bonds, in particular metal-sulfur multiple bonds.  Complexes with metal-ligand multiple bonds have broad utility in small molecule activation and catalysis and are also found throughout biology.  By exploring their synthesis and reactivity we hope to discover new modes of small molecule activation and help answer key questions about important biological processes, such as denitrification.  A secondary goal was to develop new methodologies for the generation of sulfide-supported, transition metal nanoclusters.  Unlike traditional nanoparticles, nanoclusters are mono-disperse and feature a well-defined arrangement of their capping ligands.  This high level of chemical precision should permit their optimization for a variety of applications, including quantum computing.  However, this application first requires the synthesis of paramagnetic nanoclusters, which are still incredibly rare.\n\nOne significant research accomplishment from this project was the isolation of the first terminal zinc sulfide.  The Zn-S bond in this complex was found to be exceptionally reactive, which calculations show is due to its low bond order as predicted by the \"oxo wall\" hypothesis.  Accordingly, it was found to react with both N2O and PhCCH, demonstrating its extreme Br?nsted and Lewis basicity.  A second significant research accomplishment was the synthesis and structural characterization of two new nickel sulfide nanoclusters, Ni23 and Ni30. The latter is especially remarkable as it represents the largest paramagnetic nickel nanocluster yet isolated.  Our work provides unprecedented detail into their electronic structures, information that will be invaluable for their deployment in cutting-edge technologies. \n\nFinally, five graduate students participated in this project.   They were trained in the synthesis and characterization of organometallic complexes and clusters.  Additionally, they participated in the writing and editing of manuscripts and in the presentation of the research results at a variety of venues.  This training will allow them to make important contributions to chemistry research and teaching in the years to come.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/04/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Trevor Hayton"
