 "awd_abstract_narration": "A workshop will be held in Washington, DC on December 7-8, 2017 to plan for the creation of a Data Science Corps. The Data Science Corps will help build the capacity of organizations at the local, state, national and international levels to utilize data to advance science and to help solve social problems. The Data Science Corps would offer practical experiences and teaching opportunities to U.S. data scientists and data science students, who would serve as volunteers working on data science projects in a variety of venues including, academia, industry, government, and various urban and rural communities. \r\n\r\nThe workshop will bring together a wide variety of stakeholders to discuss the vision and implementation of such a Data Science Corps. It will provide the opportunity to define the organizational and implementation details of the Data Science Corps, and will elaborate upon how the initiative can best serve the volunteers as well as the program beneficiaries. The workshop will include presentations by speakers representing a variety of stakeholders, and will include discussions sessions to help develop ideas for establishment of the program.\r\n\r\nVia the Data Science Corps, volunteers--including data science professionals as well as data science students--will be able to offer assistance to real world data science problems, and will provide data science training to users across a wide variety of sectors. By providing assistance to projects in academia, industry, government in communities at the local, state and national levels, Data Science Corps volunteers would gain practical experience on real world data science problems, as well as gain experience as data science teachers and trainers.\r\n\r\nThe Data Science Corps program can help enhance existing internship programs at academic institutions by providing a data science theme and focus. The Data Science Corps would complement existing NSF programs, including the Big Data Regional Innovation Hubs, Spokes, and Smart and Connected Communities.\r\n\r\nSuch a program will help with improved data collection and data analysis across all applications areas, whether in urban or rural communities, and at the local, state, national and international levels. As a result, these communities will have greater capacity to implement data-driven solutions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "The demand for data science skills has increased as organizations continue to identify new ways to use data science and large-scale data to address important social challenges.\nAt the same time, the supply of data science expertise often goes untapped.  Faculty and researchers are eager to work on new projects.  Volunteers from the private and non-profit sectors seek meaningful applications of their skills and efforts.

What kinds of resources would be necessary and who would provide them?\nSix key themes emerged from the discussions.  They were that the Data Science Corps should 1) be centered on a culture of service 2) focus on underserved communities 3) commit to ethical use of data and volunteers 4) rely on stakeholder engagement 5) guarantee transparency and 6) seek to expand data literacy. \nA full report entitled ?The Data Science Corps: Making a Difference by Connecting Experts to Projects? contains detailed summaries of the discussions and findings.
