 "awd_abstract_narration": "Snowmelt from mountainous regions in the western US is a vital source of water for agriculture, industry, cities, and natural ecosystems in the dry inter-mountain basins. The transformation of snowmelt into streamflow in mountainous regions is influenced by the interplay between climate, vegetation, and geology. The role of the subsurface in transporting water from the point of infiltration to the stream is currently poorly understood. This study uses state-of-the-art instruments to image the subsurface of six Rocky Mountain hillslopes with different geologies. In addition, computer simulation models are used to calculate subsurface water flow and storage dynamics and to predict streamflow. An important goal is to find predictable relationships between geology and flow regime. The resulting insights are critical for understanding the impact of current and future climate and land use scenarios on the magnitude and timing of streamflow. Such insights will facilitate better land and water management by agencies, companies, and individuals. Two graduate students and three undergraduate students will gain experience with a broad range of geological and hydrological measurement and computer simulation techniques as part of the project. In addition, a traveling museum exhibit will be constructed in collaboration with the University of Wyoming Geological museum to engage residents and visitors of the Rocky Mountain region in geological and hydrological research.    \r\n\r\nThe study combines state-of-the-art geophysical and hydrological measurement and modeling techniques to examine subsurface water flow and storage in hillslopes with three different geologies. The following research questions will be answered: Q1. How different or similar are the weathering zones of the six Rocky Mountain hillslopes selected for this study that represent old granitic surfaces, young volcanic surfaces, and recent glacial deposits over Precambrian rock?, Q2. To what level of detail can subsurface hydraulic properties and flow regimes be determined for the six Rocky Mountain hillslopes?, and Q3. What is the impact of hillslope subsurface model complexity on streamflow and water balance predictions at the watershed scale?  Three of the hillslopes are in Wyoming and are currently being measured by the two investigators. The other three hillslopes are proposed in Critical Zone Observatories in Idaho (2) and New Mexico (1). The six hillslopes are paired so that each of the three geologies are represented by two hillslopes. Measurements will consist of shallow seismic refraction to determine subsurface porosity structure, time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography to determine vadose zone water dynamics, and hydrological monitoring to assess water inputs and hillslope hydrologic response. Numerical models will be combined with parameter estimation algorithms to estimate subsurface hydraulic parameters. Integrated watershed modeling will be used to investigate the effect of hillslope model complexity on streamflow and water balance predictions. The study focusses on subsurface hydrological processes and streamflow generation but also contributes to a better understanding of hillslope weathering processes and hillslope ecological functioning.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Snowmelt from the Rocky Mountains is an important water source for agriculture, population centers, industry, and wetland ecosystems. The role of the subsurface in transforming spring snowmelt and summer rainfall into streamflow is poorly understood. The shallow and heterogeneous mountain soils and underlying (weathered) rock are difficult to sample, and the installation of hydrological monitoring equipment is labor intensive.</p>\n<p>This project applied hydro-geophysical methods to image the subsurface and estimate structure, properties, and water flow dynamics using inversion techniques. Inversion can be understood as an iterative process wherein different subsurface configurations are tested for their ability to explain the geophysical and hydrological observations. This general approach was applied to seven mountain hillslopes, covering three different geologies (old granitic surfaces, young volcanic surfaces, and glacially altered surfaces), using shallow seismic refraction (SR) and time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) data. In addition, for one of the study sites (in the Owyhee Mountains, ID), surface and airborne electromagnetic induction (EMI) data were used to determine subsurface properties in a three-dimensional hydrologic model to predict streamflow.</p>\n<p>Relatively intact bedrock was detected within 5 m from the surface at hillslopes in the Laramie Range, WY (granitic), the Owyhee Mountains, ID (volcanic), and the Snowy Range, WY (glacially altered). Two hillslopes had only soil-like material within 5 m from the surface, namely in the Jemez Mountains, NM (volcanic) and the Bighorn Mountains, WY (glacially altered). Not surprisingly, no simple relationship between geological origin and subsurface make-up was found, given differences in past geological events, recent morphological processes, and local climate conditions.</p>\n<p>Several inversion techniques were tested on selected sites using different geophysical and hydrological data sets. One study used time-lapse ERT, soil water content, and groundwater level data to estimate the subsurface hydraulic properties for two glacially altered hillslopes by assuming simple two-layer profiles. Using only groundwater level data to inform the inversion yielded better hillslope water storage and outflow predictions than when using only soil water content data. Using only time-lapse ERT resulted in reasonable outflow predictions but relatively poor hillslope water storage predictions with the two-layer structure being too simple to replicate the ERT observations.</p>\n<p>A new hydro-geophysical inversion code was developed for the research project to allow for the estimation of fully distributed subsurface hydraulic properties using shallow SR or time-lapse ERT data, or a combination of these.

The hydraulic properties of the different materials were obtained through inversion using different combinations of EMI, soil water content, groundwater level, and streamflow data. Interestingly, hydrologic model calibration with EMI and streamflow data gave reasonable predictions of streamflow and intra-headwater water storage dynamics, suggesting that surface and/or airborne EMI surveys may be an alternative to labor intensive and costly soil water content sensor and groundwater well installations. Future studies that do not rely on well core data to determine stratigraphy are needed to confirm the potential of EMI data in supplementing streamflow data for hydrologic model calibration.</p>\n<p>Overall, this research project showed that subsurface configuration and its role in routing water to streams in mountainous regions is difficult to predict from information on geology alone.

Geophysical measurements provide additional information to models and have a different footprint than hydrological data. Having the ability to quantify subsurface structure, water storage dynamics, and outflow in a relatively cost-effective manner is important to improve our understanding of snow-dominated mountain ecosystems and their role in streamflow generation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 09/05/2024<br>\nModified by: Thijs&nbsp;J&nbsp;Keleners</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1818550/1818550_10552140_1725576751291_3_coupled_inversion_seismic_WY--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1818550/1818550_10552140_1725576751291_3_coupled_inversion_seismic_WY--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Optimized porosity distribution\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1818550/1818550_10552140_1725576751291_3_coupled_inversion_seismic_WY--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Optimized porosity distribution\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Optimized porosity distribution for the Snowy Range site in Wyoming.
