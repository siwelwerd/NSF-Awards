 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Description\r\n\r\nBy eroding and depositing sediment, river systems record past changes in climate, hydrology, vegetation, and tectonic processes on the Earth's surface. While vertical erosion into bedrock landscapes has been extensively studied, there is little consensus on how rivers erode laterally in bedrock landscapes. It is crucial to establish the duration of lateral widening intervals that create bedrock valleys in order to understand how changes in river dynamics shape the Earth's surface. Through a collaboration with the Desert Research Institute (DRI), the PI will learn luminescence dating techniques that will allow her to establish the timing of lateral erosion intervals and apply these techniques to infer transport history of sediments. Determining the timing of past and current river incision is important for predicting the effect of ongoing landscape change on humans who live and work near rivers in Kansas, the PI's home state. The PI's home institution, Kansas State University, will benefit from the professional development of the PI, her extended collaborative network with DRI, and the incorporation of dating techniques in research and teaching to demonstrate how local rivers change on decadal and centennial time scales that humans must be prepared to adapt to.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\n\r\nThe processes that control vertical incision in bedrock rivers are widely studied and well characterized; however, the fundamental processes that control lateral erosion have not been quantified in the laboratory or in the field. Field data that describes past channel mobility and defines absolute time constraints on the length of lateral erosion intervals are vital for better understanding the conditions that result in wide bedrock valleys. Analysis of luminescence properties is a key tool for dating fluvial deposits to determine periods of lateral erosion and vertical incision. It also has the potential to illuminate transport processes, such as channel mobility, during periods of sediment deposition. Research conducted during this project has the potential to transform our understanding about the processes and timing of the evolution of bedrock valley systems. Two main project objectives support the overarching goals: (1) learning single-grain luminescence techniques to date the depositional age of sediments with complex transport histories; (2) interpreting luminescence properties as a proxy for fluvial processes, such as channel mobility. Using luminescence techniques to interpret geomorphic processes is an emerging application that has the potential to give insight beyond dating. When this project is complete, the geomorphology community will be closer to interpreting luminescence properties as proxies of transport processes to assess past channel mobility from sediment deposited in association with periods of bedrock valley formation and ultimately a new way of interpreting a wealth of measured, but previously unexamined data.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

While vertical erosion from bedrock rivers has been extensively studied, little is known about how, when, and why rivers erode laterally in bedrock landscapes. Determining absolute dates of when rivers laterally widened their floodplains in the past is important for understanding how changes in river dynamics shape the Earth's surface. Luminescence dating is a key tool for dating river deposits and allows scientists to determine how long periods of lateral erosion and vertical incision lasted. This project allowed the PI and two graduate students to make two long term collaborative visits to the Desert Research Institute (DRI) in Reno, NV to learn luminescence dating techniques. Mastering the versatile tool of luminescence dating added a career-changing tool to the early career PI's skill set. The primary objectives of this project were 1) to collect samples from a currently widening bedrock valley (Buffalo River, AR) to learn standard luminescence dating techniques and 2) to interpret luminescence properties of modern and ancient floodplain samples as records of river conditions when these sediments were deposited. The novel application of luminescence dating in this project showed that sediments transported during high flow conditions had distinct luminescence characteristics from sediments deposited during low flow conditions.</p>\n<p>In addition to the original goals of this project, the PI and a graduate student collected four samples from a local field site in Kansas that were dated using luminescence. These samples gave ages of sediment deposition that range from 36 ky ? 19 ky. This is a significant finding because these are some of the oldest sediment samples to be dated in northeast Kansas, allowing the PI to draw conclusions about stream behavior during the last ice age. These exciting results from the local stream prompted a new collaboration between the PI and colleagues at Kansas State University to study cycles of sediment deposition and erosion in a sensitive tallgrass prairie stream using luminescence dating. Determining the timing of past and current river incision with luminescence techniques is important for predicting the effect of ongoing landscape change on humans who live and work near rivers in Kansas. The second project outcome that was outside the scope of the original project was using luminescence dating on rock samples, rather than standard sediment samples. The PI and a second graduate student collected samples from rock piles in a bedrock valley to determine how long the rock piles have been in place. During the second visit to the DRI lab, the PI and graduate student developed an entirely new protocol for preparing and testing sandstone rock samples from the Buffalo River area for luminescence dating. This exciting new application of luminescence dating on rock piles in a bedrock valley allows us to evaluate the effect of rock piles in slowing how quickly bedrock valleys widen, a novel idea in the scientific community.</p>\n<p>This project has resulted in a substantially extended collaborative network for the PI. The PI has ongoing collaborations with three researchers at DRI working on new research directions using luminescence and interpreting past river behavior.
