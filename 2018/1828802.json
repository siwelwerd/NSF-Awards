 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the University of Hawai'i at M&#0257noa to purchase a micro-computed tomography (&#0181CT) instrument.  This type of instrument has become an important and widely-used used technology in basic research due to its ability to generate fast, reproducible, non-destructive 3-D imaging of a broad range of tissues. The new &#0181CT system will significantly enhance a broad spectrum of local research programs, enabling researchers to initiate, continue, and expand studies of taxonomy in corals, insects and mollusks; sensory system evolution in arthropods and fish; morphology and physiology in frogs and sea spiders; and the impacts of ocean acidification on corals, among many others. This new imaging instrument will be accessible to life science researchers across campus, as well as graduate and undergraduate students, promoting the training of young scientists in advanced 3D imaging technologies.  By partnering with &#0181CT users from both the University of Hawai'i and the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum in Honolulu, the PI and co-PI will build a Virtual Museum of 3D models of native Hawaiian biodiversity that will be accessible online to the general public and to researchers around the world.  These 3D scans of native fauna will also be used to create large scale, 3D models for biodiversity exhibits at the Bishop Museum. \r\n\r\nThe new &#0181CT imaging system will be added to the University of Hawai'i at M&#0257noa Center of Advanced Bioimaging Research (CABR) to develop a comprehensive, multi-modality research facility that will serve the local Hawaiian, and broader Pacific, research community. The location of the instrument affords researchers access to fast, affordable, easy-to-use, non-invasive imaging techniques in one of the premier hotspots of island biodiversity, allowing for studies of the unique, endemic, and rapidly declining fauna found in Hawai'i. The new instrument will support 3D microscopy of hard and soft tissue imaging, capable of mapping genome-phenome interactions, physiology, metabolism, and molecular interactions in living animals, and enhancing efforts to conduct place-based research. The new instrumentation builds on the initial strong investment by UH administration in imaging technology and will support interdisciplinary research, education, and training.  The multimodality capability created by the addition of a &#0181CT imaging system to the University of Hawai'i imaging resources will make it unique among bioimaging facilities across the nation because of the access afforded to researchers and students engaged in basic science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The UHM Life Sciences Building houses a diverse range of integrative research groups from multiple programs across campus who serve as a core user base.&nbsp; Despite significant delays in the acquisition of the instrument due to the COVID pandemic, as soon as the SkyScan 1272 micro-CT instrument was installed it quickly became an integral component of multiple research programs both across campus and across the state. Since the facility became operational in March 2021, it has generated data for over twenty-five projects for different research groups within the University as well as from the greater Hawai'i academic community.&nbsp; The system has been used to scan biological samples as varied as plant leaves, deep-sea corals, new species of reef fish, marine fish larvae, Antarctic sea spiders, the skulls and tails of invasive anoles and geckos, bioluminescent shrimp, and cave-adapted insects, with a particular emphasis on scanning and creating 3D images of native Hawaiian species. The new instrument is also being used by material science researchers for investigations of non-biological materials. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />In addition to advancing research efforts, the acquisition of the SkyScan 1272 and establishment of the UHM 3D imaging facility has also significantly contributed to the campus academic environment.&nbsp; In less than a year of operation the technology has already made major contributions to the dissertation research of four current Ph.D. students from three different graduate programs.&nbsp; The availability of the instrument has also led to the creation of an annual micro-CT course that provides hands on training in x-ray imaging techniques to graduate students. &nbsp;Additionally, the instrument has generated data that has served as the basis for three undergraduate independent research projects. Beyond training and education, the micro-CT instrument has played a significant role in ongoing studies of native Hawaiian and local Pacific species by contributing key data for describing new species of crustose coralline algae, deep-sea corals, and reef-dwelling shrimp and fish; descriptions of a novel pheromone gland in a native species of fruit fly; and the comparison of visual capabilities in native versus invasive reef shrimp. &nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />The University of Hawai'i, the 3D Imaging Facility Team, and the diverse community of faculty, graduates, and undergraduate researchers that are utilizing the new facility are greatly appreciative of NSF funding to support the purchase of the SkyScan 1272 micro-CT instrument. &nbsp;The University remains committed to maintaining the operation of the micro-CT instrument and building facility capacity and has already purchased an additional two years of service contract beyond the warranty to ensure the facility remains operational, as well as purchased a dedicated computer for the facility capable of processing and analyzing the large image dataset generated by micro-CT scans. &nbsp;This acquisition of the micro-CT instrument and creation of the imaging facility brought a new technology to the state of Hawai'i that is rapidly becoming a critical technique for basic research in the life sciences.&nbsp; The new facility has enhanced the research, education, and training opportunities for Life Science researchers across the state and has provided a new and exciting way to document the unique plant and animal species found in Hawai'i and to share that information both with the broader scientific community and the general public.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/01/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Megan&nbsp;L&nbsp;Porter</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div
