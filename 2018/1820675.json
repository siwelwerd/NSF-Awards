 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research activities of Professors John Donoghue and Lorenzo Sorbo at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.  \r\n\r\nOne of the most active areas in theoretical physics involves the interface between general relativity, which is our theory of the gravitational interactions, and the study of particle physics and cosmology.   The union of gravity and quantum mechanics has fundamental problems to be addressed, and the connection of fundamental physics with cosmology will allow crucial tests of our present ideas. Professors Donoghue and Sorbo have a research program which addresses these new frontiers.   As such, this research advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of new physical laws.  Professor Donoghue will use the techniques of what is called \"effective field theory\" to study quantum-gravity effects that are reliably calculated at low energy.  Professor Sorbo's primary research involves novel effects in the study of the universe, including possible new ways of testing proposed new theories. Professors Donoghue and Sorbo will also involve undergraduate and graduate students in their research, and thereby provide training for junior physicists beginning research in this field.  They will also  provide outreach to middle-school students and develop a new book promoting the understanding of quantum field theory. \r\n\r\nMore technically, Professor Donoghue will use effective field theory to treat quantum problems in general relativity in the region where the effective field theory is valid.  He will also study more complete theories of gravity as well as alternative ways to tackle the issue of naturalness of the Standard Model.  Professor Sorbo will explore various phenomenological aspects of primordial inflation, with a special emphasis on how the effects of particle creation during inflation could show up in future observations.  He will also investigate more theoretical aspects related to the creation of particles in strong external electric fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
