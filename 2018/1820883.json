 "awd_abstract_narration": "Permanently frozen soils, or permafrost, often contain large amounts of ground ice, which make it vulnerable to climate change and human activities. These soils are protected from melting by a surface layer which thaws in summer and refreezes in winter, and a near-surface layer, termed the transition zone. This transition zone, which develops through complex interactions between the environment and permafrost, controls permafrost resilience to ground surface subsidence (thermokarst). Expectations are that as the climate warms, deeper seasonal melting will impact this transition zone, and ecosystems and infrastructure (i.e., roads, airfields, and buildings) stability. The goals of this project are to evaluate the properties of the transition zone from the High Arctic to the southern border of the permafrost region and to understand processes of formation, degradation, and recovery of the transition zone in various climatic regions. The knowledge gained from this work will inform Arctic science and engineering. The project will support student training. The investigators will collaborate with government agencies and engineering companies whose work is impacted by permafrost ground subsidence issues.\r\n\r\nIn previous research, the investigators identified a zone in the upper profile of permafrost soils that is critical to permafrost stability, soil development, and geomorphic processes. However, how the thickness and cryostructures of this transition zone (TZ) vary across climate and landscape gradients, the rates of its formation during ecological succession, and how it contributes to permafrost vulnerability and resilience, is not well understood. What knowledge we have is in low Arctic tundra and can be misleading if applied to other bioclimatic regions. To address this gap in knowledge, our collaborative research with the University of Montreal will focus on the TZ across climatic regions and landscapes distributed along a north-south transect from barren polar deserts with continuous permafrost in Canada, to boreal forests in southern Alaska with sporadic permafrost. Our group will also monitor and experiment with mass and heat transfer processes between the active layer (AL) and the TZ to identify mechanisms controlling segregated ice formation.\r\n\r\nThis project was co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The transition zone consists of two layers: the transient layer (TL), which reflects interannual changes in thickness of the seasonally thawed active layer (AL) above permafrost, and the ice-rich intermediate layer (IL), which responds to long-term ecological and climate change. The main goal of the project was to evaluate the patterns and processes of formation, degradation, and recovery of the transition zone of the upper permafrost and its effects on permafrost vulnerability and resilience. To accomplish this goal, we studied the structure and properties of the IL during 2019-2023 at numerous sites across different climatic conditions and geomorphic settings in Alaska and Canada and summarized previous knowledge from other permafrost regions. Results of this study have led to a better understanding of the role of the IL in ecological transformations, its effects on trace-gas emissions and carbon balance, and its fundamental role in evolution of arctic and boreal landscapes.</p>\n<p>The IL is sensitive to climatic and environmental changes that increase the thickness of the AL because it can be extremely ice-rich: its average excess-ice content (volume of ground ice that exceeds the pore volume of the unfrozen soil) exceeds 40% and often reaches 80% (<strong>Figure 1</strong>). Degradation of the IL is a major factor leading to thermal subsidence (<strong>Figure 2</strong>) that triggers development of thermokarst lakes, bogs, and fens, thermal erosion associated with gully formation and coastal erosion, and slope failure. For example, one of the widely occurring types of slope failure called the active-layer detachment slides (ALDSs) is the direct result of ice melting in degrading IL. Degradation of the IL is also a major factor in the damage to infrastructure from climate warming.</p>\n<p>Wildfires and disturbance associated with development can have a devastating impact on the IL. In 2007, the huge Anaktuvuk River fire in northern Alaska burned 1,040 square kilometers of tundra with ice-rich permafrost, which triggered immediate degradation of the IL and underlying ice wedges and initiated extensive ALDs. Our studies showed that with the recovery of vegetation, the IL recovered on flat terrain (<strong>Figure 3</strong>), but permafrost continued to degrade on slopes.</p>\n<p>Since the early 2000s, we have been documenting the abrupt increase in the degradation of ice wedges at numerous sites in northern Alaska. We have found that initially active thermokarst slows down with time, and the IL eventually reestablishes. Thus, the IL is the fundamental indicator of resilience and recovery of permafrost.</p>\n<p>Structures such as roads and airfields are also sensitive to the degradation of the IL. It is extremely important to properly assess the thickness and ice content of the IL during geotechnical investigations.
