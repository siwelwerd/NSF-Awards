 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Description:\r\nIn supporting the acquisition of a variable-pressure, field-emission scanning electron microscope, this project enables researchers and educators in Vermont and northern New York to explore materials at the nanometer scale. Research projects spanning physics, chemistry, engineering, materials science, and geology rely on the instrument for analysis and characterization, identifying elemental composition and local crystal structure. Remote operating capabilities allow classrooms and museums in the region to perform live experiments and demonstrations. The modern instrument, with its wide-ranging capabilities, serves as a core research infrastructure for local universities and industries alike.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description:\r\nThe scanning electron microscope is equipped with secondary electron, five-segment back-scattered electron, electron backscatter diffraction, and energy dispersive spectroscopy detectors. Combined with variable-pressure and low-voltage operating modes, these detectors allow for topographic, compositional, and crystallographic characterization of delicate samples at spatial resolution of 1.2 nm. The instrument enables research projects exploring nanoporous oxide structures, organic crystals, optoelectronic devices, optical filters, metal nanowires, rheology of crustal processes, and mineral weathering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
