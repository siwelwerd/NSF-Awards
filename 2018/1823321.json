The HoloCamera will meet these needs.  Using several cameras and a computer cluster it will directly create dynamic virtual worlds. Users will be able to freely move about and observe these virtual worlds as if they were actually present there.\r\n\r\nThe HoloCamera will advance the state of the art in light field capture and rendering, high-performance computing, and embedded signal processing. The facility will aid medical education and training, interactive imitation learning for robots, and capturing fluent sign-language use in native signers. Virtual and augmented reality offer exciting ways to educate students, particularly those from underrepresented groups in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In response to that need, we have built a high precision cyberinstrument that can capture true-to-life realistic immersive environments. Specialized camera mounts allow us to maximize capture space, and our modular camera setup can capture synchronized frames at up to 30 FPS. We utilize a state-of-the-art neural network, trained specifically for background subtraction on 4K video frames, to extract foreground segments from our raw footage.

We have further processed the extracted foreground mask into an intermediate 3D mesh and have been able to achieve a significant size reduction on transmissible geometry data, while maintaining consistent levels of detail. We have also developed a custom-built streaming software to facilitate the process of manually focusing the HoloCamera?s lenses.
