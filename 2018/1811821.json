 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2018, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. The fellow will conduct research to improve our understanding of the role of rapid evolution in facilitating biological invasions. A longstanding theory in the field predicts that decreased genetic diversity normally associated with small initial populations of invasive species should reduce the likelihood of success for these species. However, invasive species are everywhere across the globe, and result in hundreds of billions of dollars in economic costs each year. The fellow will apply recently developed DNA sequencing techniques to museum specimens of an invasive Great Lakes fish, the round goby, to look for evidence of genetic adaptations associated with this species ability to spread across the Laurentian Great Lakes since 1990. An improved understanding of the evolutionary processes that allow biological invasions to succeed will allow natural resource managers to better anticipate which species pose the greatest risks, increasing the likelihood of successful prevention or mitigation of invasions. The fellow will engage K-12 and undergraduate teaching programs to design active learning classroom lessons focused on biological invasions, which provide an elegant nexus between concepts related to biology, ecology, and evolution. \r\n\r\nThis research project will be completed using a spatially- and temporally-explicit landscape genomics approach that accounts for demographic processes that often make genomic detections of selection difficult. By using genomic data derived from museum specimens collected throughout the Great Lakes region since the invasion began, the project will provide a unique opportunity to empirically observe changes in allele frequencies associated with adaptation to novel environmental stressors. To complement methods seeking genomic signals of selection, the fellow will also evaluate associations between genetic data and a suite of morphological and environmental variables. This project will provide the fellow with training in laboratory and bioinformatic analyses of degraded DNA, including DNA extraction from formalin-preserved samples and sequencing via target capture. The genome-wide panel of loci used in the analyses will provide a resource for future genomic research on round gobies. In addition to creating classroom learning resources, the fellow will also train undergraduate researchers, with an emphasis on underrepresented minorities, in genomic and bioinformatic methods necessary for evolutionary biology research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This research used spatially and temporally explicit genomic data to investigate the demographic and evolutionary processes that have resulted in the widespread invasion of round goby in the Laurentian Great Lakes basin. To begin, I developed a &lsquo;RAD capture&rsquo; genotyping panel for round goby that allowed me to collect genetic data for 909 round gobies from 46 locations throughout the Great Lakes basin. In generating that genotyping tool, deep sequencing of round gobies collected from populations throughout the Great Lakes revealed over two million single nucleotide polymorphisms throughout the genome, including a suite of putatively sex-diagnostic markers that will be valuable for future research efforts. In addition to the genomic analyses, I used geometric morphometrics to understand how round goby body shapes varied for 1068 individuals from 45 locations. These analyses revealed striking genetic and morphological variation among river-dwelling round gobies and nearby Great Lakes populations. In particular, river fish were more likely to be elongated with a generally more hydrodynamic body shape that may be the result of adaptation to a flowing water environment. Genomic analyses revealed numerous genetic sites throughout the genome that differed depending on whether the fish were sampled in a river or lake. I also found a reduction in genetic diversity for gobies occupying river habitats, a pattern that is expected if those populations are more recently established and potentially experiencing local adaptation. Collectively, my research highlighted the influential role that contemporary evolution can have in determining success of biological invasions. At the conclusion of my research, I donated over 1700 round goby specimens to three museums that supported my research, providing an expansive resource for future research.</p>\n<p>As an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow, I gained extensive training in teaching and leadership approaches. For instance, I worked with my sponsoring scientist to develop an undergraduate course on applied biological concepts that I helped deliver. While at Michigan State, I also earned the designation of Postdoctoral Teaching Scholar, wrote and presented a two-hour workshop on research reproducibility, and authored a K-12 learning module based on my round goby research. I gained valuable skills in computational biology through various high-throughput computing workshops offered at my host university and through completion of a fellowship program focused on cloud computing. I developed valuable mentoring skills while supervising an undergraduate researcher for over two years whose work resulted in multiple conference presentations and a first-author publication on the effects of ethanol preservation on round goby body shape.
