The symposium will be held October 5 and 6, 2018, at the Babson Executive Conference Center in Wellesley, Massachusetts. This symposium will bring together women at all career stages in STEM, with the goal of connecting women and strengthening their connections in their fields. The award will help fund room rental costs as well as travel and hotel costs for the three keynote speakers.\r\n\r\nAs is well documented, women continue to be underrepresented in the sciences. Although a higher percentage of women than men currently earn college degrees, fewer women go into STEM fields, and those who do are more likely to drop out. This symposium offers a venue for discussing issues of recruiting and retention, as well as broadening the participation of the STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This under-representation shortchanges the students, the field of science, and the public that benefits from scientific advancement.
