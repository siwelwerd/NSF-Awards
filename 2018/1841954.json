 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award deals with the design and analysis of algorithms for geographical problems, and algorithms for computational problems involving forming clusters of input datapoints. As an example, the project will involve investigation of a particular approach to electoral redistricting by computer, an approach that builds on clustering techniques and concepts.  The goals of the project are to design and assess redistricting methods that will yield compact, contiguous districts that are population-balanced to within a difference of one person, to quantitatively evaluate the compactness of the districts, to seek faster algorithms to compute the districts, and to study the degree to which the method is resistant to gerrymandering. One potential impact of this activity is to help inform the ongoing societal discussion of redistricting by demonstrating the availability of a transparent redistricting methods that achieve high-quality fair districting plans.  Another potential impact is in the training of new computer scientists.  Because research on redistricting addresses a perceived problem in society, it attracts and engages many people, especially those motivated by a desire for positive societal impact.  The project will support training both directly and indirectly.  First, students, particularly women and members of historically underrepresented groups, will be recruited to assist in performing this research and in disseminating the results. Second, the disseminated results will inspire and encourage people to study computer science.  This project will serve as an example of how algorithms can be used for social good. \r\n\r\nThe research draws on the study of the following optimization problem: given an integer k and a set of points in a metric space, find a partitioning of the given points into 'k' clusters so as to minimize the sum of squared intra-cluster distances subject to each cluster being assigned a '1/k' fraction of the locations.  Although this problem is computationally intractable, even a locally-optimal solution has desirable characteristics; for example, if the metric space is the Euclidean plane, the clusters can be represented by convex polygons with few sides on average. There are several obstacles to using this approach in practical redistricting, such as: (1) exact locations of people are not available; (2) finding a locally optimal solution can be time-consuming; (3) the Euclidean metric does not take into account geographical  barriers. The project will explore ways of overcoming these obstacles.  In addition, the project will investigate other questions, such as how well does local search approximate the minimum sum of squared distances, and how easy or difficult is it to find local solutions that give one group a significant political advantage.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis research builds on algorithmic results on planar graphs, which are networks that can be drawn without crossings on a surface.  The primary focus of the research project is on studying algorithms for nonpartisan political redistricting.  A districting plan for a geographical region is a decomposition into a specified number of subregions, called districts.  The districts should be balanced with respect to population, and each district should be contiguous.  In addition, the decomposition should consist of subregions that are compact. There are multiple competing measures of compactness.    It is important to note that compactness should be measured for the district plan as a whole---it is not enough to ensure that some individual districts are compact if their greater compactness comes at the cost of lesser compactness of other districts.\nThis work addresses two measures.  According to the first measure, a district plan is compact to the extent it minimizes the following measure of dispersion: the average squared distance between pairs of people within the same district.  Previous work by others suggests that this is a good way of measuring compactness. There is an algorithm to find a district plan that is believed to minimize or nearly minimize dispersion subject to the constraint that the district population balance is perfect.  Also, any district plan resulting from this algorithm is mathematically guaranteed to consist of districts that are convex polygons that have few sides on average.\nThe above method assumes that the boundary lines between districts can be drawn anywhere; in reality, one might impose the requirement that each district consist of predefined geographical regions (e.g. census blocks or census tracts) whose populations are known.  Another algorithm has been developed that can take as input a district plan and perturb it slightly to satisfy that requirement while preserving contiguity and preserving population balance to the greatest extent possible.   Because the perturbations are slight, the degradation in compactness tends to be slight.\nFurther research has explored the degree to which using such algorithmic district plans affects the relative advantage of a primarily rural political party over a primarily urban political party.  This research calls into question the belief that this advantage is inherent.\nAnother measure of compactness more directly takes into account the predefined geographical regions, which can be called atoms.  A district plan is a decomposition of atoms into regions each of which is contiguous.  The algorithmic goal is to find a decomposition of atoms minimizes the number of pairs of adjacent atoms in different districts, subject to a constraint on population balance.  The research has studied the computational difficulty of this problem, and has resulted in an algorithm that in practice has been able to find solutions for some rather coarse instances.\nThe research supported by the grant has also resulted in other new algorithms; an algorithm addressing a problem of splitting up a graph, and algorithms for vehicle routing, a problem related to delivery optimization.   \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/13/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Philip N Klein"
