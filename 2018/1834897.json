 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is conducting research that is applying the collective impact framework to examine specific components of a multi-organizational partnership, with emphasis on the backbone infrastructure and functionality of the collaboration. The multi-organizational partnership, which is focused on broadening the participation of minority teenage girls in STEM, involves K-12 schools, colleges and universities, industry, and STEM research organizations.  An important contribution of the proposed research is to understand how this multi-organizational partnership functions without a traditional backbone organization.  There are five research questions: (1) What key features (roles, relationship types, individual attributes) within and between organizations make the collaboration successful?  (2) To what extent does this collaboration satisfy the five defining criteria of collaborative impact strategies?  (3) What components of the organizational network within the partnership serve as backbone support?  (4) How was the backbone developed and sustained over time in tandem with other collective impact elements?  (5) To what extent are the features of the backbone replicable and scalable to other collaborations between universities and STEM-focused community organizations? \r\n\r\nThis research was created in response to the NSF INCLUDES Dear Colleague Letter: Announcement of an Effort to Expand the NSF INCLUDES National Network (NSF 17-111).  The DCL states that EAGER Proposals should produce findings and results that will generate new insights for the NSF INCLUDES National Network, suggest potential strategies for engaging NSF's existing broadening participation activities in the Network and/or highlight lessons learned that could inform the NSF INCLUDES Launch Pilots and Alliances as they develop.  The NSF INCLUDES program focuses on catalyzing the STEM enterprise to collaboratively work for inclusive change.\r\n\r\nThe research findings that are being generated from this project inform the collective impact framework for STEM broadening participation networks, and it will inform researchers, educators, families and industry about how to advance broadening participation efforts for inclusive STEM education, research and workforce development.  Together with other NSF INCLUDES Network activities, this research is contributing to positive, transformative change within the U.S. STEM workforce and research community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our work sought to interrogate and better understand Collective Impact (CI) partnerships. CI is a way of thinking about collaboration across organizations, which focuses on how information is shared and people work together to solve complex problems. To better understand how STEM partnerships function, we studied a school-university-community partnership in Western Massachusetts, which we refer to as STEMSUCCESS, that closely resembled model CI partnerships in every respect except for not having a formal backbone organization. In CI partnerships, a backbone organization is created to coordinate the activities of the partnership because it is assumed that each organization&rsquo;s goals would otherwise be focused individually, to the detriment of the CI partnership. STEMSUCCESS did not have a backbone organization and instead distributed backbone responsibilities among two partner organizations, an arrangement that has been sustained successfully over a prolonged period of time, but which literature on CI suggests should not work. Our project used in-depth qualitative interviews and social network surveys with people involved with STEMSUCCESS to determine a) how STEMSUCCESS created backbone functionality without a backbone organization, and b) how the partnership sustained this organization over time. Results of the project offer important insights into CI and the science of broadening participation, as well as the methodological tools to study such partnerships (specifically social network analysis).&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>We explored the way that people involved in STEMSUCCESS made sense of both their decision to be involved and the overall partnership. What we found was that, while most participants had a relatively limited view of what enabled the success of the STEMSUCCESS partnership, participants shared a belief that the project was important and everything would work out. They referred to this belief as &ldquo;magic,&rdquo; and this belief structure anchored the strategies used to make the partnership function well. In other words, the partnership worked in part because people believed it should and would work.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>We also found that distinctive organizational features in STEMSUCCESS set it apart from most CI partnerships.
