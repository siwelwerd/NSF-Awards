 "awd_abstract_narration": "Knowledge of thermal conductivity of the Earth's mantle and core materials under extreme conditions is important for understanding the physical and chemical processes and their evolution in the Earth. Sustained heat transport through the mantle is crucial for the existence and stability of the Earth's magnetic field. The Earth's mantle dynamics depends on the rate of heat transfer by convection, conduction, and radiation, and understanding these processes requires knowledge on the conductive and radiative parts of thermal conductivity. The investigators will conduct measurements of the conductive and radiative parts of thermal conductivity at extreme conditions of pressure and temperature that are relevant for the Earth's deep interior. The laser techniques developed in this work will advance other fields, which benefit from knowledge of thermal conductivity under extremes, for example various energy applications. A range of students, including area high school students, undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates, will benefit from high-quality scientific training at Carnegie that will be provided by participation in the cutting-edge science that will be developed in the course of this work.\r\n \r\nThe investigators will determine the thermal conductivity of the Earth's key minerals under high pressure and high temperature conditions (up to 150 GPa and 6000 K) by using pump-probe pulsed laser techniques. To determine the lattice thermal conductivity, they will measure the heat flux histories across the sample using time- and spatially- resolved spectroradiometry and/or time-domain thermoreflectance. To infer the radiative thermal conductivity, the team will study the optical spectra of these mantle minerals in the ultraviolet-to-infrared spectral range. They will apply the time-resolved emission and optical broad band spectroscopy tools that they have previously developed including pulsed white laser (supercontinuum) in combination with time-resolved multichannel detectors (streak camera and intensified CCD). The experiments will be performed on Fe and Fe-rich alloys, high-quality geologically relevant samples pre-synthesized at high P-T condition in large-volume devices (e.g. single crystals of bridgmanite), silicate and oxide melts, and planetary ices. These high P-T experimental data will enable a direct estimate of the radiative and conduction parts of the thermal conductivity of the Earth's mantle and core. These measurements will elucidate complex laws which govern thermal conductivity in the deep interior and reach sufficient accuracy to critically improve existing planetary models.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It is related to the processes of planetary accretion and differentiation, the time evolution of mantle and core temperatures, and the generation of Earth?s magnetic field. The thermal conductivity of materials in the Earth?s and planetary interiors is the key to understanding these phenomena.</p>\n<p>In this project, we performed the direct measurements of thermal conductivity of deep Earth?s materials using our pulsed laser techniques applied to the samples in a laser heated diamond anvil cell, which generate the relevant pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions.

These are essential for minerals for which both these mechanisms are viable at extreme P-T conditions.&nbsp;To determine the heat conductance, we applied the Transient Heating technique (Figs. 1-2), which applies a short laser heating pulse to the one side of the continuously laser preheated sample and measures&nbsp; the temperature histories from both sides of the sample using time- and spatially- resolved spectroradiometry, thus inferring the time dependent heat flux across the sample [1]. To infer the radiative thermal conductivity, we measured the optical spectra of the mantle minerals using the Broad Band Optical Spectroscopy technique (Fig. 3), which utilizes a very bright white pulsed laser and time-resolved spectral data acquisition [2].</p>\n<p>Our measurements of lattice thermal conductivity of pyrolite, the assemblage of minerals expected to make up the lower mantle, up to pressures and temperatures near the base of the mantle yielded the values of 3.9(1.4) W/m/K at 80 GPa and 2000 to 2500 K and 5.9(3.0) W/m/K at 124 GPa and 2000 to 3000 K. These values are consistent with a heat flow at the core-mantle boundary (CMB) of 7 to 1.5 TW and a thermal boundary layer thickness of 32 to 300 km [3].</p>\n<p>Our measurements of thermal conductivity of Fe to 130 GPa and 3300 K [4] (Fig. 2) yielded values near the low end of previous estimates, at 18?44 W/m/K for thermal conductivity of Fe in the outer Earth?s core suggesting an old inner core and that the geodynamo will persist for a long time into the future.</p>\n<p>Our measurements of radiative conductivity of the lower mantle minerals (bridgmanite, ferropericlase, and postperovskite [5,6]) and their assemblages (Fig. 3) showed very low values at the P-T conditions at the base of the mantle near the CMB revealing that radiative heat transport is essentially blocked due to an increased optical absorption in the hot lower mantle. This suggests a reduced CMB heat flow, which is nevertheless sufficient to drive the present-day geodynamo, but implies a very old inner core.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The technical developments of this work enabled measurement of the lattice and radiative thermal conductivity of the deep Earth?s materials, knowledge of which are important for understanding of the Earth thermal history and dynamics.
