 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs.  Professor Dirk Iwata-Reuyl from Portland State University and colleagues Robert Strongin, Daniel Ballhorn, David Stuart and Theresa McCormick have acquired a high-performance benchtop quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer with a front-end ion trap that is capable of tandem mass spectrometry, and equipped with a direct analysis in real time (DART) source. In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species in complex matrices. In a typical experiment, the components flow into a mass spectrometer where they are ionized and the ion masses are measured. This highly sensitive technique allows detection and determination of the structure of molecules in a complex mixture. The DART source is used for rapid analysis of a wide variety of samples at atmospheric pressure and in the open laboratory environment. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the University and regional area. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse students in research and research training using this modern analytical technique. This is a multi-user, multi-departmental (and multi-institutional) facility that enhances active interdisciplinary activities. Students enrolled in an advanced instrumentation course at PSU are trained on the instrument and use. Among the programs designed to broaden participation by women and underrepresented groups in STEM education and research are the programs Ronald E. McNair Scholars, Enhancing cross-disciplinary infrastructure training at Oregon, and the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation. In addition to the training that this facility provides to undergraduate and graduate students at PSU, faculty and students from nearby 4-year institutions also have access to the instrument as do high school science teachers involved in summer internships.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts studies on the formation and function of chemically modified nucleosides in transfer RNA and investigations on redox and chromophore materials and mechanisms in molecular sensors and probes. The mass spectrometer is used for studies of interactions between organisms of different trophic levels and for developing catalysts for solar fuel generation using hetero-ligated nickel-pyridinethiolate catalysts. The instrument also aids researchers developing reactions with hipervalent diaryliodonium reagents, and those developing screening tests and evaluating new compounds having medical potential.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
