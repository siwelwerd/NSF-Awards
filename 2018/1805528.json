 "awd_abstract_narration": "The structure of proteins determines their function. This project will attempt to modify several structural features of enzymes in order to obtain more productive functions and higher reaction rates. The enzymes are newly discovered and could help convert biomass into valuable chemical products very efficiently. The project will also provide interactive research experiences to students. The PIs will continue recruiting undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented minorities to work on this project. The PIs will also be assembling and distributing an educational kit through the Nebraska EPSCoR Young Scientists Program, beginning with the HS level and expanding to the middle school level. This will provide these students with hands-on experience designing and creating different proteins.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed work focuses on the study and engineering of carboxylic acid reductases (CARs). The goal of the project is to expand the substrate specificity of CARs in order to efficiently reduce short-chain carboxylic acid metabolites into aldehydes. These serve as common and versatile biosynthetic intermediates that are readily to be further converted to alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, or amines. This proposal specifically targets CAR mutants that function on the reduction of three abundant carboxylic acid metabolites, including D- and L-lactic acids (C3 substrates), and glycolic acid (a two-carbon substrate). Further reduction of the aldehyde products leads to the formation of R- or S-1,2- propanediol and ethylene glycol, which are bulk industrial chemicals with broad applications, especially in the production of polyesters.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBiocatalysis is emerging as an indispensable alternative to traditional chemical synthesis.  This project focuses on a group of multidomain enzymes, Carboxylic Acid Reductases (CARs).  CARs have an N-terminal adenylation domain (A), a C-terminal reduction domain (R), and a connecting phosphopantetheine attachment domain (P), which shuttles the catalytic intermediate from the A domain to the R domain through a covalent linkage.  The goal of the project is to study and engineer CAR enzymes for efficient reduction of short-chain carboxylic acids into aldehydes, which are versatile biosynthetic intermediates for further enzymatic conversions into compounds of industrial importance, including alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, and amines (Figure 1).\n\nWe started the project with the characterization of a group of phylogenetically distant CARs on a substrate panel that consisted of C2-C6 dicarboxylate and hydroxycarboxylate compounds.  The efforts identified one CAR enzyme, i.e., MavCAR, with a broad substrate range and high thermal stability (Figure 2).  The enzyme was applied to the biosynthesis of a bulk industrial chemical, 1,2-propanediol, from renewable feedstock.  We reported the research in ChemBioChem, 2018, 19, 1452. \n\nRelative movements of individual domains in a large protein like CAR dictate its function and kinetics.  We next explored the construction and study of hybrid CARs using domains from different parent CARs.  In this effort, we built 16 hybrid CARs from four enzymes that were isolated from bacteria or fungi.  Biochemical characterization under steady state revealed that hybrid enzymes which harbored the P and R domains from the same parent enzyme catalyzed faster reactions than others.  More interestingly, we identified hybrid CARs that outperformed the parents.  Under the non-steady state, single turnover condition, a correlation between the rate of the reduction step and the rate of overall enzyme catalysis was observed (Figure 3), which indicated the reduction step is rate-limiting and the natural connection between the P and the R domain plays a key role.  We further investigated the underlying cause by examining the domain dynamics of hybrid CARs.  It was shown that the interacting interface between the A domain and the R domain is more flexible.  As a result, new interfaces can be easily formed in hybrid enzymes in the process of domain movements.  This study provided a practical guideline for the engineering of hybrid CARs and gained mechanistic insights into CAR catalysis.  We reported the research in Journal of Biotechnology, 2019, 304, 52. \n\nOne key to the successful enzyme engineering is the ability to examine numerous variants quickly and reliably.  To facilitate the engineering of CARs, we established a cell growth-coupled selection method.  The design exploits the cells? needs for redox balance during growth.  We first constructed a bacterial host with overflow redox production, which led to a slow growth rate.  The growth defect was rescued when a CAR enzyme was expressed (Figure 4).  This method enables the high throughput selection of improved CAR variants with low resource requirement.  Using this method, we identified CAR mutants with up to 17-fold improvement in the catalytic efficiency on carboxylate compounds.  We also demonstrated the use of one mutant in the conversion of adipic acid to 1,6-hexanediol, which is an industrially important chemical for polymer production.  We reported the research in ACS Chemical Biology, 2020, 9, 1632.\n\nAtomic details in a protein crystal structure give valuable guidance to designing protein engineering strategies.  Collaborating with colleagues, we solved crystal structures of the A domain of two CAR variants at 1.6 A resolution (Figure 5).  By applying the growth-coupled selection method, we took a structure-guided approach to achieve efficient engineering of CARs for improved kinetics.  One manuscript is in preparation to report this research.\n\nThe education component of the project focused on the integration of research and education activities.  The project provided research opportunities to three graduate students and four undergraduate students, including six woman and two underrepresented minority.  One student was awarded with the best poster award for her presentation in the 2021 Mid-American Student Regional Conference of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers.  The research experiences are having long and lasting impact for students? future career choice in the STEM field.  Two out of three graduated undergraduate students entered graduate school.

For example, in a course newly developed by the PI, topics such as biocatalysis, enzyme, and protein engineering were taught using CAR enzyme as one example.\n\nThe PI (Niu) and co-PIs (Guo and Wilson) are also committed to outreach activities.  Together with several other University of Nebraska-Lincoln faculty members, they organized and mentored undergraduate iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine) teams from the university for two consecutive years (2018-2019).  Each team consisted of six to eight undergraduate students with a good gender balance.  Both teams were awarded with silver medals.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/19/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Wei Niu"
