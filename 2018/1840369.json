 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Planning Grants for Engineering Research Centers competition was run as a pilot solicitation within the ERC program.  Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research.\r\n\r\nRenewable electricity is becoming abundant and cheap. We are on the cusp of a gradual, decades-long process of electrification across industry and society, replacing fossil fuels with electrons, much as the auto industry has executed over the past two decades. However, this transition to cleaner energy inputs demands devices and processes that can use this energy source efficiently. Electrons Leveraged through Electrochemical Conversion Technologies to Realize Opportunities for New Services (ELECTRONS) engages this enormous opportunity to provide the 'missing link,' a flexible and efficient means to use available electrons for a wide range of applications.  ELECTRONS requires research that engages many scientific and engineering disciplines and stakeholders to achieve its vision of major societal benefits from a core device construct to deliver capability in numerous contexts at numerous scales. \r\n\r\nThis planning grant aims to build the team that can realize this opportunity by connecting technical and 'softer' components.  The planning grant will proceed via an 'agile' approach to building the team, a method often used in start-ups. It entails a team of small teams, called scrums, which execute iterative cycles of ?build-test-analyze? for a given product to drive a rapid learning curve and development cycle, also incorporating input from customers of the product. The team will employ the agile scrum approach for ERC proposal development to build all aspects of the project and organization, putting the agile approach into the ?DNA? of the proposed NSF-ERC effort arising from this planning grant.  Based on a core system that is highly developed for other related technologies, the Center to be proposed will deliver the devices for using renewable sources of electricity for a wide range of services and will seek to commercialize these systems.  It is anticipated that this effort will produce spin-off companies and jobs in the tech sector as well as efficient and clean replacement technologies for various industry processes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "This project was a planning grant proposal for an ERC.\nMajor Activities:\n\n\nOverall, the team was formed, met and submitted a preproposal to the current competition.  During the  course of the work, one additional university partner was added.  Also, multiple industrial partners were identified.  Moreover, major aspects of convergent research were identified:  we were able to connect technological targets ( engineered electrochemical systems) to significant societal needs.  More importantly, we developed a network in the cities represented by our university partners to use anticipated technical outcomes to possibly seed new business in underserved areas such as urban Cleveland OH and Rochester NY or Appalachia.\n\nPrimary activities were undertaken to build this network via face-to-face meetings as well as teleconferences.  The PI painstakingly built a team of participants to meet the four major requirements for the proposal.\n\nSpecific Objectives achieved include:  \n\nidentify key participants for each of the major technical, outreach and diversity and industrial ecosystem components.\ndevelop plans for workforce training.\ndevelop specific technical targets for engineered systems.\nstudy, and codify in the center plan, best practices for a culture of inclusion. \nEngage appropriate elements of universities to set the stage for a robust Innovation Ecosystem program, including partners of various types such as industry, business assistants and so on.\n\n\nAll of these were achieved during the course of the planning grant.\n\nSignificant Results:\n\n\nA primary result is building a diverse team of experts that can address engineering systems as well as the components of the systems aand practices that will allow us to analyze and build for target applications.  Much more specific Engineered System targets for the first round of development were prepared for the proposed.\n\nAnother major result is our identification of a robust team, across the participating universities, of social scientists, lawyers and entrepreneurship experts to address our targets of creating businesses in underserved communities.\n\n\n\nThe ultimate outcome was submission of an ERC preproposal in the 2020 round.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas Zawodzinski"
