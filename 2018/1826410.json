 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the near future, human drivers will share the roadways with fleets of autonomous vehicles.  Significant energy savings might be achieved in autonomous vehicles if vehicle control systems integrate models of human driver behavior. Such savings would beneficially impact the economics of transportation, thereby increasing national prosperity. This project considers control of autonomous and connected vehicles in an on-road environment where both autonomous and human driving vehicles exist. The project will integrate novel models of human driver behavior into autonomous vehicle motion and powertrain control, thereby enabling simultaneous optimization of energy efficiency and driver safety. Experiments also examine the co-adaptive interaction between human drivers and autonomous vehicles on a closed-course proving ground, wherein system performance can be tested and verified safely.  The project will involve an educational component that provides training to graduate, undergraduate, and high school students in conducting research. The project also develops animation software to help students understand the working principle of connected and autonomous vehicles. \r\n\r\nThis research investigates new control methodologies that promise improved autonomous vehicle powertrain efficiency by integrating a novel model of human driving behavior, which is capable to predict the movement of human-driven vehicles and autonomous vehicles over long time periods. Methods include: a hazard-based modeling framework and rolling horizon mechanism that ensures accurate modeling of vehicle movements while considering driver and vehicle heterogeneity; experimental evaluations of how human driving behavior will impact the energy efficiency of autonomous vehicle control, and how changes in autonomous vehicle control strategy will impact human driving.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Understanding the traffic behavior in such an environment can significantly improve the control of autonomous vehicles for better energy efficiency.</p>\n<p>Optimizing the behavior of autonomous vehicles (including ensuring fuel efficiency) and understanding the traffic behavior have traditionally been considered two independent challenges and addressed by two different research communities. This project developed algorithms to capture the interdependencies of these two challenges by (1) developing accurate long-term vehicle trajectory prediction algorithms capable of predicting the movement of individual vehicles for long durations of time. (2). Such trajectory prediction algorithms are then incorporated into the control strategies to optimize the energy consumption of autonomous vehicles.</p>\n<p>Firstly, we developed a probabilistic vehicle-trajectory-based model for traffic state prediction (where both human driving and autonomous vehicles exist). While macroscopic-level traffic prediction based on current and past macroscopic measures (i.e., flow, density, and speed) showed reasonable levels of accuracy, in order to provide useful information for energy-usage optimization at the individual vehicle level, there is a need to provide prediction at both microscopic (i.e., vehicle trajectory level) and macroscopic levels. The microscopic-level prediction provides an estimate of other vehicles? locations in the autonomous vehicle?s field of view and macroscopic-level prediction provides an estimate of overall traffic condition (e.g., congested vs. uncongested or shockwave status). Due to possible prediction errors, both predictions are probabilistic in nature, where the prediction accuracy of the vehicle location decreases as the prediction horizon increases.</p>\n<p>Secondly, with the predicted traffic information, we investigated a new control methodology that can significantly improve the autonomous vehicle powertrain efficiency using the approximate dynamic programming (ADP). Solving this problem using ADP is independent of the initial condition of the system and requires much less memory storage capacity compared to the conventional method. We addressed the key challenges associated with using ADP to solve the integrated optimal control, including the nonquadratic cost function, nonlinear constraints on control inputs as well as the non-affine structure of the augmented vehicle and powertrain dynamics. The concept of the reachable set for the first time is adopted when implementing method. Testing shows that the examined control strategy outperforms the conventional control method by an additional 15% improvement in fuel consumption.</p>\n<p>Through this project, we hosted multiple visitors in their labs, including 20 undergraduate students from Mexico through the TAMU-Mexico exchange progress and NSF REU students supported by NSF REU programs at TAMU.&nbsp; Through Aggieland Saturday at TAMU, we communicated the research work to local high school students who visits TAMU for the Saturday event.
