 "awd_abstract_narration": "Iron is an essential nutrient for the growth of phytoplankton in the oceans. As such, iron plays key roles in regulating marine primary production and the cycling of carbon. It is thus important that models of ocean biology and chemistry consider iron, in order to explore past, present and future variations in marine productivity and the role of the ocean in the global carbon cycle. In this joint project involving researchers in the U.S. and the U.K., supported by both NSF and the Natural Environment Research Council (U.K.), field data from the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) region will be combined with an established, state-of-the-art ocean biogeochemical model. By leveraging the known seasonal-scale physical, chemical and biological changes in the BATS region, the oceanographic context provided by the BATS core data, and an existing model of the regional physical circulation, the proposed study will yield process-related information that is of general applicability to the open ocean. In particular, the proposed research will focus on understanding the atmospheric input, biological uptake, regeneration and scavenging removal of dissolved iron in the oceanic water column, which have emerged as major uncertainties in the ocean iron cycle. The project will include significant educational and training contributions at the K-12, undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels, as well as public outreach efforts that aim to explain the research and its importance.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ability of ocean models to simulate iron remains crude, owing to an insufficient understanding of the mechanisms that drive variability in dissolved iron, particularly the involvement of iron-binding ligands, colloids and particles in the surface input, biological uptake, regeneration and scavenging of dissolved iron in the upper ocean. Basin-scale data produced by the GEOTRACES program provide an important resource for testing and improving models and, by extension, our mechanistic understanding of the ocean iron cycle. However such data provide only quasi-synoptic 'snapshots', which limits their utility in isolating and identifying the processes that control dissolved iron in the upper ocean. The proposed research aims to provide mechanistic insight into these governing processes by combining time-series data from the BATS region with numerical modeling experiments. Specifically, seasonally resolved data on the vertical (upper 2,000 meters) and lateral (tens of kilometers) distributions of particulate, dissolved, colloidal, soluble and ligand-bound iron species will be obtained from the chemical analysis of water column samples collected during five cruises, spanning a full annual cycle, shared with the monthly BATS program cruises. These data, along with ancillary data from the BATS program, will be used to test and inform numerical modeling experiments, and thus derive an improved understanding of the mechanisms that control the distribution and dynamics of dissolved iron in the oceanic water column.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIron is an essential micronutrient for marine phytoplankton, and the supply of dissolved iron (DFe) sets a limit on primary production over as much as one third of the surface ocean.  Availability of DFe thus exerts important controls on the ocean-atmosphere balance of carbon dioxide, hence global climate, and the ocean ecosystem.  As such, there is a need to include and accurately represent DFe in numerical models of the Earth system, in order to predict how future environmental changes will impact ocean biology and biogeochemistry.  Contemporary numerical models struggle to reproduce the observed spatial and temporal variations in DFe in the ocean, due to an imperfect mechanistic understanding of the processes that mediate the transformations between the various chemical forms of iron in the oceanic water column.\n\nThis project aimed to fill this knowledge gap by measuring the major chemical forms of dissolved and particulate iron in the water column at the open-ocean location of the Bermuda Atlantic Ocean Time-series Study (BATS) over one full annual cycle.  This study site was chosen because previous observations have revealed a large and consistent seasonal cycle in the concentration of DFe in the upper water column, which is driven by physical and biological processes that are well characterized by the monthly data collected by the ongoing BATS research program.  By combining our observations of the major inputs and forms of dissolved and particulate iron in the water column during winter, spring, summer and fall, together with numerical simulations using a state-of-the-art ocean biogeochemical model, we have arrived at a new conceptual framework for the processes that control the concentration of DFe in the ocean.  Specifically, these processes involve two largely independent pools of DFe, one being DFe that is chemically complexed or stabilized by dissolved organic compounds called ligands, and the other being colloidal iron oxyhydroxides that can aggregate to from authigenic particulate iron phases and eventually sink, thereby removing DFe from the water column.  Whereas previous research had emphasized organic ligands as playing a dominant role in controlling oceanic DFe concentrations, our results suggest that colloidal iron oxyhydroxides play a similarly major role in regulating DFe in the ocean.  When these two different DFe pools were represented in the numerical model, it was able to accurately simulate the distribution and seasonal variations of DFe in the BATS region, where previously it had failed (Figure 1).  Moreover, the new model formulation significantly improves model DFe simulations at the ocean-basin scale, suggesting that our new conceptual paradigm has general applicability for iron in the ocean.\n\nBroader impacts of this project have included the training and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students, and early-career researchers, as well as the mentoring of middle-school girls in an ocean science focussed summer program.  In addition, the improved understanding of the ocean iron cycle has advanced our ability to predict how ocean biology and chemistry will respond to future environmental changes, such as a warming climate and changes in the supply of iron-bearing dust to the surface ocean.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/27/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter N Sedwick"
