 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many important commercial processes involve turbulent flow of molten metal mixed with gas.   In steel continuous casting, used to manufacture 96% of steel in the US, problems with multiphase flow in the mold are responsible for most of the serious defects in final rolled steel products.  Detrimental flow patterns allow particles to become entrapped in the solidifying steel shell, where they form permanent defects, leading to surface pinholes, slivers, blisters, and expensive rejects.  With the difficulty of experimental measurements in the molten metal environment, computational models are an important tool to enable fundamental understanding of how these defects form, and to find windows of safe operating conditions to avoid them.  This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) Program award supports creation of a new computational tool to study multiphase flow in molten metal systems with inert gas injection, and to apply this tool to better understand and improve steel continuous casting, in order to minimize the entrapment of gas bubbles, inclusions, and slag particles.  This will benefit many engineering processes which involve these phenomena.  In particular, the application of these tools to steel continuous casting will improve the quality of steel slabs and competitiveness of the US steel industry. \r\n\r\nThis GOALI award supports a collaboration between University researchers experienced in computational modeling with an industry team at ArcelorMittal, experienced in conducting water modeling studies, measurements and trials in the operating steel plant, and metallurgical analysis of defects.  A comprehensive model system is being developed to accurately simulate gas flow through the nozzle refractories, passive gas aspiration into low pressure regions, bubble formation during injection, unsteady multiphase flow in the nozzle and mold that ranges from bubbly to slug flow with and without electromagnetic effects, and particle transport and entrapment into the final product.  Systematic measurements are being conducted at ArcelorMittal to quantify the size and location of entrapped bubble-related defects in many cast steel slabs, in order to validate the model system.  The validated models will provide new insights into defect formation, and ways to improve caster operations will be proposed and tested.  This fundamental project complements ongoing practical modeling efforts at the University Continuous Casting Consortium, which is currently supported by eleven member companies. Results will be conveyed to the steel industry via the Consortium and short courses to industry.",

Furthermore, continued viability of the high-volume low-profit-margin domestic steel industry depends upon improved efficiency and consistent steel quality, relative to low cost imports.</p>\n<p>Continuous casting is the last, most-important processing step in steelmaking, where inclusions, gas bubbles, and other particles that cause defects can either be generated or removed. Fig. 1 illustrates a critical portion of this important process, where molten steel in a holding vessel called a <em>tundish</em>, flows down through a ceramic nozzle, and into a bottomless, water-cooled copper mold. The flow rate is controlled either by a slide-gate valve system (shown here) or a stopper rod. Inside the mold, the steel flows in a turbulent manner according to the geometry of the nozzle outlet ports, and starts to solidify against the walls of the mold, forming a thin shell that is pulled down from the bottom of the mold at the <em>casting speed</em>. Below the mold, the thin shell acts as a container for the molten steel inside, and its exterior is further cooled by water sprays until the entire cast shape is fully solid.&nbsp; The solid steel is cut into desired lengths and then rolled into products such as sheets for car bodies, appliances, pipelines, and almost every other steel product.</p>\n<p>To prevent clogging during the process, argon gas is injected into the nozzle, where it eventually forms bubbles in the mold cavity. The buoyancy of the argon greatly affects the flow, making it difficult to predict. However, this complex flow pattern is of critical importance, because it determines how many detrimental particles are safely removed into the protective molten slag layer that floats on the top surface, and how many particles become entrapped into the solidifying steel shell to form defects in the final product. &nbsp;Bubbles captured during continuous casting are usually coated with brittle inclusions (Fig. 2a), which lowers the quality of final rolled products (Fig. 2b). To help control the flow, electromagnetic forces are often applied by powerful electromagnets outside the mold, but this causes further complexity to the flow.

Separate models were developed for the tundish, nozzles controlled by slide-gate or stopper rods, and the liquid cavity in the mold. The models account for thermal buoyancy, pressure drops, turbulence, varying size distribution of particles, their transport in the turbulent flow, and their capture into the solidifying steel shell. The result is an efficient system of computational models which can predict the number, size distribution and location of particle defects in the final cast product, coupled together according to Fig. 3. The project was very successful, because each model and the entire system together have been verified with other calculations, and validated with many different laboratory and plant measurements, where its predictions were found to be accurate. For example, Fig. 4 shows the shape of gas pockets that formed below a particular rectangular stopper-rod geometry, where X-ray videos were taken in special laboratory experiments using a low-melting temperature metal alloy. For the same conditions, our computer simulation was able to predict the size and shape of the gas pockets, and furthermore accurately predicted the size distribution of bubbles finally observed circulating in the mold.
