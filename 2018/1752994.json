 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor James Prell at the University of Oregon is developing analytical methods for accurately determining the composition of mixtures of large polymers and/or molecular assemblies using mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry is a tool for chemical analysis conventionally used to measure the mass and determine the structure of many types of molecules. Complex mixtures are a major target of research in industrial and biochemical applications as well as from the perspective of fundamental science. These mixtures can have properties that depend strongly on the relative amounts of their different constituents as well as how they are assembled. From synthetic chemicals to models of biological membranes, such systems can be extremely challenging to characterize using mass spectrometry or any other technique. Dr. Prell and his group are developing new approaches for these characterization challenges, ultimately seeking to facilitate precise control of physical and chemical properties. The project combines state-of-the-art mass spectrometry with advanced mathematical and signal processing tools. Publicly available, open-source software created as part of this project will be made available for researchers around the world to use in analyzing these types of samples. At the same time, Dr. Prell seeks to increase the participation of undergraduates from diverse backgrounds in STEM research through a research-based workshop course. Students in this course are learning and implementing strategies for communicating science research to audiences ranging from middle school through professional colleagues at regional and national STEM conferences.\r\n\r\nDr. Prell is establishing a vigorous, integrated program of research and education to simplify the analysis of nanoscale chemical assemblies using mass spectrometry, and to increase the retention and research participation of STEM undergraduates from underrepresented groups. There are three specific aims: 1) to establish Fourier Transform-based methodology for analyzing extremely congested electrospray mass spectra of mixed-subunit nanoassemblies, including copolymers and lipoprotein assemblies; 2) to introduce two-dimensional Fourier Transform-based measurement tools for signal isolation in extremely congested electrospray mass spectra of nanoassemblies for which prior ion mobility separation or ordinary Fourier Transform are insufficient; and 3) to increase undergraduate participation in and communication of scientific research. Measurement tools target characterization of subunit interactions, assembly shape and size, and assembly kinetics in a wide variety of applications related to the study of nanoassemblies. Software being developed is open-source and publicly available, allowing rapid implementation and adaptation by other research groups. Educational goals are being addressed by implementing a 1-credit workshop course for undergraduates at the University of Oregon using themes drawn from this research as prototypes. Students in the course develop \"elevator talks\" for delivery to a UO STEM bridge program; local middle- and high school outreach modules; and a research presentation abstract for submission to a regional or national scientific conference. These efforts build off of the PI's expertise in mass spectrometry and experience supporting URM student representation and inclusion in science as a faculty sponsor of UO's chapter of the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
