 "awd_abstract_narration": "Important mathematical structures can often be understood from very different perspectives, either by analyzing them with algebraic or analytic formulas or by regarding them geometrically.  This dual algebraic/geometric view is applied in many branches of mathematics, especially for the study of algebraic equations involving numbers (under the name of Diophantine geometry), the study of solutions to polynomial equations (under the name of algebraic geometry), or the study of the possible algebraic relations among solutions to systems of differential or difference equations (under the names of differential algebraic geometry or difference algebraic geometry,  respectively), among others. In practice, some of the questions considered in these areas suffer from extreme complexity inherited from their connection to number theory or to even more complicated domains. Work in mathematical logic has elucidated the boundary between those complicated theories and those admitting a tame, geometric theory. This research project aims to extend the class of theories for which a tame geometry can be established and to use these results from mathematical logic to answer questions from the target domains. \r\n\r\nThis research project studies the connections between geometries of various kinds, including algebraic, differential, Diophantine, and analytic geometries, through the model-theoretic lens of definability in suitable theories.  Mathematical theories as diverse as those of partial differential equations, difference equations, perfectoid spaces, formal geometry, algebraic dynamics, and homogenous dynamics will be studied. Technically, methods including geometric stability theory as applied to differentially closed fields, o-minimality, and quantifier elimination for valued differential fields and analytic difference rings will be applied for the purpose of answering questions internal to model theory (such as proving or refuting the trichotomy principle for regular types in differentially closed fields with several commuting derivations) and for applications to problems in functional transcendence, dynamics, and Diophantine geometry. It is anticipated that the work will have applications to the structure of algebraic differential equations, the arithmetic of dynamical systems, and mathematical physics, as well as in other areas.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project was devoted to the study of geometric problems through the lens of definabilty in natural structures. The main results of this project are as follows.\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\nWe resolved variants of the Mordell-Lang conjecture both in an algebraic dynamical formulation, for algebraic groups beyond semiabelian varieties, and in some cases in positive characteristic. Our methods permitted a conversion of some these problems to diophantine problems involving integers.\r\nBy developing a more flexible formalism for expressing polynomial compositional identities, we produced a strong classification of skew-invariant curves for twisted polynomial dynamical systems. The results deepened our understanding of the model theory of difference fields and allowed us to prove strong functional transcendence theorems for Mahler functions.\r\nEncoding the problem of solving Diophantine equations in rational numbers, we showed that a key linear algebraic step in the computation of lower bounds for distributed computing is likely algorithmically infeasible.\r\nUsing the complexity of definability in the integers coming from the proof of Gdel's Incompleteness Theorem, we established the exact complexity of the definable sets in finitely generated commutative rings.\r\n\r\n\n\nUsing ideas and deep results from geometric stability theory, we extended the theory of parameter identifiability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nWe extended elimination results for difference fields to the problems of solving systems of difference or difference-differential equations in rings of sequences. In a complementary direction, we established undecidability results for the corresponding questions for systems of equations involving several difference operators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nUsing o-minimal geometry and the model theory of differential fields we proved strong, effective finiteness theorems in the style of the Zilber-Pink conjecture for period mappings associated to variations of Hodge structure.\r\n\r\nWe presented the tilt/untilt correspondence of perfectoid geometry as a bi-interpretation in the sense of continuous logic and thereby justified general transfer principles.\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThis project has supported the training of a diverse group of doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers in the mathematical sciences.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/06/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ThomasWScanlon\n"
