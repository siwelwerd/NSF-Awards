 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mechanisms of SSB in Coordinating DNA Replication and Repair\r\n\r\nWhen enzymes duplicate chromosomal DNA or repair DNA damage, the DNA duplex is unwound and regions of single-stranded (ss) DNA are exposed. Single-stranded DNA binding proteins (SSBs) play a key role in protecting DNA from damage by binding ss DNA that forms during normal cellular processes. This project addresses the questions of how SSBs bind ss DNA tightly to protect it, but at the same time allow key enzymes to access the DNA to perform their necessary activities. A combination of biochemical and biophysical techniques will be used to investigate the interactions between SSB and three different enzymes that help replicate DNA or repair DNA damage. This project will also be used as a platform for teaching scientific concepts and techniques to students of all ages in order to foster their career development. Students ranging from high school to graduate school will be actively engaged in performing the experiments. More experienced students will be encouraged to mentor newer students, thus fostering their teaching and mentoring skills, as well as solidifying their own core knowledge. The students who work on the project will also develop YouTube video vignettes that use entertaining ways to explain the science behind the project to younger students to excite young students about science and to encourage more young people to explore STEM-related career opportunities. \r\n\r\n\r\nSingle-stranded DNA binding proteins (SSBs) bind single-stranded (ss) DNA intermediates of DNA metabolism to protect ssDNA from damage and to prevent the formation of potentially mutagenic DNA secondary structures. Another critical function of SSBs is to mediate genome maintenance pathways by physically and functionally interacting with many different enzymes. These basic functions of SSB are conserved in all domains of life, but they would seem to interfere with one another. This project uses an Escherichia coli model system to uncover general mechanisms by which SSB and enzymes cooperate to enhance the efficiency of enzyme-catalyzed reactions on DNA. Despite their critical importance, mechanisms by which SSB-enzyme interactions stimulate enzyme activity and allow enzymes to gain access to DNA are not fully defined. Moreover, few studies have measured both enzyme stimulation and DNA-SSB remodeling under the same kinetic conditions to determine how the two processes are linked. This research addresses these questions by: 1) defining mechanisms by which E. coli SSB stimulates enzyme activity, and 2) defining dynamic interactions between enzymes and DNA-SSB that give enzymes access to DNA substrates. Interactions of three model enzymes, a clamp loader, a DNA polymerase, and a DNA helicase, with SSB will be investigated. These enzymes were chosen because each acts on the same DNA substrate, and thus will encounter the same dynamic DNA-SSB structure. This will increase the impact of the findings by permitting identification of mechanisms that are common to all three enzymes, and those that may be specific for a given enzyme.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

When the DNA strands are separated for DNA replication or repair, the individual strands are more susceptible to DNA damage and prone to forming alternative structures which could hinder DNA replication and repair.

In bacteria, this protein is called single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB). The question that our project investigates is how the activities of enzymes that are needed for DNA replication and repair perform their functions on SSB-coated DNA. We used a bacterial (<em>Escherichia coli</em>) model system to compare and contrast the activities of four enzymes on DNA bound by SSB: a DNA polymerase that synthesizes new DNA, two related DNA helicases that unwind DNA for repair processes, and the DNA polymerase clamp loader that supports synthesis by the DNA polymerase during replication. Because SSB avidly binds ss DNA, it seems that SSB would hinder access of these enzymes to DNA and block their activities. Instead, SSB did not affect the progress of these enzymes and in some cases stimulated their activities. By direct physical interactions with SSB, these enzymes can rearrange SSB on DNA to gain access to DNA and perform their functions. A common theme was that SSB in turn stabilized the enzymes on DNA which enhanced their actions. When the binding site on SSB was mutated to weaken interactions with these enzymes, the mutant SSB protein hindered their activities. This shows that the physical interactions between the proteins and SSB allow the enzymes to overcome the barrier that is imposed by SSB on ss DNA. We were the first group to study one of the two helicases, YoaA, and defined its biochemical activities. We showed that YoaA borrows a known SSB binding protein, chi, to mediate interactions with SSB so that YoaA-chi complex can deal with SSB on DNA. Interestingly, the two related helicases, YoaA-chi and DinG, are affected by SSB differently, and we believe this is because the two helicases bind SSB differently. Based on our studies, we hypothesize that DinG binds behind SSB and pushes SSB on DNA where as YoaA-chi binds in front of SSB and pulls SSB along DNA.
