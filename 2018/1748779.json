 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tropical cyclone development is significantly affected by the presence of dry air and wind shear.  Wind shear can interact with the tropical cyclone vortex through a process called ventilation to inject cool, dry environmental air into the tropical system.  While it is well known that these processes exist, there is significant uncertainty as to how ventilation occurs and how it modulates tropical cyclone development.  This project will shed light on these issues by conducting a series of high-resolution numerical modeling simulations.  The main societal impact of the project will be improved knowledge of the factors that affect hurricane intensity, which is especially important for forecasts of hurricanes near populated and vulnerable areas.  The researchers also plan outreach events for students and the general public to enhance scientific literacy.  Two early career researchers will also be educated and trained under this project, ensuring the development of a highly capable workforce.\r\n\r\nThe research team plans an idealized modeling study to increase understanding of how dry air and vertical wind shear work synergistically through the process of ventilation to modulate tropical cyclone development.  The CM1 model will be used with different combinations of vertical wind shear and relative humidity, starting from tropical cyclones states with different initial intensities.  The simulations will be analyzed to test the following hypotheses:  1) low- and mid-level ventilation both increase as the relative humidity decreases and the vertical wind shear increases, but the ventilation pathway depends on the intensity of the TC, 2) mid-level ventilation is accomplished by vortex Rossby waves in the inner core and descending radial inflow in the stratiform region of TC rainbands, 3) ventilation increases lateral entrainment of low-moist static energy air into convection and convective/turbulent mixing of low-moist static energy air into the boundary layer, thereby weakening TC convection and the secondary circulation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

A strong, positive relationship was found between the low-level, upward vertical motion in the storm core and intensity (Figure 1).

This relationship suggests that physical processes that influence the area of upward motions, such as ventilation, directly influence the intensity of tropical cyclones.</p>\n<p>Second, we examined the structure of ventilation in the simulations and identified two distinct ventilation pathways: downdraft and radial ventilation (Figure 2). Downdraft ventilation occurs due to the evaporation of rain into dry air undercutting the storm. As a result, this evaporation generates negatively buoyant air that is flushed downward toward the surface. Downdraft ventilation typically occurs in rainbands that are organized on the side of the storm that is to the left of the shear direction. Radial ventilation occurs in horizontal currents that transport cooler, drier air from the environment around a storm closer toward the center. Such currents occur in the same rainbands that downdraft ventilation may be present in. Radial ventilation can also occur higher up in the atmosphere due to a misalignment of the vortex by the shear. Both downdraft and radial ventilation act to reduce the area of strong upward motion, thereby reducing the upward motion in the core, stunting storm development and intensification.</p>\n<p>Third, we used our definitions of downdraft and radial ventilation to look for evidence of ventilation in observations. At the start of a rapid weakening period in Hurricane Sam (2021),&nbsp;downdraft ventilation was documented using instruments dropped from aircraft (i.e., dropsondes) and aircraft-mounted radar observations from flights into the storm. This data revealed deep, and sometimes intense, downward vertical motions (Figure 3; blue shading). These strong downward motions can transport cold and/or dry air diagnosed from the dropsondes downward, cutting off the storm's supply of warm and moist air. Radial ventilation was also observed occurring at mid-to-upper levels of the troposphere on the side of the storm from which the shear was coming from (upshear) and at low-to-mid levels of the troposphere on the opposite side (downshear). All these signatures are broadly consistent with ventilation pathway findings in idealized model simulations.</p>\n<p>These newly discovered aspects of the impacts of ventilation on tropical cyclones have led to an improved understanding of physical processes affecting intensity change in tropical cyclones embedded in vertical wind shear. As&nbsp;tropical cyclones can cause large impacts on society and the economy, improved understanding, together with improvements in numerical weather prediction and forecast tools, can mitigate against these impacts. Observational analysis of ventilation can lead to real-time diagnostics that help with forecaster situational awareness.
