 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work will study how electrons and nuclei move inside of molecules. Observing such motion will advance physicists' understanding of many processes in nature such as vision, energy storage, energy conversion, and chemical transformation.  It is also important for fundamental approaches to the development of new technologies such as solar cells, ultrafast molecular switches, and quantum computers.  While lasers are natural tools for manipulating and measuring electrons in molecules, one requires very short laser pulses in order to manipulate electrons in real time.  The investigators in this project will use intense ultrashort laser pulses in order to ionize molecules, removing one of the many electrons bound to the molecule. They will take pictures of the electrons as they come off the molecules, making use of a technique called velocity map imaging. These pictures can be used to understand the coupled dynamics of electrons and nuclei during ionization, which is important for understanding chemical dynamics and for developing high speed electronics. \r\n\r\nThis project will make use of shaped few cycle laser pulses to study non-adiabatic and correlated strong field ionization of small molecules (~5-10 atoms). The investigators will control the shape of sub 10 fs (3-4 optical cycles) laser pulses, and make use of velocity map imaging in order to study the angle and momentum resolved photoelectron spectrum (in coincidence with fragment ions) as a function of laser pulse shape. This will help develop a deeper understanding of how electrons are removed from multiple orbitals, and the extent to which electron correlation and non-Born Oppenheimer dynamics play a role in the ionization dynamics. The investigators will also make use of strong field ionization as a probe of excited state dynamics, studying dissociation and internal conversion in families of homologous molecules in order to understand similarities and differences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project studied non-adiabatic molecular dynamics during strong field molecular ionization.  Strong field ionization is the first step in the process of generating attosecond laser pulses, which are key to following the rapid motion of electrons.  It is also an important tool for following nuclear dynamics via laser induced electron diffraction or Coulomb explosion imaging.  However, there are many aspects of strong field ionization in molecules that are not well understood, particularly the coupled motion of electrons and nuclei in the presence of the strong laser field driving the ionization.  This project used velocity map imaging of electrons and shaping of ultrafast laser pulses to study strong field molecular ionization and uncover the delicate interplay between electrons and nuclei in the strong field of the laser. \n\nVelocity map imaging produces a mapping of the momentum of electrons and ions produced by the interaction of a strong laser field and a molecule.  It allows one to infer the final state of a molecule after the light matter interaction.  Pulse shaping allows one to control the exact shape of the applied laser pulse and study the molecular response as a function of pulse shape.  For specific pulse shape parameterizations such as a \"pump-probe\" scan, one can get detailed insight into the molecular dynamics as a function of time by varying the delay between pump and probe pulses.  In this project, the ionization dynamics of several molecules were studied as a function of pump probe delay, with independent control over the pump and probe pulse amplitudes and phases.  This allowed us to see how the phase of the molecular wave function is affected by non-adiabatic dynamics which involve the coupled motion of electrons and nuclei.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/04/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas C Weinacht"
