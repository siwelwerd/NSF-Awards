 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cells contain molecular machines consisting of protein complexes that convert chemical energy into mechanical work. These machines use the work to help either assemble or disassemble cellular structures during vital cell processes. Understanding the mechanisms of action of these biological machines and their relationship with conformational changes in their substrates are among the challenges of modern molecular biology. This project uses computational modeling at multiple scales to elucidate how a class of molecular machines associated with microtubules accomplishes the severing of this largest structure in the cytoskeleton, whose dynamic organization and rearrangement is an essential process of cell division, motility, and development. This research will address a critical gap in our understanding of the dynamic properties of microtubules and their complexes with microtubule associated proteins undergoing wear and their dependence on the magnitude and geometry of mechanical input and will lead to a better understanding of how molecular machines work. The project will provide education and training of undergraduate and graduate students in computational biophysical chemistry by involving them in interdisciplinary scientific projects and increase the participation of groups underrepresented in science through the outreach at local Cincinnati Public School and through research experience opportunities for freshmen students participating in the \"Women in Science and Engineering\" program at the University of Cincinnati. The results of the project will be disseminated to the public by the investigator, postdoc, and students through publications, conference presentations, and visits to local schools. \r\n\r\nThis project will elucidate the major remodeling action of microtubules performed by severing enzymes from the ATPases Associated with various cellular Activities (AAA+) family. The multiscale simulations will determine molecular and thermodynamic parameters that characterize the breaking of a microtubule filament according to the proposed severing mechanisms. Because the action of AAA+ proteins is known to involve the application of pulling forces on their substrate proteins, in this project simulations that can reach the long time and length-scales required to follow the action of severing enzymes, primarily katanin in its hexameric functional states, will be complemented by experiments conducted by collaborators to extract markers of the unfoldase action on microtubules. Furthermore, the contribution of allosteric transitions between the active states of these hexameric enzymes to microtubule disassembly will be established. The combination of coarse-grained simulations and experiments will ultimately provide quantitative insight into the power stroke action of severing enzymes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Numerous efforts have been expended to characterize the interactions between microtubules and microtubule associated proteins (MAPs) that control their dynamic behavior in cells resulting in microtubules being assembled and disassembled where and when they are required by the cell. Two biologically relevant mechanisms of microtubule breakage have been observed in cells: breaking from high frequency buckling of filaments and breaking induced by the mechanical action of microtubule-severing enzymes. The severing enzymes, katanin and spastin, are molecular machines affecting such disparate processes as neuronal maintenance, cell motility, cell polarity, and cilia formation. Studies showed that severing is regulated by cellular biochemical and biophysical effectors, yet there is only limited information regarding the mechanism(s) of severing. Errors in the severing action are often associated with diseases such as neurological disorders and cancer. Understanding the mechanism of action of the microtubule severing machines is thus crucial for the development of effective disease therapies. The complexity of the interactions that provide the structural integrity of the severing machines and allow them to engage with the microtubule substrate, which is the largest polymer in the cell, require the combination of experimental and computational techniques to a yield a quantitative understanding of this fundamental biological process. Through support from my NSF-sponsored grant, my lab employed a macroscopic modeling approach that can follow the response of a biomolecule over the timescales and lengthscales required to determine the most likely mechanical action that explains the in vitro experimentally measured breaking of a microtubule by severing enzymes conducted in our collaborator&rsquo;s lab. Our results support the so-called death spiral model where severing is achieved by the coordinated action of multiple copies of a severing enzyme: each enzyme applies a pulling force on the tails of a tubulin dimer, resulting in the extension and translocation of the tail inside the pore of the enzyme. The reaction to this upward force results in a wedging force being applied on the microtubule surface, which is an efficient manner for breaking interfaces between subunits leading to the fragmentation of a number of protofilaments; continuous application of the pulling forces on dimers from the broken protofilament fragments eventually leads to extraction of mostly folded subunits from the filament. To further explore this mechanism, we developed the first full model of a spastin machine mounted on a standard microtubule filament and we observed that the spastin motor has to either detach from the microtubule or to break into lower order oligomeric species once a fragment starts to peel off from the lattice. A crucial question concerning severing enzymes is how does their allostery drive their action. Allostery has long been thought as playing a crucial role in the action of AAA+ proteins, but a characterization of the factors responsible for this long-distance transfer of perturbations in severing machines is lacking. To address this problem, we developed a multi-pronged approach that employed methods from evolutionary information, to graph-based networks, to machine learning applied to atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of spastin and katanin. Our results indicate that the severing action is carried out by the highly correlated terminal protomers and their immediate neighbors, while the internal protomers act as scaffolding for the motor. In contrast, disease-related mutations at allosteric sites result in the loss of the correlated action of the terminal protomers thus offering microscopic insight into what drives the altered action of the severing enzymes in disease. Furthermore, combining our computational modeling with experimental studies performed by our collaborator, we showed that the action of katanin is highly dependent on the tubulin code, which is the set of tubulin isotypes and post-translational modifications occurring on the tubulin tails.
