 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1914, Einstein brought forth his foundations for General\r\nRelativity (GR) to explain gravity using the geometry of space and\r\ntime. Einstein's GR ushered in the beginning of a new scientific\r\nparadigm shift for the science of the origin and evolution of the\r\nuniverse (\"Cosmology\"). This is now a golden age, similar to the\r\ncenturies around Plato, Copernicus and Newton, and we are privileged\r\nto be witnesses to this paradigm shift in real-time. All scientific\r\nparadigms go through a long period of intense testing, as the data and\r\nthe scientific methods push the theory to its limits. The Universe is\r\nso vast that there are physical scales on which GR should apply, but\r\nwhich have been difficult to test. Consider clusters of galaxies,\r\nwhich are the largest gravitationally bound objects in the Universe.\r\nClusters entrap galaxies on scales of tens of millions of light years\r\n(i.e, 100 times larger than our own Milky Way). Does Einstein's GR\r\nstill apply over such large distances in space-time?\r\n\r\nThe escape velocity from a galaxy cluster is a combination of the\r\nlocal Newtonian gravitational potential and the acceleration of the\r\nexpansion of the Universe. Weak lensing mass profiles of clusters can\r\nbe used to predict the escape velocity profile from the gravitational\r\nNewtonian component and cosmology. This joint analysis provides a new\r\ndirect avenue to constrain the dynamics of the expanding Universe and\r\ncan simultaneously test GR and our standard Lambda CDM cosmological\r\nparadigm, time evolving dark energy, Chameleon gravity, and more. We\r\nwill use the Michigan Magellan Fiber System (M2FS) to collect 100-200\r\ngalaxy cluster member spectra for escape velocities of clusters within\r\nthe Dark Energy Survey (DES) footprint.  We will directly compare the\r\nweak-lensing predicted escape velocity profiles to the observed\r\nprofiles from the M2FS data in a likelihood analysis. Given a Hubble\r\nconstant prior, this probe can achieve similar or better precision on\r\nthe dark energy equation of state parameters compared to supernovae or\r\nthe CMB.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
