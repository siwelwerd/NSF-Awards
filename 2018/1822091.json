 "awd_abstract_narration": "An estimated 330 million urban households worldwide live in substandard or unaffordable housing.  By 2025, that number is expected to climb to 440 million households, representing 1.6 billion people.  This interdisciplinary research project will analyze the ramifications of accelerating urbanization and rising housing costs in global perspective.  By focusing on several major cities that are responding to affordable housing shortages in different ways, this project will provide new understanding regarding the effectiveness and unanticipated consequences of different government policies.  The research team will generate new data and analyses about processes of global urbanization, the relationship between housing and poverty, and the large-scale environmental impact of expanding cities.  The project will produce policy-relevant findings regarding the effectiveness and unanticipated consequences of various strategies, policies, and responses.  The researchers will document how the development of certain ideas and laws helped to contribute to the current crisis, which will provide lessons for planners and other decision makers.  The project also will catalogue the human costs of the crisis and record how housing policies work on a day-to-day basis, offering policy makers new insights into the complex nature of the problem.\r\n\r\nThrough their analysis of four cities on four different continents (New York in the U.S., London in the United Kingdom, Lagos in Nigeria, and Delhi in India), the investigators will identify key sources of the global affordable housing crisis by exploring the historical record, present-day strategies of housing provision, and a range of social and environmental transformations taking place in territories far removed from the city.  They will document multiple consequences of the affordable housing crisis, including historical processes of dispossession and land enclosure, present-day survival strategies of low-income families in high-cost cities, and broader trends of accelerated urbanization.  They also will assess why cities have responded to the affordable housing crisis in vastly different ways as well as the consequences of those varied responses for low-income families, cities, and surrounding environments.  The investigators will analyze infrastructure and property relations, urban poverty and housing market dynamics, migration patterns, and flows of capital and other resources.  Historical geoparsing algorithms will analyze a large textual database of archival sources that document the worldwide contestation of property rights in the 20th century.  Ethnographic fieldwork in the four focal cities will document the everyday lives of low-income residents and analyze how different housing policies play out on the ground level.  Macrospatial and geographic methods will map large-scale data about infrastructural systems to connect cities and their hinterlands, highlighting territories and resource.  This project is supported through the NSF Interdisciplinary Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (IBSS) competition.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In order to measure patterns of urbanization, the team pursued a mixture of archival and digital methods, including the integration of remote sensing data with photographic images collected through Google Street View.  These methods provided the team with a historical baseline from which to measure change in a systematic and consistent fashion on a regional basis.  Rather than rely primarily on government records, census counts, and conventional measures of urban growth, the team combined these important sources of information with independent empirical measurements of urban footprints, zones of recent urban occupation, and related audits of housing quality and density.  Our team's work shows how formal systems, such as zoning ordinances, can easily become overwhelmed by \"informal\" facts on the ground, as the struggle for basic rights to housing unfolds on Latin America's urban peripheries.  The models for measurement and code for extracting and building urban extents in historical series from Landsat imagery are published on GitHub.  Peer reviewed articles relating to this work have been published, submitted, or are currently in the final phase of writing. The team has been able to build international collaborations with a team of urbanists in Colombia (Universidad de los Andes) as well as to train a large number of students (ranging from undergraduates to postdocs) in digital methods, GIS techniques, and the analysis of urban change and social inequality.\n\n \nThe Street View Team\n\n \nFour graduate students conducted preliminary preliminary fieldwork in four cities, gaining valuable training and research experience from the experience.  One of the students is completing a dissertation on housing dynamics and has secured a job at Mathematica; another is pursuing a career as a writer, enrolled in NYU's MFA program; and the other two are continuing as graduate students.  \n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ellen J Guldi"
