 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to University of Hawaii at Hilo, located in Hilo, HI, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2018-2020. The REU program places primary emphasis on tropical ecological research in degraded ecosystems. Interns will participate in professional development, field trips, and outreach, attend the State's annual conservation science conference, and prepare an oral presentation and final paper. This work is expected to spark the research careers for the next generation of environmental problem-solvers through intensive writing training, solution-oriented research topics, and a supportive program structure. The program concentrates on the health and restoration of degraded ecosystems by investigating the spatial spread of degradation as well as ecosystem functioning of resilient communities. The primary focus will be on attracting students with a passion for the environment and nurturing the confidence, skill set and ability to effect positive change and pursue a viable career in this field. \r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily underrepresented minority students (Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander in particular), first-generation college students, and students with little to no research experience, will work with a diverse team of faculty mentors on projects focused on the ecology of degraded landscapes. Students will learn how research is conducted, and present the results of their work at an internal symposium as well as at scientific conferences.\r\n\r\nA common web-based assessment tool used by all REU Site programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program as well as multiple internal methods. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program is available by visiting http://hilo.hawaii.edu/uhintern, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Ostertag at ostertag@hawaii.edu), co-PI (Dr. Puniwai-Ganoot at npuniwai@hawaii.edu), or project coordinators (Linnea Heu and Rita Miller at uhintern@hawaii.edu).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Weekly in-person interactions include our M&#257;huahua (professional development workshops) and huaka&#699;i (service-learning excursions). The in-person nature of these activities also facilitates a deeper connection between staff and interns, as many of our M&#257;huahua and huaka&#699;i involve group interactions. Mentors are also invited to these activities. Students also attend the Hawaii Conservation Conference, which was held in Honolulu for the first two years of the program until COVID interfered; they have some mandatory sessions they attend and also are exposed to networking opportunities. Finally, we provide training for mentors called Kumu M&#257;huahua, where in three lunchtime sessions we explore student self-efficacy, different learning styles, tips for motivating their interns, and the process of building confidence and encouraging teamwork.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Students must complete an internship development plan, which functions like a proposal of the planned work and involves input from their mentor.

The final deliverables are an oral presentation and a written report in a scientific writing style that is worked on in sections over the summer. All REU students gave an oral presentation at the end of the summer at our annual symposium, with at least 100 faculty, students, and conservation agency personnel in attendance. The symposium was streamed online via YouTube to reach a broader audience and for partners, mentors, family, and friends who could not attend in person.

In addition, some are in MS programs (2 alumni are in the Tropical Conservation and Environmental Science program at UH Hilo) and some are currently applying for MS and PhD programs. In total, 12 conference presentations and 10 peer-reviewed publications have been associated with this award. The UH Hilo REU program is one of many supportive programs and experiences which contributes to the success of an individual student and ultimately the entire field of conservation science.</span></p>\n<div><span><br /></span></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/28/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Rebecca&nbsp;Ostertag</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757875/1757875_10532619_1687963824989_KIMG0308--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757875/1757875_10532619_1687963824989_KIMG0308--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Orientation 2021\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757875/1757875_10532619_1687963824989_KIMG0308--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Orientation 2021\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">PIPES interns, including REU interns, participate in community service work at a local fish pond, during the program orientation that occurs the first week of the program</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Linnea Heu</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Rebecca&nbsp;Ostertag</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Orientation 2021</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757875/1757875_10532619_1687964017151_Ui_Lab1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757875/1757875_10532619_1687964017151_Ui_Lab1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Molecular research\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757875/1757875_10532619_1687964017151_Ui_Lab1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Molecular research\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REU intern Taylor (U'i) Barongen conducts lab work for her molecular research project</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Linnea Heu</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Rebecca&nbsp;Ostertag</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Molecular research</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757875/1757875_10532619_1687987206848_KNexercise--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757875/1757875_10532619_1687987206848_KNexercise--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Orientation topics\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757875/1757875_10532619_1687987206848_KNexercise--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Orientation topics\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The week-long orientation program includes topics of research ethics, professionalism, and community-based research, shown here by workshops where interactive scenarios are discussed.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Cherie Pauahi</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Rebecca&nbsp;Ostertag</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Orientation topics</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757875/1757875_10532619_1687987358146_2018-07-2515.53.22--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757875/1757875_10532619_1687987358146_2018-07-2515.53.22--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Presentation of research\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757875/1757875_10532619_1687987358146_2018-07-2515.53.22--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Presentation of research\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REU intern Leilani Sablan talks about her research in an informal roundtable session at the Hawaii Conservation Conference in Honolulu</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Linnea Heu</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Rebecca&nbsp;Ostertag</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Presentation of research</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757875/1757875_10532619_1687988645902_20190621_094131--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757875/1757875_10532619_1687988645902_20190621_094131--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Huaka'i\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757875/1757875_10532619_1687988645902_20190621_094131--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Huaka'i\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Most Fridays are huaka'i (field trip) days, attended by all PIPES in which we partner with community groups, to learn about conservation efforts and develop a sense of place.
