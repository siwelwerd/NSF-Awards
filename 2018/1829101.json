 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports fundamental research to provide new knowledge that paves the way for a systematic design of advanced geopolymer composites. Geopolymer composites are a new class of amorphous polymeric hybrids with attractive attributes that have the potential to drastically change the way composites materials are synthesized. Geopolymer-based hybrids are relevant to a vast array of fields such as civil, aerospace, mechanical, and biomedical engineering. However, established relationships between performance, chemistry, and composition are lacking. As a consequence, the widespread application of geopolymer-based materials has been impeded, despite their high potential. The integration of cutting-edge experiments with advanced computational modeling will accelerate the discovery of high-performance multifunctional structural composites. Geopolymer composites have been theorized for many interdisciplinary applications including enhanced-performance construction materials, passive cooling systems for buildings, biomaterials for bone repair, membranes for clean energy generation, and sound insulation systems. Therefore, results from this research will benefit the U. S. economy and society, and spur materials discovery. This research involves the collaboration between three institutions and across disciplines including nanoscience, solid mechanics, and materials science. Comprehensive outreach activities will be implemented in collaboration with local high schools to contribute to raising the next generation of materials scientists. Therefore, the multi-disciplinary approach will help broaden participation of underrepresented groups in research and positively impact engineering education.\r\n\r\nGeopolymers are amorphous inorganic polymers that result from the reaction between an aluminosilicate source and an alkali metal hydroxide or silicate solution. Despite a wealth of studies, the origin of the strength of geopolymer composites is not fully understood. This research is to fill the knowledge gap by connecting the effective response to the micro- and nano- constituents based on continuum and computational micromechanics integrated with nanoscale mechanical characterization methods. The research team will formulate a theoretical micromechanics model to predict the macroscopic constitutive behavior, articulate new variational solutions using the modified secant approach within nonlinear homogenization theory, build a periodic microfield finite element model that accounts for multiaxial loading cases as well as morphological features, test the hypothesis that nano-porosity is the driving factor controlling the macroscopic mechanical response, validate the theoretical models by carrying out nano- and macro-scale mechanical tests on microsphere-reinforced potassium-based geopolymer composites, and establish correlations between nano- and micro-scale characteristics and the macroscopic behavior.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Geopolymer composites were found to exhibit a pressure-dependent granular behavior, with the porosity being subdivided into nanoporosity and microporosity. Our results indicated that the nanoporosity is solely influenced by the chemistry and is not influenced by the processing and the presence of reinforcement. The nanogranular structure and the chemical composition at the nanometer scale have a profound influence on the effective mechanical response.</p>\n<p>We formulated advanced synthesis protocols for metakaolin-based geopolymers reinforced with carbon nanofibers (CNFs) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). We found that CNFs lead to a densification of the microstructure, and we noted an increase in indentation modulus and in indentation hardness. A similar inner strengthening effect was also observed with MWCNTs as MWCNTs reduced the microporosity, resulting in an increase in the indentation modulus and hardness for the dominant microphase. We found that CNFs enhance the fracture toughness and the fracture energy. Similarly, MWCNTs increased the fracture toughness. For CNFs, we observed crack-bridging mechanisms in geopolymer nanocomposites. For MWCNTs, MWCNTs acted as bridges for fracture surfaces and connections for pores. Therefore, carbon-based nanomaterials such as CNFs and MWCNTs promote the geopolymerization reaction, strengthen the geopolymer skeleton, affect the pore structure, and improve mechanical characteristics.</p>\n<p>We investigated the behavior of rock-based geopolymers synthesized using feldspathic rocks. We found that the geopolymerization products involve two phases: polysialate geopolymer and sodium aluminosilicate hydrates (N-A-S-H). When used as raw materials, feldspathic rock serve as both catalysts and fillers in geopolymer composites resulting in advanced materials with enhanced strength and fracture response.</p>\n<p>Broader Impacts:</p>\n<p>The research yielded advanced designs and protocols for the synthesis of enhanced performance geopolymer composites and cement nanocomposites: our protocols were archived in four patent applications and ten scientific articles in high-impact scientific research journals.

The project also supported five undergraduate students (Herbert Elyse, Raymonde Council, Mairi Glynn, Junior Ndayikengurukiye, and Nadiah Zamri), including four female students and three African American students, in advanced materials design and materials nanoscience.
