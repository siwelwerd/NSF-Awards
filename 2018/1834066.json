 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) program supports the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need.  This S-STEM project at Florida International University aims to increase the number of students with financial need who earn an undergraduate geoscience degree in four years and successfully enter the\r\ngeoscience workforce or graduate school.  Over a five-year period, this project will fund 24 scholarships to undergraduate students who are pursuing bachelor's degrees in the geosciences, including atmospheric sciences. Scholars will enter the University as two cohorts of 12 students who will take similar classes.  The Scholars will be mentored, receive math tutoring, have internship opportunities, and go on a week-long geosciences field trip to the Appalachian Mountains.  \r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project are to provide students with scholarships, as well as academic and social supports to help them graduate in four years. The project aims to reduce student debt and provide the training needed to pursue a career or graduate studies in geosciences. The project will measure student success in both time-to-degree and future career path.  Education research will investigate how student experiences as part of a cohort contribute to retention in the geosciences and on-time graduation. Specifically, the research will focus on students' perceptions of their developing identity as geoscientists, their sense of belonging in the geoscience discipline, and their access to social capital within Florida International University's Geosciences Department. This information will provide the researchers with insights into how the cohort provides the students with a community of support. The results of the research will be used to refine ongoing cohort activities, as well as departmental teaching practices and activities, and will be communicated to other geosciences communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe aim of the Future Generation of Geoscientists program was to provide low income, undergraduate geoscience majors (Geology and Atmospheric Sciences) at Florida International University with support (financial, social, educational and professional) in an effort to increase the graduation rate and decrease the time to degree while providing pathways to employment or graduate school. The program provided support in the form of scholarships ranging from $500 to $7000 a semester to 51 students. The average amount of the scholarship was $1000 per student per semester and determined according to the financial needs of each student. Students were also provided support in the form of membership in professional geology and meteorology societies, travel to the mid-Atlantic to experience Appalachian geology, attend national science conferences and conduct internships in university laboratories. \r\n\n\nIntellectual Merit: Students were provided programing both inside and outside the classroom to enrich their professional skills and experiences as geologists and atmospheric scientists. Activities included field trips to observe Appalachian geology, local geology and well drilling operations. Atmospheric students participated in the WxChallenge, a nation-wide intercollegiate weather forecasting competition. Alumni with geoscience careers interacted with the students as guests in classrooms, off campus during field trips and as hosts of professional development seminars. Workshops on How to write a resume, \"How to prepare to take the Fundamental of Geology Exam\" and How to apply to Graduate School were offered. During their senior year, students completed a capstone course, Senior Seminar, where they wrote a short research paper and completed an oral presentation of their research. Student research projects resulted in the completion of the website Tropical Cyclone Accumulated Precipitation from IMERG: Storms per basin from 2000 until 2019 (http://tcpf.fiu.edu/tc_storms_IMERG.html) and a publication in FIUs Undergraduate Research Journal. \r\n\n\nSurveys of the students in the program determined that relationships with faculty and other students helped them to identify as geologists or atmospheric scientists. Students tended to identify with their chosen degree program in their later years and suggested integrating more community building opportunities in the first couple of years so they could identify with other students earlier. Surveys of faculty in the program mentioned overwhelmingly that the program benefited the department by providing opportunities for low-income students, developing their identity as geoscientists/atmospheric scientists, assisting them in completing their degrees, and encouraging them to enter the geoscience workforce or graduate school. Faculty also felt the program benefited their research and careers by having undergraduates conduct research in their laboratories, presenting at professional meetings and development of new websites and publications.\r\n\n\nBroader Impacts: By the end of the program, 29 (69%) of the 51 supported students had graduated. Of those, 11 applied or went onto graduate school and another 11 obtained jobs in their fields. Most of the geology graduates obtained positions as geologists or hydrogeologists with environmental consulting companies in Florida, with one employed with a mining company in Nevada. The atmospheric sciences students found employment as Meteorologists in private industry, the National Weather Service, and the Navy. As a majority of the students in the program were from groups typically underrepresented in STEM fields (67% Hispanic, 8% Black and 2% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander), the program contributed to diversifying the geosciences and atmospheric sciences workforce.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/27/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ReneMPrice\n"
