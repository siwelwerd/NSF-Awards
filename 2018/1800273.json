 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Ross A. Widenhoefer in the Department of Chemistry at Duke University investigates the mechanisms of gold-catalyzed chemical reactions, especially those in which a divalent carbon atom is transferred to a carbon-carbon double bond to form a cyclopropane. This is a synthetic transformation of growing importance. Studies include experiments to determine the scope and mechanisms of gold-catalyzed processes and the structure of gold complexes. This research provides mechanistic insight that will serve the ever growing global community of researchers working toward the development of new and more efficient gold(I) catalyzed transformations. Research activities are fully integrated into the scientific education and training of graduate and undergraduate student researchers, including students from groups traditionally underrepresented in the sciences. Graduate students augment their research experience through participation in educational activities offered through the Duke University Graduate School.  Graduate students also participate in community outreach activities in collaboration with Dr. Ben Bobay of the Duke Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) center which provide local high school students with hands-on exposure to modern high-field NMR spectroscopy and one-on-one instruction in the processing and interpretation of NMR data.\r\n \r\nThis project investigates the structure and reactivity of gold carbenoid complexes and cationic gold carbene complexes, including those relevant to gold-to-alkene carbene transfer (cyclopropanation), gold alpha-oxo carbene and carbenoid complexes, and cationic beta, gamma-unsaturated gold carbene complexes.  Despite a growing body of work in this area, limited experimental information is available regarding mechanisms which involve these gold complexes. Research activities fill important gaps in this field and develop an experimentally-grounded understanding of the nature of the complexes generated either through carbene transfer from stabilized diazo compounds or through the oxidation of alkenes in the presence of gold. The research addresses three main areas of inquiry:  (1) elucidation of the mechanisms of gold to alkene carbene transfer by modeling the transition state for carbene transfer, independent synthesis of gold metallacyclobutane complexes, and  kinetic analysis of gold to alkene carbene transfer under stoichiometric conditions; (2) evaluation of the nature and reactivity of cationic gold alpha-oxo carbene and carbenoid complexes by studying the reactions of gold complexes with stabilized N- and S-ylides and the reactions of pyridine N-oxides and with cationic gold complexes;  and (3) interrogation of the structure and reactivity of unsaturated gold carbene complexes through the synthesis and characterization of cationic gold allenylidene and vinyl carbene complexes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n            One of the most important developments in homogenous catalysis since the turn of the century has been the emergence of cationic gold(I) complexes as catalysts for the functionalization of C-C multiple bonds.  Cationic gold carbene and/or carbenoid complexes have been invoked as intermediates in a significant number of these gold(I)-catalyzed transformations, most notably the cycloaddition of 1,n-enynes and the diverse array of carbene transfer reactions.  However, an understanding of the structures of cationic gold carbene and carbenoid complexes and the mechanisms carbene transfer reactions has lagged significantly behind the synthetic development of this chemistry, with available information derived largely from computational analyses rather than experimental observation.  For these reasons, our research activities during the tenure of this grant were directed toward addressing some of the most notable gaps in our understanding of the structures and behavior of gold carbene and carbenoid complexes.  Specifically, we sought to (1) elucidate the mechanisms of gold to alkene carbene transfer, (2) evaluate the nature and reactivity of cationic gold &alpha;-oxo carbene and carbenoid complexes, and (3) evaluate the electronic structure and reactivity of two-coordinate &alpha;,&beta;-unsaturated gold carbene complexes. \n\n            The intellectual merit of the research activities conducted during the tenure of this grant is three-fold.  Firstly, our efforts directed toward the synthesis of &alpha;,&beta;-unsaturated gold carbene complexes have produced the first examples of cationic gold allenylidene and vinyl carbene complexes lacking &pi;-conjugated heteroatom substituents. Spectroscopic interrogation of these complexes established the significant delocalization of positive charge into the organic groups bound to the electrophilic carbene carbon atom and reactivity studies established nucleophilic trapping at the carbene carbon atom and/or &beta;-carbon atom.  Secondly, our efforts directed toward the synthesis of gold &alpha;-oxo carbenoid complexes have produced the first well-defined examples of these complexes and have established the stability of these complexes toward nucleophilic attack.  This latter characteristic argues strongly against the intermediacy of gold &alpha;-oxo carbenoid complexes and their variants in gold-catalyzed alkyne oxidation processes.  Thirdly, our efforts directed toward elucidating the mechanisms of gold to alkene carbene transfer have demonstrated for the first time gold to alkene carbene transfer from a gold sulfonium benzylide complex and cyclopropane formation via ionization of gold &gamma;-methoxy alkyl complexes.  Our investigations of these transformations provide new insight into the mechanism and transition state geometry of gold to alkene carbene transfer.  Taken together, the results and conclusions derived from our research activities conducted during the tenure of this grant will provide mechanistic insight that will serve the ever growing global community of researchers working toward the development of new and more efficient gold(I) catalyzed transformations involving cationic gold carbene complexes.  \n\n            The broader impacts of the activities conducted during the tenure of this grant stem from (1) the integration of scientific discovery with the training and education, (2) improving the graduate school educational experience, and (3) community outreach.  The PI has sought to provide meaningful research experiences for undergraduate and graduate student participants and to encourage both female students and students from traditionally underrepresented minority groups to participate in the PI's research program and to pursue STEM-related careers.  With the objective of providing a more balanced graduate educational experience for students who are interested in pursuing careers in education at predominantly undergraduate institutions, these students have participated in a range of educational programs offered through the Duke Graduate School and the Department.  With respect to community outreach, the PI has implemented a high school outreach program in collaboration with Dr. Darrell Spells at the North Carolina School of Science and Math (NCSSM) and Dr. Ben Bobay of the Duke University NMR Center that provides hands-on experience and instruction in the use of high-field NMR spectroscopy.  To date, ~120 high school students from the NCSSM have participated in this program although the positive impact of these outreach activities were significantly curtailed during the tenure of this grant owing to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictions.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ross A Widenhoefer"
