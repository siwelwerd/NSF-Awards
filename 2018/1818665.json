 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Winston Salem State University seeks to improve undergraduate students' preparation and success by promoting multidisciplinary learning through integrating physics, music, and biology. Undergraduate students are involved in the project as researchers. \r\n\r\nThis project has the goal to establish an enriching interdisciplinary experience for undergraduate students that intersects physics, music, and biology through course redesign, research, and outreach. This will be achieved through the following activities and strategies: a course entitled \"Music Physics/Acoustics\" will be redesigned to integrate active learning through the use of music to enhance learning in physics and biology; undergraduate students will conduct research with the faculty; and undergraduate students will be involved in disseminating the components of the project through presentations, a one-week summer research program, and interactions with the K-12 community. This project is guided by formative and summative evaluation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe Targeted Infusion Project: Enriching Student Learning through Biophysics and Music at Winston Salem State University (WSSU) was a multidisciplinary project designed to promote and enhance learning physics through the integration of music and biology. While this project was originally designed to strengthen the knowledge and understanding of physics for students at WSSU, it had a significant impact on K-12 and the community. The key components of the project were: i) course redesign; ii) research; and iii) outreach. In the aspect of course redesign, the project team created both a lecture (Biophysics of Music) and research/laboratory course (Investigation and Research: Biophysics of Music) that focused on the integration of physics, music, and biology. Within the investigation and research course, a highlight was that students developed an experimental design for how to bake a cake from beginning to end, and addressed the physics, music, and biology involved in the process; a taste test of each cake occurred. For the research component, numerous students had distinct research projects where they worked with at least one faculty member within the team. Some of the research topics included: skin conductivity response to music, enhancing learning physics through music and biology, musical effect of cellular viability and replication, musical genre influence on electrical response, and beat frequency impact on eye movement. The research students disseminated their work by presenting poster and oral presentations on a local and national level. Some of the conferences included: Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students, National Council for Undergraduate Research Conference, WSSU Scholarship Day, and the American Physical Society Meeting. This project was also presented at the NSF HBCU-UP PI Meeting. Lastly with outreach, several community events were performed to educate the surrounding community about how physics, music and biology intersect. Some of the events included: A Day of Force & Movement with Erwin Montessori, Biophysics of Cycling with the Chancellor, and Feel the Beat: The Science & Energetics of the Skin. A highlight to the project teams outreach efforts was during the summer of 2020, where the first Biophysics of Music Virtual Summer Program was held. Amid COVID-19, this four-week program included middle school, high school and college students across North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, where there was a themed focus each week: Week 1 (mechanics); Week 2 (sound); Week 3 (forces); and Week 4 (electricity). Each week was filled with live educational sessions, experiments, and guest speakers. The speakers included a dancer/choreographer, a sound engineer, a US Navy Commander, and a neurophysiologist. Student teaching assistants were available, where they held virtual tutoring hours and facilitated breakout sessions with the students in the program. More information about the summer program can be found at: https://sites.google.com/view/2020-biophysics-of-music-virtu/home.\n\n\nBroader Impacts\n\n\nBeing that STEM recruitment and retention are ongoing problems not only at WSSU, but throughout the nation, the efforts of this work served as a platform for improving this deficit by equipping underrepresented individuals with tools to be successful in STEM. This project provided the opportunity for students to gain undergraduate research experience, as well as leadership skills. Throughout the duration of the project, more than 400 K-12 and college students, as well as the community were impacted by the outcomes of this project. Furthermore, aspects of this project had a positive effect on K-12 teachers, administrators, counselors, collegiate faculty, and staff, ultimately leading to a greater understanding of physics and how it applies to everyday life. The outcomes of this work were also published.\n\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\n\nThis project was the first of its kind at Winston Salem State University, and uniquely demonstrated how physics, biology and music significantly intersect to enhance a more thorough understanding, compared to each of the concepts taught individually. The project provided a new and effective approach for a wide range of students and the community to become engaged and excited about STEM, and especially physics.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: TennilleDPresley\n"
