 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Description\r\n\r\nOrganic semiconductors (OSCs) are a class of materials that combine the electronic properties of semiconductors with the chemical and mechanical properties of organic compounds, such as polymers. OSCs have unique characteristics and offer fundamentally new approaches to harvest energy, making them increasingly interesting for a range of emerging technology applications, including sustainable energy, electronics and biomedicine. However, limitations in the ability to predict, synthesize and control OSCs and to understand the complexities of matter across a range of scales hamper their broad application. This project aims to overcome these barriers by generating the knowledge needed to extend the utility of OSCs into the infrared region (IR) and control electronic correlations in organic and hybrid systems. The research includes the development of new materials and systems that have unique electronic, and optical properties for present and future science and engineering challenges such as sustainable energy, electronics, and biomedicine. Applications include solar cell devices, hybrid electronics, bioimaging and biosensing. A new interdisciplinary material research Center for Emerging Molecular Optoelectronics (CEMOs) will be formed. Through this Center, the project will share resources and leverage partnerships among Mississippi institutions of higher learning, national laboratories, and industry as well as establish national and international collaborations to strengthen the research capacity and to build and train an inclusive workforce in optoelectronics.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\n\r\nThe processes of capturing energy from IR light and controlling electronic correlations in organic and hybrid systems has profound implications for next generation energy technologies and for developing materials with novel optoelectronic functionalities. CEMOs will develop theoretical and experimental tools, materials, and techniques to overcome fundamental limitations of OSCs. Theoretical models will be developed to establish design rules for guiding experiments, materials development, predicting properties, and tailoring morphology to understand complex contributions affecting optical and electrical processes. Systematic and iterative research approaches in theory and experiments will provide understanding of how photophysical, electronic, structural, and morphological properties relate to elementary excitations, dynamic processes, and electronic correlations within complex materials systems. The project team will synthesize new materials capable of optical to electrical signal transduction of longer wavelength light and develop new engineering routes to meet technologically challenging IR applications, including biomedicine and biosensing. The Center's education, outreach, and workforce development efforts will serve to support the development of a qualified STEM workforce in Mississippi, including new faculty hires and student engagement that will increase diversity at all levels. CEMOs will facilitate the development of research capabilities, infrastructure, and education opportunities in the areas of energy, advanced manufacturing, and health in alignment with the state's Science and Technology priorities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
