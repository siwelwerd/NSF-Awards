 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study investigates how stereotypes about race and gender affect support for black women political candidates.  The vast majority of political science research on race and gender examines these two identities separately.  Consequently, little is known about how race and gender stereotypes interact when a minority female candidate runs for office. This project examines how black women candidates face distinct stereotypes based on the intersection of their race and gender, which make it more difficult for them to win votes in political campaigns.  This study advances our knowledge of the ways stereotypes affect black women differently than other underrepresented groups, such as white women and black men. This research also has the potential to help black women candidates understand the types of campaign messages that exacerbate negative stereotypes the public holds about black women and which strategies could help mitigate the influence of these stereotypes.  As a result, black women candidates may be better able to counteract negative stereotypes through their campaigns and increase their representation in elected office.  \r\n\r\nScholars of intersectionality theory emphasize that race and gender are mutually constructed identities, such that their combined influence is not necessarily equal to sum of its parts.  Yet, most research in political science still examines race and gender in isolation from one another.  This project investigates how stereotypes based on the intersection of race and gender affect support for black women candidates.  Research in social psychology demonstrates that whites stereotype black women as being tough, assertive, and domineering.  It is unclear, however, how these agentic stereotypes impact support for black women political candidates. In addition, there is little empirical research on whether African Americans also stereotype women of their own racial group in this manner.  This project examines a theory of intersectional stereotyping, which argues that black women candidates are negatively impacted by unique stereotypes based on the intersection of race and gender.  Specifically, we argue that stereotypes associating black women with agentic traits lead black women candidates to be evaluated more negatively among voters outside of their own race and gender group.  In other words, we expect that the agentic stereotype not only reduces support for black women candidates among white voters, but also reduces support among black men.  This theory will be tested using a national survey experiment, with an over-sample of African Americans.  This research demonstrates the importance of using an intersectional framework to study the political campaigns of candidates from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPolitical scientists have debated whether gender stereotypes influence support for women candidates. Similarly, scholars have examined how racism among whites affects evaluations of minority candidates.  Yet, rarely have political scientists considered how racism and gender bias intersect when a female minority candidate runs for office.  In this dissertation, I propose a theory of intersectional stereotyping, which argues that evaluations of black women candidates are influenced by unique stereotypes based on the intersection of race and gender.  Specifically, I argue that stereotypes associating black women with agentic traits (such as assertiveness, dominance, and anger) put black women at a disadvantage when they run for elected office. I hypothesize that members of racial or gender out-groups will penalize black women candidates when they receive campaign information consistent with these agentic stereotypes.  On the other hand, I expect that black women will reward an agentic black female candidate because these traits suggest that the candidate is willing and able to stand up for the interests of black women. \n\nI test these expectations using a content analysis and two national survey experiments (one using a sample of whites and the other using a sample of African Americans).  In my content analysis of newspaper articles from the 2018 Democratic primary for governor of Georgia, I find that Stacey Abrams, the black female candidate, was more likely to be described with agentic traits, especially negative agentic traits, in newspaper coverage than Stacey Evans, her white female opponent.  My experimental data demonstrates that this media coverage of agentic traits puts black women at a disadvantage among white voters.  White voters are more likely to penalize a black female candidate for acting in an assertive manner than identical white female and black male candidates.  However, I find no penalty or reward for the assertive black female candidate among black voters. \n\nThis research underscores the importance of studying the influence of race and gender in politics simultaneously.  We cannot fully understand the effects of race and gender on support for minority women candidates by studying these concepts in isolation from one another.  This research also has important implications for the campaigns of black women candidates.  I find that negative stereotypes about black women being overly assertive drive whites' opposition to these candidates.  As a result, these candidates are forced to walk a particularly fine line in order to be viewed as competent leaders without activating negative stereotypes about their group.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/17/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Heather M Hicks"
