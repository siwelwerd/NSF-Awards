 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is uniformly agreed that civics education is an important way to teach the responsibilities of citizenship.  However, little is known about how teachers navigate this subject in a time of changes in government.  History teachers and Government teachers are being taught how to teach their subjects during a period of governmental changes in Kenya, and this research will examine how these teachers then actually teach these subjects.\r\n\r\nCivic education has been seen as a stalwart for democratic processes.  This research examines how civic education might be changed as a function of teacher experience.  It will examine how changes in government structure are communicated to teachers in charge of teaching civics, and how they in turn teach civics to their students.  The research contributes to citizenship-formation theories and democratization.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
