 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for renewed funding of the Maria Mitchell Observatory (MMO) Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site in Nantucket, Massachusetts. The REU program will be offered annually to six qualified applicants, who will perform state-of-the-art data analysis using a wide variety of space- and ground-based astronomical observations. The student projects include the general areas of: formation and evolution of stars, groups and clusters of galaxies, large-scale structure of the universe, cosmology, and star clusters. This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n\r\nThe MMO REU program will have a significant impact on the skills and career development of student participants by enhancing their capability to do research, to present their results at scientific meetings and in public settings, to write scientific papers, and to write observing proposals to use national and international telescope facilities. Hundreds of undergraduate students have participated in the REU program to date, the great majority of them women, and many have gone on to successful careers as astronomers at leading universities, observatories, and other organizations around the world. Indeed, roughly one of every 20 American women with a PhD in astronomy today acquired formative research experience at the MMO. This award will therefore contribute to developing a talented STEM workforce in the United States.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In fact, an outsized proportion of today's professional women astronomers had a formative research experience at the MMA.</p>\n<p>This award supported the summer research experiences of 30 undergraduate students from around the country and helped the MMA continue its mission of providing professionally guided summer research opportunities in astronomy for undergraduate students, especially for women and other underrepresented groups as well as students from colleges and universities with limited research opportunities. Fully 67% (20/30) of the students supported on this award are women, while 73% (22/30) are members of traditionally underrepresented racial and ethnic groups.&nbsp; Nearly 60% (17/30) of the students hail from small, liberal arts, and undergraduate-only universities, where access to astrophysics research is limited or non-existent. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Keenly aware of the importance of cultivating diverse mentors, 67% (10/15) of the affiliated astronomer mentors active during this award are women.&nbsp; Of those, three women are alumnae of the MMA REU program, providing not only first-hand testaments to the long-term career successes of MMA REU alumnae, but also, real-world mentoring and networking for current MMA REU students.&nbsp; Finally, it should be noted that the current Director of the Maria Mitchell Observatory is a woman and also an alumna of the MMA REU program.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit: </strong></p>\n<p>Research at MMO emphasizes state-of-the-art data reduction techniques and thoughtful physical interpretation. Data for projects come from leading ground- and space-based observatories as well as next generation surveys and cosmological simulations. Students also obtain data with the MMO's 24- and 17- inch research telescopes equipped with modern CCD and CMOS cameras. Each MMO REU student works on an individualized research project under the guidance of experienced astronomers, as well as a collaborative team project. All projects focus on original research aimed at producing a new and publishable result, with the student taking a genuine leadership role.&nbsp; Throughout the summer students participate in weekly group meetings to discuss their research progress, weekly professional development activities, and lectures from visiting astronomers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>MMO REU students disseminate results of their research at the annual winter meeting of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) where 100% (30/30) of the students prepared and presented either a poster or talk (with the exception of the January 2022 AAS meeting that was canceled at the last minute due to the COVID-19 pandemic).&nbsp; During this award period, four MMO REU students won the prestigious Chambliss Astronomy Achievement Award to recognize exemplary research.&nbsp; Students presented at multiple other scientific conferences and at their home institutions, as well as publishing papers in peer-reviewed scientific journals. During this award period, MMO REU students have published six first-author peer-reviewed papers, contributed to many other peer-reviewed publications, and authored seven senior theses.&nbsp; Several additional papers are currently in preparation for submission to peer-reviewed journals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Students also develop their communication skills by participating actively in public outreach, especially our twice-weekly public stargazing open nights at the observatory, a very successful outreach program that attracts more than 3,500 visitors each summer. Finally, each student gives a short public presentation of their research results to an audience of over 100 members of the public on Nantucket and watching via live Zoom broadcast at the conclusion of the summer.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts: </strong></p>\n<p>Few organizations have had a greater demonstrable impact on increasing participation by women in astronomy than the Maria Mitchell Association. Extensive follow-up shows that their REU experience at the MMA crucially influences the career choices of many students. Most of them continue on to graduate school in astronomy or physics, and more than half eventually obtain a PhD. &nbsp;Of the current award period, 60% (18/30) of the students are now enrolled in graduate programs, five have not yet completed undergraduate studies, and a following seven are working in STEM fields, several of whom intend to go to the graduate school.&nbsp; The long-term mentoring and advising of each MMO REU student is continued well after their summer research experience is over and each student becomes part of the MMA 'family,' supported by the Director and an online community of alumni and affiliated astronomers.&nbsp; MMA REU alumni reunion events, such as the annual alumni breakfast at the AAS meeting, nurture students' professional growth and provide further networking opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/21/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Regina&nbsp;Jorgenson</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757321/1757321_10534965_1697912872517_IMG_6400--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757321/1757321_10534965_1697912872517_IMG_6400--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"MMA REU students at the AAS meeting\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757321/1757321_10534965_1697912872517_IMG_6400--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"MMA REU students at the AAS meeting\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">MMA REU students at the AAS meeting</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Regina Jorgenson</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Regina&nbsp;Jorgenson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">MMA REU students at the AAS meeting</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757321/1757321_10534965_1697913270450_IMG_7210--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757321/1757321_10534965_1697913270450_IMG_7210--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"MMA REU interns watching a solar eclipse\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757321/1757321_10534965_1697913270450_IMG_7210--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"MMA REU interns watching a solar eclipse\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Summer 2021 MMA REU interns watching a solar eclipse during sunrise on the east coast of Nantucket Island.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Regina Jorgenson</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Regina&nbsp;Jorgenson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">MMA REU interns watching a solar eclipse</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757321/1757321_10534965_1697913399699_IMG_7989--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757321/1757321_10534965_1697913399699_IMG_7989--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"MMA REU interns with dome\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757321/1757321_10534965_1697913399699_IMG_7989--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"MMA REU interns with dome\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">MMA REU interns with telescope dome</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Regina Jorgenson</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Regina&nbsp;Jorgenson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">MMA REU interns with dome</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757321/1757321_10534965_1697913496248_IMG_7613--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757321/1757321_10534965_1697913496248_IMG_7613--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"MMA REU interns during lecture\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757321/1757321_10534965_1697913496248_IMG_7613--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"MMA REU interns during lecture\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">MMA REU interns participating in lecture from visiting Affiliated Astronomer</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Regina Jorgenson</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Regina&nbsp;Jorgenson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">MMA REU interns during lecture</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757321/1757321_10534965_1697913569297_IMG_7526--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757321/1757321_10534965_1697913569297_IMG_7526--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"MMA REU intern at Open Night\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757321/1757321_10534965_1697913569297_IMG_7526--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"MMA REU intern at Open Night\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">MMA REU interns giving constellation tour during a public open night at the Observatory.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Regina Jorgenson</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Regina&nbsp;Jorgenson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">MMA REU intern at Open Night</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
