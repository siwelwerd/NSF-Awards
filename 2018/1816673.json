 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses security attacks that: (i) masquerade as failures and (ii) are delivered via self-learning malware that monitors the target system and launches the attack at a time and system location to have a maximal impact, by injecting a strategic failure. The target systems are cyber-physical systems (CPS) that manage or control large computing enterprises (e.g., the cooling or power distribution of high-performance system or cloud infrastructure). In this scenario, the vulnerability of the cyber-physical system acts as a weak point that lowers the security barrier of an otherwise well-protected system. This project addresses a full range of issues, including: (i) design of self-learning malware; (ii) launch vectors for failure injection attacks; and (iii) mitigation and defense against such attacks. The research draws on data from a cyber-physical system that supports the cooling of the Blue Waters supercomputing system at the University of Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this work lies in: (i) Development of scientifically sound methods to jointly study reliability failures of, and malicious attacks on, a cyber-physical system infrastructure that provides critical services for the uninterruptible operation of a large computing infrastructure. Possible advances in cyber-attacks in the context of indirectness, automation (driven by self-learning and adaptive malware), and reduced barriers to unauthorized entry to the system are considered; (ii) Study of feasibility of deploying attacks through self-learning malware (inserted into the auxiliary CPS), which takes advantage of a low-security barrier. In cyber-physical systems, the real-time control sequences rely on online measurements from the sensors distributed across the system. By monitoring those measurements one can build smart malware that is able to learn (interpret) the system state and then trigger an attack sequence at an opportune time; (iii) Develop attack mitigation methods that can be integrated with an existing intrusion detection system and combined with the monitoring from the cyber and physical layers of the tenant system; (iv) Validation of the mitigation strategies using a data-driven simulation testbed that emulates the cyber-physical system behavior and enables experimentation with different attack scenarios. While we focus on a large computing infrastructure, the problem has broader implications, e.g., the proliferation of \"Internet of Things\" devices creates an environment for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in such entities as a stepping stone for launching attacks against highly-valuable assets. In the broader context of cyber security, this project aims to identify potential advances in threats by demonstrating the feasibility of masquerading a security problem as a reliability failure. Demonstrating a proof-of-concept on a potential threat and presenting an effective mitigation method will promote the development of detection and mitigation techniques against new threats.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In this research, we consider indirect security attacks that take advantage of the relatively weak security of the CPS as a stepping stone toward compromising the target system. Unlike the known CPS attacks, our advanced attack scenario distinguishes itself by: (i) masquerading itself as an accidental failure by inducing abnormalities (failures) in the CPS whose impact propagates to the target-dependent system (e.g., a large computing infrastructure in our study) and (ii) minimizing the risk of exposure and detection by introducing self-learning features to the malware deployed in the CPS to learn and execute the attack scenario based on the events corresponding to the behavior of the CPS under regular operations. We also devise methods to preemptively detect such malicious attacks, which is an important step toward developing mitigation strategies. Finally, we generalize the threat model to capture (i) purposeful manipulation of information/data available via online monitoring of a cyber-physical system and (ii) attacks that combine both reliability and security features of the CPS and computing enterprise.
