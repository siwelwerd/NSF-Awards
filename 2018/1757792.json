 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for renewed funding of the REU Site at Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA) at Northwestern University (NU). The REU site takes advantage of CIERA's interdisciplinary nature, providing students with access to mentors across departments, and insight into the cross-departmental connections between astronomy and astrophysics and other STEM disciplines. The program will be offered annually to 8 students. The available mentors come from the departments of: Physics and Astronomy; Applied Math; Earth and Planetary Science; and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Available research projects cover astronomical topics and methods ranging across theory, computation, instrumentation, and experimentation. The students will have access to a wide range of cutting-edge facilities, including instrument labs and the Quest high performance computing facility at NU.\r\n\r\nThrough this exposure, the REU students will learn how astronomical studies prepare them with a wide range of skills and can lead them to diverse professional paths. NU CIERA's REU site gives students the experience of doing interdisciplinary astronomical research, exposes them to a wide array of exciting research areas in astrophysics, and builds a community among the students and NU researchers. The Site recruits a significant fraction of its participants from underrepresented groups in STEM by partnering with Chicago-area minority serving institutions. Through high-quality research experiences and profesional development activities, the NU CIERA REU Site will contribute to the development of a diverse, sophisticated, and highly competitive STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This broad range of interests reflects the interdisciplinary nature of CIERA and enriches the students' summer experience.  The summer research projects cover the breadth of research methods in astrophysics, from theory to computation and instrumentation to experimentation.\n\nThis grant provided funding for all students to attend a scientific conference to present their research.  The majority of our students accepted this offer to attend a meeting and presented research posters to their peers and professional astronomers.  Most students chose to attend and present their work at American Astronomical Society meetings.  Other students presented at the American Geophysical Union annual meeting, the Seismological Society of America meeting and the APS Conferences for Undergraduate Women in Physics (CUWiP).\n\nAbstracts for most of these students' posters are available online.  Furthermore, each of our REU students created a research website, maintained by NU and CIERA, to share their research with the public (see our website URL at the end of this report).   At the end of each summer, students also shared their results with Northwestern faculty and staff, museum visitors at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, and friends and family (on Zoom), through poster presentations. \n\nDuring this grant cycle, our REU students contributed to 18 refereed journal articles (7 as first authors) and 3 research notes (all as first authors).  Links to these papers can be found on our website, provided at the end of this report. \n\nWe continue to make a concerted effort to maintain a diverse REU cohort: including the full duration of our REU program, 54% or our students were female, 28% were Hispanic, 12% were African American and 8% were from other minority gender or ethnic/racial groups (with some overlap between these groups).
