The structure of the conference is such that students will be able to network with peers and faculty, as well as to listen to a lecture from an esteemed mathematician,  as to the opportunities and life style afforded mathematical science majors, and to give students an opportunity to present the results of their research.  A strong effort will be made to invite students who are members of underrepresented groups, first generation college students, and women.   More information will be made available at:\r\n\r\nhttps://stratos.skidmore.edu:8002/apex/f?p=113:1:0::::",
