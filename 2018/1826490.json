 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in their efforts to significantly increase the numbers of students matriculating into and successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines to diversify the STEM workforce.  Particular emphasis is placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences in support of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.  These strategies facilitate the production of well-prepared students highly-qualified and motivated to pursue graduate education or careers in STEM.\r\n\r\nFor the United States (U.S.) to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy.  The California State University-Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (CSU-LSAMP) program was established in 1993 in response to the need for a more diverse and skilled technical workforce.  That need still exists and is particularly acute in the State of California.  CSU-LSAMP is an alliance of the 23 campuses of the California State University (CSU) system.  As a LSAMP STEM Pathways and Research Alliance, the project has two primary goals: (1) increase the number of underrepresented minority (URM) students graduating with undergraduate and graduate degrees in STEM, and (2) contribute to the production of scholarly research in broadening participation in STEM.  These goals support the National Science Foundation's strategic goal to \"cultivate a world-class, broadly inclusive science and engineering workforce, and expand the scientific literacy of all citizens.\"  To achieve the first goal, CSU-LSAMP will provide activities that support the academic integration, professionalization, and social integration of participants.  Goal two will be achieved through the creation of a research team made up of social science researchers, program evaluators, and the CSU-LSAMP leadership team.  This research team will be the first step in creating a CSU center for broadening participation research, which will serve as a resource for education and social science researchers across the CSU system.  Research results will be broadly disseminated to ensure the replication of successful undergraduate intervention models that increase access to, and success in STEM baccalaureate degree programs and facilitate admissions to STEM graduate programs; and moreover, lead to a more talented and diverse STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Over its history, CSU-LSAMP has served over 30,000 students, most of whom belong to groups historically underrepresented in STEM. During this same period, the number of UR students enrolled in STEM disciplines at CSU campuses increased more than four-fold, from 10,580 in 1994 to 49,265 in 2023. Additionally, annual UR STEM baccalaureate degree production increased nine-fold, from 917 in 1994 to 8,293 in 2024. CSU-LSAMP participants have published their research in peer-reviewed journals and presented their research at numerous international, national, and regional professional conferences. CSU-LSAMP students also showed higher retention and graduation rates when compared to non-LSAMP students, with retention and graduation rates that are comparable with those for non-UR students. Lastly, 39% of a subset of CSU-LSAMP graduates entered graduate programs, with 2,661 participants who obtained a STEM Master&rsquo;s, 433 who obtained a STEM doctorate, and 3,013 participants who are currently enrolled.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>By the end of this period, CSU-LSAMP also completed its research in broadening participation project, resulting in the publication of a manuscript in the Journal for STEM Education Research (doi.org/10.1007/s41979-023-00107-8). Findings show substantial evidence that Undergraduate Research Experiences (URE) heighten students&rsquo; likelihood of attaining a baccalaureate degree and a postgraduate education. In this study, CSU-LSAMP analyzed three outcome variables (1) STEM baccalaureate degree attainment, (2) post-baccalaureate enrollment, and (3) post-baccalaureate degree attainment in STEM. Among LSAMP participants who entered the CSU as first-year students but did not participate in URE, the probability of attaining a baccalaureate degree was 0.54. Among the first-year students who did participate in URE as part of LSAMP, the probability jumped 32 percentage points to 0.86 after holding everything else constant (p&lt;.001). A smaller but similar pattern holds among transfer students; URE corresponds to an 18-percentage point increase in STEM baccalaureate attainment (from .72 to .90; p&lt;.001). Among students who entered a CSU in their first year, URE were associated with a 19 percentage-point boost in postgraduate enrollment, from .35 to .54. Among transfer students, URE were associated with a fifteen percentage-point increase in postgraduate enrollment, from .42 to .57; p&lt;.001. Finally, and perhaps most pertinently, LSAMP students who participated in URE are about nine percentage-points more likely to graduate with a post-graduate degree in STEM. This is true among students who entered as first-years (.06 to .15; p&lt;.001) as well as among transfer students (.09 to .17; p&lt;.001). This research, which included CSU-LSAMP participants between 2004 and 2019 for whom we have post-graduation information, offered us a real measure of graduate enrollment and completion of graduate degrees. CSU-LSAMP has therefore made significant progress in closing the achievement gap for UR students in STEM and successfully increased the diversity of students moving into graduate programs in STEM.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/22/2024<br>\nModified by: Semarhy&nbsp;E&nbsp;Quinones-Soto</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
