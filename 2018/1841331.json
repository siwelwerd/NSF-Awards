 "awd_abstract_narration": "For a number of applications in manufacturing, energy and infrastructure, materials with high strength and high ductility are needed. Finding both of these properties in the same material, however, is extremely rare. A number of materials engineering approaches seek to create high strength, high ductility materials, including fabricating nanostructured layered structures with alternating materials. This EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award supports an exploratory experimental and computational effort to engineer multi-layered metal-ceramic nanocomposite materials that exhibit tunable strength and toughness. The nanocomposite will be composed of alternating nanoscale metallic and ceramic layers. The ceramic layers are part of the family of ceramic materials known as MAX phase, which themselves are layered carbide or nitride materials. Combining metal layers with MAX layers results in a unique structure with as a complex network of interfaces which will eventually control the behavior of the material. These materials have applications in multiple technological fields, including high temperature structural applications, protective coatings, sensors, tunable damping films for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and potential applications in cladding materials for nuclear use. The ability to have a strong yet ductile metal-MAX composite with improved mechanical behavior to satisfy the demands of such applications will provide considerable technological and economic benefits. The research will provide graduate training for a PhD student who will also benefit from the collaboration with Los Alamos National Laboratory.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this combined modeling and experimental EAGER research are to: a) design and synthesize multi-layered nanocomposites composed of alternating metallic and MAX phase layers with a lamellar thickness reduced to the nanoscale, b) establish a fundamental understanding of the hierarchical interface driven microstructure and microstructure-property relationships using nano-mechanical testing tools (nanoindentation, micro-compression), and c) formulate and validate atomistic models that outline the premise for controlling the activation of specific deformation mode(s) through hierarchical design of metal-MAX nanolaminates, thus tuning their mechanical properties to achieve greater strength and toughness. Upon successful completion of this research, tunable properties will be realized through guided variations in processing parameters from computation, as our nanoscale modeling will unravel the role of interfaces and the hierarchical microstructure of the metal-MAX system.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
