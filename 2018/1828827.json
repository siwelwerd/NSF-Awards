 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although lake drainage into sinkholes is common occurrences in karst systems, little is known about the relationships among lake water, groundwater, spring water, and river water. The continuous drainage of a large amount of lake water and water-contained contaminants into lake sinkholes can be viewed as a natural tracer experiment. If the contaminant concentrations are monitored in downgradient karst springs and rivers, the lake sinkhole drainage can be used to gain knowledge about the transport of water and contaminants. To test this, the project will use a man-made dye tracer along with water chemistry measurements to in an actively draining lake sinkhole. The dye tracer and water chemistry will be monitored and measured in the lake, the upper Floridan aquifer, karst springs, and rivers. Results from this project will be shared with the Florida State Geological Survey and environmental management agencies.\r\n\r\nThis project examines the hydrologic connection among lake drainage via sinkholes, springs, and estuaries in a karst system.  A dye tracer experiment will be used to calculate the transit time from an actively draining lake sinkhole to downgradient springs and rivers. To evaluate if environmental tracers or contaminants can be used as surrogates for dye tracer experiments in karst systems, chromophoric dissolved organic matter measurements will be taken in conjunction with the dye tracer. The results of this study and the associated methods development may be applied to many other karst systems in the U.S. The PIs will collaborate with the Florida State Geological Survey and their results will be shared with state government water resources and environmental management agencies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

One reason is that contaminants on land surface (e.g., nitrogen due to fertilizer uses) and in surface waterbodies (e.g., dissolved organic matters) can enter the aquifers directly through sinkholes, which are a common geomorphologic landscape in karst terrains. This project studies lake sinkholes, i.e., sinkholes on lakebeds. Since the sinkholes are connected to karst conduits that end at karst springs, lake water that drains into the sinkholes discharges at karst springs, and contaminants in lake water may affect not only groundwater geochemistry but also spring water quality and ecosystems of rivers that receive spring water. Studying the impacts of surface water contaminants on groundwater and spring water quality requires identifying hydraulic connections between surface water and spring water, i.e., which surface water body flows to which spring. The identification is challenging, because karst conduits are complex networks. As a result, surface water that drains into one sinkhole may discharge at multiple springs, and one spring may receive surface water from multiple sinkholes. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>One way to identify the hydraulic connections is to conduct a dye tracing experiment by injecting a dye (e.g., rhodamine) at a sinkhole and monitoring where the dye appears. Conducting a dye tracing experiment is time consuming and labor intensive, and it is impractical to conduct many dye tracing experiments at many locations or at one location for many times. An alternative to the dye tracing experiments is to use environmental tracers that are ubiquitous such as hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of water. This project is to explore whether we can turn a lake sinkhole event into a natural tracer experiment.</p>\n<p>At the study site located in northwest Florida, USA, two sinkholes occurred on the lakebed of Lake Miccosukee in 2010, and lake water drained through the sinkholes to karst conduits in the upper Floridan aquifer underlying the lake. This happened again in 2018, and it provided a unique opportunity of research for advancing our understanding of karst hydrogeology and hydrology, especially for using environmental tracers to identify hydraulic connections between the lake and downgradient karst springs. A dye tracing experiment was conducted in April, 2018 at one sinkhole, and charcoal packets were deployed at a number of springs to investigate to which springs the dye discharged. After the dye tracing experiment, the sinkholes were covered by lake water after a heavy rainfall in May, 2018. Based on laboratory measurements of dye concentration absorbed on the charcoal packets, we found that the lake water discharged at Natural Bridge Spring, a first-magnitude spring about 32 km (20 miles) downgradient from the lake. This is the first time that the hydraulic connection between the lake and the spring is identified, and this identification may potentially change the existing groundwater models developed for Northwest Florida including the study site.</p>\n<p>We developed a new method that uses hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in water to identify the hydraulic connection between the lake and the spring. Because light isotopes are evaporated more easily than heavy isotopes, lake water is enriched by heavy isotopes, and there is a contrast in the isotope signature between lake water and groundwater. By analyzing isotope ratios in water samples collected from the lake, the spring, and groundwater wells during 10/2019 ? 1/2020, the hydraulic connection between the lake and the spring is detected, and such a detection at the scale of tens of kilometers and for a first-magnitude spring has not been reported in the literature.</p>\n<p>This project supported a doctoral student, who graduated in 2020 and published a first-authored paper in Groundwater in 2021. This research was recently reported in <em>Eos</em>, a news magazine of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) that is delivered electronically to more than 100,000 AGU members worldwide.

The PI has collaborated with scientists worldwide, and published a total of six peer-reviewed journal articles and one book chapter on various topics related to karst hydrogeology such as spring hydrograph separation and sinkhole identification and water quality assessment using machine learning approaches. Conference presentations were also given at national and international meetings. The research was also presented to the Florida Geological Survey, a state agency in charge of sinkhole mapping and involving in environmental protection. The PI is collaborating with Florida Geological Survey to study another lake sinkhole event that occurred on June 6 at Lake Jackson, Florida.
