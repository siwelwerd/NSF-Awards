The supported students are expected to have authored or co-authored accepted papers and to present them in person at the Symposium. It is anticipated that the funds will support 45 students, with $1,000 for each person. The International Symposium on Combustion is the most prestigious technical conference in the combustion community. By attending this meeting, students will be exposed to the state-of-the-art combustion research and have a chance to network with other researchers and practicing engineers. This experience will greatly enhance their scientific knowledge as well as professional careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Students attending this Symposium had a unique opportunity to meet these members of the community, discuss their research with them, and exchange ideas with both senior researchers as well as their student peers from around the world. Thus, it is almost essential that fledgling combustion researchers attend the Symposium and present their work therein. \n\nBroader impacts\n\nOver 80% of the world?s energy production and use is based on the combustion of fossil fuels.  Combustion is ubiquitous in traditional energy conversion systems such as automotive engines, stationary and aircraft gas turbines, rocket and space propulsion, electrical power generation, industrial furnaces, and home and institutional space heating.  Moreover, emerging technology areas such as hypersonic propulsion, microscale power generation and material synthesis depend critically on chemically reacting flow processes.  The world?s dependence on combustion processes has led to many technological challenges including air quality, energy efficiency, global warming, and fire/explosion safety.  Thus, combustion is still an active, vital area of research.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/24/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul D Ronney"
