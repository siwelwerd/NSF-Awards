 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mediterranean region is identified as a climate change hot spot. Recent observations, including increased fire activity in 2017, suggest that aridity in the Iberian Peninsula is already increasing. This multi-institutional team of researchers seeks to provide a spatial and temporal context for on-going and future climatic changes in this region by constructing a 2,500-year-long history of hydroclimate variability from precipitation-sensitive stalagmites formed in caves in central and southern Portugal. Rainfall in Iberia is strongly correlated to the strength of the Azores sub-tropical high-pressure system, and these cave sites lie at its climatological epicenter.  \r\n\r\nSpecifically, this project aims to bridge the hydroclimate knowledge gap for the last 2,500 years using sub-decadally resolved, multi-proxy stalagmite records (carbon and oxygen stable isotope ratios, trace element abundances, growth laminae, and high precision Uranium/Thorium dating) from cave sites in central and southern Portugal.  Based on measuring, counting and comparing the uppermost Uranium/Thorium age from one stalagmite, these laminae appear to be annual in nature. Resulting data will be combined and evaluated with similarly-resolved hydroclimate-sensitive records from northern Iberia (Spain) and northwest Africa (Morocco), creating a latitudinal transect that will allow spatial and temporal constraints to be placed on the Azores High\r\n\r\nThis research could also provide a significant spatial bridge between the only existing high-resolution paleo-hydroclimatic reconstructions (northern Morocco and northern Spain) from this zone. Together, these time series will allow for a more comprehensive evaluation of dynamical changes in the regional climate system through time, particularly in the spatial extent and intensity of the Azores High.\r\n\r\nThe state of the atmospheric circulation in the North Atlantic region during recent millennia, and particularly medieval times, remains the subject of considerable debate in both proxy- and model-based studies.  Of particular interest is the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), an atmospheric dipole between the Iceland low and the Azores high, which is strongly linked to regional inter-annual precipitation variability in Western Europe and northwest Africa through the routing of storms tracks. Dynamics of the NAO and the Azores High are poorly understood prior to the late 19th century, and as a result, the drivers of NAO/Azores High dynamics have not been adequately explored.  An ideal place to address these deficiencies is central and southern Portugal, where few, if any, high-resolution records exist.\r\n\r\nThe potential Broader Impacts (B.I.) includes the potential to transform the understanding of the nature and drivers of past Iberian hydroclimate variability, and through comparison with model simulations, how it may respond to future anthropogenic forcing. As such, the development and synthesis of these high resolution and precisely dated records will be of value to the broad climate/paleoclimate communities.  All data produced as part of this project will be made publicly available and archived on community websites. The project unites a diverse, internationally recognized team of researchers from major research institutions (Iowa State University, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, University of New Mexico) and liberal arts colleges (Cornell College, Union College) to apply multi-disciplinary approaches to addressing long-term hydroclimate dynamics. This work will involve the training of a PhD student already in residence at Iowa State and at least eight undergraduate researchers in state-of-the-art climate reconstruction and modeling techniques.  A component of data collection in Portugal will involve citizen-based science at a local tourist cave and with regional caving groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The position and size of the Azores High thereby affects precipitation across western Europe, especially during winter. In a series of studies that combine proxy evidence of hydroclimate from stalagmites in Portugal, with state-of-the-art climate model simulations of the past millennium, as well as instrumental data over the past ~150 years, we characterize the behavior of the Azores High pressure system and its impacts on regional hydroclimate over the subtropical North Atlantic and western Mediterranean region. In particular, we study how size, position, and intensity of the Azores High pressure system (<strong>Figure 2</strong>) has varied over the past 1200 years.</p>\n<p>In Cresswell-Clay et al. (2022), we use observations and ensemble climate model simulations to show that winters with an extremely large Azores High are significantly more common in the industrial era (since CE 1850) than in pre-industrial times (<strong>Figure 3</strong>), resulting in anomalously dry conditions across the western Mediterranean, including the Iberian Peninsula. Simulations of the past millennium indicate that the industrial-era expansion of the Azores High is unprecedented throughout the past millennium (since CE 850), consistent with precipitation proxy evidence from Portugal (Thatcher et al. 2020). Azores High expansion emerges after CE 1850 and strengthens into the 20<sup>th</sup> century due to greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically, it was found that extremely large Azores Highs occurred on average during 15 winters in the 20<sup>th</sup> century compared to roughly 10 winters for all other 100-year periods over the last 1200 years. In addition, the most recent 25-year period available (1980-2005) averaged 6.5 winters with extremely large Azores Highs, while other 25 year periods since 1850 averaged 2.6 such winters. This makes it 2-3 times more likely now to experience a winter with an extremely large Azores High, compared to what it was between 1850 and 1980. Observations, climate models, and proxy evidence all combine to show consistent unprecedented expansion of the Azores High - a proxy-model synthesis that was further expanded upon in Thatcher et al.
