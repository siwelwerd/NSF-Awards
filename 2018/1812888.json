 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.The Cultural Connections Process Model (CCPM) will formalize, implement, and test a process model for community-engaged educational resource development for Indigenous populations.  The project will collaborate with Indigenous communities to create educational resources serving Inupiaq middle school students and their teachers. Research activities take place in Northwest Alaska.  Senior personnel will travel to rural communities to collaborate with and support participants. The visits demonstrate University of Alaska Fairbanks's commitment to support pathways toward STEM careers, community engagement in research, science teacher recruitment and preparation, and STEM career awareness for Indigenous and rural pre-college students. Pre-service teachers who access to the resources and findings from this project will be better prepared to teach STEM to Native students and other minorities and may be more willing to continue careers as science educators teaching in settings with Indigenous students. The project will contribute to a greater understanding of effective natural science teaching and science career recruitment of minority students. The project's participants and the pre-college students they teach will be part of the pipeline into science careers for underrepresented Native students in Arctic communities. The project will build on partnerships outside of Alaska serving other Indigenous populations and will expand outreach associated with NSF's polar science investments.  \r\n\r\nCCPM will build on cultural knowledge systems and NSF polar research investments to address science themes relevant to Inupiat people, who have inhabited the region for thousands of years. An Inupiaq scholar will conduct project research and guide collaboration between Indigenous participants and science researchers using the Inupiaq research methodology known as Katimarugut (meaning \"we are meeting\").  The project research and development will engage 450 students in grades 6-8 and serves 450 students (92% Indigenous) and 11 teachers in the remote Arctic. There are two broad research hypotheses. The first is that the project will build knowledge concerning STEM research practices by accessing STEM understandings and methodologies embedded in Indigenous knowledge systems; engaging Indigenous communities in project development of curricular resources; and bringing Arctic science research aligned with Indigenous priorities into underserved classrooms. The second is that classroom implementation of resources developed using the CCPM will improve student attitudes toward and engagement with STEM and increase their understandings of place-based science concepts.  Findings from development and testing will form the basis for further development, broader implementation and deeper research to inform policy and practice on STEM education for underrepresented minorities and on rural education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Teaching in Rural Areas using Cultural Knowledge Systems (STEM TRACKS) was a project to formalize, implement and test a process model guiding coproduction of place-based K-12 education resources. To test the UAF-developed Cultural Connections Process Model (CCPM), a unit of middle school instruction was created for the remote Northwest Arctic Borough School District, in Alaska. A team of local Indigenous knowledge bearers called the \"TRACK Team\" was deeply involved in decision-making throughout the project. Because the resources would be used in their communities, they held the power in the development process, while UAF held the role of facilitator. The TRACK Team chose the topic of snow and worked with a UAF curriculum developer to create the unit and craft all resources authentic to place and culture. Care was taken to ensure the unit aligned with applicable academic standards. The resulting unit, \"<em>Qanniksuq: It is Snowing</em>,\" was piloted in three middle-school classrooms chosen by the school district. Feedback from the pilot was incorporated into a final version. The TRACK Team performed a final review to ensure cultural integrity. After piloting, the school district decided to adopt the unit as part of their standard science curriculum. Teachers indicated the curriculum helped engage students in STEM learning, the materials--especially the videos featuring local knowledge bearers--were meaningful and engaging for students, and that the resources supported existing curricula and presented new content. Teachers also indicated the resources helped them meet required standards, could link with other subjects beyond STEM, and helped culturally orient teachers new to the district or region.</p>\n<p>Intellectual merit: A peer-reviewed journal article was published in <em>The Morning Watch</em> (Topkok &amp; Loon, 2021). A required UAF course for pre-service educators now includes project findings, and shares educational resources developed according to the CCPM. The course is taught by the project researcher, who is also one of the project's co-PIs. The finalized Alaska-based curriculum \"<em>Qanniksuq: It is Snowing\"</em>&nbsp;contains nine hands-on lessons, five educational videos, and an online I?upiaq pronunciation guide. Included in the unit are data and images from NSF-funded research projects, and interviews with scientists supported by NSF and other federally-funded research grants. A pedagogical guide to Cultural Connections curriculum has been drafted and is being incorporated in a peer-reviewed journal article (in progress). Indigenous knowledge has been generously shared for this project with the permission of the Kotzebue IRA. Resources resulting from this work provide multidimensional perspectives on the content theme, which deepens student learning. Much has been learned about how collaboration and coproduction on these kinds of projects can be successfully performed. These lessons learned pave the way for broader success. Project activities and findings have been shared with communities of interest including the science community through a paper presented at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting (2021); the education community through a paper presented at the National Science Teacher Association STEM21 Conference (2021) and a breakout session conducted at the Sealaska Heritage Institute Culturally Responsive Education Conference (2022); and with the Indigenous education research community through a paper presented at the New Zealand Association for Research in Education (2022). The research performed during the STEM TRACKS project has formed the basis for a new project titled \"<em>Cultural Connections to Alaska Science</em>,\" that explores the transferability and sustainability of resources created using the CCPM.</p>\n<p>Broader impacts: STEM TRACKS served a rural Alaska school district with greater than 90% Indigenous students. On multiple visits into the rural community, relationships were built and strengthened that will continue long after the grant ends. These relationships represent a commitment UAF has to supporting pathways to STEM careers, community engagement in research, and teacher recruitment and retention for Native and rural populations. Alaska Native people and Alaska contexts are absent from many K-12 education textbooks. STEM TRACKS developed a set of resources that can be used by teachers to help Alaskan learners see themselves represented in the classroom education they receive. It also helped validate a model that supports further development and dissemination of such resources. If the resources are used outside of Alaska, they can also help others learn through authentic representations what Alaska and its real people are like. Through a partnership with the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry, content from the curriculum developed during this project has been incorporated into a traveling exhibit about Snow. The exhibit, which other museums and science centers around the country and abroad can rent, features video content from the \"<em>Qanniksuq: It is Snowing\"</em> unit.</p>\n<p>Topkok, S.A. and Loon, H.P.
