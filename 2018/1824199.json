 "awd_abstract_narration": "The basic idea of plate tectonics is built on a simplified view that the lithosphere (the outermost layer of the solid earth) is broken into rigid pieces that drift around relative to each other without deforming internally, like puzzle pieces that are moved around to make a picture but don't themselves change shape or size.  This works well to capture the motions of pieces once their boundaries are well-developed, but doesn't explain how the pieces are made in the first place, such as how the African piece breaks into several parts along the East African Rift System.  This experiment is focused on quantifying the role of three different factors in influencing plate break-up: preexisting structures in the lithosphere; present topography; and the convecting mantle beneath.  The Turkana Depression of northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia is an ideal place to investigate these issues: it is probably the location where anomalous mantle first interacted with the African lithosphere to produce magma, it has considerable inherited structure, and it has very little topography compared to adjacent parts of the rift.  The scientific and broader impacts of this project are significant. An international team supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation and the U.K. Natural Environment Research Council and including scientists from the US, UK, Kenya, and Ethiopia will undertake both field observations and scientific computing.  The work will support graduate and undergraduate students at the two collaborating US institutions. Knowing how new plate boundaries form in space and time allows us to better understand the tectonic evolution of the planet over its long history, to identify past, current, and future plate boundaries, and to understand the natural hazards associated with tectonic boundaries, such as earthquakes and volcanos.\r\n\r\nNonlinear interactions among mechanical competence, gravitational potential, mantle dynamics, and magmatism determine how continental plate boundaries evolve over time.  The East African Rift System (EARS), is an ideal natural laboratory for rifting processes.  For example, because the far-field boundary conditions on the whole EARS are the same, systematic comparisons of strain accommodation in melt-rich and melt-poor sectors have illuminated the role of heating and composition. Comparing sectors with and without large lateral material heterogeneities has revealed the role of pre-existing lithospheric architecture; comparing sectors with different total finite strain can be used as proxies for evolution. What remains to be considered, however, is the role of gravitational potential energy (GPE) through a comparison of a rift sector in high topography to one in low topography. Although the seismically and volcanically active Turkana Depression appears to represent the end member conditions of very low topography, very high material heterogeneity, and elevated mantle geotherms, it has yet to be investigated in detail with modern geophysical methods. This project involves a multi-method geophysical investigation of the Turkana Depression, combining seismic and geodetic data collection for seismic imaging, earthquake source mechanisms, surface kinematics, crustal strain rates, and structural architecture. Systematic comparisons of the data products to one another, combined with inverse models of geodetic, structural, and earthquake data and limited forward numerical simulations of rift topography and strain patterns will test basic hypotheses about the role of GPE and crustal architecture in continental rifting. Doing so will help to resolve the longer-term rift evolution, especially the role of one or two mantle plumes, inherited continental structure from Mesozoic rifting, and topographic feedbacks in contributing to and shaping continental breakup. Such constraints on the dynamics of rifting will, in turn, enable a better understanding of the exchange of mass and heat between the lithosphere and mantle, long timescale continental tectonic plate and boundary behavior, and the spatial and temporal distribution of hazards and resources associated with magmatic rifting.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\n The East African Rift System (EARS) is a very complex structure accommodating the split of the African continent into at least two pieces.  Although from a global perspective, this can be viewed as a single \"tear\" of the lithosphere, closer study reveals that it is actually made of multiple segments that have very different characteristics.  For example, in the north, the Ethiopian part of the EARS combines a broad zone of stretching across high topography with a localized rift.  In the south, the Kenyan, Ugandan, and Tanzanian parts of the EARS have multiple parallel rifts.  Comparing these segments gives geophysicists a rare opportunity to test what properties of the lithosphere determine the specific rift characteristics as well as how the different segments connect to one another.\n\nThe Turkana region spanning the Kenya-Ethiopia border is a key segment for this kind of comparison, because it is weird.  It accommodates the relay of parallel rifts down to a single rift, it is very low elevation and flat, and it has a complicated geologic history with older phases of rifting that changed the mechanical properties of the lithosphere. \n\nOur results show that, even though the conventional wisdom was that the ancient rifting and the relay of extension could be expected to spread stretching over a broad area, the opposite is true.  Stretching in Turkana is localized to a very narrow zone right at Lake Turkana. The mechanical properties of the region vary a lot in space, but mostly in ways that strengthen the lithosphere by cooling or removing weaker layers as well as by relict strengthening from past continental collisions.  Therefore, the region matches expectations from material science that very stiff stuff breaks in very narrow zones, while softer stuff elsewhere in the EARS stretches over wider areas.  This effect can be observed over many different length scales; it\u2019s the same physics as the difference between snapping a candy cane or stretching taffy.  Our results therefore lead to a comprehensive understanding of the whole EARS as a set of linked segments, and to a demonstration that Earth materials obey the basic framework of material science.\n\n \n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nAt a time when diversity and inclusion are critical priorities for the scientific community, experiments like this one that engage global partners as scientific peers showcase the importance of diverse perspectives, build scientific capacity in the global South, and support pipelines for new talent.  This experiment specifically brought together young scientists, including graduate students from the US, the UK, Ethiopia, and Kenya in the field and in the lab.  The award directly supported part or all of six graduate programs, including one student from Kenya studying at Tulane University.  It also produced data used by six other graduate students (that we know about) including two from Kenya and one from Ethiopia.  Field expeditions engaged all of the supported grad students, plus another cohort of African students who were trained in advanced geophysical field methods.  The field work also exposed Kenyan and Ethiopian primary and secondary students to geophysics through installation of instruments at local schools with a program of outreach, textbook donation, and computer donation.  The African partner institutions, Dedan Kimathi University, the University of Nairobi, and the University of Addis Ababa, are leaders in African science but they rely heavily on resources from awards like this one to support research activities, since African research foundations have limited funding.  NSF and NERC awards play a foundational role in supporting indigenous science in Africa though partnerships.\n\nThe raw data and results of the research will continue to be openly available to the scientific community, including access for African researchers.  In particular, both have utility for refining our understanding of regional geologic hazards (especially earthquakes and volcanos) and geologic resources (especially geothermal energy), leading to improvements in community resilience to natural disasters and opportunities for carbon-free energy development.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/10/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rebecca O Bendick"
