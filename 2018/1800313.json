 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oxidation reactions are critically important and widespread in modern chemistry.  The cheapest and most sustainable oxidant is atmospheric oxygen (O2).  This research expands on prior successes in the laboratories of Professor Doerrer, Boston University and Professor Stieglitz of Roxbury Community College (RCC) in preparing new copper (Cu) catalysts.  The researchers are designing and developing new catalysts that are longer lived and more selective in their reactivity.  They are also designing water-soluble catalysts to avoid the use of expensive or toxic organic solvents. A new collaboration between Boston University and Roxbury Community College develops a new summer research class that brings together BU expertise in transition metal complexes and RCC experience with natural products.  Roxbury Community College (RCC) is a predominantly under-represented minority institution.  The research demonstrates how to incorporate sustainability concepts into challenging and important chemical reactions. \r\n\r\nOxidation of carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds remains a chemical transformation with many remaining challenges.  This research builds on recent success with Cu/O2 chemistry that has demonstrated the effectiveness of fluorinated alkoxide ligands in making highly reactive species for oxidizing carbon-hydrogen bonds.  The fluorinated, chelating O-donor ligands are developed to determine the effect of chelate ring size and overall metal complex charge on the oxidation reactions by {CunO2} moieties.  The researchers then determine the potential breadth of this chemical formulation for oxidation catalysts.  Finally, the researchers build on recent work with more earth-abundant metals from the middle of the d-block - chromium, manganese, and iron - using the fluorinated alkoxide ligands in water, a more sustainable solvent.  A new collaboration between Boston University and Roxbury Community College develops a new summer research class that brings together BU expertise in transition metal complexes and RCC experience with natural products.  This collaboration enhances the capacities of RCC to train under-represented minority students for science careers, while exposing them to research at an highly research intensive university.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant has enabled the continued exploration of oxidation chemistry in a particular system of Teflon-coated molecules that our research group has focused on for more than a decade.  Oxidation chemistry, the removal of electrons from one molecule or substance by another, is a fundamental chemical process in both biological and non-biological systems.  Maintaining the correct balance of oxidation reactions (with their counterparts, reduction reactions, that add electrons) in living systems is one of the critical parts of homeostasis.  Imbalances can lead to diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s.  Oxidation chemistry is also the process by which all human civilization, from the most primitive to the 21st century western world gets its energy.  A fire is oxidation chemistry, as is burning petrochemicals, or part of the drawing of energy from a lithium battery.  Therefore fundamental studies of oxidation reactions have the potential to impact every aspect of our lives and the world around us.\n\nThe particular molecules under investigation herein are described as \"Teflon-coated\", because the outermost portion of themselves that they present to the world \"looks like\" Teflon.  Teflon, as is well known from its myriad uses in coating cookware and making tight seals between threaded metal connectors, is very chemically inert. The basic formula of Teflon is C2F4, therefore no hydrogen atoms are present, and that is a large part of its inertness.  The oxidation of hydrogen in molecules with carbon and hydrogen (hydrocarbons) is a source of energy.  To make such a reaction practical and sustainable requires that it be controlled by a special type of molecule, namely a catalyst.  This grant has investigated the development of molecules as catalysts for the oxidation of carbon-hydrogen bonds, beginning with candidate catalysts that themselves have no carbon-hydrogen bonds.  Many current oxidation catalysts are limited in their lifetime and effectiveness because they can themselves be oxidized and are thereby destroyed or handicapped beyond their ability to function.\n\nThe molecules that we make are termed fluorinated alkoxide complexes of transition metals, with the fluorinated alkoxides being the Teflon coating part, called ligands, and the bind to the metals.  In several cases, the transition metals, like Cu, must be paired with additional metals that are not transition metals. Continuing with our previous work on fluorinated alkoxide complexes of Cu (copper) supported by potassium (K), in this three-year period we expanded our studies to Cu with lithium (Li) and sodium (Na) in their reactions with O2.  The Cu/alkoxide molecular piece has been demonstrated to play the central role in the catalytic oxidation studies, and is negatively charged.  The positively charged Li, Na, and K have now been shown to also influence this process and we were able to demonstrate that changing the fluorinated alkoxide ligand can control which compounds are oxidized.  The entire Cu-based system has been very effective but is not useable on the benchtop.  We have now developed a vanadium(V)-based system that works in air, at room temperature, and can catalytically oxidize alcohols to aldehydes.  Time-dependent studies of the best cases showed reaction completion in a few hours.  Additional studies of tin (Sn)- and lanthanide (Ln)-containing compounds showed that our methods for preparing fluorinated alkoxide complexes are general beyond the transition metals, but the circumstances that lead to air-stable species are more subtle.\n\nFor the first time, this grant initiated a research collaboration with Roxbury Community College, a community college with a very diverse student body and considerable enrollment of socioeconomically disadvantaged students.  The co-PI, from RCC, teaches a class in Research Science in which one unit of the class has been (in 2018 and 2019) a collaboration with the PI at Boston University.  The students spend several classes learning about our V-containing fluorinated alkoxide complexes, both their synthesis and reactivity.  They make two compounds in sequence, the second from the first, and then carry out small scale oxidation reactions whose products can be analyzed at RCC.  In this work, they are doing the same experiments that PhD students at BU do, and can generate publication-quality data for future publication.  This shared effort is not only empowering during the lab time, but also creates many shared stories and useful contacts for the RCC students into the wider world of STEM education. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/16/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Linda H Doerrer"
