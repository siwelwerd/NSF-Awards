 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biodegradable Mg-based alloys are considered as a great material for implantation without additional secondary surgery for implant removal. They are lightweight, have close to bones physical and mechanical properties, excellent biocompatibility and osseointegration, and they can completely degrade and be replaced by naturally re-grown bones. However, installation of bare Mg-based implants has frequently been accompanied with high initial corrosion rate and hydrogen release burst that can cause variety of post-surgical complications. Therefore, the success of their implementation highly depends on control of corrosion rate and hydrogen release especially during the initial stage of installation. This function can be provided by special coatings having well-controlled water permeability. \r\n\r\nThis project supports exploratory work on an untested, but potentially transformative idea for biodegradable Mg implants. It is exploring a new process methodology and underlying mechanism in a new \"thin film coatings concept for tunable water transport\" - through coating components that are capable of providing targeted/tunable resorption or degradation time. It will study how combining thin, degradable and nanoporous layers into nanolaminate coatings can significantly extend tunable control of initial corrosion rate of Mg-based implants. This project also supports providing URM students at an HBCU with state-of-the-art science and technology training, along with deeper exposure to team-based research and value-creation best practices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
