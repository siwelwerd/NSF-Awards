 "awd_abstract_narration": "The collision of celestial objects can be so powerful that they create distortions in spacetime, known as gravitational waves. Albert Einstein predicted their existence more than 100 years ago, but the effects are so tiny that even Einstein thought they could never be detected. After decades of hard work, the Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) finally observed these waves for the first time in September 2015 and this triumph was recognized with a Nobel Prize in Physics in 2017. This award will support the attendance of US scientists to the COFI International Workshop on Gravitational Waves, to be held in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The workshop will convene scientists from across the globe to discuss current and future research in gravitational wave detection, giving priority to the attendance of graduate students and young researchers as part of their formation in the field.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will gather the world experts to discuss the motivation and the experimental challenges of future measurements of  gravitational waves. The discussion will include: Overview of recent detections and prospect for upcoming LIGO/Virgo observing runs, the landscape of  electromagnetic follow up programs, science implications to cosmology, tests of general relativity and understanding of low mass binary stars and mergers, and the future of LISA. The agenda for the three days workshop includes about twenty-five presentations summarizing the state of the field in that many aspects of research and data analysis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
