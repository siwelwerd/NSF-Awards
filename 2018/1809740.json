 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Abstract:\r\nThere is an increasing need for more cost-effective, portable methods to measure and identify molecular species related to the environment, health, and industrial processes. Traditional analytical instruments often require a skilled operator and are expensive and bulky. This research seeks to make advances in these measurement methods by creating new electronic nanomaterials that enable the formation of highly specific chemical sensors. Key to creating selectivity in such materials is the ability to tailor the chemical environment so that they interact or react with the molecule of interest.  New chemical reactions will be developed to attach groups to carbon nanotubes and create nanowires that will conduct more or less electrical current in response to the presence of a target molecule. Sensors empowered by these new nanomaterials can be lightweight, have very low power requirements, and can be the basis of new generations of functional materials.  Nanostructured materials will be developed that detect toxic or biologically active chemicals that can be encountered in the workplace or at home. \r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract:\r\nThis project will create new functional carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphenes by developing/improving reactions that lead to the covalent attachment of different groups to the graphene pi-surfaces. These methods will expand the diversity of functional groups that can be attached and enable novel material concepts and functional interfaces. New functionalization methods will be developed using reactive intermediates such as fluorinated carbenes and nitrenes. We will direct our efforts by determining the impact of functionalization on the mobility of the carriers in the materials. It has been theoretically predicted that the products from carbenes and nitrenes will result in minimal perturbations to the extended electronic structure.   In addition to perfecting and extending the methods initiated previously, this program will explore the covalent attachment of more complex molecular scaffolds that can create binding sites for molecules of interest. The functional nature of the target materials provides natural transitions to impactful, real-world applications. These include transduction materials that enable wearable sensors for workers who may be exposed to harmful chemicals in chemical/polymer production and/or coating processes. Creating soluble forms of SWCNTs and graphene opens a wide range of opportunities for fabrication of organic electronics for the selective assembly at interfaces.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project focused on the development and understanding of functional carbon nanomaterials with a focus on interactions with single sheets of carbon atoms arranged in hexagonal structures, called graphene.  The graphene sheets can be rolled up to create a tube and thereby become the side walls of carbon nanotubes, or the sheets can also exist as planar structures supported by a substrate.  We examined new methods to create chemical bonds to the graphene surfaces and found that in some cases the chemical bonding was dynamic and the groups could effectively walk around the surface to give dynamic reconfigurable materials.  In other cases, the chemically bonded groups to the graphenes were used to create electrical connections to metal centers to allow for electrical to chemical transformations relevant to energy conversion.  In particular it was found that binding molecular catalysts to carbon nanotubes, provides exceptional catalysis for the electrolysis of water to create oxygen gas.  Polymeric materials composed of chains of organic groups designed to bind to carbon nanotubes were also used to create sites that can strongly absorb toxic chemicals like benzene to create chemical sensors.  Other polymers combined with carbon nanotubes allowed for the formation of composites wherein metal nanoparticles are generated proximate to the carbon nanotubes.  The latter materials can be catalytic and this reactivity was used to create sensors for carbon monoxide. In other activities, catalytic molecular complexes were bound to the carbon nanotubes to create sensors for the toxic gas hydrogen sulfide. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/12/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Timothy M Swager"
