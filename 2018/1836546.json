 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pengfei Huo of the University of Rochester is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Division of Chemistry to theoretically investigate new types of reactions caused by interactions between molecules and light. Discovering new types of reactions is a central goal of Chemistry.  When molecules and light are introduced into small, confined spaces new possibilities arise for how they interact. One possible outcome is the generation of \"entangled\" molecule-photon states, which is a feature that arises due to the quantum mechanical nature of light and matter.   Understanding how these systems change over time will uncover design principles that should lead to new, unexpected chemical transformations. However, simulating these systems accurately is one of the most challenging tasks in modern theoretical chemistry. To address this challenge, the PI and his group develop and apply new approaches to investigate this cavity-induced entangled photochemistry. These investigations provide fundamental knowledge about quantum light-matter-interaction-induced chemistry. Dr. Huo is organizing international conferences that focus on this emerging field to facilitate advances that could lead to new technologies and applications using systems of this type.  \r\n\r\nCoupling molecules to a quantized radiation field in an optical cavity has shown great promise to enable new paradigms for chemical reactivities and transformations. The resulting new photon-matter entangled states, so-called polaritons, have new conical intersections or avoid crossings which significantly influence the photochemistry of molecules, and thus, open up new possibilities to tune and control chemical reactivities. The non-adiabatic dynamics of such hybrid matter-field systems remains unclear and beyond the usual paradigm of photochemistry which does not include quantum photons, or quantum optics which has not focused on molecules. Theoretical investigations play a vital role in understanding the fundamental limits and new principles in this emerging field. However, existing approaches and models that are commonly used in quantum optics are significantly limited by their scope and applicability for describing photochemistry. To provide fundamental knowledge in this emerging field, located between photochemistry and quantum optics, the PI and his research group are (1) investigating the fundamental limit, the basic mechanisms, and new principles in cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) induced photochemistry, and (2) developing accurate and efficient path-integral based approaches to simulate quantum transitions among polariton states induced by cavity QED. The results of these investigations provide the fundamental understanding of quantum light-matter induced chemistry and new theoretical approaches that facilitate the merger of quantum optics and photochemistry.  The conferences organized by the PI will stimulate new approaches in the field that can expand its potential impact.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We have theoretically investigated the quantum dynamics of molecule-cavity hybrid systems under the strong coupling limit, with the aim to clearly demonstrate the fundamental mechanism of the cavity-mediated photochemical reactions. With a model molecular system that undergoes photo-isomerization reaction and is strongly coupled to the vacuum field inside the cavity, we discovered that the selectivity of the photo-isomerization reaction (cis vs. trans) can be directly controlled by tuning the photon frequency of the cavity mode of the light-matter coupling strength, providing a new paradigm to manipulate chemical reactions via the tuning knobs from quantum optics. We have also investigated the polariton-induced conical intersection (PICI) created from coupling a diatomic molecule with the quantized photon mode inside an optical cavity, as well as the corresponding Geometric Phase effects. Finally, we have investigated the polariton mediated electron transfer reaction and demonstrated the photoinduced charge transfer can be significantly enhanced or suppressed by coupling molecules to the cavity.</p>\n<p>(2) Resolution of Gauge Ambiguities in Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). The QED Hamiltonian describing quantum light-matter interactions should give invariant physical results upon a Gauge transformation. While the QED Hamiltonian under both the Coulomb gauge and the dipole gauge indeed obey such a principle, these two Hamiltonians under a finite electronic state truncation (the few-level approximation) are known to give different results for physical observables, which is commonly referred to as the gauge ambiguity in quantum optics. To resolve this long-lasting problem, we have provided a new theory that constructs a unitary Gauge transformation operator (so-called Power-Zienau-Wooley (PZW) gauge transformation) that properly constrains all light-matter interaction terms in the same truncated electronic Hilbert subspace, providing an explicit resolution for this Gauge ambiguity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(3) Investigating Polaritonic Vibrational Strong Coupling (VSC) Enabled Chemistry. Hybridizing nuclear vibrations and cavity photonic excitations have recently emerged as a promising strategy to modify the ground state chemical reactivities and enforce unique selectivities among competing chemical reactions. Unfortunately, a clear theoretical explanation of the observed VSC reactivities remains elusive. We have presented a new theoretical explanation for the VSC modification of the reaction kinetics that could provide the first important step toward unraveling this mystery. Our results suggest that the VSC kinetics modification is originated from the non-Markovian dynamics of the cavity radiation mode that couples to the molecule, leading to the dynamical caging effect of the reaction coordinate and the suppression of the reaction rate constant for a specific range of photon frequency.</p>\n<p>(4) Investigating Polariton Photophysics and Simulating Polariton Photoluminescence Spectra. Recent experimental studies have focused on coupling many molecules inside an optical cavity and investigating the polariton photophysics of the hybrid system. The clear physical picture of the polariton physics remains to be clarified. Through a recent collaboration with the Krauss and Vamivakas groups at the U of Rochester, we have investigated strong light-matter coupling between CdSe Nanoplatelets excitons and the photonic states of a dielectric optical cavity. We performed numerical simulations to obtain polariton quantum dynamics and investigate polariton photophysics with the explicit influence of the nuclear vibrations (phonon fluctuations). These theoretical simulations provide direct quantum dynamical insights into the role of the dark states (which have very little photonic contributions in their state characters) in terms of mediating quantum transitions from the upper to the lower polariton states, as well as how coupled electronic-photonic-phononic DOFs lead to a rich polariton photophysics.<br /><br />We hope that our research activities help to unravel the fundamental limit and basic principles in polariton photochemistry and discover new chemical reactivities enabled by cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) processes. We envision our investigations will provide fundamental understanding of QED mediated reactivities and develop new theories that facilitate the merger of quantum optics and physical chemistry subfields.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/29/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Pengfei&nbsp;Huo</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1836546/1836546_10558640_1637961120691_Polariton--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1836546/1836546_10558640_1637961120691_Polariton--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Molecular Polariton\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1836546/1836546_10558640_1637961120691_Polariton--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Molecular Polariton\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A.
