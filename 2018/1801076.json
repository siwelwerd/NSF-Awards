 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Community College of Beaver County (CCBC) aims to enhance a regionally-distinctive Process Technology (PTEC) program by converting a traditional lecture/lab structure to a Flexible Entry/Flexible Exit delivery format.  The expectation is that these changes will increase student accessibility and the number of credentialed process technicians in the tristate region (Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia).  An economic report from the American Chemical Society predicts that, by 2025, development of the region's natural gas resources will create 25,000 new job in the region's energy and advanced manufacturing sectors.  The proposed Flexible Entry/Flexible Exit format will build upon the successful model developed by Polk State College with a prior NSF award.  This program format permits students to enroll in PTEC technical courses at virtually any point in the academic year, complete the courses at their own pace, and increase the amount of time spent on hands-on technical education. By accommodating personal and professional schedules, this approach could also enable existing workers and non-traditional students to enroll in the program.  Thus, the program format can broaden the diversity of graduates who are prepared for careers in the region's rapidly expanding energy and advanced manufacturing sectors.  \r\n\r\nThe goals of the Process Technology: Flexible Entry/Flexible Exit Curriculum Adaptation project are to: 1) build capacity of CCBC's Process Technology program to educate the technician workforce needed in the tristate region; 2) increase program accessibility for non-traditional students and incumbent workers from the Appalachian Region interested in an associate degree in process technology; and 3) increase collaboration between education and industry within the tristate region. The project plans to use a flipped-hybrid, competency-based delivery model that is detached from the traditional semester framework.  It is expected that this flexible model will permit the College to institute an \"every day is a new class start\" approach that will increase accessibility of the program to diverse groups of students.  Each current PTEC technical course will be modularized into multiple one-credit courses.  Each one-credit course will consist of an online component, corresponding hands-on requirements, and one or more hands-on assessments.  Each one-credit course will be self-paced, and faculty will support learners by serving as success coaches as the students complete the online and hands-on requirements.  Learners will schedule the final hands-on assessment of each course with faculty, when the learners are ready and it fits in their schedules.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProcess Technology: Flexible Entry/Flexible Exit Curriculum Adaptation \n\nProject Overview\n\nThe Process Technology: Flexible Entry/Flexible Exit Curriculum Adaptation Project enabled Community College of Beaver County (CCBC) to enhance a regionally-distinctive Process Technology (PTEC) program by converting a traditional lecture/lab structure to a Flexible Entry/Flexible Exit delivery format to increase student accessibility and the number of credentialed process technicians in the tristate region (Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia).  The Flexible Entry/Flexible Exit format permits students to seamlessly enroll in PTEC technical courses at virtually any point in the academic year, complete the courses at their own pace, and increase the amount of time spent dedicated to hands-on technical education.\n\nProject Objectives\n\nCurriculum Development.  To rapidly meet the workforce needs of industry and increase student accessibility, nine three- and four-credit core courses of the Process Technology program will be modified into a corresponding number of one-credit courses.\nFaculty Development.  To prepare faculty to successfully implement and deliver the one-credit courses within the Flexible Entry/Flexible Exit framework, all Process Technology program faculty will participate in developmental workshops.  The lead program faculty member will participate in site visits to institutions which have implemented a similar delivery model to benchmark best practices and establish a peer mentor network.\nRecruitment of Additional Industry-Affiliated Faculty.  The Flexible Entry/Flexible Exit framework will foster the recruitment of additional industry-affiliated faculty.  Over the three years of the project, the College will target recruiting at least 6 new-industry-affiliated faculty.\nOutreach, Enrollment, and Partnerships.  To validate the curriculum revisions, the College will leverage the dynamic and engaged Process Technology Advisory Committee to vet changes and promote the opportunities endemic to the Flexible Entry/Flexible Exit framework throughout the region.  By the conclusion of the project, the program targets a 30% growth in enrollment with a particular focus in increasing enrollment from incumbent workers, non-traditional students, and under-represented populations in industry.\nInstitutional Change.  The project will engage the College?s administration and staff to integrate new business practices.\n\n\nProject Outcomes\n\nIn fall 2020, began offering courses in the FEFE model, and in a two-year period, a total of 33, 1-credit courses were completely developed for the FEFE model. (Project Objectives 1 and 5)\nFaculty and administration modified and improved the lab scheduling and student communication/tracking processes.  (Project Objectives 1, 2, and 5)\nUtilizing the FEFE model and simulation software enabled the program to continue, without delay, during the initial onset of COVID-19, from March 2020 to August 2020. (Project Objectives 2 and 5)\nThe FEFE model has created greater accessibility to the program for traditional students and incumbent workers.  (Project Objectives 2, 4, and 5)\nThe FEFE model is adaptable, and CCBC expects to continue to provide customized training in the future using the online content and lab modules.  (Project Objectives 4 and 5)\nPTEC faculty participated in training and collaborative sessions with the Curriculum Designer and CCBC Administrators to coordinate the development and effective implementation of online and lab content and to establish best teaching and business practices for the FEFE model.  Also, faculty participated in vendor-led training (Lab Volt/Festo, Simulation Solutions, PetroSkills, ECI, and Pignat) to effectively use the PTEC equipment during the lab sessions.  (Project Objectives 2 and 5)\nThe CCBC Process Technology/FEFE Playbook was created and is being utilized to manage the continuous improvement process in the following areas: reviewing/modifying of online courses/content, performing course administration duties, repairing/adjusting of existing Blackboard Materials, creating a Blackboard maintenance schedule, and reviewing online course tools/applications.  (Project Objectives 1, 2, and 5)\n\n\nSummary\n\nThe implementation of this new model has afforded employees the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of new delivery methods that are available across higher education.  This is particularly valuable for faculty, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic which was challenging/requiring the College to deliver programs using a variety of alternate delivery strategies.  Additionally, by connecting with peers from another institution across the county, CCBC team members gained valuable training/perspective that would be impossible with the institutions limited professional development budget.  This model has created greater accessibility to the program for traditional students and incumbent workers.  Also, the College will continue the ongoing efforts to share this model with community college partners in the tristate region.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John Higgs"
