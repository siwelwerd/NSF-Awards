 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns two mathematical research directions. The first direction involves the mathematical study of waves such as water waves or sound waves. Both physical experiments and numerical simulations exhibit the phenomenon of turbulence: fluids that are initially very smoothly-flowing and slowly-varying can develop much more complicated eddies and fine-scale behavior.  It remains unknown whether the equations that model fluid dynamics can give rise to \"blow-up,\" in which some portion of the simulated fluid achieves infinite velocity. This project studies the extent to which blow-up can be \"engineered\" by tweaking the equations that model fluid mechanics, such as changing the number of dimensions in space. The second direction involves questions related to the notorious twin prime conjecture in number theory. This conjecture asserts that there are infinitely many pairs of prime numbers that are separated by a distance of two, such as 3 and 5, 5 and 7, 11 and 13, 17 and 19, and so on.  It is still not known whether the assertion is true, but recently much progress has been made on understanding more tractable questions, such as how often it occurs that a pair of numbers, separated by a distance of two, both have an odd number of prime factors. This project aims to develop these promising new techniques further, with potential application to proving or disproving the twin primes conjecture and to other difficult, important questions in number theory. \r\n\r\nIn more detail, the fluid dynamical part of the project focuses primarily on variants of the Euler equations for incompressible fluids, especially higher-dimensional Euler equations on Riemannian manifolds. The ability to select the metric of such a manifold gives a promising way to \"program\" the equations to exhibit certain desirable behavior. Prior work has established that the dynamics of certain quadratic ordinary differential equations can be programmed into such systems.  The project will continue work towards exhibiting finite-time blow-up (or other interesting behavior, such as Turing universality) for these models. For the number-theoretic aspects of the project, the investigator and collaborators aim to establish further cases of the Chowla conjecture (or its logarithmically-averaged variants) on correlations of the Liouville function, by combining the recently-developed entropy decrement method with techniques from analytic number theory, combinatorics, and ergodic theory.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe first part of the project concerned the study of nonlinear wave, dispersive, and fluid equations. These are a general class of equations that govern for instance the motion of water in the ocean, exotic quantum states of matter such as Bose-Einstein condensates, and gravity waves. These equations represent a struggle between dispersive and dissipative effects, which seek to spread out and smooth out the wave in space, and nonlinear effects, which could potentially concentrate much of the energy of the wave into a small region of space, creating a situation known as \"finite time blowup\". Supercritical equations- such as the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations describing fluids such as water - are ones in which the nonlinear effects are potentially stronger than the dispersive or dissipative effects, so finite time blowup is not ruled out as a theoretical possibility; but it is still a major open problem to show that the nonlinear effects can indeed \"win\" over the dissipation to create blow up. (Informally: can water spontaneously explode?)\n\n\nIn the work funded by this project, we were able to show that if we allow the ambient space to be both curved and high-dimensional, then these equations become \"universal\" - roughly speaking, any behavior consistent with the law of conservation of energy can actually be achieved, at least in the medium term. In particular, it is possible for a fluid to concentrate its energy over time into a smaller region of space, potentially leading to a \"self-similar blowup\". Unfortunately, the curvature of space prevents this construction from truly being self-similar, but the PI remains hopeful that some variant of the methods can make further progress. In the meantime, these works have led to resolutions of other problems regarding fluid equations, in particular the remarkable fact that they are as complex as a universal Turing machine, and in particular that some questions about their solutions are in fact undecidable.\n\n\nThe other part of the project, which is quite unrelated (other than both relying on some common techniques in analysis), regards some special sequences in number theory, such as the Liouville function sequence +1, -1, -1, +1, ..., which records whether a given natural number has an odd or even number of prime factors. Understanding this sequence sufficiently well would resolve major problems in the subject, such as the Riemann hypothesis, as well as the Chowla conjecture (a simpler analogue of the notorious twin prime conjecture). Until recently, this sequence was only well understand \"macroscopically\" - for instance, the celebrated prime number theorem tells us that in the long run, this sequence has the same number of +1s and -1s. However, the \"microscopic\" behavior of this sequence has only begun to open up to study, starting with work of Matomaki and Radziwill in 2015 and subsequent work by the PI and others. In several works supported by the NSF grant, we have obtained better understanding of this sequence (and related sequences) in increasingly short intervals; among other things, this allows us to obtain short interval versions of several previous results in analytic number theory, such as my result with Ben Green that there exist arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions of primes (we can now give asymptotic counts as to how many such progressions there are, even when the primes are in a relatively narrow interval).\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/02/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: TerenceTao\n"
