 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) by preparing and interesting high achieving middle school students for advanced math courses in high school and eventually in engineering careers. The University of Central Oklahoma Strategies project (\"STEM CareerBuilder\") will engage with government, business, industry, and community partners to design, develop, implement, and evaluate an innovative summer program training girls in Computer Forensics (CF). The project aims to benefit society through the contributions to the future STEM workforce by better preparing today's digital learners with collaborative partnerships, innovative learning tools, career exploration opportunities, skill-acquisition venues, and education-workforce-development models. The project broadens the STEM participation by underserved population through strategic recruitment to target girls in Oklahoma where the highest representation of Native American tribes reside. Partnering with EPSCoR and TRiO-participating high schools will allow the project team to address the needs of girls from low-performing schools, low-income families, and underrepresented ethnic/racial groups.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to discover what strategic partnerships and innovative interventions can effectively interest, motivate, and support female high school juniors and seniors to pursue STEM degrees and careers. The objectives include implementing interventions, measuring learner outcomes, and assessing results. The project team will collaborate with IBM, the FBI, the Forensics Science Institute, the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation, technology centers, and women-owned businesses to support the CF Program. The CF Program will consist of a summer academy, job shadowing, mentoring, internships, and research fellowships. This project aims to contribute new knowledge to ITEST's comprehensive workforce model by extending STEM learning in simulated and virtual environments. As the learning space and workplace of the future evolve around emerging technologies, examining how girls learn, work, and solve problems via immersive human-computer simulation and information communication technology will offer insights on how to encourage STEM participation with innovative research that establish the efficacy of the interventions. Project findings will deepen the understanding of: (1) the role of business, government, and industry professionals in promoting student awareness of job opportunities and motivating students to pursue the STEM education career pathway; (2) effective ways to broaden STEM participation by recruiting and engaging girls in STEM programs and career-exploration; (3) engaging girls in STEM interventions with age-appropriate curriculum and multi-faceted support; and 4) cohesive sets of experiential learning experiences in the workplace that effectively and efficiently support skills development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The project team researched, developed, and tested COVID-adapted teacher development, career exploration, job shadowing, mentoring, internships, and research fellowships, with disruptive technologies (e.g. AI, blockchain, machine learning, and metaverse). These multi-tiered interventions with disruptive innovations aimed to expose and prepare our K-12 educators and youth for the emerging careers (e.g. forensic analytics, bioinformatics, data science, robotic engineering).<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Promoting Authentic STEM Education with Sustainable Ecosystems of Partnerships </em></strong></p>\n<p>To promote authentic STEM education with real-world contexts, the project team implemented strategic education-career models in collaborations with government-industry-non-profit organizations (GINO). These GINO partners included Apple, Code.org, the FBI, Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation, and SAS. The project leveraged partners&rsquo; existing resources and technological infrastructures to create robust and age-appropriate STEM curricula with forensic lens and disruptive innovations. STEM professionals representing GINO partners served as presenters, internship sponsors, and research mentors to share their professional expertise with high school teacher and student participants. To overcome COVID-19 challenges, STEM contents were delivered virtually instead of in the traditional brick-and-mortar classrooms. High school teachers and female students were provided with opportunities to interact with professionals, explore careers, acquire knowledge, and develop the 21<sup>st</sup> century skills through multi-tiered interventions: teacher professional development (PD), summer bridge programs, internships, and research fellowships.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Promoting</em></strong> <strong><em>STEM Teacher Preparedness with Real-world Contexts</em></strong></p>\n<p>The project team implemented the Teacher Institute by partnering with Code.org and SAS to offer Computer Science Discovery and Analytics workshops. Teacher participants learned how to incorporate inclusive pedagogy to foster equitable classroom culture with disruptive innovations.</p>\n<p>Over the four-year period, 30 (25 teachers being female) teacher participants taught approximate 7200 underserved students in 60 rural high schools across the state of Oklahoma. These teacher participants became leaders in their school districts to serve as STEM mentors and sponsors for their students to present posters at science fairs, Oklahoma Research Day, and the annual EPSCOR Science for Women Conference. Two high school teachers secured external funding to start new forensic and data science programs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Promoting STEM Equity with Strategic Talent Recruitment &amp; Human Resource Development&nbsp; </em></strong></p>\n<p>To promote STEM career awareness and interests, high school student participants were actively engaged in solving modern-day problems with innovative ethnologies. For example, students used virtual reality to process simulated crime scenes, investigated cyber security breach within a metaverse world, processed digital evidence with AI and machine learning, requested DNA profiles via blockchain, and solve cold cases thru critical analysis of biometric data and criminal patterns. All hands-on activities were designed for the underserved subgroups (e.g. girls, minorities, students with socio-economically disadvantaged background. Over the four-year funding period, all 150 students (9<sup>th</sup> &ndash; 12<sup>th</sup> grades) were representatives of the subgroups: 100% were females, 70% were minorities, 55% attended schools that participated in the National School Lunch Program, and 45% were enrolled in Oklahoma Promise. Oklahoma Promise is a scholarship program to aid high school students from low-income families so that they can attend college. These underserved students were provided with opportunities to explore careers, interact with professionals, acquire STEM knowledge, and to develop 21st century skills. Student interns and fellows, who conducted STEM projects independently and remotely (due to the pandemic) to explore bioinformatics (gene editing), nanotechnology, and environmental sustainability, also co-presented their projects with their mentors at the national and international conferences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Out of 150 female participants, 60 graduated from their high schools and 52 attended colleges and majored in STEM. To broaden STEM participation, the project team strategically recruited subgroups of the underserved with talent management and workforce-development strategies to foster leadership. Former student participants, interns, and/or fellows, who are in college with STEM majors were given opportunities to return to subsequent summer programs as near-peer leaders and research assistants to work alongside professionals, teachers, and student participants in helping with crime solving. Research shows a strong correlation to degree completion when students were provided with opportunities to form STEM identity and excel in their chosen fields.</p>\n<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Impacts of Sustainable Ecosystems &amp; Disruptive Innovations on Society&nbsp; </em></strong></p>\n<p>This project catalyzed Oklahoma STEM Zone with high percentage of underserved population&nbsp;&nbsp; into a more inclusive, equitable, and diverse community with broader participation by women and other underserved in STEM despite the pandemic. COVID-19, which affected the way we taught, learned, and worked, presented many challenges for K-12 educational stakeholders (e.g. policymakers, administrators, educators, advisors, parents, and students) to transition from teaching and learning in the traditional brick-and-mortar classroom to e-teaching and e-learning in an online environment. This STEM CareerBuilder project laid the foundation for a STEM education-career pathway with long-lasting partnerships, existing technological infrastructures, and innovative tools to support K-12 educators beyond the funding period while promoting STEM equity to better prepare underserved students for emerging careers on the human-computer frontier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/22/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Joselina&nbsp;Cheng</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1758975/1758975_10533065_1647920585176_girlwithvr2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1758975/1758975_10533065_1647920585176_girlwithvr2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Girl with VR\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1758975/1758975_10533065_1647920585176_girlwithvr2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Girl with VR\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Girl using VR to process a virtual crime scene</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">joselina cheng</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Joselina&nbsp;Cheng</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Girl with VR</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1758975/1758975_10533065_1647921458578_virtualcrimescene--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1758975/1758975_10533065_1647921458578_virtualcrimescene--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Crime Scene\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1758975/1758975_10533065_1647921458578_virtualcrimescene--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Crime Scene\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Virtual Crime Scene with a Victim</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">joselina cheng</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Joselina&nbsp;Cheng</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Crime Scene</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1758975/1758975_10533065_1647921619080_virtualinterviewsbyteamleaders--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1758975/1758975_10533065_1647921619080_virtualinterviewsbyteamleaders--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"virtual team\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1758975/1758975_10533065_1647921619080_virtualinterviewsbyteamleaders--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"virtual team\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Virtual interviews with suspects (role-played by near-peer team leaders and students)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">joselina cheng</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Joselina&nbsp;Cheng</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">virtual team</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1758975/1758975_10533065_1647921782650_biometricsml--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1758975/1758975_10533065_1647921782650_biometricsml--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"biometrics\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1758975/1758975_10533065_1647921782650_biometricsml--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"biometrics\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">machine learning & search engine for matching finger prints</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">joselina cheng</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Joselina&nbsp;Cheng</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">biometrics</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
