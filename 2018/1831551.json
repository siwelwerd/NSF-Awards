 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will design and develop a data science platform that provides access to documents. The platform will make available for the first-time analytical tools, using natural language computer processing and data science to enable systematic research and inquiry by practitioners, project proponents, scholars, and the public to answer a host of critical questions.\r\n \r\nUsing natural language processing and data science, this research will design and develop a data science platform. The research team will produce a blueprint for the platform and validate its functionality with a community of scholars and practitioners. The team will establish the platform structure, ingest data, and refine analytical tools to integrate documents across many repositories, link text to metadata even when text comes from one source and the metadata from another, infer more detailed types of metadata that are not present in any of the existing repositories from analysis of the text, and allow researchers, contractors, and policy analysts to pose complex questions and answer them via analysis of documents. The team will also build a user community to catalyze scholarship and application and develop long-term mechanisms to ensure the sustainability and continued growth, management, and use of the platform and its resources.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Agency officials and decision-makers want analytics on the time efficiency and effectiveness of the business of NEPA. Scientists and researchers want to unlock the vast publicly funded trove of environmental knowledge held within NEPA review documents.\r\n\n\nThe NEPAccess Solution\r\n\n\nNEPAccess is making this a reality. With funding from the NSF RIDIR program, a University of Arizona-based team of researchers, data scientists, and students used the tools of modern data science and AI to unify environmental policy data across federal agencies, making possible immediate and radical improvements to the efficiency of NEPA processes and the production of better-informed, environmentally equitable outcomes. The NEPAccess platform, was publicly available from September 2021 to May 2024 and provided unprecedented public access (at NEPAccess.org) to environmental impact statements from all federal agencies, used machine learning and AI to extract and deliver customized documents and datasets and included powerful tools to discover relationships  including temporal and geographic  between agencies, projects, and documents.\r\n\n\nBroader impacts\r\n\n\nNEPAccess saved time, effort, and money! \r\n\r\nArizona-based mining consultant: Finding and reviewing past project examples [with NEPAccess] takes minutes instead of hours spent emailing colleagues of information and weeks spent waiting for responses. \r\nArizona-based DoD NEPA preparer: With NEPAccess, writing my next EIA will take 2-6 months less time. \r\n\r\n\n\nPartnerships in Development\r\n\n\nThe NEPAccess team engaged in meetings and collaborations with the following entities and are looking to develop new partnerships.\r\n\r\nFederal agencies: National Science Foundation, White House Council on Environmental Quality, Department of Energy (including Pacific Northwest National Lab), Department of Defense (Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration and Sentinel Landscapes)\r\nCivil society: Environmental Policy Innovation Center (EPIC), Federation of American Scientists\r\nIndustry & Trade Groups: American Association of Civil Engineering Companies (ACEC); Americans for a Clean Energy Grid and AECOM (a multinational engineering consulting company).\r\n\r\n\n\nPublications & Presentations\r\n\n\nThe project produced 5 papers, mostly on data-science and analytical methods. At the time of the final report the team was beginning to publish research papers conducted with the NEPAccess platform, with two published, two in review and four in preparation. In addition, the team was invited to give more than 20 presentations on NEPAccess, including a presentation at the 2023 White House Environmental Permitting Technology and Data Summit organized by the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nStudent Training\r\n\n\nThe project supported 38 undergraduate researchers, many who have gone on to graduate school & law school, careers in Federal service, and to work for environmental consulting companies. Six graduate students worked on the project and two now academic positions at Arizona State and Iowa State universities. One postdoctoral fellow is now research faculty at the University of Arizona.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\n\nAlgorithms developed by the team support basic research in data science and management information systems. The research advanced the field natural language processing with techniques for the management of large documents (1000+ pages) and algorithms to extract geographic locations and coordinates from narrative language. The basic research conducted by the team on the accountability and efficiency of environmental review advanced the fields of environmental science, conservation biology, public policy, public administration, sociology, and law.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/02/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: LauraLopezhoffman\n"
