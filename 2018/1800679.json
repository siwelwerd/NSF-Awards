The workshop is devoted to recent developments in dynamical systems and many applications to other disciplines. The workshop has been funded by NSF for the past ten years. The workshop always attracts a considerable number of participants from other regions of the United States and other countries. Approximately 20 junior participants will be supported each year.\r\n\r\nMore information will be made available at: https://math.psu.edu/dynsys/workshop\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
