The meeting will start with a public forum emphasizing the utility of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas as a model for studying biology in complex organisms.  Formal sessions will include a combination of plenary lectures, talks and poster sessions.  There will be ample opportunity for sharing latest research results and for exploring collaborative possibilities.  \r\n\r\nChlamydomonas is an outstanding model for understanding many biological processes.  Recent advances in the field, including new technological capabilities, will be highlighted in this meeting.  Among the topics for discussion will be structure and function of flagella; plastid structure, function and biogenesis; carbon metabolism; cell cycle, photoperception, heat and circadian control; novel studies and developing systems; and recently developed resources for reverse genetics.  The meeting will bring together seasoned investigators with early-career scientists in a venue that will encourage informal discussion and sharing of latest research results.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the Genetic Mechanisms, Cellular Dynamics and Function, and Systems and Synthetic Biology Clusters in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and by the Physiological Mechanisms and Biomechanics Program in the Physiological and Structural Systems Cluster of the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems, all of which are in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
