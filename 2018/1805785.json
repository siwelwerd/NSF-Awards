 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project will investigate the concept of driving catalytic reactions on the surface of iron oxide nanoparticles that are locally heated by exposure to radio frequency (RF) radiation. The main objective is to develop a new process that is more energy efficient than thermally-driven ones and to design a modular reactor system for RF-driven catalytic reactions at low temperatures.  Low reaction temperatures are expected to prevent catalyst degradation by reducing coke formation and particle sintering, while reducing the energy consumption in chemical manufacturing processes. \r\n\r\nThe fundamental principles behind the RF-driven oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes on Fe3O4 nanoparticles will be studied, including the effects of the energy conversion/transfer on reaction mechanisms. The size and structure of the nanoparticles will be optimized to maximize energy conversion. Chemical reactions will be investigated using standard methods and neutron/synchrotron characterization techniques. Interactions with magnetic fields will be modeled using open-source software to elucidate the interaction between catalytically active Fe surface sites, orientation within magnetic fields, and generated energy. The fundamental knowledge on RF-driven catalytic reactions will be used to design a modular reactor that can be scaled-up to industrial level. In addition to training graduate students in an interdisciplinary research field, the PIs plan to use magnetic nanoparticles to develop material for educational and outreach activities to K-12 students from the Baton Rouge, LA, area and undergraduate students from local HBCUs, with special emphasis on encouraging students from underrepresented minority groups to pursue careers in science and engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We tested these catalysts in laboratory scale reactor systems with heat generated in the reactors by RF-IH.
