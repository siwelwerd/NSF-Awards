 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site in Physics at Kansas State University.  The site engages twelve students per year in significant research projects and related experiences during the summer with faculty mentors. A wide range of projects are available that involve undergraduates in state-of-the-art research. The experience of what real science is like helps the participants make better informed decisions about careers, graduate work and/or professional school. Whether they choose to continue in physics or a related technical field, or choose to move to a different area, bright students making good choices early in their careers is in the national interest.\r\n\r\nStudents will do research on how atoms and molecules behave in intense and ultra-fast optical and x-ray pulses, precision spectroscopy in laser-cooled atoms, how light interacts non-linearly in optical fibers, the properties of nanoparticles in solution, and protein self-assembly with simplified models.  They will help build next generation hardware for high-energy particle detection, improve measurements of neutrino oscillations, and help faculty use research-based assessment tools. This experience will be supplemented by a series of lectures that provide the background these students need to carry out their projects. The participants will gain experience in explaining their research work to a variety of audiences and will also read about and discuss ethical behavior in science. Social activities, both organized and spontaneous, will enrich this undergraduate research experience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These outcomes indicate that the students from our program thrive, and that we have made a positive impact on their career choices.   \n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nParticipation in externally funded research. A total of 43 students participated in K-State Faculty-led research projects over the 2018-22 period.  As evidenced by participant-co-authorship on 4 published papers and 7 conference talks, these students helped advance ongoing, externally funded departmental research in a variety of areas: femtosecond chemical dynamics; how students learn physics; the large-scale structure of the universe; and deep underground neutrino detection, as well as in other areas.  Discourse in scientific ethics. Once a week, students met with two K-State Philosophy professors to discuss ethical issues in science that included: increasing diversity in science; the obligations of advisors toward graduate students; what the APS guidelines imply; and the scientist's role in advocating for public policy.  These informal discussions developed tools for helping well-intentioned people communicate about ethical issues; identifying morally salient features of situations; and developing confidence in discussing and debating ethical issues within a community.   Soft-skill take-aways by participants. At the end of each summer, we used the SalgSite survey to anonymously question the participants about their perceptions of their personal-progress during the program.  Over the past five years, students on average report good gains (4/5 on the survey's scale) in nearly all aspects of thinking and working like a scientist and even higher scores in personal gains, including many confidence and comfort measures.  Thus, the program has been effective in fortifying the participants? sense of belonging in STEM research environments.  Technical take-aways by participants.  Through weekly cohort meetings and direct participation on faculty-led projects, the REU students developed skills in orally presenting their work, in defending of scientific arguments, and in the use of computers in research, and surveys confirm that the participants perceive significant improvements in these areas.              \n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nUnder-represented minority participants. During the last funding cycle, we hosted diverse cohorts with a significant numbers from minority groups that are historically under-represented in STEM research.  Our combined Hispanic/Latino, African-American, and Pacific Islander demographic was 19% (up from 17% in the prior funding cycle) and the fraction of first-generation college students was 21% while 42% of the participants were female.  Additionally, 65% were from non-PhD granting institutions and 7% identified as part of the LGBTQ+ community.  An engaged STEM workforce. Our program is effective at helping participants clarify their career-goals and embarking on their next steps.  Having tracked ~200 students who participated between 2007-2022, 65% chose to continue on to STEM-related graduate school while 6% chose non-STEM careers and 2 participants found that physics research was not the place for them during the course of our program.  These data indicate that our program has made a positive and illuminating impact on our students' career choices, which is conducive to having motivated graduate scholars and an engaged STEM workforce nationally.   Mentoring that goes beyond the summer.  Our mentors continue to advise participants, well after the end of the program.  These efforts include sending participants to conferences, helping them with regard to graduate school or with other career options.  In one case during the past funding period, a participant qualified for an industry-job as a direct result of her REU project and mentoring.   \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/23/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bret N Flanders"
