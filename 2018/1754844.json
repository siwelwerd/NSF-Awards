 "awd_abstract_narration": "An understanding of the direct and indirect links between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is still a large unknown in ecology.  This lack of knowledge impedes restoration of degraded lands, because the establishment of a complex food web is rarely planned for in restoration. It is often assumed that \"if you build it, they will come\"; in other words, if a certain plant community structure is achieved, the assumption is that animal colonization will follow. Yet, there is a limited understanding of cause and effect; if certain plant species are chosen for restoration, how is animal presence and abundance affected? The proposed field experiment will address if functional trait-based restoration influences the species and functional diversity of animal communities. Plant species differ in many tangible ways relating to resource use, growth, and reproduction. Intentionally choosing species with specific traits may help direct and engineer the species of animals attracted to restored sites, which provides land managers with tools to guide degraded sites towards healthier ecosystem states. This research will offer student and technician research training opportunities, public outreach, and expand development of a module for middle school students at a local Hawaiian language immersion charter school. \r\n\r\nThe restoration experiment will be conducted in a Hawaiian lowland wet forest, which consists of a reference (invaded forest) and experimental treatments in which native plants were left in situ, all non-native plant species were cleared, and four different mixtures of ten species were planted. The four different mixtures of ten species vary by functional traits, as well as their overlap in the restored community. This research will test the hypothesis that animal diversity of the litter arthropod community will be higher and interactions among species will be more complex in terms of connectance, interaction diversity, and interaction specialization in the treatments where the plant species have a greater diversity in their functional trait values.  These invaded forests are living experiments in how novel ecosystems assemble new community members, with environmental conditions ideal for examining multi-trophic interactions. Stable isotope analyses, network analyses, and statistical modeling will provide indices of different aspects of animal assemblage and interaction complexity in a relatively low diversity tropical environment. In turn, ecosystem services value estimation will provide additional context for treatment comparisons and sustainable ecosystem management.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The <strong>intellectual merits</strong> of this proposal were to understand how plant communities, differing not in species richness but in functional diversity, affect the diversity of animal communities. The project leveraged the Liko N&#257; Pilina experimental restoration project in the lowland wet forest of Hilo, Hawai&prime;i. In this functional trait-based restoration experiment, we focused on functional diversity in a novel experimental system, an island tropical forest, where plant species richness is constrained and communities have been initially assembled (i.e., restored), but continue to naturally diverge over time. The experiment compares four different planting mixtures of 10 species each that vary in the rate of carbon turnover (SLOW or MODERATE) and in the functional trait profiles of the species (COMPLEMENTARY or REDUNDANT). In addition to examining the treatment mixtures, we are also investigating the influence of each species&rsquo; litter on decomposition rate and arthropod community structure.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Default\">The project expanded our knowledge of litter arthropod species in Hawaiian lowland wet forests. Although these habitats have received less study because of the dominance of invasive plant species, these remnant forests are important reservoirs for biodiversity in light of the fact that much of this habitat type has now been converted for urban uses. The species diversity of arthropods found within this one field site was remarkable. Because so little was known about litter arthropods in Hawai&#699;i, we identified arthropods to morphospecies. In the experimental mixtures, we identified a total of 73,975 invertebrates from 216 morphospecies and 18 orders from the litterbags. For the decomposition experiment of treatment mixtures, the decomposition after 6 months in the field was significantly faster in the two MODERATE treatments. Despite differences in species arthropod composition among the treatments, we found no differences in species richness or abundance among treatments for the entire community. In the individual species litterbag experiment, we found a total of 14,347 individuals, with 151 different morphospecies. Plant species and their traits were found to strongly influence arthropod community composition, but biological origin (native or introduced) did not influence arthropod richness or abundance. Plant species with traits tending towards the slow, conservative end of the spectrum were found to be strongly associated with larger, more predatory arthropods, and plants with moderate, more acquisitive traits were strongly associated with smaller arthropods lower in trophic positions. However, interpretation is complicated, because not all the arthropods were herbivores, and some use the litter for habitat rather than nutrition.</p>\r\n<p>The <strong>broader impacts</strong> of the project showed that a functional trait and ecosystem services framework for can be incorporated into the restoration of animal communities.&nbsp; A strong emphasis on mentoring led to the training 40 undergraduate students, graduate students, interns, technicians and other professional staff.

Trophic interactions among organisms drive energy and nutrient cycling within ecosystems, linking biodiversity to ecosystem function.&nbsp; Our study found that plant functional diversity may not only affect the number of species in other trophic levels, but also influence interactions among species and community structure. Results emphasize the potential benefit of including introduced plant species in the restoration of highly degraded ecosystems, suggesting that by planting certain tree species restoration can be directed towards specific arthropod taxa and trophic levels. In restoration, careful selection of plant species can influence arthropod communities and sustain a diverse food web from the bottom up. A rich and diverse arthropod community may enhance the long-term ability of a forest to cycle nutrients and shelter other important species.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/29/2024<br>\nModified by: Rebecca&nbsp;Ostertag</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1754844/1754844_10557400_1732784580246_Arthropod_field_lab--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1754844/1754844_10557400_1732784580246_Arthropod_field_lab--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Litterbags, Berlese funnels, and microscope image\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1754844/1754844_10557400_1732784580246_Arthropod_field_lab--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Litterbags, Berlese funnels, and microscope image\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Field and lab procedures used during the study.
