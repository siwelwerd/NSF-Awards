 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)\r\nproject is to improve outcomes and decrease costs in the mental health space by engaging\r\npatients starting with their first therapy session through objective progress reporting and\r\npost-session motivation. Patients and clinicians alike will be able to track and assess treatment\r\nprogress through self-reported and physiological measures. This innovation builds upon the\r\nstrong academic, government, and industry partnerships that will advance research and\r\ninnovation in the field of biotechnology. By demonstrating improved outcomes and decreased\r\ncosts associated with the utilization of technology, this will pave the way for insurance\r\nreimbursement (using existing CPT codes) to accelerate market adoption. Additionally, as\r\neducation of patients and the public improves regarding mental health and PTSD in particular,\r\nthe negative stigma surrounding these conditions will decrease and more people in need will\r\nseek help rather than resorting to unhealthy behavior or even suicide.\r\n\r\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to represent an innovative approach that provides easy to\r\ninterpret results tailored to mental health providers, patients, and other non-technical users.\r\nCurrent mental health treatment and assessment has lacked qualitative, scientifically-based\r\nmeasurement. The need for a scientific measurement is evident, as about 8 percent of all\r\nadults - 1 of 13 people in this country will develop PTSD during their lifetime. Currently, 60%\r\nof adults diagnosed with a mental illness don't receive mental health treatment; using proven\r\nscience and physiologic measurements as the foundation for improving treatment and\r\nmonitoring progress for PTSD can help to alleviate some of the stigma surrounding mental\r\nillnesses. This project aims to demonstrate how implementing a web-based platform can\r\nimprove PTSD treatment by providing physiologically relevant feedback to the patient and by\r\nproviding a tool for the clinician to tailor the therapy to the individual patient. Patients will have\r\ntheir subjective measures and physiological data visualized throughout treatment on a software\r\nplatform, with progress being tracked through validated assessment scales. Patients will be\r\ncompared to others in treatment as usual. Results should yield improved quality of life and\r\ndecrease long term healthcare costs for those that use the platform.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
