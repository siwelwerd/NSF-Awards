The conference program includes many of the research topics central to Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics and Quantum Information Science. The support of students through this award makes a substantial contribution to the education and training of future scientists. Students who graduate with a background in atomic, molecular, and optical physics acquire a broad range of knowledge and skills that enable them to contribute to progress in many areas of science and technology. \r\n\r\nThe meeting is scheduled to be held in  Ft. Lauderdale, FL May 28 through June 1 of 2018. It offers an opportunity for students to present their research results and to interact with senior scientists primarily from the United States, but also the broader international community. Support is provided only for US students (students enrolled in US universities).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe objective of this grant award was to provide travel support to 24 students to attend the 2018 annual meeting of the Division of Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics (DAMOP) of the American Physical Society (APS).  The conference attracts over one thousand participants, where nearly half of these are students (mostly graduate students).  Support was needed to ensure the participation of a large and diverse group of researchers, and to help foster the interchange of scientific information among young scientists.  Due to its influence on the productivity and knowledgeability of individual researchers, this conference series is of outstanding importance to the vitality of atomic, molecular, and optical physics in the United States.  It is particularly important for students to learn about other researchers' perspectives, approaches, and results that relate to their own work.  This exchange of ideas, methods, and techniques is essential to advancing knowledge in the field.\n\nThe APS DAMOP conference offers an opportunity for students to present their research results and to interact with scientists primarily from the United States, and also the broader international community.  An initial presentation at a DAMOP meeting is often a landmark event in the career of a young scientist.  In conjunction with the meeting, there was a special one-day graduate student symposium to introduce students to modern topics in atomic, molecular, and optical physics; in 2018, the symposium was on \"Exploring New Physics with Ultrafast Lasers and Techniques.\"  The support of students through this grant made a substantial contribution to the education and training of future scientists.  Students with a background in atomic, molecular, and optical physics acquire a broad range of knowledge and skills that enable them to contribute to progress in many areas of science and technology.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/25/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven Olmschenk"
