Additional information about the conference can be found on the website https://users.miamioh.edu/mckennp2/gpots/index.html\r\n\r\nThe Great Plains Operator Theory Symposium (GPOTS) is an annual regional conference that has taken place since 1981. It brings together a diverse group of mathematicians whose primary research interest is in operator algebras, operator theory and related areas. A sampling of the topics presented in the 2018 event is given by the following: the corona problem, Hilbert modules, noncommutative function theory,  deformation rigidity, free probability, subfactors and fusion categories, classification of C*-algebras, C*-algebras and dynamical systems, the Baum-Connes conjecture, noncommutative differential geometry, index theory, operator spaces and applications, and logic and operator algebras. The expected attendance is between 100 and 150 participants. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
