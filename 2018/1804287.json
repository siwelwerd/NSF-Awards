 "awd_abstract_narration": "A critical yet unexplored dimension of the food-energy-water nexus is the expansion of the \"cold chain\" into developing countries. The cold chain is defined as access to climate-controlled environments (i.e. refrigeration) throughout the entire food supply chain. There is not a good understanding of how adoption of the cold chain in emerging economies will affect food consumption patterns, energy use, or water stress. This research will examine the influence of the cold chain on the life cycle impacts of meat, dairy, and produce in the context of the Chinese food system. The hypothesis driving this work is that the introduction of a fully-integrated cold chain will lead to significant increases in global energy use and water stress without achieving substantial decreases in food waste. In addition to testing this hypothesis, the research will seek to identify potential technical or policy interventions that are likely to reduce the anticipated energy and water impacts of an expanded cold chain.\r\n\r\nFirst, the project team will construct a system dynamics model that quantifies baseline greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy use, and water stress of the interlinked food, energy, and water systems when refrigeration is not present. Second, elements of the cold chain related to physical system properties will be integrated into the model, including extended shelf life of food, direct energy required for refrigeration, GHG emissions from coolants, changes in transportation modes and distances, and changes to infrastructure such as refrigerated warehouses and modern grocery stores. Third, elements of the cold chain related to behavior and consumption will be integrated into the model, including shifts in consumption to more water and energy intensive foods, increased bulk purchasing (and subsequent waste generation) due to household refrigeration, and a shift in demand for convenience foods such as prepared and frozen meals. The system dynamics model will be integrated with an economic input-output model to determine the spatial extent of water consumption to quantify water stress. Finally, a variety of scenarios will be tested to determine how interventions or alternative development scenarios will affect system dynamics. In particular, a case study will be constructed to quantify the life cycle energy and water use of a direct-to-consumer meal kit compared with the same meal purchased from a brick-and-mortar supermarket. Direct-to-consumer food systems have the potential to leapfrog traditional supermarkets in emerging economies and may significantly reduce energy use due streamlined logistics and also reduce food waste, lowering overall energy and water use associated with an expanded cold chain. The work will advance sustainable systems modeling capabilities by coupling multiple modeling techniques and integrating socio-economic factors into analysis of emerging technologies. Due to the emerging nature of the cold chain, the research will also advance methods in prospective LCA, using scenario analysis to determine potential interventions that have the greatest potential to mitigate undesirable consequences. The project will work directly with relevant cold chain industries to help improve the sustainability of the food supply chain. Outreach activities will be coordinated through established industry partnerships to share the results of the work. The PI is part of a larger effort to redesign sustainability-related curriculum through integration of case-based learning in sustainability education, where each case tells a story that presents a real-world problem with a challenging decision. The cold chain will be the basis of a new\r\nMichigan Sustainability Case and integrated into course modules.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe introduction of refrigeration into food systems in emerging economies will transform the global food system and its environmental impacts. The \"cold chain\" is an essential element of the industrial food system and is defined as access to climate-controlled environments throughout the supply chain.  While the cold chain\u2019s impact on human well-being is largely favorable, the environmental impacts of the cold chain are complicated and not well understood. A fully deployed global cold chain is expected to increase the use of energy and refrigerants, reduce rates of food spoilage during distribution, facilitate changes in infrastructure to support more industrialized operations, and enable changes in consumption and food waste behaviors that affect the embodied energy and water use of the food system. This project conducted multiple, related studies that estimate how introduced refrigeration would change the environmental impact of the global food system and identified the most effective interventions to reduce overall environmental impact.\n\nThe project resulted in 9 published peer-reviewed publications and 2 PhD dissertations, with 3 additional manuscripts undergoing peer-review.  In addition to advancing intellectual knowledge, this work has direct practical application for the food sector to better understand and reduce food waste and energy use throughout its operations.  In addition, the project attracted public interest in the environmental impacts of food waste and alternative e-commerce grocery delivery methods, with the research featured in multiple, major media outlets and a social media audience reaching over 30 million.\n\nThe studies conducted through this project range from quantitative estimates of changes in food waste and embodied greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with introduced refrigeration, potential changes in global food consumption patterns, energy use associated with future cold warehouse capacity, environmental impacts of alternative supply chains such as grocery e-commerce, and the relationship between food, food waste, and plastic packaging.  Some high-level findings of the project include:\n\nThe cold chain has the potential to reduce overall GHGs of the food system from a technical and logistical perspective, despite increased energy use and refrigerants.  Nevertheless, potential changes in human behavior may negate these improvements.  For example, access to refrigeration is likely to enable increased consumption of environmentally-intensive perishable items such as meat and dairy.\n\n\nE-commerce models where groceries are delivered directly to a consumer are likely to have greater environmental benefits than traditional grocery stores, despite having greater associated packaging.  Major reasons for the smaller impact include the shortened supply chain and decreased residence time of food, lower food waste throughout the supply chain, elimination of energy associated with storing food in a grocery store, and lower last-mile transportation emissions.\n\n\nThe embodied emissions of food dominate any life cycle assessment associated with the food supply chain, potentially obscuring other important sources of emissions within the sector, such as the GHG emissions associated with the cold chain.  GHGs associated with refrigerated supply chains are a non-negligible contributor to carbon emissions, representing up to 3% of national GHG emissions in some instances.\n\n\nFocusing on decarbonizing the electricity grid and improving the energy efficiency of refrigeration will likely have a greater impact on overall food system GHG emissions than introduction of lower-GHG refrigerants.\n\n\nChanges that result in reduced food waste or reduced consumption of environmentally-intensive foods are likely to have the largest effect on the environmental impacts of a food system.  Greater environmental benefits will likely result from efforts that focus on food waste rather than packaging waste.\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/11/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Shelie Miller"
