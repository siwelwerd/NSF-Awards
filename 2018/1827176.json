 "awd_abstract_narration": "Acquisition of a Scanning Electron Microscope with EDS to Enhance Teaching and Research at Indiana University of Pennsylvania\r\n\r\nScanning Electron Microscopes (SEMs) create detailed images of tiny objects. SEMs can image biological and geological samples and man-made items (modern and historical). With another instrument (Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy-EDS) attached it can determine chemical compositions. This grant will purchase an SEM with EDS for Indiana University of Pennsylvania. The SEM-EDS system will be an important tool for faculty and students at all universities and local industries in the region. The new instrument will enhance research and education capabilities in an underserved area of western Pennsylvania. The SEM-EDS will be used in scientific research and as a training tool for undergraduate and graduate students in a many science and technology fields.\r\n\r\nWith the ability to image objects at nanometer to millimeter scale, Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEMs) are the standard tool for scientific research of microscopic features. The addition of Electron Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) allows for collection of semi-quantitative compositional data and elemental mapping. This grant will purchase a research-grade ThermoScientific Prisma E SEM with an Oxford EDS system, along with some ancillary equipment, for Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP), which will be transformative to IUP and the surrounding region, immediately elevating research productivity of active scholars and their predominantly undergraduate trainees. The SEM-EDS system will be available for faculty and students at all universities in the region and to local industries, creating a regional effect, increasing research capabilities and productivity throughout western Pennsylvania. This grant includes senior investigators and their students from departments of Anthropology, Biology, Chemistry, Geoscience, and History who will use the SEM-EDS in a wide range of research topics, including: 1) quantifying crystallization within volcanic deposits (tephra, lava, and diabase sills) and lab crystallization experiments, 2) characterizing solid-state mineral chemistry and crystallography in semiconductor materials, 3) identifying diatom taxonomy to determine temporal variability of the silica and carbon cycles in both freshwater and marine systems, 4) analyzing Roman ceramics to investigate (pre)historic trade connections, 5) analyzing tooth-tooth interaction and tooth-food interaction in extinct (fossils) and living vertebrates, 6) characterizing ash morphologies from tree wood and nuts found at archaeological sites to correlate vegetation response to changing climate, 7) analysis of fine-grained aerosols (<2.5um) to examine air-quality, and 8) studying rapid tectonic exhumation. The acquisition of the SEM-EDS will immediately enhance the regional research environment by promoting new collaborations on campus, across campuses, and with industry and non-profit partners. The instrument will also be used as a training platform for undergraduate and graduate students to learn modern, state-of-the-art analytical techniques used in a large variety of science and technology disciplines.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
