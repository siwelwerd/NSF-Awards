 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 2010, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) was named the top-ranked ground-based astronomy project for the coming decade.  The telescope will begin gathering light in 2019, and begin a full survey of the visible sky two years later.  The survey will discover billions of new astronomical objects, including hundreds of new galaxies nearby to our own Milky Way galaxy.  The new galaxies that we will discover are so faint that they could not be found by previous telescopes.  These tiny galaxies are also ideal places to test fundamental questions about the origin of galaxies in our Universe.  This research focuses on the fact that these tiny galaxies are very sensitive to the first stars that formed in our Universe.  This fact has not been sufficiently explored in previous research.  To prepare astronomers to understand what these galaxies tell us about the origins of our Universe, this research focuses on three key areas.  First, they will predict the number of faint galaxies that the National Science Foundation's LSST should discover.  Second, they will predict how far away from the Milky Way the LSST might find the faint galaxies.  Third, they will predict whether any of these galaxies is still forming stars today, or whether they all stopped forming stars billions of years ago. The research advances the scientific leadership of the United States and help to safeguard the United States' investment in LSST.  The project focuses on training students who are first-generation college students, with the goal of diversifying the US technical workforce.  An expanded and diversified scientific workforce helps to ensure that the US remains a leader in innovation and economic growth.\r\n\r\nThe LSST will revolutionize our knowledge of dwarf galaxies, especially in the ultra-faint regime.  However, simulators have barely begun to extend their successful models to stellar masses below 1 million solar masses.  Now is the critical time to understand whether our current simulations can continue to explain galaxy formation down into the ultra-faint range, or whether a new understanding of star formation in low mass dark matter halos will be required. The goal of this work is to gain substantial knowledge about the processes that control early star formation in dwarf galaxies and subsequent quenching. The number of observed galaxies with stellar masses below 10 thousand solar masses depends strongly on the density of gas from which the first stars could form in the early Universe. The proposed work will generate hundreds of simulated dwarf galaxies, with stellar masses ranging from one billion solar masses (roughly 1/10 the mass of the Milky Way) down to 1000 solar masses in the range of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies.  This work utilizes the simulations to (1) pinpoint the role of star formation density threshold on the number of galaxies that form, and the resulting stellar mass function; (2) make predictions for the number of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies as function of radius from the Milky Way; (3) study the processes that quench dwarf galaxies as function of mass and environment, and make predictions for the quenched fraction in the field that can be observed by future facilities.  This work also establishes a program to support and mentor first-generation college students (many of whom are likely to also be from groups historically underrepresented in STEM) as they transition to being undergraduates. The program will (1) develop a mentoring relationship between students and members of the Rutgers Physics & Astronomy department, (2) utilize cohort building activities to develop the students into a peer support network for each other, (3) introduce the students to basic research tools and get them involved in original research. These three goals have been shown to increase the retention of underrepresented students in science. The overall aim is to improve the demographic diversity of both the Rutgers Physics & Astronomy undergraduate majors, but also of the Physics and Astronomy community. This program will also train graduate students to teach and mentor the first-year students, and educate the graduate student mentors on issues of equity and barriers to education that first-year/underrepresented students face.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Vera Rubin Telescope's Legacy Survey of Space &amp; Time (LSST), the top-ranked ground-based astronomy project this decade, will begin gathering data in the next couple of years.  The survey will discover billions of new astronomical objects, including hundreds of new galaxies nearby to our own Milky Way galaxy.  The new galaxies that we will discover are so faint that they could not be found by previous telescopes, and are called \"ultra-faint\" dwarf galaxies. This research simulates hundreds of dwarf galaxies in order to prepare astronomers to understand these newly discovered galaxies.  In particular, we explore the uncertainties that may make it difficult to understand the ultra-faint galaxies, helping to safeguard the United States' investment in LSST.\n\nFirst, we explored changing the way stars are born.  There is plenty of evidence that the mass that a star is born with is random.  We implemented a random mass model for star formation in our simulations, and compared to a deterministic model.  We find that a population of stars with random masses makes supernova (an explosion at the end of a massive star's life) able to heat and remove gas in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies.  These stellar explosions stop star formation in the small dwarf galaxies, sooner than would otherwise happen.  If the new model is more realistic, then we might expect the newly discovered galaxies to be older than expected.\n\nWe next explored yet a different way to form stars.  This time, we changed the properties of the gas that the stars are born from.  We compared the galaxies if we required molecular hydrogen to be present in the gas, or not.  We found that many more faint galaxies are able to form if molecular hydrogen is not present.  Since astronomers don't yet understand if molecular hydrogen is necessary for star formation, this means that we can't predict the exact number of faint galaxies that we expect LSST to find.  We estimated the range of possible numbers.\n\nWe then ran the highest resolution simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy to date.  This allowed us to simulate fainter neighbors of the Milky Way than had ever been done before.  We found that some of the ultra-faint dwarfs in the simulation still have gas, and are still forming stars at the present day.  This result is in contrast to all ultra-faint dwarfs discovered to date, which have no gas and are no longer forming stars.  However, the known galaxies are all much closer to us.  We predict a population of gas-rich, star-forming ultra-faint dwarfs will be discovered by LSST, at distances about 10 times further away than have been found so far.\n\nFinally, we used our hundreds of simulated dwarf galaxies to predict how many stars and how much dark matter will be present in the faint galaxies.  We find a tight relationship between the predicted amount of stars and dark matter, but the mass in dark matter gets more uncertain as there are fewer stars.  This relationship will be put to the the test with future observations of the newly discovered dwarf galaxies, allowing us to assess whether we understand galaxy formation at these small scales.  \n\nFinally, this project also supported education and training of future scientists and engineers across all academic levels, with the overall goal to diversify the US technical workforce. Two graduate students were supported by this research, one of whom has obtained a PhD and entered the US workforce in data science. The project also supported a first-year undergraduate seminar, with 15 first-year Rutgers undergraduates participating in Fall 2019, the majority of whom (75%) were students of color.  The students were introduced to coding in python, participated in cohort building events, conducted small research projects in teams of two, and presented their research to the department on the final day of class.
