 "awd_abstract_narration": "All biological field stations need modern communications and information networks tailored to their situations to optimally support ongoing research and education programs and facilitate new lines of research. Researchers need access to environmental data, sensors and sensor stations, remote access to field sites and equipment, access to the internet and servers, and the ability to efficiently upload and transmit data from remote locations via standardized data schemes. This project will update and expand an existing radiotelemetry network at the Black Rock Forest field station (http://blackrockforest.org) in New York. The expected impacts will be greater research productivity, increased future research capacity, expanded opportunities for collaboration through data sharing, and substantial broader community impacts through education and outreach. The new network will enable expansion of connectivity and data transmission in the more remote portions of the forest where new research efforts will be initiated.  These long-term enhancements to the Black Rock Forest's infrastructure will create opportunities for teaching and learning, dissemination of environmental information to a broader audience including the public, and for increasing the involvement of the diverse groups who interact with the field station.\r\n\r\nThe improvements will consist of a new off-grid wireless mesh network, extending the old network with more than twenty new, self-powered wireless access points (store and forward mesh data nodes), two new transmission towers, an application programming interface (API) to support all users, and a new research-dedicated web portal. Based on open source software, this installation will simplify aggregation of a variety of sensor types and management of different data streams for use by a wide range of researchers and institutions. The system is designed to be simple and expandable through the use of foundational modules applicable to forest environments anywhere. The new network will enable expansion of connectivity and data transmission in the more remote western side of the forest where new research efforts have been proposed. It will contribute to increased science literacy and understanding of the natural world among the 13,000 students who visit Black Rock Forest each year, increased STEM training and college preparation, increased participation particularly of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM activities, and increased activity in BRFC public and citizen science programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The project was successfully completed in 2020. Starting in the 1990s Black Rock Forest developed an Environmental Monitoring Network of research sites where environmental data were automatically recorded from sensors measuring variables such as air and soil temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, streamflow, and water quality parameters. The data were transmitted to the Black Rock Forest Science Center once each hour via a radiotelemetry network where they were stored and made available for viewing, downloading, and analysis by scientists and students. The 2018 NSF grant was awarded to modernize and upgrade this Network with new technologies, in particular, replacing the older radiotelemetry network with a new Wifi communications system and expanding the Network range. The coverage zone now extends over more than a quarter of the 4000 acres of the Forest with further expansion possible. The new Wireless Mesh Network provides instantaneous access to any sensor station connected to the Network. The mesh aspect provides multiple pathways that the data can travel in case one or more transmission legs of the network become temporarily unavailable, and also store and forward nodes that store data whenever data transmission is interrupted and then forward the data when connectivity becomes restored. New sensor installations in the Network include a phenology camera, a CritterCam, and connections to a series of tree growth sensors (digital point dendrometers).
