 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Professor Edward Merino from University of Cincinnati and colleagues Patrick Limbach, James Mack II and Neil Ayres have acquired a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization, tandem time-of-flight, tandem mass spectrometer MALDI-ToF/ToF-MS/MS) equipped with multiple ionization sources. In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species in complex samples. MALDI TOF combines gentle ionization (ideal for producing intact ions of peptides, proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, synthetic polymers, and other similarly sized species) with a detection mode that offers an excellent balance between sensitivity and accuracy across a wide mass range. This highly sensitive technique allows identification and determination of the structure of molecules in a complex mixture. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the university and regional area. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse students with this modern analytical technique. The instrument improves research projects from around southwestern Ohio. The Mass Spectrometry Facility analyzes samples from other universities and private companies. Thus, this new instrument answers new research questions derived from the local area. The instrumentation enables further growth in research that addresses wider research themes of biomaterials, chemical sensing and many other applications.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It is especially useful in characterizing synthesized blood compatible biomaterials and for uncovering the chemistry and biology of reactive molecules. This mass spectrometer is used in the development of recyclable catalysts and reagents using mechanochemistry and in investigations of radiation-induced damage during translation in melanized fungi which is associated with a wide variety of infectious syndromes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
