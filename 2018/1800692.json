 "awd_abstract_narration": "Knight works in computability theory, a branch of mathematical logic.  There is a body of work designing procedures for computing certain functions, and there is work designing useful approximation procedures for other functions.  There are many real-world functions (involving population, revenue, location of objects in space or events in time, etc.) that we can know only through approximations.  Knight is particularly interested in computability and computable approximation in number systems and other algebraic structures.  Traditionally, computability theory has dealt with countable objects.  However, important algebraic structures such as the field of real numbers are uncountable.  Some of the problems that interest Knight involve computability in uncountable structures.                      \r\n\r\nWith Karen Lange and Reed Solomon, Knight is trying to measure the complexity of the process of finding roots of polynomials in fields of generalized power series.  Some of the ideas go back to Newton.  With Uri Andrews, Knight is interested in the problem of when an elementary first order theory that is well-behaved from the point of view of model theory has a computable model.  Andrews and Knight have a result for \"strongly minimal\" theories, with conditions on the complexity of fragments of the theory guaranteeing that the countable models all have computable copies.  For some cases, the models are produced by \"workers\" constructions, involving nested approximations.  Knight is interested in applying the techniques of computability to uncountable structures.  There are different approaches.  Some involve changing the definition of what is computable.  Noah Schweber defined a reducibility that allows us to compare the computing power of structures of arbitrary cardinality, using the standard computability notions.  The idea is to collapse cardinals so that the structures being compared become countable.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe grant provided partial support for three of Knight's graduate students.  Rose Weisshaar and Rachael Alvir completed their PhD's.  Grant Goodman left the program.  Knight believes that it is valuable for students to have experience in collaborative research.  All three of her students contributed to the paper ``Interpreting a field in its Heisenberg group.''  The paper had further collaborators from the U.S., Russia, and Bulgaria. \n\nBoth Weisshaar and Alvir had further collaborators.  Weisshaar's research measured complexity of certain kinds of sets---generics of different kinds, theories of arithmetic, and ``omega-models'' of a weak version of set theory.  Alvir's research focused on ``Scott complexity.''  Some of her results are abstract---they apply to all structures.  Other results concern specific kinds of structures, groups or linear orderings.  Together with Dino Rossegger, she studied ``scattered'' linear orderings, giving sharp bounds on the Scott complexity in terms of the Hausdorff rank. \n\nAlvir helped Knight to mentor an undergraduate, Hannah Burchfield.  Burchfield's senior thesis involved saying when there is an effective procedure that, given copies of two structures $A$ and $B$, but not told which is which, always gives a copy of $A$.  Burchfield found some sufficient conditions.  It seemed likely that for most pairs of structures, there is no such procedure, but it was difficult to produce an example.  The project became joint.  The example that we found involved two kinds of forcing.  Burchfield thought of, and managed to prove, some very interesting lemmas toward this.                 \n\nA covid supplement provided partial support for further logic students at Notre Dame, and also for a postdoc, Ben Castle, whose plans had been derailed by Covid.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/18/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Julia F Knight"
