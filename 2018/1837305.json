 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rutgers University proposes a research practice partnership (RPP) -- the Computer Science Teaching and Learning Collaboratory (CS-TLC) -- that brings together computer science (CS) educators, educational researchers, and industry partners to provide targeted, differentiated professional development (PD) and ongoing virtual support to high school CS teachers and schools. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, CS-TLC will (a) develop and deliver high-quality CS PD for teachers that enhances their ability to deliver instruction that is responsive to their students' abilities, motivation, and cultural backgrounds; (b) invest in building the capacity of school and district leaders to plan, implement, manage, and evaluate programs and policies that can support rigor and equity in CS education; and (c) engage in research and community-building activities that can improve the performance, effectiveness, and sustainability of the RPP as well as expand the size and diversity of its membership. This proposal directly addresses the issue of equity in CS education as the collaborating school districts serve many students who have been traditionally underrepresented in CS including rural students, students living in poverty, and Hispanic and African American students. By working in collaboration with a network of teachers and administrators who serve these students, the team well tailor activities and pedagogy of content to addresses the different needs and experiences of students, providing them with opportunities for rigorous and engaging CS instruction.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The hub of the project was the RPP, i.e., the CS-TLC, where Rutgers University faculty and researchers partnered with educators and LEAs to harness the knowledge and experience of all partners to facilitate the <em>short-term</em> implementation of CS curricular and instructional innovations alongside a <em>long-term</em> cycle of content and pedagogical improvement, both with the ultimate goal of broadening participation in computer science. Over 50 educators, representing 15 school districts, and serving approximately 20,000 students, took part in the CS-TLC research-practice partnership (RPP). Key collaborative activities included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Monthly Virtual RPP Meetings</em> dedicated to sharing progress regarding local and overall ongoing efforts; collaborating in small groups focused on identifying best practices and exploring potential innovations or enhancements that can enrich students' CS learning experience; diving deeper into key aspects or challenges to enhancing rigor and equity in CS education (e.g., parent outreach and engagement, integrating CS across disciplines, etc.); and discussing actionable items emerging from work groups. RPP meetings provided the space and opportunity for educators to exchange ideas and experiences; co-develop and co-produce curricular materials; and explore ways to adapt evidence-based pedagogy to the unique characteristics and circumstances of each unit. At the conclusion of the project, nearly 95% of participants agreed that CS-TLC was successful in (a) creating and supporting norms of collaboration and equitable participation, (b) facilitating thoughtful and action-oriented engagement with research evidence, and (c) contributing significantly to their professional learning and capacity to implement high-quality and equitable CS education in their program. <br /> <br /> </li>\n<li><em>Annual Summer Institutes</em>, which brought the full RPP community to the Rutgers University campus for five-days of professional learning and collaboration opportunities. With support and feedback from their peers, school-based teams used this opportunity to engage in a planning process focused on formulating specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-bound (SMART) goals regarding student recruitment into CS classes and the optimal delivery of CS curriculum across grade levels. Team building and socializing activities strengthened relationships and generated excitement for participating in the RPP. In participant satisfaction and feedback evaluations, the summer institutes were frequently noted as the highlight of participating in the program and RPP, with virtually all participants -- especially CS teachers who had reported feeling isolated and/or unsupported at their home units -- sharing that these gatherings provided extensive in-person time for learning, sharing, working, and relationship-building; and expert and peer support for planning and implementation. <br /> <br /> </li>\n<li><em>Professional Learning Opportunities</em>, both synchronous and asynchronous: (a) engaged educators with fresh perspectives on new (or less familiar) concepts in computer science and computational thinking; (b) provided a forum for examining innovative and equitable teaching strategies that could be feasibly integrated into instruction; and (c) allowed space for sharing resources and discussing materials or ideas. There is evidence that teacher knowledge of both content and pedagogy increased over the course of the project, as did self-efficacy for teaching computer science to historically underrepresented student populations. In addition to teachers, school and district administrators were supported through professional learning opportunities that equipped them with the knowledge and tools necessary to promote best practices in CS teaching and learning that ensure equity and the ability to make informed decisions regarding course offerings and staffing. RPP members also spent time working collaboratively to develop mechanisms to recruit and retain underrepresented students to CS courses, and to create a support system to address the specific needs of the diverse populations (e.g., providing time, space, technology). There were also some indicators of systemic changes happening within schools, including the intentional recruitment of all students, and offering a wider range of CS courses and/or extra-curricular or informal learning opportunities connected to CS.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In summary, over the course of the project and following its conclusion, participating educators and schools became better equipped to implement meaningful changes to CSE in their schools by: (a) increasing their ability to use innovative and collaborative structures to better allow for an inclusive classroom experience; (b) enhancing their overall CS content and pedagogical knowledge as well as self-efficacy to teach CS effectively to diverse student populations; (c) preparing them to introduce new CS courses for high school students; and (d) growing the number of afterschool clubs and CS-relevant community activities such as CS family nights and Hackathons. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, educators developed meaningful collaborations across schools within and beyond their district that continue to support inclusive, innovative, and cohesive CSE, as well as provided a foundation for the exploration of other problems of practice.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/03/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Cynthia&nbsp;L&nbsp;Blitz</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1837305/1837305_10583158_1677874766113_CS-TLCPoster1-ConnectingCSEducators--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1837305/1837305_10583158_1677874766113_CS-TLCPoster1-ConnectingCSEducators--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"CS-TLC: Connecting CS Educators for Equity &amp; Engagement\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1837305/1837305_10583158_1677874766113_CS-TLCPoster1-ConnectingCSEducators--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"CS-TLC: Connecting CS Educators for Equity &amp; Engagement\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This poster provides a high-level overview of the CS-TLC project, its goals, and the themes it explored.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Rutgers CS-TLC: Drs.
