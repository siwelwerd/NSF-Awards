 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Workshop is dedicated to the Constructal Law, a new physics theory emanating from the contemplation of how natural systems evolve in time, and its implications to thermal transport processes. The forming of river basins, the shaping of mammal lungs, the percolation paths of coffee brewing, the growth of tree roots and branches, the complexity of blood vessel networks, all have similarities in their evolution: to exist, it seems, they must morph toward structures that facilitate access to what flows. The bringing together of thermal transport processes experts in Constructal Law is paramount to measure the impact so far of this new law in thermal transport processes, to determine how it can better contribute to the thermal transport knowledge base, and to identify how this area will evolve in the near future as to guide its dissemination. It is also an opportunity for the community to organize and plan around constructal law.\r\n\r\nThe observations of natural systems resulting in the constructal law can be applied to engineering systems as well, to anticipate how complex thermal transport systems should evolve so they continue to exist. This concept is intrinsically related to the Thermodynamics of energy and entropy balances, via the work (energy) needed to flow and the dissipating heat resulting from it.  Diffusion, convection, and radiation are also intrinsically related to constructal law, as they are the most important heat and mass transport processes affecting thermal systems. The contributions of each in new thermal transport processes should not be dictated by materials or manufacturing limitations alone, but should also account for how they will contribute to facilitating access to what flows. The new paradigm born out of constructal law is for the thermal designer not to avoid geometric complexity; rather, to embrace and explore it, to recognize the importance of new form-function relationships as to facilitate access to what flows. The main outcome of this workshop is expected to be a clear direction of constructal law and its implications to thermal transport processes.",
