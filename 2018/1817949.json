 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the mechanism of irreversible color conversion, as observed in a set of fluorescent proteins derived from jellyfish and reef corals. This group of proteins, termed green-to-red photoconvertible fluorescent proteins (pcFPs), has greatly advanced molecular and cellular imaging techniques in the life sciences.  Notably, the light-induced change in appearance has played a critical role in the development of super-resolution methods to image subcellular events beyond the diffraction limit of visible light. The objective of this project is to unravel the connection between protein motion and the rearrangement of chemical bonds, an interplay that is ultimately responsible for the development of red color. Ultrafast spectroscopic methods and computer modeling will be combined with time-dependent biochemical measurements on pcFPs. The correlation of dynamical and chemical processes will help elucidate novel principles in photobiology and enzymology.  This work will facilitate the training of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as the training of post-doctoral researchers.  In addition, this project will serve as a cornerstone for a number of outreach activities.  To enhance evidence-based instructional practices, cutting-edge research on pcFPs will be integrated into formal coursework. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of this work is to investigate how ultrafast atomic motions in a protein's active site are linked to long-range dynamics and catalytic functionality.  To develop a mechanistic model that connects protein motions to key chemical events, femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy (FSRS) will be combined with photoconversion kinetic measurements and molecular dynamics simulations.  Currently, wavelength-tunable FSRS is the only table-top technique that can track bond vibrations starting with photoexcitation.  Mechanistic hypotheses will be tested by evaluating rate and equilibrium constants of pcFPs engineered to bear modified building blocks.  With this synergistic approach, functional models will be developed that integrate ultrafast atomic motions, local side chain rotations and global chain dynamics on the pathway of color modification.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Notably, the mechanistic understanding of the fluorescence properties of green-to-red photoconvertible FPs, how they originate and evolve on molecular timescales, how the chromophore interacts with the local environment, and how we can tune them with targeted functions such as redder and brighter emissions remains challenging to obtain. This project effectively tackles this problem by implementing wavelength-tunable femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy (FSRS) at the OSU Chemistry laboratory housed in Linus Pauling Science Center, aided by femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) and density functional theory (DFT)-based quantum calculations, revealing the fluorescence modulation mechanisms in an array of photochromic FPs.</span></p>\n<p><span>On the&nbsp;<strong>experimental/technological front</strong>, the Fang Lab has developed a versatile tunable FSRS setup in the visible range (ca. 480-720 nm) to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of transient species in condensed phases (e.g., solution, proteins). The synergistic use of steady-state (absorption and fluorescence) and time-resolved (fs-TA) spectroscopy has proven beneficial in selecting the optimal actinic pump (for photoexcitation) and Raman pump-probe pair (for signal generation).&nbsp;The use of a common stimulated emission (SE) band of these FPs for pre-resonance enhancement is effective, highlighted by a comprehensive article (<em>IJMS</em> 2023) benchmarking various green, orange, and red FPs with ground-state FSRS methodology. On the&nbsp;<strong>system/<strong>knowledge front</strong></strong>, the Fang Lab has revealed fluorescence modulation mechanisms of an engineered single-site mutant of an emission-ratiometric Ca<sup>2+</sup> biosensor called GEM-GECO1-P377R (2018), a single-site mutant GFP-S205V (2018), a green-to-red photoconvertible FP termed LEA (2020) with previously unknown photoswitching capabilities (2023), a wild-type yellow fluorescent protein for excitation-ratiometric chloride sensing (2021), a green-red emission and excitation ratiometric Ca</span><sup><span>2+</span></sup><span> biosensor REX-GECO1 (2021 and 2023), a large Stokes shift RFP called mKeima (2023), and a red fluorescent protein with a noncanonical chromophore (2023). On the&nbsp;<strong>related photosensitive molecular system front</strong>, the Fang Lab has studied a tree-fungi-derived conjugated chromophore called xylindein with excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (2021a,b) and a methylated compound to promote ultrafast triplet state formation (2021c), a series of halogenated GFP chromophores in solution (2021), a cyanobacteriochrome photoreceptor with a larger chromophore cofactor than GFP (2021a,b), a tetrazine-encoded superfolder-GFP for high bioorthogonal fluorogenicity (2022), and nitrophenols/nitrophenolates in solution (2023). Such new knowledge generated throughout the entire project funding period has helped to elucidate the chemistry and biophysics for FPs derived from jellyfish and reef corals, and aided protein engineers and chemical biologists to rationally design new FPs and FP-based biosensors for broad applications in chemical, biomedical, and life sciences.
