 "awd_abstract_narration": "Classification of shapes has many important applications in a variety of fields. For example, anthropologists use shape classification on fossilized faunal teeth to reconstruct past environments and on variation in the shapes of stone tools to assess different technological strategies.  Other applications include classification of plants based on the shape of their leaves and identification of shapes of tumors.  While there are many statistical tools that can be used for classification, most methods are based on complete shapes with relatively few methods available for partially observed or incomplete shapes. This project focuses of the development of new statistical methodology, based on the ideas of multiple imputation, for the analysis of partially observed shapes.\r\n\r\nThis project proposes as a starting point leveraging the ideas of nonparametric, hot-deck type multiple imputation to shapes that are defined by unlabeled points and/or functions, as opposed to shapes defined by landmarks where traditional methods of multiple imputation may be applied.  The proposed method involves matching partially observed shapes to fully observed shapes, randomly choosing a fully observed donor shape among the shapes that are good matches for the partial shape, and then completing the partial shape with the unmatched part of the donor shape. A simulation study will be conducted to compare the relative merits of different partial matching methods.  The imputation framework will be tested using teeth from the Family Bovidae, whose classification plays an important role in biological anthropology for identifying the taxa of specimens, which in turn is used to reconstruct paleoenvirnoments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nAnthropological researchers typically rely on fossil animals in the Family Bovidae (e.g. antelopes and buffaloes) to reconstruct past environments of our early human ancestors. Bovids reflect distinct ecological adaptations in terms of diet, habitat, water dependence, and seasonal migrations that vary according to their respective ecological niches. Bovid remains, especially isolated teeth, dominate the South African fossil faunal assemblages. Unfortunately, the taxonomic identification of these specimens is often imprecise and subjective, a difficulty compounded by the fragmentary nature of the associated assemblages. \nPrevious research found that bovids from southern Africa could be taxonomically identified using the shape of the occlusal (chewing) surface of their fully observed teeth. However, broken bovid teeth are common in the fossil record.\nThis project developed a framework to predict the unobserved portions of partially observed shapes (e.g. broken bovid teeth), which is referred to as imputation.  Each partially observed shape can then be completed several times, hence multiple imputation, and the collection of completed shapes can then be analyzed using more traditional statistical methods for fully observed shapes with results being combined across the different shape completions.  A large scale simulation study was performed to examine the relative merits of the methods proposed here under several different settings. \n\nThrough our simulation study, we demonstrated that when we hold the scale of the teeth fixed (i.e. classification is based on shape AND size) we can classify the partially observed bovid teeth to the correct tribe with accuracy in the range of 70%-90%, depending on the type of tooth (e.g. Lower Molar 1, Upper Molar 2, etc.), using a simple classification method (i.e. k-nearest neighbors). Classifying teeth to species has proven much more difficult and our accuracy is in the range of 30%-50%. When scaling the teeth (i.e. classification is based on shape only), classification rates, as expected, drop to 60%-80% and 15%-35% for tribe and species, respectively. While classification accuracy of the proposed method is reasonably high, we have actually observed slightly higher accuracy rates in most cases by using k-nearest neighbors without actually using any imputation.  However, the performance can also be evaluated using log-loss which measures how well the predicted probabilities of a taxonomic group aligns with the correct classification.  Using this evaluation metric, the imputation method proposed here along with a simple classification method outperforms classification without performing imputation in a large percentages of the settings studied here.  \n\nResults of this work were presented at the Joint Statistical Meetings in both 2019 and 2020, and manuscript with the results of the simulation study as well as an application to partial bovid fossils is nearly complete.  In addition to the work developing statistical methods, the funding from this grant allowed the collaborating anthropologist to travel to South Africa to collect additional images of both fossil and extant bovid teeth, notably increasing the collection of fractured bovid teeth to use as an application of the methods developed here.  These new images, along with previously collected images, are now being stored in a database developed as part of this project, and this database is accessible to any scientific researcher who may find this collection of images useful in their research.  \n\nFinally, the results of this research laid the groundwork for this line of study, which allowed us to submit a more ambitious, larger scale follow-up grant, ultimately resulting in successful funding.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/03/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Juliet K Brophy"
