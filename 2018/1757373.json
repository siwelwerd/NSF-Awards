 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Marine Advanced Technology Center (MATE) at the Monterey Peninsula College will continue to manage a program that places interns in at-sea technical positions in collaboration with the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) and the United States Coast Guard (USCG). The program will provide 12-14 undergraduate students with two to twelve-week internships and one student with a six-month internship each year for the next three years (2018-2021). MATE interns work with marine technicians and scientists onboard research vessels and these experiences provide them with the opportunity to develop their technical, scientific, seamanship and interpersonal skills. Ships that are part of the UNOLS and the USCG fleets will serve as internship hosts. UNOLS and USCG are committed to providing berthing space and meals on their vessels during a research cruise and marine technicians who act as mentors. These internships provide students with the opportunity to develop their technical, scientific, seamanship, and interpersonal skills, and give ocean-related employers access to qualified technical professionals who can fill their workforce needs. While the program is open to all U.S. undergraduates, recruitment efforts are focused on community college students enrolled in marine technology programs and university students interested in marine technical careers. This training effort is important for the continued operation of the U.S. academic research fleet and for the marine industries that benefit by hiring the highly skilled technicians who graduate from the program.  \r\n\r\nWith a focus on recruiting students from community colleges who are interested in careers as marine technicians, MATE internship program fills a unique need in the continuum of support for undergraduate students in marine sciences. This program provides an excellent bridge between students who need training and experience and academic and industrial employers who need technical support. The MATE internship program will provide a total of forty-five undergraduates with internships over the three-year period. Most of the funding provided supports student stipends and travel to meet the research vessels where they will be working. The MATE internship program supports national goals by developing the next generation of technically skilled workforce.\r\n\r\nSkills and experience gained through all MATE internships vary depending on the research vessel, cruise goals and tasks the mentors need to accomplish during the cruise. Typical experiences include: 1) cruise preparation and coordination; 2) operation and maintenance of specific oceanographic equipment [e.g. Conductivity Temperature Depth (CTD), Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), fluorometer, transmissometer, temperature and salinity sampling, nutrient sampling, sonar and echosounders, current profilers, corers and nets, underwater cameras, AUVs, ROVs]; 3) trouble shooting instruments and equipment; 4) chemical analyses; 5) operation and maintenance of computer hardware and software; 6) programming software for data retrieval, analysis, and archiving; 7) seamanship, marine operations, and safety procedures; 8) navigation skills; 9) application of basic oceanographic and meteorological knowledge to sampling design and execution; 10) teamwork and other interpersonal skills; 11) experience working in a marine and scientific environment; and 12) communication skills.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Students who choose to pursue marine technical careers are often caught in the paradox of not being able to acquire a job without work experience, and not being able to get work experience without a job. The MATE At-Sea Technical Internship Program (<a href=\"https://www.marinetech.org/internships/\">https://www.marinetech.org/internships/</a>) offers an essential solution to this problem; at-sea technical internships help undergraduate students gain the experience they need at sea with high tech equipment and help ocean-related employers gain access to qualified technical professionals who can fill their workforce needs. By working side-by-side with professional marine technicians onboard UNOLS and USCG research vessels, MATE interns develop their technical, scientific, seamanship, and interpersonal skills.</p>\n<p>This grant provided funding for 40 interns from 28 colleges and universities to work aboard 10 different research vessels within the U.S. Academic Research Fleet (ARF). Internships lasted between three weeks and six months; but due to the pandemic, some internships were converted from at sea to land-based technical support positions and extended in length. Interns worked with marine technicians, engineers, scientists and other crew on shore and at sea and learned how to operate and maintain a variety of scientific and navigational equipment in support of shipboard scientific research. They assisted marine technicians with deck operations and provided technical support deploying, maintaining and repairing oceanographic systems and instruments, while participating in many activities including the operations and maintenance of human occupied vehicle, ROV and AUV submersibles, deployment and recovery of HABCAM systems, CTD casts, scallop dredging, deck safety and small boat operations. These tasks were performed on cruises to support science projects ranging from chemical oceanography to marine biology, GIS/bathymetric surveys, geological studies and more.</p>\n<p>As a result of completing MATE Internships, many interns have been recruited to fill Marine Technical and Engineering positions. Out of the 40 interns supported by this grant period, 22 are currently working as Marine Technicians and Oceanographic Engineers for the ARF, 8 are employed as Marine Technicians or in a closely-related ship-based job with other institutions, 4 are employed in other STEM related fields, 1 is in a non-STEM position as a Sales Associate, and 5 are continuing their studies in Marine Science, Engineering and Technology.</p>\n<p>During this grant period, a robust database of intern alumni was developed to track student career paths. Out of 89 respondents to a 2022 survey, 33 have been recruited by the ARF to work aboard ships, 20 are working as Marine Technicians or in a closely related ship-based job with other institutions, 29 are employed in other STEM related fields, 1 is&nbsp;in a non-STEM position as&nbsp;a Sales Associate, 1 did not report employment status, and 5 are continuing their studies in Marine Science, Engineering and Technology.
