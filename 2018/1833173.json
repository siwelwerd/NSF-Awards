 "awd_abstract_narration": "By mass, dust is the most pervasive aerosol in the Earth's atmosphere. Dust plays an important role in the Earth's weather and climate since mineral aerosols affect the hydrological cycle, oceanic and terrestrial nutrient budget, and radiative energy budget. A large fraction of the total atmospheric dust load is due to emission from closed topographic depressions (closed basins), yet little is known about the meteorological processes controlling dust emission from such topographic features. The project aims to address this gap in understanding by elucidating the meteorological controls on dust emission and transport in a closed basin via observational and numerical analysis of dust storms originating in the Salton Basin, a closed sub-sea level basin in extreme southeastern California that experiences frequent dust storms.\r\n\r\nPrevious field studies have focused on elucidating the meteorological controls on dust emission and transport within the largest dust sources in the Sahara, yet the initial results presented here suggest that the meteorological processes fundamental to dust emission and transport in a closed basin are very different from those over the expansive source regions in the Sahara. This project will focus on the role of warm Foehn events on dust emission. The Salton Sea is the large shallow lake that fills the lowest portions of the Salton Basin, which was accidentally created in 1905 by engineers attempting to irrigate the Imperial Valley. New legislation enacted in 2017 is resulting in a massive reduction in freshwater input to the Salton Sea and it is expected that the level of the Salton will drop so much over the next decade that its surface area may shrink by 100 to 200 square miles. This project will also elucidate the effect of the drying of the Sea on the meteorological processes responsible for dust emission and estimate how the expanding dry playa will influence the total dust burden for the basin.\r\n\r\nThe Broader Impacts of this research center on using the new scientific findings to inform policy and improve human health outcomes from exposure to airborne dust for the quarter-million people living and working in the affected area. Scientific results will be communicated with stakeholders via the state's Salton Sea Management Program (SSMP) in order to inform policy decisions, particularly in terms of those management activities aimed at reducing dust emission from the dry playa. Additionally, a forecast version of WRF-Chem will be developed and validated in order to provide 5-day forecasts of dust concentrations for the region. The main goal of these forecasts will be to afford vulnerable groups, health care providers and first responders an opportunity to mitigate adverse human health and safety risks associated with local dust storms. The Principal Investigator (PI) will work with the SSMP's Public Outreach Committee in order to reach relevant stakeholders and improve the utility of the forecast products.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

For example, dust can influence the hydrological cycle by affecting cloud properties. Dust can affect biological activity in diverse ecosystems due to the iron and phosphorus contained within the particles and alter global temperature through interactions with short and longwave radiation, and cloud droplets.</p>\n<p>Given the varied and global scale of the impacts of dust on the environment, there is a need to understand the processes underlying those impacts. This project focused on the processes of dust emission from the surface and transport through the atmosphere, and the role local meteorology plays in governing this movement of dust. More specifically, we aimed to examine the meteorological aspects of dust storms from geographically small dust source regions. These small source regions are interesting because although individually they may not be important sources of dust to the atmosphere, collectively they are significant at regional to global scales. These small sources are also interesting because they are oftentimes strongly affected by complex terrain; dramatic changes in the topography that are expressed over short distances that exert strong effects on local ecosystems, land surface characteristics, and weather.</p>\n<p>This project sought to improve understanding of dust, and the meteorology underlying dust storms from these small sources by generating new and novel measurements of both in a remote region of southeastern California, the Salton Basin. Through this project, a new research site was built downwind of a major dust source region in the area, which began making measurements of dust and meteorology in 2019, and that continues to make measurements (Figure 1).
