 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate an additive manufacturing process to produce 3-D woven textile products at scale. Presently, the clothing manufacturing industry still relies on manual sewing machines that were invented over one-hundred and seventy years ago. This system limits the manufacturing process and textile capability; an abundance of steps leads to waste, inefficiencies, and segmented products. Further, due to the low cost of foreign labor, the US textile industry has effectively come to a halt: 97.3 percent of all clothing sold in the United States in 2015 was imported. This project seeks to develop a novel method for manufacturing woven textile products by employing additive manufacturing methodologies to automate the production process, while simultaneously enabling complete customization and on-demand production. This technology will enable premium and competitive textile manufacturing to return from overseas, creating high value-added jobs and a designer community in the United States while also generating tax revenue. In the same way that 3-D printing technology has revolutionized the hard goods manufacturing process, this project seeks to create an entire new industry of additively manufactured textile products, enabling significant opportunities for future innovation.\r\n\r\nThis project develops a novel technology to manufacture near-net-shape three dimensional woven textile products. To develop this technology, this project first proved feasibility through creating constituent textile panels of non-standard shapes with 3-D topography in Phase I, laying the foundation for continued development into fully three-dimensional, seamless, finished products produced in-situ through Phase II. By additively producing garments from a unique 3-D model complete customization to each individual consumer is possible on a large scale, though this has never before been accomplished. Further, through the on-demand production of clothing customized to individual consumers, the need for substantial inventory buildup is eliminated. In this way, additively manufactured textile products are both more desirable to consumers and more economical to producers. As such, the societal and environmental benefits of automated and on-demand textile manufacturing within the United States are significant, including eliminating massive amounts of waste from typical cut-and-sew manufacturing techniques, revamping a struggling American manufacturing industry, and minimizing the economical, environmental, and geopolitical implications of the United States? current dependence on a convoluted global supply chain.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

By skipping the cut-and-sew methodology and directly weaving yarns into a 3D garment, apparel manufacturing can be highly efficient, and even open the door to on-demand production. As the goal of the Phase II program is to expand on the proven-feasible technology developed in Phase I and fund Research &amp; Development towards a prototype, the high-level Phase II technical objective was to develop an additive manufacturing process to produce 3D woven textile products at scale. \nWith the development of unspun\u2019s on-demand, whole-garment production method for woven textiles, the field of textile production may undergo a paradigm shift towards the creation of end products instead of raw materials.  Our work indicates the potential for significant efficiency advantages with this approach, yielding both better products and less waste.  With direct (and automated) manufacturing of whole garments, manufacturing can be located closer to domestic markets due to reduced labor dependence. During the course of our research, the capabilities and limitations of 3D weaving as it pertains to clothing production has also been further understood. \nFurther, current methods of clothing manufacture and distribution are exorbitantly CO2 intensive, unnecessarily wasteful, and socially inequitable.  By moving to an on-demand system where garments are 3D-woven as needed, many of the negative externalities associated with the current textile industry can be overcome.  Localized production leads to fewer CO2 emissions as the garment travels shorter distances between manufacture and point of sale, while excess inventory waste is eliminated by the build-as-needed business model. \nPhase II of this SBIR investigation has proven both the technical foundation of unspun\u2019s 3D weaving technology, as well as a demonstrated commercial need; the opportunity to create an entirely new industry of manufacturing in the United States via an optimized and automated process is even a possibility. \n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/26/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Elizabeth F Esponnette"
