 "awd_abstract_narration": "The observation and study of Earth surface and atmospheric processes using remote sensing is an area of scientific and technological innovation as well as workforce growth. One of the primary ways to analyze and synthesize the complex processes and impacts on the atmosphere and Earth's surface is to utilize a multi-sensor framework with multiple partners and organizations. From event-based studies of natural disasters to long-term ecological and hydrological forecasting, this systems research topic spans time horizons and thematic areas with a focus on remote sensing using ground-based radar platforms as well as active and passive satellite sensors.  This project will bring ten undergraduate students together each year for a ten-week summer research experience on remote sensing of atmospheric and land surface processes.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the program will be to introduce a diverse student cohort to the wide range of research topics and applications surrounding remote sensing of the Earth surface and atmosphere. Participants will be paired with scientists and their research teams from collaborating organizations: UAH Earth System Science Center, NASA MSFC Earth Science Branch, NOAA NWS Weather Forecast Office, and private industry partners. Throughout the summer, students will join other interns in professional and research development workshops at UAH and will take part in tours, discussions, and lectures from local organizations, private industry, and federal agencies related to Earth, atmospheric, and geospatial sciences. Students will be selected from a national pool of applicants, but targeted recruitment efforts will take place at regional and under-served institutions in the Southeast and Ohio River Valley.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
