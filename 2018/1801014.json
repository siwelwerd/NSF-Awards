 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Unmanned Aircraft Systems Operations and Maintenance Training Project at Atlantic Cape Community College in New Jersey aims to advance technician education and training in the rapidly evolving and critically important field of small commercial unmanned aircraft systems (UAS).  To this end, this project plans to develop a curriculum for a new academic program that will prepare students to work as technicians in operation, maintenance, and repair of small UAS. Through site visits and a national steering committee, the project will work with employers to identify current and future needs for technicians.  It will use this information to create an associate degree program that aligns with the expectations of employers, manufacturers, and regulatory agencies. This new curriculum could benefit employers involved directly in the UAS industry, as well as employers in other fields such as agriculture, insurance, real estate, utilities, construction, media, and law enforcement/public safety. Project results will be shared with other community and technical colleges interested in training UAS technicians, with a special focus on building capacity for colleges that wish to develop an aviation technician program or to enhance current offerings. The project will promote diversity in the technical workforce by training all students in entrepreneurial principles and skills, and by supporting enrollment and retention of female students. The project aims to create a pool of trained technicians available for work in southern New Jersey, a region in which policymakers and government agencies are encouraging development of a robust UAS industry.\r\n\r\nThe project will define the skills and knowledge needed to enable a technician to maintain, upgrade, or repair a small UAS, and develop an innovative academic program that promotes the requisite student learning. Curriculum development will use a systematic approach to instructional design, based on the Dick and Carey model instructional model.  This approach includes defining the needs, the audience, the tasks that students will need to master, as well as planning for student assessment and course/program evaluation. The curriculum will include education and training in aviation regulation, aviation weather, aeronautical knowledge, mechanical/electronic engineering, geospatial data collection, and computer science. The curriculum will also include three competency areas that researchers have identified for UAS technicians: hardware, software, and documentation and personnel issues. Drone manufacturers and employers will provide input to ensure that the program educates skilled technicians who can comply with FAA regulations for safe operation of small drones in the national airspace system. Industry experts conclude that the largest barrier in building a UAS maintenance knowledge base is lack of maintenance documentation for drones. The project will address this barrier by facilitating greater information-sharing by manufacturers. Project leaders have extensive professional contacts and collaborators in the UAS industry, as well as administrative experience and expertise in engineering curriculum development. The project plans to build on an existing aviation program at the college that can provide resources (e.g., equipment; teaching space; administrative support) and a sustainable source of new equipment and ongoing professional development opportunities for faculty. Other academic institutions, including Rutgers University, New Jersey Institute of Technology, and the University of Arkansas-Fort Smith, will provide input on the curriculum and related project activities.  In addition, so that this program can build on existing expertise and experience in UAS technician training, the project leaders will make site visits to other community colleges with active UAS training programs, including Sinclair Community College in Ohio and Northland Community and Technical College in Minnesota.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

To support this, the PI made a series of 17 fact-finding site-visits to UAS manufacturers, and other related firms, utility companies using UAS, and UAS-involved educational institutions in the United States and Canada. The inventory is utilized by Atlantic Cape as a standard for the alignment of core competencies to develop sUAS Field Technician programs, including course and program learning goals and objectives.<strong><br /><em>Curriculum creation:</em></strong> Atlantic Cape deployed its inventory of in-demand knowledge, skills and abilities as the standard to design and develop stackable sUAS Field Technician curricula. The curricula have undergone external approval channels through NJ higher education, is published in the college catalog, and is available for adaptation by other schools.</p>\n<p>Through grant funding, Atlantic Cape designed coursework that teaches the knowledge and skills required to safely conduct civil and commercial sUAS operations, and repair and maintain sUAS. The coursework prepares students to work for sUAS firms, to be sUAS entrepreneurs, and to be hired by other employers using sUAS applications for a broad range of business and public sector purposes. Additionally, the coursework implements a program capstone project for students and enables them to build portfolios of their work that can be easily shared with prospective employers and clients. Specifically, Atlantic Cape created three credit-bearing academic programs - including a new degree program - educating students to be sUAS Repair Specialists and Field Technicians. Additionally, Atlantic Cape received a sub-award from Sinclair Community College NSF ATE project titled Educating Entrepreneurial Technicians for Unmanned Aerial Systems (DUE:1902003). The focus of the project is to implement a business plan competition developed at Sinclair at Atlantic Cape. The competition will run in the 2021-2022 academic year.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Dissemination:</em></strong> The results of project efforts include a website for disseminating deliverables and sharing resources with the goal of helping facilitate design of new sUAS credit bearing programs at other institutions. Products were submitted for dissemination to the National Center for Autonomous Technology. Presentations were made at local conferences, such as the New Jersey Community College Computing Consortium, The New Jersey Community Colleges Best Practices Conference, The League For innovation in The Community College; and at local community groups.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Novel focus on preparing students' entrepreneurial mindsets and approaches to sUAS employment:</em></strong> Students enrolled in Atlantic Cape's sUAS technician programs are at the forefront of far-reaching and multi-purpose technologies, and current students gain the potential to become the employers of future graduates. To build a culture of entrepreneurship among drone technicians, the project created a new course titled, \"The Drone-Powered Economy.\" Focused on entrepreneurial concepts, the course walks students through developing a comprehensive business plan to launch a sUAS-related business. Atlantic Cape has surveyed seven community colleges offering UAS programs and determined that only three of these colleges currently teach students how to pair entrepreneurial activities with their technical knowledge of drones. In that, Atlantic Cape's project will provide a model and curricula for entrepreneurial-oriented learning to colleges that do not currently have this capacity.</p>\n<p>Students have gone on to work for civil engineering consulting firms, solar installation companies, a firm that conducts critical electrical asset inspections, and the Federal Aviation Administration. Those that have taken the entrepreneurial path include two students who together started an LLC and worked with graduate students at Rutgers University to develop a subscription-based artificial intelligence product used to detect a novel fungus attacking North American cranberries; and five students who have established businesses using sUAS for commercial photography and cinematography.</p>\n<p>The program offers coursework focusing sUAS Operations, identified as a 'Gateway' course \"sUAS Operations\" is required for all four programs, and is pre-arranged into a student's first semester. The course prepares students to sit for the Federal Aviation Administration's Unmanned Aircraft General Examination. Successfully passing the examination leads to the earning of the FAA's Remote Pilot Certificate (commercial drone license). During the three years of the project, 192 students have taken the 'Gateway' course leading to 75% of students earning their FAA Remote Pilot Certificate.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Robust student enrollment, including successful recruitment of under-represented students:</em></strong> As of Sept. 2020, 84 students have enrolled in four programs adapted and/or developed by the project, of which, 10% are female, 6% are African American/black, and 4% are Hispanic. The sUAS Specialist certificate program has an average enrollment rate of 10% African American and 6% Hispanic/Latinx students. The sUAS Field Technician Associate A.S. degree program has an average enrollment rate of 14% for female students, and the sUAS Field Technician Certificate program has an average enrollment rate of 11% for females. An example of proactive recruitment strategy is the project's participation in the annual <em>Girls in Aviation Day</em> at the Atlantic City International Airport.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/11/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: James&nbsp;Taggart</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div
