 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Physics at Cornel University.  The site will support twelve undergraduate students per year in research projects in accelerator physics and synchrotron radiation science.  The student participants have full access to the resources of the Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-based Sciences and Education (CLASSE) and the University, and will work closely with experienced researchers. Although the research scope of this REU program is focused on understanding the fundamental physics of beams and accelerators and the uses of the radiation they produce, the techniques and technologies utilized are applicable to a much wider range of scientific careers. In addition, each student is asked to participate in one of the outreach programs at the Laboratory, teaching them to communicate the scientific ideas with the public and exposing them to the outreach prospects at their home institutions, through the Society of Physics Students (SPS) chapters and other outlets.\r\n\r\nThe Cornell Laboratory has an international reputation for research, with a constellation of programs including accelerator physics, synchrotron radiation research, and microwave superconductivity. The students will work on a range of projects that advance the Laboratory's scientific mission, further their education and training, and heighten their interest in pursuing careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Students will also attend lectures on wide topics in the accelerator physics and X-ray sciences; take part in talks and hands-on activities that introduce various frontiers of physics research with the larger group of REU groups on campus; and attend events addressing social and ethical issues in scientific research and conduct.  These joint activities will provide an environment that fosters networking of the future scientists.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
