 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development a scalable, automated, genetic transformation platform that is 10,000X faster than the current state-of-the-art.  The fields of synthetic biology and genetic engineering are currently limited by the ability to re-program microorganisms with foreign DNA. There have been significant advances in the synthesis of DNA, screening of genetically engineered microorganisms, and bioinformatics. However, the technology used to deliver DNA and perform genetic transformation has not advanced in a similar way. Phase I of this SBIR will result in a prototype high-throughput genetic transformation platform to demonstrate the utility of the system. This system will allow genetic engineers to more rapidly develop microorganisms for the production of bioengineered chemicals and materials. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a high-throughput, automated platform for genetic transformation of bacteria using a proprietary flow-through electroporation technology that is fast, reliable, and scalable. A key step in genetic engineering of cells is to introduce the foreign DNA that re-programs the cell. Electroporation, cell permeabilization using pulsed electric fields, is the most efficient and widespread method to deliver DNA into microorganisms for this application. State-of-the-art electroporation involves cuvettes that expose the cells and DNA to uniform electric fields. However, this process is currently slow, labor-intensive, and expensive. The proposed technology can be automated by augmenting existing liquid handling robots, and, when operated in parallel, may improve the genetic transformation rate by up to 10,000X compared to current methods. This will represent a paradigm shift in areas dependent upon genetic transformation where DNA delivery using electroporation is currently a major bottleneck. Ultimately, the goal is to address the need for a high-throughput genetic transformation platform to accelerate innovation in synthetic biology.",
