 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses fundamental research of advanced battery systems for large-scale stationary energy storage applications in renewable energy production and utility grid stability management. Current state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries are not sufficient for large-scale stationary energy storage due to concerns of cycle stability, particularly at high cycling rate and cost. Solid oxide metal-air battery systems represent a new class of advanced batteries operated on high-temperature oxide-ion chemistry. It is capable of being charged and discharged at a much faster rate and lower cost and is well suited for large-scale stationary energy storage due to its scalable and modular nature. This project aims to advance the high-temperature solid oxide metal-air battery towards commercialization through fundamental studies on the dynamic interplays between the two key components of the new battery: reversible solid oxide fuel cell and metal-based energy storage bed. From a broader impacts perspective, the project will advance the science of materials chemistry, electrochemistry and heterogeneous catalysis. The progress and new findings of the project will be included in a new graduate course and disseminated to the community through journal publications. Long-term research collaborations will be strengthened with a neighboring small college Historically Black College and University (HBCU), Benedict College. \r\n\r\nThe reduction kinetics of metal-oxide redox couples during charging is key to obtain stable long cycle life and high round trip efficiency for solid oxide metal-air battery systems. The project focuses on fundamental studies on the rate limiting steps and their associated rate constants during charging/discharging cycles, based on which dynamic interplays, between reversible solid oxide fuel cells and energy storage materials, can be revealed. Advanced in situ surface techniques such as synchrotron-based ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy will be used to identify the elementary steps and determine the kinetic rate constants for the redox couple energy storage bed. In parallel, materials development will be focused on energy storage materials including highly active, atomic layer deposition derived active metals, catalysts and proton-conducting oxide supports. Multiphysics modeling including elementary microscale kinetics will also be used to guide the fundamental understanding and development of the battery. By interpreting the results from synthesis, performance testing, and surface chemistry characterization, fundamental insights on the metal/metal-oxide based redox chemistry will be gained, hypotheses will be tested, and the model will be validated and further refined to facilitate the engineering design of the new solid oxide metal-air battery technology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

To achieve the goal, the project first employed advanced <em>in-situ</em> ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) technique to probe the temperature- and time-dependent surface chemistry evolution of a single crystal Fe. The obtained results have led to redox kinetics of thin film iron oxide, which follows Cabrera-Mott model but not the conventional parabolic law. On the device level, the project has demonstrated for the first time the storage of 10+ hours of electricity with a lab-scale size cell (f1&rdquo;), suggesting that the new solid oxide iron-air battery is a promising technology for long-duration energy storage (LDES) that is currently lacking on the stationary energy storage market. The key enabling factor for LDES is the Ir-catalyst that significantly boosts the kinetics-limited iron-oxide reduction. The project has also established a multiphysics model to simulate the dynamic interplays between the electrochemical cell and Fe-based energy storage unit (ESU). On the materials front, the project has systematically measured the rate constants of a variety of Fe-based ESUs containing Ir-catalyst and proton-containing oxide supports and demonstrated one order of magnitude higher rate constant than the baseline material. Based on the above findings, the project concludes that the newly emerged solid oxide iron-air battery is a well-suited technology for LDES applications. The use of Ir as catalyst and proton-containing oxides substantially accelerates the reduction (equivalent to the charge cycle of the battery) kinetics, which would otherwise severely limit the performance. The developed multiphysics model can simulate the dynamic interplays between the cell and ESU with high fidelity.</p>\n<p>The project has also graduated 2 PhD students, published 15 peer reviewed papers, presented the results in 5 different conferences, and held two summer workshops with Benedict College (HBCU) over 5 years.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/20/2023<br>\nModified by: Kevin&nbsp;Huang</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1801284/1801284_10556892_1700501960509_Working_principle--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1801284/1801284_10556892_1700501960509_Working_principle--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Schematic\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1801284/1801284_10556892_1700501960509_Working_principle--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Schematic\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Working principle of solid oxide iron-air battery.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kevin Huang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kevin&nbsp;Huang\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Schematic</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1801284/1801284_10556892_1700502007689_LDES_performance--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1801284/1801284_10556892_1700502007689_LDES_performance--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"LDES performance\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1801284/1801284_10556892_1700502007689_LDES_performance--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"LDES performance\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Long duration (10+ hours) energy storage performance of the battery.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kevin Huang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kevin&nbsp;Huang\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">LDES performance</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1801284/1801284_10556892_1700501734461_rate_performance--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1801284/1801284_10556892_1700501734461_rate_performance--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Comparison\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1801284/1801284_10556892_1700501734461_rate_performance--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Comparison\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Performance comparison between baseline and Ir-added Fe-bed.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kevin Huang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kevin&nbsp;Huang\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Comparison</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1801284/1801284_10556892_1700501668838_Microstructure_of_Fe_bed--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1801284/1801284_10556892_1700501668838_Microstructure_of_Fe_bed--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Microstructure\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1801284/1801284_10556892_1700501668838_Microstructure_of_Fe_bed--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Microstructure\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Microstructure of Fe-bed containing Ir catalyst.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kevin Huang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kevin&nbsp;Huang\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Microstructure</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1801284/1801284_10556892_1700501791435_Stability--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1801284/1801284_10556892_1700501791435_Stability--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Stability\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1801284/1801284_10556892_1700501791435_Stability--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Stability\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Stability of the battery operated under low rate and low Fe-utilization.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kevin Huang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kevin&nbsp;Huang\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Stability</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
