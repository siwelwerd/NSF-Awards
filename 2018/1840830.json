 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impacts/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to use a more efficient powertrain system to extend the current flight durations of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) by 3 to 4 times the currently technological capabilities. UAVs with this capability will be able to accomplish a much wider range of missions than current systems. These missions could include, but are not limited to, search and rescue, large scale industry inspection (pipelines), land survey, and high-quality photography. This powertrain also has potential applications in small scale power generation out in the field for portable electronic devices. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is a UAV powertrain system using a gasoline two-stroke engine with a coupled starter/generator able to produce power for flight and other onboard components. The system itself is an optimization of many components and new technologies to produce power more efficiently than anything else currently available. Research on this system has included using a state of the art test stand to optimize engine performance and development of technologies that allow a coupled starter/generator system capable of producing varied output of power independent of input shaft work.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
