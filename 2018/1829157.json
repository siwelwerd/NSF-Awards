 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human Anatomy and Physiology (A&P) is a required course for nearly half a million undergraduate students, many of whom enroll in community colleges (CCs).  Averaging 29 years of age, these students hope to transform their lives by entering allied health care careers such as nursing or dental assisting. Yet, accompanying this culture of hope are stark social and economic realities. Many students are military veterans and receive financial support from the GI Bill, many work as well as attend school, and many are raising families. These burdens result in heightened levels of student anxiety. While CCs are known for their focus on teaching, CC instructors are burdened with heavy workloads and few opportunities for professional development. The result is predictable: an environment where there is high instructor burnout and high student failure rates.  The Community College Anatomy and Physiology Education Research (CAPER) project addresses this issue by taking a novel approach to instructor professional development.  Specifically, CC instructors will become co-investigators in research studies investigating changes in student performance and anxiety following implementation of evidence-based instructional practices (EBIPs).  Introducing practices such as guided inquiry and cooperative group learning into science classrooms has been shown to promote student learning and to foster a more equitable learning environment for students of color and women. By participating in this project, CC instructors will contribute new data to the field as well as change their own practices.  These instructors will then act as leaders in A&P education within their schools and their professional communities.  \r\n\r\nThe CAPER project takes an evidence-based approach to fostering transformation. Community College A&P instructors will combine a professional development course with the design and implementation of a small-scale educational research project investigating the impact of a student-centered teaching strategy.  They will also participate in a larger scale study examining the affective impact of different pedagogies. The individual research projects will use validated instruments to detect changes in student success measures resulting from EBIP implementation. The results will refine our understanding of EBIP effectiveness in the diverse student populations found at community colleges. In addition to their individual projects, instructors will collaborate in a multi-institutional effort examining the hypothesis that EBIPs could alleviate the negative impacts of anxiety on student performance and retention by improving learning and building community.   The instructors' contributions to this project will be foundational to the increasingly relevant topic of student stress. Finally, the research team will monitor instructor perceptions and practices using a combination of validated survey instruments, interviews, and classroom observation protocols. Using a pre-/post- research design will reveal if the CAPER project was able to promote transition to more student-centered instructional practices.  A dissemination strategy of conference presentations, blogs, and articles will ensure that the information reaches the end users, the first step in promoting change. In particular, the instructors will be well-situated to influence the practices of other CC instructors, both within their institutions and within professional organizations such as the Human Anatomy and Physiology Society, the Community College Biology Education Research network, and the Physiology Educators Communities of Practice.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Over a three-year time period, two groups of six community college instructors engaged in the following steps in order to achieve this goal: First, instructors took a 1-credit, education research methods course.&nbsp; While the majority of this class met online, we also met face to face at the 2019 SABER West meeting in Irvine, California (cohort 1) and at the 2019 Regional HAPS meeting in Columbus, Ohio. Second, at both meetings the 12 participants were able to witness presentations of biology education research. Third, after completing the pedagogy research course, the instructors worked with education research consultants, and faculty mentors, to design and implement their own education research project. Fourth, with the help of consultants and mentors, the instructors wrote up the results of their research projects and presented them at the HAPS Annual Conference.&nbsp; Finally, the instructors used feedback from the posters to modify conclusions and also wrote manuscripts for submission to peer reviewed journals.</p>\n<p>While instructors were progressing through the CAPER program, education researchers from Bishop&rsquo;s University and the University of Minnesota were gathering data from both instructors and their students.&nbsp; More specifically, the instructors were interviewed three times during their involvement and also completed validated surveys, such as the Teacher Belief Inventory.&nbsp; The anatomy and physiology students also completed a short array of surveys such as the SCOPE (Student Coping Questionnaire) and the Mini-SPIN (Social Phobia Inventory).&nbsp; This level of research was conducted in order to assess the effects of the program on student perceptions of new instructional strategies. This research also measured instructors changing views of teaching and learning.&nbsp; Data from the surveys and interviews were analyzed and published in peer-reviewed journals, such as <em>Journal of Microbiology&nbsp;and Biology Education</em> and <em>CBE-Life Science Education.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The CAPER project was initially meant to take two years.&nbsp; While the first cohort of instructors proceeded through their 1-year cycle as planned, the COVID-19 pandemic required us to make many adjustments to the second group. These modifications mostly focused on helping instructors move from face-to-face to virtual classrooms, but also included modifying their projects to a virtual setting.&nbsp; To help with the changes, we applied for, and received, a one-year no cost extension from NSF.&nbsp; Results from the second cohorts&rsquo; research on virtual teaching and learning were presented in the poster session at the virtual 2021 annual HAPS Conference.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We have clear results that the CAPER project impacted instructor&rsquo;s views of teaching and learning, and were beginning to an effect on classroom teaching, both face-to-face and virtually. More specifically, we saw instructors becoming dissatisfied with traditional lecture and more open to trying alternative teaching strategies. This was most clear during the switch to online learning when instructors were frequently dissatisfied with the lack of student-teacher and student-student interaction during their courses.&nbsp; Most of the CAPER instructors tried to make use of features on Zoom to promote break-out groups and foster conversation between students.&nbsp; These attempts were met with a moderate level of success. The largest limitation of the study was that while we did see the beginning stages of instructional change, instructors typically did not progress to a state where they were satisfied with their current classroom teaching practices.&nbsp;</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/20/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Murray&nbsp;Jensen</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1829157/1829157_10552379_1634743053631_SABERWest2019CAPERmeeting--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1829157/1829157_10552379_1634743053631_SABERWest2019CAPERmeeting--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"CAPER Team at SABER West\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1829157/1829157_10552379_1634743053631_SABERWest2019CAPERmeeting--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"CAPER Team at SABER West\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">CAPER Team at SABER West January 2019</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Murray S Jensen</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Murray&nbsp;Jensen</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">CAPER Team at SABER West</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1829157/1829157_10552379_1634742914315_ExampleCAPERPoster1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1829157/1829157_10552379_1634742914315_ExampleCAPERPoster1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Example Poster 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1829157/1829157_10552379_1634742914315_ExampleCAPERPoster1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Example Poster 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Example CAPER Poster 1</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Murray S Jensen</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Murray&nbsp;Jensen</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Example Poster 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1829157/1829157_10552379_1634742852764_SABERWest2019CAPERmeeting--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1829157/1829157_10552379_1634742852764_SABERWest2019CAPERmeeting--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2019 CAPER Team HAPS Ohio Regional\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1829157/1829157_10552379_1634742852764_SABERWest2019CAPERmeeting--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2019 CAPER Team HAPS Ohio Regional\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2019 CAPER Team HAPS Ohio Regional</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Murray S Jensen</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Murray&nbsp;Jensen</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2019 CAPER Team HAPS Ohio Regional</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1829157/1829157_10552379_1634743005417_HAPS2019PosterSession--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1829157/1829157_10552379_1634743005417_HAPS2019PosterSession--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Poster Session at HAPS 2019\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1829157/1829157_10552379_1634743005417_HAPS2019PosterSession--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Poster Session at HAPS 2019\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Poster Session at HAPS 2019</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Murray S Jensen</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Murray&nbsp;Jensen</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Poster Session at HAPS 2019</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1829157/1829157_10552379_1634742946114_ExampleCAPERPoster2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1829157/1829157_10552379_1634742946114_ExampleCAPERPoster2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Example CAPER Poster 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1829157/1829157_10552379_1634742946114_ExampleCAPERPoster2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Example CAPER Poster 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Example CAPER Poster 2</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Murray S Jensen</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Murray&nbsp;Jensen</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Example CAPER Poster 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
