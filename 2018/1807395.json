 "awd_abstract_narration": "The production of rubber is an important industry as noted by the wide range of rubber based products on the market and the large demands for rubber tires.  Despite the maturity of the rubber and tire industries, there remain fundamental scientific challenges in improving the properties of these materials, which arise from limitations in the crosslinking chemistry to harden, or vulcanize rubber precursors.  In this collaboration between Professor Jeffrey Pyun at the University of Arizona and Dr. Paul Endres at the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, the research team aims to develop novel sulfur-based crosslinkers for the production of the next generation rubber with improved properties.  It has long been known that tire performance alone can profoundly impact the fuel efficiency in automobiles.  The use of sulfur-based crosslinking agents also provides the petroleum industry avenues to consume excess sulfur waste generated from fossil fuel refining.  Hence, this research is anticipated to broadly impact the rubber industry, automobiles, petroleum industry, and sustainability.  This project provides opportunities for research training and industrial experience to undergraduate and graduate students, preparing a skilled workforce of industry.\r\n\r\nIn this synergistic collaboration between academia and industry, Prof. Pyun and Dr. Endres aims to provide a new technological route to enhanced rubber and tire products.  Prof. Pyun develops novel approaches to large-scale synthesis of polysulfides, as soluble sulfur crosslinking agents for rubber vulcanization, from the polymerization of elemental sulfur with vinylic and electronically activated aromatic co-monomers.  The compositional tunability of the synthetic methods enables the introduction of organic co-monomer units that can improve the compatibility and reactivity of the sulfur phase with polydienes (rubber precursors).  Using the specialized industrial facilities at the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, Dr. Endres incorporates the novel polysulfide crosslinkers in formulations for vulcanization of rubber and evaluates the mechanical properties of the resulting materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
