 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Texas State University, located in San Marcos, TX, supports the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2018-2020. This site, supported by the Divisions of Chemistry and Materials Research in the Mathematical and Physical Science Directorate, offers research projects in the areas of chemistry, biochemistry, and material science. In addition to student research projects, participants in the REU program attend a course designed to expose them to the entrepreneurial and commercialization aspects of technology. The course allows them to explore how basic research contributes to molecular innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic development in molecular sciences. This unique combination of research and commercialization training provides student participants with a broad understanding of academic and industrial research. The REU program also focuses on the development of emerging scientific professionals through an extensive professional development course that includes seminars, workshops, and panel discussions with topics including scientific communication, ethics in scientific research, and graduate school and career preparation. Participants in the REU are recruited largely from regional primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) and provides extensive research experience for participants that would otherwise not be able to participate in undergraduate research.    \r\n\r\nStudent participants contribute to research projects that include hybrid metal organic framework materials, fluorescent nanomaterials for biomedical applications, analysis and application studies of biohybrid organic chromophores, and electrophilic carbene studies. Some of the other research projects involve conducting polymer nanocomposite studies, organic halide synthesis, N-substituted alkyne synthesis, and structural and functional studies of RNA binding proteins. The site's distinctive combination of basic research training and an understanding of technology commercialization promotes a novel scientific training environment for participants that contributes to their professional success in academic and industrial research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe CheMIE REU program provided a quality experience in chemical and biochemical research to 33 undergraduate students that had limited access to such research training at their home institutions.  Students conducted independent research projects in chemistry, biochemistry, materials chemistry, and chemistry education.  The research experience gained by student participants prepared them for future education and employment in the chemical and biochemical sciences.  Our program strongly emphasized scientific communication and students gave multiple scientific presentations in various modes throughout each summer.  At the conclusion of the summer program, each student participated in a campus-wide undergraduate research symposium.  Students overwhelmingly reported that the program provided them significant gains in confidence in the research lab and in scientific communication.\n\nIn addition to performing independent research, students were immersed in a Molecular Innovation course designed to expose them to the entrepreneurial and commercialization aspects of technology.  The course allowed students the opportunity to explore how basic research contributes to molecular innovation and helps drive economic development in chemical and biochemical sciences.  A number of previous students that have since pursued a career in the chemical or biochemical industries have reported that the Molecular Innovation course curriculum has had positive and practical implications on the early stages of their career. Participants leave the CheMIE REU program with an overall greater understanding of basic and applied research.  This combined with the professional development and business skills rendered our participants well-rounded, business savvy young scientists.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/30/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Cory Holland"
