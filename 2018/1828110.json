 "awd_abstract_narration": "This MRI award will fund the replacement of the 21+ year-old electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA) at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH; New York City, NY) with a new, state-of-the-art instrument. The EPMA is probably the most important instrument for geochemical analysis of rock samples and experimental samples, providing unmatched capabilities for most elements at high precision, high-spatial resolution, and is nondestructive for most analyses. The current system serves many faculty, postdoctoral researchers, graduate and undergraduate students at AMNH, Columbia University (CU), institutions of the City University of New York (CUNY) and other regional institutions.\r\n\r\nElectron probe analyses provide fundamental data for a wide spectrum of high-profile scientific research on volcanology; igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary petrology, including climate science; ore/resource geology; and material science. Considering the high density of geoscience researchers in the New York City area who depend on EPMA, a new state-of- the-art instrument is vital for the success of their ongoing and future research projects.  The new EPMA will impact the multi-faceted research, education, and public-outreach activities of the primary users at AMNH, CU and CUNY including: (1) EPMA training and outreach to under-represented undergraduates in science and technology at the CUNY campuses, (2) undergraduates participating in REU programs at AMNH and CU, (3) characterization of AMNH collection materials and experimentally generated reference materials which are shared with research colleagues and the general public, (4) the 5 million annual visitors to the Museum's public exhibitions on Earth and extraterrestrial geoscience, and (5) numerous science education programs at the Museum that connect the public and K-12 students and teachers with active scientific research programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
