 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advances in nanotechnology have been central to the creation of novel biomedical applications, energy transport and storage systems, aerospace materials, and solar energy conversion.  This research explores novel nanostructures made of boron nitride (BN). Graphene is one type of nanocarbon in which a honeycomb arrangement of carbon atoms forms a thin sheet. When graphene is seamlessly rolled, it forms carbon nanotubes, a well-known material. Alternating boron and nitrogen atoms can replace carbon in carbon nanotubes to form BN nanostructures,  BN nanostructures are wide band gap semiconductors with outstanding thermal stability, in contrast to their carbon analogs. Concentrating on these special differences, Professors Angel Marti and Matteo Pasquali of Rice University, are exploring how to tune the properties of BN nanostructures by attaching chemical groups to their surfaces and by monitoring their movements in solution. This information may enable the assembly of these nanostructures into sophisticated systems with tailored physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. This research may accelerate discovery and innovation in producing insulating films, corrosion protections, and UV optoelectronics.  Professors Marti and Pasquali disseminate their research to the greater community through press releases and YouTube videos. They provide cutting-edge nanoscience activities such as workshops, talks, and summer research opportunities by reaching out to high school, college, and graduate students, paying particular attention to underrepresented groups.  The research team recruits and mentors undergraduate students from Puerto Rico via the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) Program.  LSAMP facilitates the training of underrepresented students in cutting-edge nanoscience research. \r\n\r\nSupported by the  Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of NSF's Chemistry Division, Professors Marti and Pasquali are addressing fundamental challenges of BN nanostructures such as surface functionalization, exfoliation, dispersion, and imaging. BN nanostructures are functionalized with a variety of groups by virtue of organic radicals produced under Billups-Birch conditions (lithium in liquid ammonia). The properties of these functionalized structures are studied in different environments and solvents. Furthermore, the dispersibility of BN materials are studied in surfactants having different charges and polarities to understand the conditions that lead to their dispersion in aqueous solution. Dispersed structures are studied by fluorescence microscopy, using special fluorescent surfactants, to understand the dynamics of the BN nanotubes in solution. Overcoming these challenges advances fundamental knowledge of the chemistry and properties of one- and two-dimensional BN nanostructures.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The discovery of the buckminsterfullerene in 1985 marked the dawn of this new field of science and technology. Buckminsterfullerene was a previously unknown form of carbon that has the structure of a truncated icosahedron similar to a soccer ball. This area of research has resulted in the discovery of many nanomaterials with different dimensions and properties. For example, carbon nanotubes were discovered a few years later, and their structure is based on that of fullerenes, but instead of a ball, the shape is that of a tube. Carbon nanotubes have unique properties (such as high strength, and high thermal conductivity), which makes them desirable as building blocks for making specialized materials in areas ranging from construction to aerospace vehicles. Another carbon nanostructure of interest is graphene, an ultrathin sheet made of repeating hexagons with carbon atoms at their vertices (similar to a honeycomb structure). Analogs of these structures can be formed with alternating boron and nitrogen atoms instead of carbon, which are called boron nitride (BN) nanostructures. Boron nitride nanostructures have complementary properties to their carbon counterparts, presenting (in addition to high strength, and heat conductivity) electrically insulating properties, chemical resistance, and temperature stability.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Interestingly, some of the attractive properties of BN nanostructures make them also challenging to use in a variety of applications. For example, given their chemical resistance, BN nanostructures are difficult to react with other compounds. Chemical modification is important to increase the compatibility of these nanostructures with other molecules and for increasing their dispersibility in solvents. The manufacture of functional materials from these BN nanostructures as building blocks require both chemical modification and solvent dispersibility, as well as a good understanding of how these nanostructures diffuse and organize in solution. To address these challenges, we first studied how to disperse boron nitride nanosheets in water using surfactants (similar to soap). Surfactants are molecules that have a part that is soluble in water (similar to table salt) and a part that is insoluble (similar to oil). The \"oily\" part attaches to the BN nanosheets, while the soluble part interacts with water making the structures soluble (see Figure 1). We then used surfactants that emit light (fluorescent surfactants) to visualize the movement of BN nanosheets and nanotubes using a fluorescence microscope (Figure 2). To enhance the properties of BN nanosheets and tubes we studied their chemical modification with long carbon chains. Using lithium in liquid ammonia, we were able to modify BN nanotubes and nanosheets and attach these long carbon chains to their surface. During this research, we found that Teflon stir bars adversely affect this reaction, thus we substituted them with glass stir bars. The chemically modified material was more dispersible and more compatible with organic solvents such as decane.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Through this work we have gained considerable knowledge on boron nitride nanostructures, discovering methodologies for their dispersion, chemical modification, imaging, and diffusion.
