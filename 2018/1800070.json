 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many large molecules have several chemically reactive sites. Oftentimes these sites behave independently, with the chemical reactions occurring at one site having no effect on the others. This is not always the case, however. In some instances, the binding at one site can change the chemical reactivity of another. Cooperation between reactive sites plays an important role in problems ranging from biology to molecular electronics. However, investigating cooperativity is challenging, since many experimental methods have trouble distinguishing the reactive sites. With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry and the Chemical, Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A programs in the Division of Chemistry, Professors Ursula Mazur, Bhaskar Chilukuri, and K. W. Hipps at Washington State University are exploring cooperative effects in the binding of small molecules on nearby sites in large chemical complexes using a high resolution imaging method. The discoveries could aid in the design of new materials, as well as have broad implications for advancing technologies related to sensing, catalysis, and optoelectronics. The project's findings are incorporated into undergraduate courses at Washington State University, providing modern research examples to highlight concepts in chemistry, materials science, and engineering. The research labs involved in the project also provide training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, including a number of female and minority students.\r\n\r\nWorking with their students, Professors Mazur, Chilukuri, and Hipps are synthesizing large, electron-rich molecules that consist of multiple fused porphyrin rings, and then depositing them on conducting substrates such as Au, graphite, and MoS2. The team then exposes the porphyrin multimers to small molecules (e.g. O2, CO, and NO) that react with the metal centers. By imaging the products with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), they can directly observe of cooperative binding. Experimental observations are compared with molecular dynamics and density functional theory calculations to determine if communication occurs through the metal support or the intramolecular pi structure, as well as the extent to which intermolecular coupling occurs. Professors Mazur, Chilukuri, and Hipps are involved in undergraduate education and mentoring students from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Many of these important potential applications involve thin films or single molecules supported on conductors.  Cooperativity in surface processes may be broadly defined as a non-additive behavior of adjacent sites on a surface; e.g.; the adsorption energy of a ligand at a particular site is different if an adjacent site is occupied.  In biological systems, it is possible to have cooperative enhancements of factors of 300 over binding to a single site.\n\nOur studies focused on exploring - at the single molecule level - reaction cooperativity of conductor supported materials in general and those occurring at the technologically important solution-solid interface in particular.  Our work to date emphasizes the need for a complete and quantitative model for surface cooperativity that goes beyond simple isotherms such as the Hill and Temkin models. We have demonstrated that cooperativity in surface reactions can be quantitively studied by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), but the real work of understanding the role of each possible contributing factor remains.\n\nThe most significant outcomes of this work were demonstrating on the single molecule level the following.
