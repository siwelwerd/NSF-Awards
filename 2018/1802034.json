 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"Endless Forms\" Thematic Collections Network (TCN), composed of 17 collaborating U.S. herbaria from 11 states, will digitize approximately two million specimens belonging to some of the most interesting plant species on Earth. Iconic species such as the Giant Saguaro Cactus, the Venus Fly Trap, and the leafless Ghost Orchid of southern Florida are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of plants that have evolved astounding adaptations allowing them to grow in extreme terrestrial environments, including deserts, tropical rain forests, and nutrient poor bogs. Many of these plants can also be challenging to study in nature and face elevated conservation concerns in the face of rapid environmental change. By digitizing herbarium specimens of these groups, researchers will gain a better understanding of these adaptations and their evolution, and can design conservation and management strategies. The public's interest in these unusual plants affords an opportunity to engage k-12 students and teachers in discussions about biodiversity and preservation, plant adaptations, and mutualistic relationships. This project will also train undergraduate and graduate students in the areas of museum studies. Finally, the availability of two million digitized records for these charismatic plant groups will help protect them and enhance their enjoyment by hobbyists, citizen scientists, and other non-academic enthusiasts\r\n \r\nThis \"Endless Forms\" project is the first TCN initiative to digitize the very significant holdings of non-North American specimens housed within North American herbaria. This project will provide access to digitized records of 15 plant families associated with adaptations to extreme terrestrial environments that can be used to test evolutionary and ecological hypotheses. This network will, for example, provide data that can be used to explore trait development and evolution, species delimitation, and geographic distribution modelling and that can inform national and regional floristic projects. This project will help provide critically needed information to overcome obstacles related to studying plant families which are very large, have cryptic diagnostic features, or occur in geographically challenging areas. This TCN will also help overcome an acute problem of access to specimens of CITES-listed taxa (species threatened with extinction) by easing data access and by holding a Plant Collecting Ethics Workshop that will bring together an array of stakeholders to make recommendations on best practices for handling sensitive data for rare species. The project will fill taxonomic and geographic gaps in U.S. institutional specimen digitization, will bring new institutions into the national digitization effort and will invest in the development of tools to stream-line the digitization process. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This TCN included iconic species such as the ghost orchid, Venus fly trap, and saguaro cactus. Many of the included species display unusual morphologies that likely evolved in response to extreme habitats, and many included species face acute conservation concerns. This TCN created 958,886 new digital specimen records, and 929,438 new images of physical herbarium sheets. Additionally, 310,343 digital specimen records were augmented with latitude and longitude coordinates (georeferenced). These newly created digital records were added to iDigBio and other natural history digital data aggregator websites such as GBIF. Eight of the 15 participating institutions (53%) were able to deliver more specimen records than originally estimated. The new digital specimens created through this TCN provide critically needed data that allow scientists, researchers, and policy makers to better understand global patterns of plant diversity, the evolution of unusual morphological traits, and how to best allocate resources to species of conservation concern. Public outreach and education opportunities were a critical component to the success of this TCN. We were able to engage several hundred members of the public through the following: digital citizen science specimen label transcription events hosted on Notes for Nature and DIGIVOL; paid internships for current undergraduate students and recent college graduates; on-site tours of collections for school students, undergraduate and graduate students, and horticultural hobbyists; georeferencing and conservation assessment workshops for high school students; WeDigBio and university webinars about plant evolution, conservation, and morphology; museum teen volunteer programs; hands-on undergraduate learning experiences involving the curation of museum collections; writing public-oriented digital stories about the included collections; and press interviews in local media markets. We engaged the professional collection community in discussions about how to ethically share location information for species of conservation concern through digital surveys and intra-TCN discussions with the California Phenology TCN. Several TCN participating institutions were able to use results from this TCN to help craft public exhibitions focusing on endangered species, and/or improve interpretive signage. This TCN resulted in several scholarly outputs, ranging from the description of new species, to professional conference presentations detailing increased efficiencies in specimen digitization. Beyond the funding period of this award, the digital specimen data created via this TCN is of critical importance to ongoing conservation related research, and is currently in use to further studies focusing on species distribution modeling, species diversity and evolution, and crafting improved conservation strategies for rare plants.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/05/2024<br>\nModified by: Matthew&nbsp;C&nbsp;Pace</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
