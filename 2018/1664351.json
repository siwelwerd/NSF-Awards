 "awd_abstract_narration": "A second quantum revolution in and around the construction of a useful quantum computer has been advancing dramatically in the last few years. Topological phases of matter, the importance of which has been recognized by scientific awards that include the 2016 Nobel prize in physics, exhibit many-body quantum entanglement. This makes such materials prime candidates for use in a quantum computer.  Topological quantum computation is maturing at the forefront of the second quantum revolution as a primary application of topological phases of matter. The theoretical foundation for the second quantum revolution remains under development, but it appears clear that algebras and their representations will play a role analogous to that played by group theory in the first quantum revolution. This focused research group aims to formulate the theoretical foundations of topological quantum computation, leading to an eventual theoretical foundation for the second quantum revolution. It is anticipated that the results of the research will guide and accelerate the construction of a topological quantum computer. A working topological quantum computer will fundamentally transform the landscape of information science and technology. The project includes participation by graduate students and postdoctoral associates in the interdisciplinary research.\r\n\r\nThe goal of topological quantum computation is the construction of a useful quantum computer based on braiding anyons. The hardware of an anyonic quantum computer will be a topological phase of matter that harbors non-abelian anyons. A physical system is in a topological phase if at low energies some physical quantities are topologically invariant. Topological properties are non-local, yet can manifest themselves through local geometric properties. The success of topological quantum computation hinges on controlling topological phases and understanding their computational power. This research addresses the mathematical, physical, and computational aspects of topological quantum computation. The projects include classification of super-modular categories, vector-valued modular forms for modular categories, extension of modular categories to three dimensions, simulation of conformal field theories, topological quantum computation with gapped boundaries and symmetry defects, and universality of topological computing models. The research has potential impacts ranging from new understanding of vertex operator algebras to the development of useful quantum computers. One specific goal is a structure theory of modular categories analogous to that of finite groups. Such a theory would lead to a structure theory of two-dimensional topological phases of matter.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nAnyon models, mathematically unitary modular tensor catgeories, are not only intrinsically interesting mathematical structures, but also used widely in topological quantum computing and topological phases of matter. The most important invariant of an anyon model is its modular data. It is also true that every anyon model leads to a topological quantum field theory, which is a central notion in topological physics. During last year, our main results are siginificant progress towards a generalization of this notion to the non-semisimple setting. In one of our papers, we generalize the notion of modular data to non-semisimple modular category. In another one, we study the topological foundastion for constructinng topological quantum field theories using non-semisimple modular categories.\n\n\nIn the modular data paper, we found some fundamental results on the anyon models fail, while others likely continue to be true but require total differeant ways to prove. For example, the rank-finiteness failed, while the congruence seems to hold. For the construction of topological quantum field theory, we start with fake surfaces, which are generlization of manifolds to the case with singularities. We obtained a complete classification of fake surfaces with low complexity. These results are foundamental for a full theory of non-semiple theories.\n\n\nIt is known that semisimple topological quantum field theories are of no use for the detection of exotic smooth structure of 4-manifolds. Therefore it is absolutely neccessary to have a theory of non-semisimple modular categories for this topological application.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/05/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ZhenghanWang\n"
