 "awd_abstract_narration": "Children's engineering books and complementary simulation games strategically designed to complement K-2nd grade literacy and science content are examined for their impact on engineering engagement and content learning. The research achieves a broader impact by enabling early understanding of engineering concepts through literature based on story board depictions from an engineering perspective as well as computer simulation games re-enforcing the engineering design process. By studying the impact of these stories in the classroom, new literacy tools and educational computer games that positively transform the way children think about engineering as well as our approach to STEM education can be developed. Engineering provides a meaningful situational context for teaching science and math and results from this study engineering to be a necessary component for effectively teaching science and math in the early years. Once this outcome is realized, results from this study can serve as a catalyst for the development of new pedagogical strategies for engineering education and enable children's book authors and game programmers to consider new strategies for learning for this young population of students. In this way, the conceptual understanding outcomes (content and vocabulary) are sustained in later years and ultimately improve achievement in engineering.\r\n\r\nThis project examines the following research questions: What is the impact of engineering-centered literacy activities on K-2nd grade culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) student learning and engagement in engineering content? How does participation in academic conversations impact sustained engagement in complex engineering tasks? Does the impact vary by student characteristics (language background and achievement level)? To what extent can engineering-centered simulations facilitate requisite science and mathematics concept learning that support the engineering process. What simulation design features maximize this learning for K-2nd grade students? How does engagement with simulations impact students' academic conversations? Specific objectives are to use a single case study approach for studying: (1) engineering design centered computer simulation games and engineering-focused books to promote student engagement and learning; (2) examine growth in instructional effectiveness; (3) research methodologies for improving student engagement; and, (4) analyze improvements in student concept learning. This is among the first studies to address the learning and engagement impact of children's story-book literature that is centered on engineering principles. With an understanding of these best practices, authors can more effectively design STEM content rich books for this age group. An understanding of the mechanisms that advance learning through computer simulation games are also being developed. This understanding is a first step toward developing additional individual and/or group activities. These best practices are examined across cultural and linguistic boundaries to better serve all populations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe NSF Award# 1836081: Practices Promoting Engineering Education in the Early Years was designed to promote STEM learning through engineering-centered literacy practices that can complement and be integrated into existing science curricula for young elementary students (i.e., kindergarten to second grade). Given the lack of research targeting students in this age span, this project was designed to accomplish five specific objectives: (1) integrate age-appropriate storybooks into science curricula; (2) utilize technology-enhanced tools to promote student engineering identity development and learning; (3) monitor student identity development; (4) monitor student concept learning in science, engineering and technology; and broaden participation in science and engineering. For this project the following goals were achieved: (1) enhancement of an existing nationally recognized engineering education program to better meet the needs of early primary students whose first language is not English; (2) development of teacher resource and training materials that empowered them to implement highly effective integrated elementary science and engineering instruction; (3) development and testing of an engaging interactive iPad game (Cheers for Engineers) designed to expose early primary students to engineering practices; and (4) tested the impact of engineering-centered instructional intervention (Engineering Everywhere: E^2) on student engineering identity development, science and engineering concept learning, and technology knowledge.  \n\n  \n\nThe specific research questions investigated were the following: \n\nWhat is the impact of the E^2 units on science and engineering learning, technology knowledge and identity development for students in kindergarten to second grade? \n\n\nDo students who are exposed to the E^2 and the iPad game outperform students who receive the E^2 without the iPad game? \n\n\n \n\nNine teachers, 349 kindergarten (120), first (107) to second grade (122) students participated in this study. Results indicate that the E^2 intervention groups consistently and significantly outperformed control groups on the science and engineering learning assessment (SELA) with F(1, 120) = 28.88, p &lt; .000, F(1, 96) = 34.74, p = .027, F(1, 117) = 42.68, p &lt;. 000 for kindergarten, first and second grade respectively. That is, results indicated that the E^2 intervention was effective in raising the content and technology knowledge of students and in serving as a catalyst to helping students envision themselves as engineers. The results also indicate that more direct links to technology should be made more frequently to improve students basic understanding of technology.  \n\n \n\nData related to the second research question showed that as designed, the iPad game (Cheers ofr Engineers) bolstered kindergarten?s (four and five year olds?) sense of self but did not produce increases in their concept or technology knowledge. Stronger results were found for first (five and six year olds) and second grade (six and seven year olds) students. First and second grade students who were given opportunities to play the iPad game outperformed those who did not have this opportunity on all three measures; F(1, 107) = 11.09, p = .001, F(1, 110) = 26.28, p &lt; .000, F(1, 112) = 8.95, p = .003 for the SELA, technology and engineering identity measures respectively. \n\n \n\nOverall, these results show promise in the use of literacy practices and technology-enhanced tools (iPad game) in raising student content knowledge and engineering identity. The results provide the basis for making specific research hypothesis in subsequent research studies. More importantly, these results show promise for enhanced engineering and science pedagogical methods for early primary students. Enhancing science and engineering hands-on activities with engineering literacy practices appear to improve student science and engineering outcomes including a more favorable attitude towards becoming an engineer. Interactive, engineering iPad games also appear to add an important contribution to student concept learning and identity development. \n\n \n\nThe study extends prior research in science educational practices by demonstrating that the integration of technology tasks and engineering literacy significantly improved science concept learning of young culturally and linguistically diverse learners. These findings are significant in that to date few empirical studies provide the empirical support for integrating instruction in this way to improve student learning outcomes. This project also provided teachers opportunities teaching in the science and engineering. The results indicated that because of the project activities, young Latinx students from low socio economic backgrounds improved content learning and improved academic and engineering identity. In the process, new educational materials were developed and disseminated to national and international audiences. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/05/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Zenaida Aguirre-Munoz"
