 "awd_abstract_narration": "Meta materials are periodic materials that allow microstructure design and are able to provide unique optical, physical, chemical and bio properties that do not exist in natural materials. The meta-materials considered in this project are 3D, where their geometry is described in three dimensions, or 2.5D, where the geometry is defined in a plane, but the plane can stack to make a 3D structure. There is a great desire to have a microfabrication technique that can provide high speed, high resolution fabrication of these structures over large areas. Existing fabrication techniques can provide either sufficiently high resolution to fabricate the 2.5D/3D features, or sufficiently high throughput to cover large areas, but not both simultaneously. An advanced manufacturing process capable of both is critical for the commercialization of the meta-structures. This award will support research on using femtosecond laser enabled 3D virtual object projections into a photoresist (a polymeric material that experiences property changes when exposed to light) as a method to achieve high speed, high resolution fabrication. This is potentially feasible as a femtosecond laser, which can realize over 10,000 focal spots in one 3D light field projection, can enable higher speed processing. Knowledge gaps regarding the complex, non-linear interactions between the 3D projections and the photoresist will be addressed using computational and experimental approaches. If successful bio-sensing/inspection and emission/absorption controlled surfaces may be realized and contribute to U.S. defense and health related interests. The award will also facilitate training of the future workforce as students across all levels will gain exposure to, and experience in 2D and 3D micro fabrication technologies. Additional educational outreach activities include engaging high school teachers in the research, and disseminating the findings through research websites, conference participations and journal publications.  \r\n\r\nThe technical objective of this research is to establish a new 3D lithography method based on femtosecond compressed 3D light field projection. If successful it will realize the high-speed (compared with single-spot multiphoton lithography), high-resolution (equal or better than half of the wavelength) fabrication of complicated 2.5D/3D microstructures over a large area. The technical scope of this research includes; 1) a hybrid wave analysis approach combining general astigmatic Gaussian beam tracing and full wave simulation to enable high accuracy wave type analysis of light focusing in large optical systems using minimum computational power, 2) determination of stress/strain fields and the associated deformation of cured photoresist from multiphoton 3D light field lithography, 3) specification and fabrication of a femtosecond compressed 3D light field projector test bed to verify the theoretically predicted size and shape of cured photoresist  patterns from femtosecond voxel projections. This proposed research will significantly advance the fundamental understanding in the following areas; non-linear femtosecond light transport/focusing/absorption in photoresists; 3D virtual object reconstructions with femtosecond pulsed light; and the feasibility of femtosecond 3D light field projection in 3D microfabrication of each type of 2.5D/3D microstructures over a large area.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We can successfully cure photopolymers by simultaneously intersecting 20 to 50 of these mini rays to a design voxel (i.e., a 3D focal spot, figure 1). Based on this logic, we can cure more than 1000 positions in a single laser pulse at assigned 3D positions to form a 3D structure. In other words, we verified the main benefit of the proposed femtosecond 3D light field projection to achieve a ~ 1000 times higher fabrication speed than current single spot femtosecond 3D lithography.</p>\n<p>However, after more than two years of study, we cannot reduce the voxel size to less than 10-20 microns after 20 times optical compression as predicted in the original proposal. We later learned from a light diffraction analysis that the proposed 3D light field projection with microlens arrays, even though it can generate more than one million mini rays from a single laser pulse, cannot precisely control the light diffraction of each mini ray. Thus, the mini rays diverge significantly after passing through the MLA, which causes a lower-than-expected spatial resolution. To solve the unexpected issue in the original proposal, we need an improved 3D projection method that can control the light diffraction of each mini-ray.</p>\n<p>We identified in the third year that better control of light diffraction of each mini-ray could be achieved by replacing the DMD and MLA in 3D light field projection with a phase-controlled spatial light modulator (SLM). A phase-controlled SLM can control each mini-ray's wavefront. With an appropriate wavefront to compensate for light diffraction during propagation, small voxels (a few microns or less) can be formed by intersecting multiple mini-rays simultaneously. The new 3D projection/lithography method using phase-controlled SLM is named femtosecond 3D point cloud projection (figure 2).</p>\n<p>Based on the new understanding, we performed femtosecond 3D point cloud projection tests with a 4K resolution SLM available in our lab. The SLM can form ~50 thousand mini rays from on laser pulse. Because of the capability to control the wavefront of each mini-ray with the SLM, fewer mini-rays are required to form a voxel with high enough intensity to cure photopolymers. Using the Fresnel diffraction integral, we determined the voxel size formed with ten mini rays can be close to 1 micron after 20 times optical compressions. A corresponding experimental setup has also been established to perform femtosecond 3D point cloud projection/lithography. We were able to generate high-resolution (better than 2 microns) basic structures with the femtosecond 3D point cloud projection/lithography (figure 3).</p>\n<p>With the experimental and theoretical verification of the femtosecond 3D point cloud projection/lithography capability in 3D fabrication, we continue improving the system during the second period of no-cost extension. By improving the femtosecond light to SLM coupling, we could send four times of light from the femtosecond laser to the SLM, which corresponded to 16 times improvements in fabrication speed with two-photon nonlinear light absorption.</p>\n<p>We supported three PhD students and one master's student during the entire project period.
