 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pathogens may be unrecognized key species in many ecosystems, causing massive impacts on other species and habitats despite the microscopic size of disease-causing organisms. Yet the triggers to disease epidemics likely involve complex interactions among changing environmental conditions and associated biological communities. In the ocean, understanding disease outbreaks has been hindered by inadequate knowledge of how these various influences interact to determine susceptibility and resilience to disease. This project integrates research in community and disease ecology with microbial genomics, geospatial analysis, and state-of-the-art computational approaches toward an unprecedented understanding of the causes and consequences of wasting disease in eelgrass, an important vegetation type supporting coastal and estuarine ecosystems throughout the northern hemisphere. The research advances frontiers in understanding the growing but poorly appreciated threat of marine diseases, how disease ecology interacts with environmental change, and its consequences for the extensive ecosystems and coastal communities that depend on eelgrass, across 23 degrees of latitude along the Pacific coast of North America. The research will inform better management of threatened seagrass ecosystems, which provide important services including fisheries habitat, erosion control, carbon storage, and capture of nutrient runoff. The research will foster integrative approaches in the next generation, including high school students, undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs working on the project, and each investigator's institution will work to recruit participants from under-represented groups. Best practices developed under this award, including the Eelisa disease app and drone mapping, will be disseminated for broader surveillance of seagrass disease and coastal habitat quality by both professional and citizen scientists in coordination with the Global Ocean Observing System's (GOOS) develpoment of seagrass extent as an Essential Ocean Variable.\r\n\r\nThe triggers to marine disease epidemics are likely complex, and progress in understanding them has been hindered by a poor understanding of the multifaceted ecological context of the host-disease interaction. This project's overarching goal is to disentangle the web of direct and indirect interactions by which changing climate mediates prevalence of eelgrass wasting disease, and its consequences for threatened but important eelgrass ecosystems. The centerpiece is a comparative, cross-scale survey of eelgrass community composition, microbiome, and disease prevalence along thermal gradients of latitude and exposure to the ocean, providing the first coast-wide picture of disease dynamics in response to environmental change. In situ sampling will be linked to dynamics of eelgrass at landscape scales using unmanned aerial systems (drones) to quantify high-resolution changes in eelgrass extent and habitat quality. Experiments will test how the diverse biological community mediates impacts of the pathogen on eelgrass ecosystems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The world?s most widespread seagrass species, eelgrass (<em>Zostera marina</em>) forms extensive meadow on both sides of the north Atlantic and north Pacific oceans. But like many marine habitat-forming species, eelgrass is vulnerable to disease epidemics, which can have catastrophic ecosystem impacts but are poorly understood. This collaborative research project engaged partners from 11 institutions and a broad range of expertise to evaluate how environment and interacting biological communities mediate the prevalence and severity of eelgrass wasting disease, caused by the pathogenic protist <em>Labyrinthula zosterae</em>, along the west coast of North America from San Diego to Alaska. The multidisciplinary team employed remote sensing, field surveys, and experiments to tease apart the effects of recent heat waves, interactions with grazing animals, and microbes on eelgrass wasting disease infections across this continental-scale range. All of the teams included early-career scientists, who benefited from &nbsp;new field research experiences and rich opportunities for shared learning, immersion in team science, and building professional and peer networks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project was unprecedented in marine ecology in its combination of geographic scale, standardized sampling, and integration of components ranging from molecular to seascape scales, all focused on the holistic ecology of disease affecting a foundation species of major importance in coastal ecosystems. The team?s research documented for the first time the important, interacting effects of climate and biodiversity in mediating wasting disease dynamics. Field studies showed that warming water temperatures stressed eelgrass across large regional scales from San Diego to Alaska, facilitating seagrass wasting disease, which in some areas contributed to large-scale diebacks of eelgrass meadows. Moreover, the Smithsonian team?s research identified a potentially novel mechanism influencing disease dynamics in these communities: the numerous small crustaceans and snails that live among eelgrass leaves appear to modify eelgrass host-disease interactions through their grazing activities, with some grazer species increasing and some species decreasing disease prevalence. These conclusions emerged from analyses of ~600 field observations along the entire west coast, and showed similar patterns to those confirmed in experimental feeding studies, in which some invertebrate species consumed diseased eelgrass tissue, potentially reducing disease spread, while others grazed disease-free tissue, potentially vectoring disease propagules into uninfected plants.
