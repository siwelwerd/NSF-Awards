 "awd_abstract_narration": "State-of-the-art automated theorem proving tools have been making progress on, and in some cases resolve, longstanding unsolved problems of mathematics like: can the positive integers be sorted into two buckets, so that neither bucket contains a Pythagorean triple (a solution to a^2+b^2=c^2), or can the points on the plane be colored 5 colors, so that every two points at distance 1 apart are colored differently? The same techniques are also crucial in industry to verify hardware and software. A key aspect of recent and future successes in mechanized mathematics is the use of massively parallel computation. Handling these computing resources carefully is vital to exploit their great potential. Sophisticated splitting heuristics and encodings are required to partition a given problem into many sub-problems that can be efficiently solved in parallel. Unfortunately, today the development of such heuristics depends predominantly on expert knowledge about this problem and on sensible manual optimization.\r\n\r\nThis research offers advances towards automated construction of sophisticated heuristics, as well as improved encodings of commonly used mathematical operations. Apart from solving long-standing open problems automatically, the research intents to extract information from the solutions to acquire useful mathematical insights. Famous mathematical challenges like the Collatz conjecture and the Hadwiger-Nelson problem are motivating examples that are driving this work and they could help making this technology go mainstream. The investigators will involve both graduate and undergraduate students in this research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
