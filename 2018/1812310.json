 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2018, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports research and training of the Fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. The Fellow's research will focus on better understanding how the loss of an important and complex trait 'limbs' occurs in a group of Australian lizards that are adapted to sandy environments. This work will provide the most thorough study of limb morphology patterns across this large group of species using dozens of existing museum specimens. The research will also leverage developmental data and genetic information to begin to understand the molecular mechanisms that cause changes in limb shape. The Fellow will gather most of these data during an extended visit to the South Australian Museum in Adelaide, Australia and Museum fur Naturkunde in Berlin, Germany. The Fellow will also gain experience mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, including individuals from underrepresented groups. Public and educational outreach will also be pursued through the production of teaching lessons for high school and college students that convey fundamental biological concepts in genetics, development, and evolution.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of limb loss is an important adaptive transition among animals. How such complex traits evolve, and how and why they are evolutionarily plastic in some lineages, remain fundamental questions in biology. Limb reduction or loss has also occurred numerous times in tetrapods, most frequently among lineages of squamate reptiles. This raises the question of whether adaptive traits are constrained and canalized in vertebrates, leading to convergent phenotypic and molecular patterns across limbless taxa. This project will address these important evolutionary questions by studying limb reduction and loss within a genus of Australian lizards (Lerista) by testing hypotheses about the genetic underpinnings of limb morphology and patterns of morphological, genetic, and developmental evolutionary convergence. The Fellow will use an integrative approach combining morphological, developmental, and genomic data to (1) discern the number of independent morphotype series present in Lerista, (2) characterize the anatomical and molecular signatures associated with pentadactyl limb development within this genus, (3) identify the putative molecular bases of limb reduction within this clade, and (4) resolve the degree of morphological and molecular convergence mediating parallel limb evolution. The Fellow will be trained in gathering morphological and developmental data, will significantly extend his genomics knowledge and skillset, and will be provided opportunities to mentor and educate younger scientists and students in the life sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

What do these phenotypic shifts indicate about how genes and their regulation contribute to natural morphological diversity? Finally, are the molecular mechanisms underlying convergent instances of limb reduction the same or does each instance evolve differently? These questions and others were studied as part of this NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology (FY2018), under the area \"Research Using Biological Collections\" with leadership by PI Daren Card and mentorship by primary advisor Scott Edwards and collaborators Mark Hutchinson, Steve Donnellan, and Mike Lee. This project sought to identify the genetic mechanisms that underlie the reduction and loss of limbs that occurs repeatedly across squamate reptiles, with snakes being quintessential examples of this evolutionary phenomenon that has occurred over 25 times, half of which are in skink lizards. However, limb reduction and loss in snakes and other lineages of squamates is relatively ancient, making it difficult to understand the progression of evolutionary changes that lead to a serpentine body plan. This project overcame this by focusing on a specific genus of skink lizards from the genus <em>Lerista</em>, a large clade of about 100 species where limb morphology varies among species, resulting in species with \"normal\" limbs like most lizards, species lacking limbs like snakes, and other species with different degrees of digit and limb reduction. A range of modern genomics techniques were used to build new genomic resources for skinks&nbsp;<span>-</span> a clade representing 15% of squamate and 2% of amniote diversity&nbsp;-&nbsp;and to study how evolving protein coding genes and noncoding regulatory regions&nbsp;-&nbsp;the \"switches\" that activate or repress gene expression -&nbsp;contribute to these dramatic morphological shifts. Altogether, exploring limb reduction in <em>Lerista</em> offers a powerful opportunity to understand how genomic changes influence body plan, contributing to collective understanding of genetics, evolutionary biology, and even biological processes important in human health and disease.</p>\n<p>An initial dataset comprised of two new reference genomes was constructed for species of <em>Lerista</em> with differences in limb morphology:&nbsp;<em>Lerista bougainvillii</em> (normal limbs) and <em>L. edwardsae</em> (limb reduced). These genomic resources are among the first for skinks, present an opportunity to investigate the genetics of limb reduction, and serve as an important foundation for analyzing other, integrative datasets produced as part of this project. A manuscript using comparative genomic data to describe aspects of the repetitive and protein-coding regions of these genomes and to examine the evolutionary genomics of limb reduction has been submitted for peer review and publication. Additional generated datasets will be integrated with these existing reference genomes. A comparative genomics dataset spanning 40 species of <em>Lerista</em> has been built using an economical resequencing approach where data can be mapped to reference genomes to derive genotypes for a large proportion of this clade. This dataset encompasses additional morphological transitions in <em>Lerista</em>, providing more statistical power important for deciphering the genetics of limb loss in <em>Lerista</em>. A functional genomics dataset comprised of RNA-seq and ATAC-seq was produced from fore- and hindlimb buds and medial flank tissue from developing <em>L. edwardsae</em> embryos. These data, among the first of their kind generated for non-traditional model vertebrates, will illuminate molecular processes underlying limb reduction during development and will be integrated with the other datasets to provide a richer understanding of the genetics, development, and evolution of reduced limbs.</p>\n<p>Aside from these accomplishments, PI Card has published 3 peer-review articles (Card et al. 2019. GBE.; Card et al. 2021. Sci. Reports.; Card et al. 2022. Front. Genetics.), 2 reviews (Lamichhaney et al. 2019. Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc. B; Card et al. 2021. Ann. Rev. Genetics), and has submitted 2 manuscripts for publication. Results from this research project have been publicly presented at several international meetings. PI Card gained experience in constructing and analyzing new genomics datasets, building high quality genomic resources, preparing and publishing manuscripts, and applying for academic positions. Moreover, PI Card successfully trained and mentored 2 undergraduate and 2 high school research assistants (3 from underrepresented groups in science) in areas such as generating hypotheses, best practices in data analysis, bioinformatics, and reading/writing scientific research papers. One of these mentees was an author on a published paper (Card et al. 2022. Front. Genetics.) and one high schooler began undergraduate studies at Harvard University. Finally, PI Card produced a learning model tailored for middle schoolers entitled \"Learning to Speak DNA\", which teaches students how scientists can use convergent evolution to better understand the links between genetics and physical traits, and has engaged in outreach with K12 classrooms through the Harvard Museum of Natural History Virtual Scientist in a Classroom program. Overall, the results of this research project, which are or will be freely available online, will facilitate a greater understanding between diverse fields like genomics, evolutionary biology, and museum science, and between science and the public.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/21/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Daren&nbsp;Card</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div
