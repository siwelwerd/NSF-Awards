 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Santa Cruz Island Reserve (SCIR) is 1 of 39 field stations in the University of California Natural Reserve System, and is located on the largest of California's eight Channel Islands, roughly 25 miles south of Santa Barbara, CA. SCIR attracts researchers from throughout the US to study many wide-ranging issues, from anthropology, island ecology, conservation biology to ecological responses to climate change.  To best serve the growing SCIR constituency while perpetuating SCIR as a resource, this project will develop a long-term (five to ten year) strategic plan for SCIR research, education, outreach programs, and facilities. The strategic plan will articulate a scientific vision for research and educational use, and an evaluation of the programs, facility needs and resources necessary to support that vision. The goal of the strategic plan is to enhance research and education activities at SCIR as well as the regional coordination of research, education and outreach activities across the Channel Islands region through a network of regional agency, non-profit, academic and field station partners.\r\n\r\nThe planning process involves engaging with key stakeholders through virtual and in-person workshops to identify regional coordination opportunities. The strategic plan will direct the prioritization of facilities and programs enhancements, and access for researchers, students, educators and natural resource managers in the California Channel Islands region. The involvement of an Environmental Science Masters level student in this process will provide graduate student level training in biological research, environmental management and related fields. Engaging with regional coordinators at workshops supported by the proposed planning process represents a formalized step in establishing a regionally coordinated node representing the Channel Islands that can more effectively participate in larger scale global observatory or climate change research efforts. The strategic plan and planning process will contribute to ongoing dialogue, and directly benefit several land and wildlife management agencies with jurisdiction over the Channel Islands, whose need for information to inform land management has increased markedly in recent years due to persistent drought conditions and other environmental stressors. The URL for the Santa Cruz Island Reserve is:  http://santacruz.nrs.ucsb.edu/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
