 "awd_abstract_narration": "Millions of people around the world are dependent on the ecosystem services provided by coral reefs, which include the provision of nutrition, fishing, tourism, and protection from storms and waves. The foundation for these services is based on the basic principle that coral reefs maintain positive calcium carbonate accretion, which is facilitated by the production of calcium carbonate by corals and other marine calcifiers. For the past several decades, coral reef calcium carbonate production has declined in many reef systems throughout the world primarily due to coral bleaching, coral disease, and poor water quality. Current projections suggest that this production will continue to decline in response to future ocean warming and acidification. However, our knowledge of how environmental parameters control coral and reef-scale calcification rates in situ is not complete and limits our understanding of the underlying mechanisms for past and future changes in coral and reef-scale calcium carbonate production. Thus, the research proposed here seeks to quantify how coral calcification rates, determined from image analysis of coral cores collected in Bermuda, have varied as a function of environmental parameters across space and time. This analysis is made possible by the existence of time-series datasets of physical and chemical parameters offshore in the Sargasso Sea and inshore where the coral cores were collected. The combination of data will offer new insights to the environmental controls of coral and reef-scale calcification. Furthermore, the investigators will engage in educational field and classroom activities with Ocean Discovery Institute (ODI) in San Diego. ODI's mission is to engage, educate, and inspire youth from diverse backgrounds through scientific explorations of the ocean and nature, and specifically work with students from underserved communities. \r\n\r\nThe research to be conducted here seeks to understand the relative importance of different environmental drivers of coral and reef-scale calcification on seasonal to interannual timescales. To accomplish this, the investigators will characterize the skeletal density, extension, and calcification rates of 42 coral cores extracted from three different species (Diploria labyrinthiformis, Pseudodiploria strigosa and Orbicella franksi) at five different sites from the Bermuda coral reef platform using computed tomography (CT) scanning techniques. Seasonal measurements of coral skeletal parameters will be analyzed in conjunction with a unique decadal time series of monthly resolved in situ seawater physical-biogeochemical parameters. The investigators will also conduct stable isotope and trace metal geochemical analyses (18O, 13C, Sr/Ca, Cd/Ca) of the coral skeleton to evaluate and construct additional proxy records of environmental conditions for the duration of the coral cores. This combination of coral growth, environmental, and geochemical datasets provides an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the relative importance of different environmental drivers on coral and reef-scale calcification rates between three dominant coral species along inshore-offshore gradients and over seasonal and interannual timescales. No such other datasets currently exist and the proposed research has strong potential to contribute to scientific advancement in several areas. The coral calcification record coupled with the geochemical proxies and the monthly in situ seawater biogeochemistry data will help to elucidate causal links between coral calcification and its environmental drivers, including interannual variability linked to the North Atlantic Oscillation. In addition, evaluation and validation of the trace metals and isotopic proxies in the context of the well-constrained environmental data have the potential to greatly assist the coral paleoceanography community in generating more robust reconstructions of past environmental conditions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In order to successfully maintain, protect, and restore coral reefs in the context of ongoing global environmental change, it is important that we have a sound understanding of the properties that allow corals and coral reef ecosystems to grow and accumulate reef structures made of calcium carbonate.</p>\r\n<p>In this project, we investigated changes in coral calcification rates and skeletal properties in cores extracted from three coral species (<em>Diploria labyrinthiformis</em>, <em>Pseudodiploria strigosa</em>, <em>Orbicella franksi</em>) from five different reef habitats on the Bermuda coral reef platform. Skeletal growth properties including linear extension, density, and calcification were analyzed for forty-two coral cores using computed tomography (CT) scanning techniques (<strong>Figure 1</strong>). For a subset of coral cores, geochemical analyses using mass spectrometry were applied to assess stable isotope variability (d<sup>13</sup>C and d<sup>18</sup>O) and trace metal ratios (e.g., Sr/Ca, B/Ca, Ba/Ca, Mg/Ca, Li/Mg, U/Ca). Uniquely, the coral growth, isotope, and trace metal records overlapped with a contemporary time series of surface seawater physical and chemical parameters from both inshore and offshore environments. These data provided an opportunity to compare variations in skeletal properties with seawater conditions. Specifically, we were interested to assess whether there were links between coral growth properties and the North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAO) as previous studies have proposed that certain modes of the NAO could lead to increased coral calcification rates in Bermuda due to increased food availability.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The longest coral growth record recovered extended back to the 1930s but the majority of cores extended back to the 1970s and 1980s. No distinct long-term trend was identified in the mean growth record of each coral species, but substantial seasonal, inter-colony, and inter-species variability were observed (<strong>Figure 2</strong>). Statistical analyses showed correlation between coral calcification in <em>D. labyrinthiformis</em> and the NAO with higher rates of calcification coincident with negative winter NAO modes. Negative winter NAO modes are in general associated with deeper mixing, higher nutrient fluxes, and intensified spring blooms. The correlation was also stronger for corals living closer to the reef edge than for corals living closer to shore. Other coral species showed no correlation with the NAO. All of the <em>D. labyrinthiformis</em> cores also showed a reduction in calcification in 1988 coincident with a well-documented coral bleaching event in Bermuda, but this reduction was not apparent in the other coral species. For all species, seasonal variation in coral calcification closely tracked environmental variations in seawater temperature and pH (<strong>Figure 3</strong>). However, because of slow growth rates and limited resolution of isotope measurements, we were unable to elucidate seasonal variations and differences from these data. In contrast, trace metal ratios were measured at higher resolution and revealed distinct seasonal trends that tracked both growth rates and seawater properties, and were mostly consistent across all three coral species despite different skeletal morphology and growth strategies (<strong>Figure 3)</strong>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit: </strong>The results from this study highlight the importance of considering the range of responses within and between coral species as well as across inshore-offshore gradients that may arise from inter-annual climate modes (e.g., NAO), thermal stress events, and interactions between ocean warming and coral nutrition in developing predictive models aimed at projecting coral calcification under past, present, and future climate change scenarios. Furthermore, the resulting data with overlapping coral skeleton and trace metal properties with monthly seawater chemistry from inshore (~10 years) and offshore (~30 years) offer a unique opportunity for further studies aimed at refining the application of coral trace metal records as proxies for historical seawater reconstruction.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts: </strong>This project directly supported the training and education of 2 PhD students, 1 MS student, 3 undergraduate students, and 1 postdoctoral scholar.
