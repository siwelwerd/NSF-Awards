 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"TeachLive\" is a mixed-reality classroom simulator through which teacher trainees practice interacting with small groups of virtual students who take on different, realistic roles as learners. The teacher trainees in this project are Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs), who increasingly provide the instruction for introductory undergraduate courses in large enrollment institutions. The extent of current GTA training varies by institution and most typically entails learning about generalized pedagogical best practices with little or no actual practice with feedback from a master teacher. GTAs are often hired to teach students while they themselves are still learning to teach. Most STEM GTAs and their undergraduate students would benefit from more intentional instruction on how to engage students using high-impact practices and pedagogical content knowledge within their disciplines. The TeachLive simulator provides a promising technology-based solution to the problem of providing GTAs with high quality training. TeachLive training provides a real-time response mechanism to practice teaching and has the promise of being more effective than other TA training strategies (workshops, short-courses, etc.), which do not provide enough feedback (real-time or otherwise) to be effective. The curricular materials for which GTAs will safely practice evidence-based teaching will utilize concept inventories that have been developed in four different STEM fields, Chemistry, Math, Physics, and Computer Science. \r\n\r\nIn the past the TeachLive platform has been developed and used successfully to train K-12 teachers to describe and explain problems more effectively and to better recognize students' misconceptions. This project is motivated by two deficiencies in current practice.  First, most GTAs get basic training in pedagogy, but not specific training in their discipline. Second, GTAs' fidelity of utilization of pedagogical training is highly variable, and many of them don't succeed in providing strong engaged student learning experiences. The TeachLive Simulator has the promise of tailoring practice to each specific GTA depending on their needs.",

For this project, a new learning environment was developed for the mixed-reality classroom simulator TeachLivE<sup>TM </sup>to resemble a physical science laboratory environment, as shown in Figures 1 and 2.</p>\r\n<p>We created and published a model for creating professional development modules to be implemented in a mixed-reality classroom simulator. In this project, GTAs rehearsed four pedagogical skills across four modules. Module 1 featured cold-calling (i.e., calling on non-volunteering students by name) paired with error framing (i.e., acknowledging that a student shared an incorrect idea in a way that frames errors as natural and/or beneficial). Module 2 featured questioning strategies, and Module 3 featured group management strategies. Finally, Module 4 allowed GTAS to integrate all four skills or to focus on a single challenging skill. We created three discipline-specific lesson scenarios for introductory physics, chemistry, and calculus. During the projects, over 100 GTAs received pedagogical training, impacting at least 6,000 undergraduate students. Consent rates for research were low among the calculus GTA cohort, we can not meaningfully analyze some data for this cohort, such as classroom observations.</p>\r\n<p>Analyzing observations of both the physics and chemistry GTAs, we identified distinct instructional styles than had previously been described in the literature. For chemistry GTAs, these instructional styles included: Responders; Active Lecturers; and Initiators. For physics GTAs, the styles included: Group-work Facilitators; Waiters; and Whole-class Facilitators. In contrast to prior work, our findings suggest a relationship between GTAs&rsquo; instructional styles and student behaviors, with more interactive instructional styles correlating with higher student engagement. This analysis suggested that both the nature of the laboratory activities and the GTAs&rsquo; amount of prior experience impacted GTA instructional style, with less experienced GTAs tending to be more interactive than experienced GTAs. Relatedly, analysis of physics GTA teaching behaviors showed that GTAs were less interactive when the classroom in which they were implementing the same active learning curriculum changed from one with tables that supported multiple students sitting together to one with individual desks.</p>\r\n<p>We conducted observations of the physics and chemistry GTAs in semesters with various amounts of simulator rehearsal of the target skills (i.e., no training, one session of training, and four sessions of training). We found that both new and experienced GTAs who completed all four simulator modules in one semester demonstrated a shift towards actively implementing whole-class facilitation strategies rather than passively waiting for their students to ask for help. We also observed that these GTAs implemented questioning and cold calling techniques. Specifically, we found that simulator training increased the number of high-quality questions GTAs asked during a class session.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, we analyzed a particularly tricky aspect of active learning instruction&ndash; what an instructor should say when a student makes a mistake in front of other students. Overall, we found error framing is difficult for GTAs to implement. We analyzed the error framing statements GTAs made in the mixed-reality classroom simulator and found that GTAs used both explicit and implicit forms of error identification and a variety of error framing techniques, including framing errors as natural, framing errors as beneficial, and positively acknowledging the error. From interviews with undergraduate students about some of these exemplar GTA error framing statements, we found that the specific framing that a GTA implemented as well as the GTA&rsquo;s tone impacted student&rsquo;s comfort. Some GTAs and some undergraduate students suggested that GTAs should not explicitly identify student mistakes. We analyzed GTAs use of error framing statements in their actual classrooms and found that in the rare cases that GTAs made error framing statements, they tended to use implicit, indirect strategies, which aligned with those that would support student comfort.</p>\r\n<p>Overall, this project demonstrated that rehearsal in a mixed-reality classroom simulator supported GTAs&rsquo; use of teaching skills that are associated with active learning curricula, which have become common in introductory STEM courses.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 02/28/2025<br>\nModified by: Jacquelyn&nbsp;Chini</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1725554/1725554_10525026_1740769240412_TeachLivE_ComputerLab--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1725554/1725554_10525026_1740769240412_TeachLivE_ComputerLab--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"TeachLivE Computer Lab\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1725554/1725554_10525026_1740769240412_TeachLivE_ComputerLab--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"TeachLivE Computer Lab\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The TeachLivE avatar students are shown seated at bench style tables with computer monitors.
