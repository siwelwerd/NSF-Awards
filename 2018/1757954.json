 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The REU Site at Southern Illinois University Carbondale will provide research opportunities for an average of 14 undergraduates per year (including 2 supported internally) for a 9 week period each summer. Students will be involved in interdisciplinary projects in the broadly defined area of materials research. Inclusion of faculty mentors from various disciplines (Chemistry, Physics, Engineering, Microbiology, and the Materials Technology Center) will enable the REU students to develop skills needed to excel in both academic and industrial research environments, where interdisciplinary teams are standard and researchers must communicate effectively across disciplines. Students will also be required to think about the application of their research to new technologies and the manufacturing of new devices, and will have the opportunity to present their results to a diverse audience. The Site will recruit primarily from 2-/4-year institutions residing in neighboring states or the Mississippi Delta region, as well as those with traditionally high enrollment of students from underrepresented groups. Students participating in this Site will learn to network with other scientists and engineers through various social activities including weekly lunches with faculty mentors and weekend trips to cultural, industrial, and recreational locations. Primary goals of the site include: (1) creating a positive image of science and engineering as a career choice. Students will leave the program with a greater sense of the trials, tribulations, and rewards that await them; (2) providing a nurturing environment and instilling a sense of confidence in the art of discussing and practicing science; (3) improving the participants? oral and written communication skills; (4) teaching of basic research tools, including literature searches and the operation of modern instrumentation; (5) fostering a collaborative teamwork approach to research; and (6) increasing the number of domestic students, especially those from underrepresented groups, who choose to pursue STEM careers. A detailed assessment plan will be followed to enable evaluation of our efforts. \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The mentored research projects associated with this Site promise to be excellent training grounds for working in materials and related fields. Students will be exposed to a variety of transformative projects at the forefront of science and engineering, including: (1) studies related to the synthesis of advanced functional materials (metal organic frameworks, inorganic heterostructures, thin films, nanocomposites, novel electron-accepting materials; electrospun nanofibers, nanoscale/microscale heterogeneous catalysts, etc.); (2) materials characterization (via electron microscopies, solid- and solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, optical/magnetic transport measurements, ultraviolet/visible/infrared/two-dimensional-infrared/Raman spectroscopies, etc.); (3) theoretical/computational studies (wherein students will learn how to study materials via density functional theory calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, etc.); and (4) materials applications varying from energy storage and photovoltaics, to biosensors and contrast agents, to polymer lithography for device fabrication. \r\n\r\nThis site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Some specific outcomes are summarized below.</p>\n<p><em>Recruitment Outcomes</em>: For our most recent three-year cycle (including one year of NCE where our program was postponed because of our University's response to the covid-19 pandemic), ~43.2% (19) were female, ~54.5% (24) were male, and ~2.2% (1) were gender-non-binary. ~30% were from underrepresented minority groups, a number that grows to over 36% when other types of underrepresented students are included (e.g. female physicists/engineers). Nearly 70% of participants were from our targeted institutions in the region (IL, IN, MO, KY, WI, IA, &amp; TN), Mississippi Delta region, select HBCUs, high minority-enrollment institutions, and junior colleges (from within and outside this targeted region); nevertheless, the relatively large number of applicants from outside our list of targeted schools likely indicates that our REU program is being proactively sought out by students using the internet.</p>\n<p>The recruitment outcomes for the past 16 years and their assessment in terms of our Program's original goals may be found in <strong>Figure 1</strong>.

The consensus of the participating faculty was that the recruited students were high quality and possessed great potential as future scientists and researchers (at least according to all feedback received by the PI/Co-PI).
