 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable students and trainees to take state-of-the-art robotics laboratory classes from anywhere in the world. The proposed learning system is aimed to be incorporated as online courses, with the potential of being attended by more than a million students. The addressable market represents hundreds of millions of dollars considering online courses, secondary schools and industrial training. Laboratory courses in colleges and high schools require students to be physically present next to the equipment. With the proposed remote robotics laboratory, students and trainees can take laboratory classes just turning on their mobile devices or computers. Most importantly, the students can conduct the laboratory tutorials anywhere across the globe and at any time. This technology can be transformative for accessing expensive laboratory equipment not present in many institutions or companies. The system we provide consists of a robotic device currently being used inside NASA robots. Therefore, students using the remote laboratory will learn the use of real-world, state-of-the-art equipment that can be highly valuable for their job careers in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will solve two key problems in online learning. First, no known commercially available laboratory online course exists that provides students remote hands-on experimentation. The second is that the same content is delivered to all students regardless of their current understanding level. Distributed communications, robotic software and web framework technologies will be integrated to provide access to state-of-the-art laboratory equipment. The second key innovation is the delivery of content adaptively tailored to individual needs. The innovation, consists of three key components. A web framework that connects equipment to servers and personal mobile devices, an intelligent content tutoring system, scheduling usage times and student evaluation regarding skill acquisition and assessments. The team anticipates that being remotely located will be slightly less effective than being next to the equipment but superior than learning theory only.",
