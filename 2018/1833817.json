 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) program supports the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need.  This collaborative project led by the University of Memphis, the University of Colorado at Denver, and Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis will provide scholarships to students pursuing baccalaureate degrees in engineering and mathematics.  Through its five years of funding, this project will support at least 50 students at each institution, for a total of 150 unique students.  Administrators and faculty from the partner institutions' colleges or schools of engineering and mathematics departments will partner to provide academic, social, professional, and peer networking, as well as career preparation. The lack of STEM identity is a fundamental reason that students often cite for leaving STEM majors and careers. This project will investigate mechanisms for supporting a diverse set of students in an urban context in their development of a STEM identity. Results of this project will help meet the national need for a highly skilled workforce in engineering and mathematics and generate knowledge about STEM identity across all disciplines.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to increase the recruitment, retention, student success, and graduation rates of high-achieving undergraduate students with financial need, who are majoring in mathematical sciences and engineering at each institution. The partnering institutions plan to implement ambitious but feasible strategies that contribute to student academic success, development of STEM identity, and workforce readiness. In addition, they plan to incentivize substantial student participation in project activities through a badging system. Activities for mathematics and engineering classes will be designed to support a high probability of student success. The institutions intend to conduct formative and summative evaluations that will focus on determining effectiveness and impact of the project activities, strategies, and adjustments. The project also plans to examine factors influencing development of STEM identity and the resulting impact on student success, attitudes, workforce readiness, and STEM self-efficacy. Attention will be paid to impact on first-generation students and students from other groups that are underrepresented in engineering and mathematics.  Innovative aspects of the project will include deploying features from CourseNetworking software to provide scholars with evidence of their learning journey, while expanding a meaningful academic social network and building a STEM identity facilitated by a comprehensive, cloud-native software environment. CourseNetworking will include a student ePortfolio that will serve as a digital collection of each student's work and accomplishments. The ePortfolio will provide certification badges that mark the student's participation and will maintain a record  of the student's attainment of knowledge, behaviors, and skill sets. The project will strive to develop and disseminate a vetted, practical, sustainable, and transportable model to recruit and retain high-achieving students with financial need and provide them with avenues for success in STEM studies and careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

While PLTL has long been used in Chemistry at IUPUI with significant reductions of course DFW rates (grades of D, F, or withdrawal), this was the first implementation within a math course at IUPUI. Both Urban STEM cohorts (Fall 2019 and Fall 2020) outperformed the overall class in Calculus 1: The Fall 2019 cohort (n=25) had a 0% DFW rate (all students passed with grades of C- or higher), compared to 21.0% DFW rate among students who enrolled in a traditional, non-PLTL recitation and 33.3% among those who did not enroll in a recitation. The Fall 2020 cohort (n=20) had a DFW rate of 15.0%, compared to 24.0% and 24.8% who enrolled in a traditional or no recitation, respectively. Pandemic-induced social distancing protocols in Fall 2020 interfered with the implementation of small-group problem-solving in PLTL; even so, the higher 2020 DFW rate in the Urban STEM PLTL section did not include any failing grades, compared to a failure rate of 12.7% in the course overall. Furthermore, both Urban STEM cohorts had a DFW rate of 0% among students from underrepresented ethnic groups (Black/African American, Hispanic/Latine, 2 or more races) despite having higher representation from these groups compared to the class overall, which saw DFW rates among these underrepresented students of 36.7% in Fall 2019 and 30.0% in Fall 2020.
