 "awd_abstract_narration": "This innovation demonstrates how advanced algorithm information technologies can transform the medical care delivery system by shifting the focus to early diagnosis. This technology identifies suspicious skin lesions as positive or negative for the structural properties of Buruli ulcers. Furthermore, this technique validates the classification system for other skin lesions which can be improved and expanded to include other types of skin diseases for humans, animals, and also plants. Point-of-care diagnostics for skin diseases have the potential to not only identify diseases in the early stages, but also create opportunities to initiate medical interventions in earlier stages of a disease, thereby reducing medical costs by treating diseases with antibiotic therapy instead of surgical interventions and eliminating any unnecessary pain and suffering resulting from complications of late-stage disease diagnosis. This innovation is critical for differential diagnosis, disease surveillance, collecting environmental contextual data, medication adherence, and advancing health literacy. This work is important because it contributes to a wider body of knowledge that seeks to validate algorithm development for point-of-care diagnostics, and ultimately improves access to healthcare for rural and hard-to-reach populations, also reducing barriers to care for otherwise stigmatizing and debilitating diseases.\r\n\r\nAdvancements in point-of-care diagnostics for neglected tropical diseases, and neglected infections of poverty represents an opportunity to decrease both the incidence and prevalence of debilitating and disfiguring diseases. These otherwise preventable diseases represent the most disability-adjusted life years lost. Representative of an interdisciplinary intervention, image diagnostics for skin diseases require the development of effective means for intervention design, management, and evaluation while enhancing the relationships and collaborations working internationally, across cultures, with community-based primary care, and to also include opportunities for incorporating telehealth to address access to care in resource-limited and hard-to-reach communities. Opportunities to more widely disseminate this research, and to include commercial potential expands the scope of this innovation and provides additional education and training opportunities for students of engineering and public health, but also for clinicians, and community-based healthcare providers. Successful implementation of point-of-care diagnostics for early stage disease detection advances the disciplines and allows for the translation of the innovation, analysis, synthesis, and interpretation of research for future education and training. Lastly, the advancement of this type of innovation has the ability to shift the medical system to early diagnosis reducing the overall disease burden of ill-health and disability due to late stage diagnosis of disease.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
