 "awd_abstract_narration": "Carbon nanodots are a type of newly engineered non-toxic nanomaterials.  They have scavenging potential of free radicals, which are highly unstable and reactive molecules, in biological systems and other environments. Because free radicals are associated with inflammation, which can lead to potentially serious pathological conditions, a better understanding of the interfacial reaction mechanisms between carbon nanodots and biological systems is a critical step toward using these nanomaterials in applications.  This project will enhance the understanding of the surface chemistry of carbon nanodots and the roles of the surrounding conditions on carbon nanodots interfacial reactions in biological systems. Additionally, the data on free radical life cycle from this study will help guide experiments and computational modeling in other investigations of nanomaterials for biomedical engineering applications. Broader impacts of the findings from the proposed study include: 1) Development of customized nanoscale materials for biomedical and, potentially, environmental applications, 2) Hands-on training of under-represented STEM students throughout the projects and curriculum revision that can be scaled up in other STEM oriented institutions, and 3) Impact on the K-12 science and engineering education in under-represented educational communities through the PIs network.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this study is to better understand how carbon nanodot's free radical scavenging potential is influenced by surrounding biological systems and biochemical conditions. The scope of the proposed work will be mainly limited to delineating the mechanisms involved in interfacial interactions. This will be done by investigating reactions between functional groups on carbon nanodots and biological/biochemical molecules. This study will be carried out by using carbon nanodots with various functional groups, polymer-protein conjugates and hybrids, and spin-trap protein radicals with three thrusts: 1) Synthesis and preparation of carbon nanodots, conjugates and hybrids, and spin-trap protein radicals, 2) Evaluation of anti-oxidative activities of the prepared molecules in biological system, and 3) Computational modeling of calorimetric techniques with empirical data. The intellectual merit of this study is to advance our understanding in the following areas: 1) Interfacial and intermolecular reaction chemistry and fundamentals of free radical reactions between nanomaterials, especially carbon nanodots and biological systems, 2) Free radical life cycle mechanisms by building computational models, which can also be applied to other similar engineered nanomaterial studies, and 3) Reaction mechanisms associated with molecules and protein radicals from immune-spin trap methods that overcome technical challenges currently present in many free radical studies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Electron transfer is a pivotal process in the fate of free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS), both of which play essential roles in biochemical reactions and pathological conditions in various environments and in humans. Understanding and controlling the lifecycle and transfer mechanisms of electrons or ROS could provide long-term solutions to the toxicological and pathological threats faced by human health and the environment.</p>\r\n<p>The study aimed to delineate the mechanisms governing the fate and transfer of electrons in emerging nanomaterials like CNDs. CNDs, quantum dots composed solely of carbon, offer superior biosafety and biochemical properties compared to other quantum dots, making them ideal for diverse applications. The project had three key objectives:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Synthesis and Characterization of      CNDs:</strong><br /> The first objective was to synthesize CNDs with ROS scavenging      capabilities. A straightforward and reliable microwave method was employed      to produce a mixture of pristine CND subtypes, including those with and      without functional groups such as carboxyl (COO-), hydroxyl (OH-), and      amine (NH2-). These CNDs were purified and characterized using many      analytical devices including atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electron      microscopy (TEM and SEM). Biochemical tests confirmed their ROS scavenging      potential. The pristine CNDs were then hybridized with hyperbranched      polymers to simulate biological systems and evaluate the impact of      environmental conditions on CND behavior. Reaction mechanisms between the      CNDs and polymers were assessed, with the results translated into      thermodynamic terms to support the development of predictive models.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Model Development for ROS Fate      Prediction:</strong><br /> The second objective was to construct a predictive model for the fate of      ROS generated in various biochemical conditions. This model aimed to lay      the groundwork for future applications by enabling accurate predictions of      ROS lifecycle dynamics in complex systems.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Biological Testing of CNDs:</strong><br /> The third objective focused on testing the ROS scavenging effects of CNDs      in real biological environments with actual pollutants as ROS sources.      Neuroblastoma IMR-32 cells, which produce beta-amyloid (&beta;A) proteins&mdash;a      biomarker for Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease&mdash;were exposed to copper nanoparticles      (CuNPs), ambient particulate matter (PM), and microplastics (MPs) with and      without CNDs. Anti-DMPO antibody assays were used to evaluate the      outcomes.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong></p>\r\n<p>The project yielded critical insights into the behavior of CNDs as ROS scavengers, including how environmental factors influence their efficacy. These findings have significant implications for environmental and human health protection as well as advancements in biomedical science and engineering. Challenges in building a predictive computer model highlighted alternative reaction mechanisms between polymers and CNDs where ROS activity could be more practically measured. Additionally, results from the IMR-32 cell studies underscored the potential link between emerging nanomaterials, microplastics, and anthropogenic PMs with rising neurological pathologies and other pathological conditions.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Dissemination and Impact:</strong><br /> During the project, findings were shared extensively through 2 community events related to K-12 trainings, 57 conference presentations in oral and poster formats, 13 seminars and workshops, and 18 new or revised courses. The study resulted in 40 peer-reviewed journal articles, with 7 additional manuscripts under preparation. Over 40 students at various academic levels were trained, including 3 postdoctoral fellows, 19 graduate students, and 15 undergraduates. This training culminated in 9 Ph.D. dissertations and 8 M.S. theses/projects. Furthermore, the project facilitated collaborations with 13 research groups and institutions, leading to the submission of 31 new grant proposals. These partnerships have broadened the scope and reach of the study, fostering ongoing research and innovation in this critical field.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/31/2024<br>\nModified by: John&nbsp;J&nbsp;Bang</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1832134/1832134_10578828_1735688493092_Prevention_of_Beta_Amyloid_Protein_aggregation_by_CNDs--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1832134/1832134_10578828_1735688493092_Prevention_of_Beta_Amyloid_Protein_aggregation_by_CNDs--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Differential ROS effects on Beta amyloid subgroups\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1832134/1832134_10578828_1735688493092_Prevention_of_Beta_Amyloid_Protein_aggregation_by_CNDs--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Differential ROS effects on Beta amyloid subgroups\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Differential aggregation potential of beta amyloid subgroups in the presence of ROS and CNDs' ROS scavenging effects</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">John Bang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;J&nbsp;Bang\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Differential ROS effects on Beta amyloid subgroups</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1832134/1832134_10578828_1735687967783_Nanomaterial_ThermoHPG_Copyright_by_the_authors_Page_03--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1832134/1832134_10578828_1735687967783_Nanomaterial_ThermoHPG_Copyright_by_the_authors_Page_03--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Crosslinked hyperbranched polyglycerol\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1832134/1832134_10578828_1735687967783_Nanomaterial_ThermoHPG_Copyright_by_the_authors_Page_03--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Crosslinked hyperbranched polyglycerol\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Creation of functionalized hyperbranched polyglycerol</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Darlene Taylor</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;J&nbsp;Bang\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Crosslinked hyperbranched polyglycerol</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1832134/1832134_10578828_1735687634986_CND_properties_amyloid_beta_proteins--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1832134/1832134_10578828_1735687634986_CND_properties_amyloid_beta_proteins--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"CNDs and ROS toxicity\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1832134/1832134_10578828_1735687634986_CND_properties_amyloid_beta_proteins--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"CNDs and ROS toxicity\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">CND properties and protection from ROS toxicity</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">John Bang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;J&nbsp;Bang\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">CNDs and ROS toxicity</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1832134/1832134_10578828_1735688189393_Optochemical_Properties_of_CNDs_Copyright_ACS_Page_01--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1832134/1832134_10578828_1735688189393_Optochemical_Properties_of_CNDs_Copyright_ACS_Page_01--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Optical Properties of Carbon Nanodots\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1832134/1832134_10578828_1735688189393_Optochemical_Properties_of_CNDs_Copyright_ACS_Page_01--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Optical Properties of Carbon Nanodots\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Experimental and Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory Modeling Studies on Optical Properties of Carbon Nanodots</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jianjun Wei</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;J&nbsp;Bang\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Optical Properties of Carbon Nanodots</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
