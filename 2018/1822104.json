 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is Phase II of the Broadband Wireless Access Center (BWAC), a multi-university multi-industry organization composed of five universities (the University of Arizona, Virginia Tech, University of Notre Dame, University of Mississippi (UM), and the Catholic University of America) and 20+ affiliates from industry and government. In the past decade, wireless communications has made major technological leaps. Wireless connectivity is pervasive in society, leading to a shortage in wireless spectrum, network congestion, cyber-attacks and personal security issues. The mission of BWAC is to address these challenges and offer creative solutions. \r\n\r\nThis project will bring to bear UM research capabilities and real-world industry interest in several BWAC thrust areas. Center as a whole addresses research areas, including wireless spectrum sharing, security, and future milli-meter wave technology. UM research problems address spectrum sharing for heterogeneous wireless systems, network optimization to mitigate mutual interference in BLE (low energy Bluetooth) and WiFi systems, and 3 D printing of antennas and the design and fabrication of closely spaced antennas and antenna arrays using elliptical metasurface cloaking. Collaboration with industries in the Southeastern U.S. will provide for our students additional co-op and internship opportunities. \r\n\r\nThe results of this collaborative industry-university center will have a direct effect on public well-fare, enabling several applications such as remote health and broadband access in rural areas. The partnering universities will broaden their activities to include REU site programs, RET program, participation of under-represented minority students and faculty in research projects, and involvement of multidisciplinary projects. New curriculum at UM will have courses on Internet of Things (IoT) systems and cognitive radios. With its research, established partnerships, and long history of collaboration between its members, BWAC will likely create intellectual property and spin-off companies, leading to job growth. \r\n\r\nThe lead site, University of Arizona manages the central BWAC project website at www.bwac.arizona.edu. This website contains various information about the center including the overview of the center, mission, industry membership, projects, meeting announcements and technical data. Center proprietary documents are managed through a secure internal pages requiring access credentials.  The data repository will be managed at the main website with links to the other university sites. The repository will contain technical papers, project descriptions, relevant software, testbed details, etc. The repository will be maintained during the project and for an additional five years beyond its termination.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
