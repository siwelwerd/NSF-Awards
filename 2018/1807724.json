 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program, Professor Jamie Walls and his group at the University of Miami are working to develop cost-effective methods to improve the resolution of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry, a powerful and versatile tool widely used in academic, clinical, and industrial research.  If successful, this work will enable improved contrast in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a noninvasive tool widely used for clinical diagnostics and other imaging applications.  This in turn could improve characterization and diagnosis of cancer and other difficult-to-detect ailments in the human body, as well as improving spatial resolution of images of solids such as bone.  Dr. Walls is also developing software that will enable others to emulate and expand on his methods.  Undergraduate and graduate students working on this research receive training in both theoretical and experimental aspects of NMR.\r\n\r\nIn spectroscopy, two resonances can be resolved if their frequency difference, ????, is larger than the linewidths of the individual resonances.  In NMR, improving spectral resolution is one of the most important challenges for extending the range of problems NMR can address.  The PI's group recently discovered that unexpected improvements in spectral resolution could be achieved (1) by using low-power RF excitation in solid-state systems, (2) by using delayed-acquisition to highlight spectral differences due to Fourier dephasing, which is a result of the mathematical properties of the line shape and is independent of the underlying spin dynamics and/or complexity, or (3) by generating multispin-order in the presence of partially correlated radiofrequency (RF) and magnetic field B0 inhomogeneities in liquid-state samples.  Collectively, these results suggest an alternative and unexplored route towards improving spectral resolution in NMR that forms the basis of this research.  Specifically, the Walls group is developing pulse sequences that exploit differences in Fourier dephasing in order to enhance sharp spectral features in a spectrum.  The work entails both theoretical and experimental investigations into the nature of the multispin-order that can lead to optimal line narrowing in liquid-state NMR.  It can provide alternative methods for coherently improving resolution in both solid- and liquid-state NMR applications.  These improvements can enhance spectroscopic characterization of pharmaceuticals, complex sugars, and other biomolecular species in addition to improving spatial resolution in solid-state MRI.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The&nbsp;<strong>intellectual merit</strong>&nbsp;of this project involves opening new avenues to control nuclear spin dynamics in both liquid- and solid-state systems.&nbsp; For example, the PI's group demonstrated for the first-time that signals could be selectively removed from an NMR spectrum or an MRI image based solely upon difference in self-diffusion coefficients. Such techniques could also be applied to selectively control the electron spin in EPR spectroscopy.&nbsp; The PI's group developed a physical model for the Gibbs phenomenon, which was previously thought to be a purely mathematical effect caused by expanding a nondifferentiable function in terms of differentiable basic functions such as those used in a Fourier series expansion. In our model, the Gibbs phenomenon is viewed purely as an interference effect.&nbsp; Local differences in this interference, i.e., Fourier dephasing, was used to explain the reversible localization at edges that PI's group found in delayed-acquisition experiments. Fourier dephasing could potentially manifest itself whenever there is interference, such as in electron transport in mesoscopic systems. We also identified that crowding in emulsions can affect the NMR determined kinetic parameters say of drug release from a nanoemulsion. Finally, experimental and theoretical results were obtained that indicated that homogenously broadened, such as those found in dipolar solids, can behave inhomogeneously under certain conditions, and that this behavior still persists even under conditions where the homogeneous broadening is coherently removed (for example, under magic-angle spinning). The&nbsp;<strong>broader impacts</strong>&nbsp;of this project is that new spatially selective pulses that incorporate Fourier dephasing in their design could be used to speed-up MRI by achieving signal localization on a faster time scale when compared to conventional spatially selective pulses currently used in MRI. Results from this project could lead to better formulations of drug carrier systems in pharmaceutical industries. Finally, this NSF award also led to the training of graduate and undergraduate students and a post-doctoral researcher in NMR methodology and simulations.&nbsp; The award period resulted in 8 publications with additional papers in preparation for submission.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/20/2023<br>\nModified by: Jamie&nbsp;D&nbsp;Walls</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1807724/1807724_10561788_1703071891679_figfinalproject_2018_2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1807724/1807724_10561788_1703071891679_figfinalproject_2018_2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Low-power excitation generates long-lived signals in dipolar spin systems\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1807724/1807724_10561788_1703071891679_figfinalproject_2018_2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Low-power excitation generates long-lived signals in dipolar spin systems\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(A) FIDs in solid hexamethylbenzene generated by low power excitation, with and without a pi-pulse.
