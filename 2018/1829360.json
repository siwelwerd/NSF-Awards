 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is a lead enrichment kit that can allow fast detection of lead in water with low cost and low detection limit. Lead contamination in drinking water is a threat to human beings. Due to its health concern, the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) has set an action level of 15 \u00b5g/L for lead in tap water. Considering the great threat of lead to health even with low concentrations, it is necessary to have lead measurements in water at a regular basis. The proposed project aims to commercialize an inexpensive kit which would allow fast lead detection in water with low detection limit to meet Lead and Copper Rule (15 ppb). The kit provides two main benefits to customers: a lower cost ($4) than current kit ($11) for lead detection which meets Lead and Copper Rule and convenience for field sample measurements.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project aims to evaluate the commercial adoption of our inexpensive lead enrichment kit for lead detection. Interviews will be conducted to help identify the potential customers and the market needs, evaluate the commercialization feasibility of the new technology, and optimize the technology to meet the demand of targeted customers. Inspired by findings from our current NSF-project, special enrichment kit was designed to accumulate Pb from water, allowing quick detection of lead in water with low concentrations using the inexpensive detection kit. Additionally, the proposed work will provide the basis for future development and commercialization of new enrichment kits to detect other aqueous contaminants in water with low detection limits.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In this project, we conducted interviews with different potential customers for customer discovery. In the interviews, we found out that 50% of customers care about both the cost and quality of the products. Among them, 80% of them thought the quality of the products had higher priority than cost. The charge per sample correlated with the turn-around time of measurements. For instance, the price per sample in a certified laboratory for a two-week turn-around time was $ 60, while a 3-4-day turn-around time was $ 90 per sample and $ 100 per sample for one day. Most water treatment plants request heavy metal results within 24 hrs, and they send the samples to certified commercial laboratories approved by EPA or TCEQ every two weeks. For residents (interested in detecting lead), they prefer to detect lead by themselves to reduce the turn-around time and cost. In the case of currently available sensors and kits in the market, several issues were identified. In the case of sensors, copper and lead presented similar responses to some sensors, making it hard to determine whether the result was coming from copper or lead. The maintenance or replacement of the sensor is typically costly. One company stated that a single kit coupled with a sensor would cost around $2,000, which is too expensive for households. As our lead detection product is relatively simple in both mechanism and operation, it does not need a sensor, making it more affordable to households. Furthermore, several companies must dissolve (digest) the target elements first to measure them, and strong acid or heat is needed for such a process, which is not possible to be used in households. In the case of kits, several kits were identified. For instance, kits involving fluorescence may suffer from the impact caused by toxic reagents. Other kits are ion-selective, i.e., each kit can only measure one element at a time. Another caveat of the current kits is that if customers want to measure multiple factors in drinking water, they will have to purchase various kits, which are costly and inconvenient. The companies are also aware of this limitation, and some of them are already doing R&amp;D to develop kits with the ability to detect different contaminants in one single kit. Detection of multiple metals is also our future goal to improve our product. &nbsp;The value chain in the water and wastewater treatment industry is evident.
