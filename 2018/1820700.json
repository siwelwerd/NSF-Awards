 "awd_abstract_narration": "This RUI award funds the research activities of Professor Noah Graham at Middlebury College in Middlebury, Vermont.   \r\n\r\nWe learn about our world via the reflection, transmission, and absorption of waves, from the light scattered by a blue sky to the rumble of seismic waves through the earth.  As a result, the mathematical and computational tools for analyzing wave scattering play an essential role in our scientific and technological infrastructure.  This research will develop and extend techniques of scattering theory and apply them both to answer questions about fundamental laws of physics and to analyze and design experiments studying microelectromechanical systems in nanotechnology.  Because of the fundamental role scattering theory plays across science and engineering, this research is accessible to and provides valuable training for undergraduate students planning careers in a wide range of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields.  The project will thus promote key national priorities through both advances in fundamental and applied research and in building the core technical capabilities of the next generation of scientists and engineers.  Through education and outreach, the impact of this project will extend beyond the students directly involved to the broader college and local community as well.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, this research will develop extensions of the variable phase method in analytic scattering theory and then use these techniques to address subtle questions in quantum field theory.  These applications include computations of quantum corrections to the energies and charges of magnetic monopoles in models of particle physics, analysis of the effects of quantum fluctuations in curved spacetime and their consequences for general relativity and quantum gravity, and precise determination of Casimir forces in systems relevant to nanotechnology.  Because it reduces problems in quantum field theory to the simpler and more familiar properties of wave scattering, this approach offers significant opportunities for undergraduate students working on this research to build broadly applicable scientific and technical skills, as well as opportunities for pedagogical integration of this research with the physics curriculum.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis award has supported advances in quantum field theory and provided opportunities for undergraduate physics students to participate meaningfully in research.\n\nWhile the laws of classical physics are usually adequate to describe the world as we encounter it in everyday life, we know that they are only an approximation to the more accurate picture provided by quantum mechanics.  This project has focused on research into a variety of phenomena for which these quantum effects can play a pivotal role.  The central tool used in these analyses is scattering theory, which describes how an incident light beam or other wave is reflected and transmitted from an object.  Scattering data form a bridge between the classical and quantum worlds, by expressing the effects of quantum fluctuations in terms of the set of all possible scattering events.\n\nAt distances comparable to the wavelength of visible light, quantum fluctuations give rise to Casimir forces between uncharged bodies that classically would not interact with one another.  Modern experimental technology has made precision measurements of these forces possible, allowing for investigations of the role they could play in the design of the next generation of microelectromechanical devices.  Casimir forces and associated heat transfer can both provide novel mechanisms for the functioning of these devices and give rise to unwanted frictional effects.  My collaborators and I have carried out calculations showing the capabilities and limitations of non-reciprocal materials, for which the reflection and transmission amplitudes for wave scattering are not the same when the process is reversed.  Because such materials break symmetries obeyed by ordinary materials, they can give rise to Casimir effects that those symmetries prohibit.  We showed how to use non-reciprocal Casimir forces to construct a heat engine from bodies at different temperatures, while for objects at the same temperature we showed that the resulting force remains reciprocal, but can give rise to repulsion and stable equilibrium in situations where these phenomena are ruled out for reciprocal objects.\n\nWhen a strong magnetic field is applied to a superconductor, the field can penetrate the superconductor in quantized filaments known as Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen vortices.  They are characterized by their magnetic flux, which mathematically is described through a topological winding number.  Depending on the properties of the superconductor, these vortices will attract, coalescing into a single flux tube, or repel, forming a lattice of evenly separated unit vortices.  At the classical borderline between these cases, this behavior is determined by quantum corrections to the classical picture.  This research has carried out the first calculations of quantum corrections in which one can study the dependence of these quantum corrections on winding number.  We find that that, like the classical energy, they scale linearly with magnetic flux but favor vortex binding.  The scattering theory approach makes feasible the complex calculations in renormalized quantum field theory, which require careful combination of formally divergent quantities to obtain an unambiguous finite result.\n\nQuantum fluctuations outside of a black hole probe the interface between quantum mechanics and general relativity as illustrated by the appearance of Hawking radiation.  New scattering theory approaches developed in this research have expanded and generalized the capabilities of previous calculations for a Schwarzschild black hole, while reducing the need for complex intermediate approximations.\n\nA total of four summer research students were supported by this grant, one of whom continued work over two summers.  All were able to build directly on their physics coursework, extending both their knowledge of that material and their broader intellectual capabilities in carrying out independent research.  Along the way, they also gained practical experience in programming and computer science.  Two are now in graduate school pursuing Ph. D. degrees, one in physics and one in mathematics, while the other two are current Middlebury students, one of whom is planning a dual undergraduate degree in engineering.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/19/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Noah M Graham"
