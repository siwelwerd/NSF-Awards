 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON), located in Cocodrie, LA, will host a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site program during the summers of 2018-2020.  Student interns in the LUMCON REU program will have the opportunity to examine the impacts of environmental changes on a diversity of ecosystems first hand as a result of LUMCON's unique location: in the upper end of one of Louisiana's larger estuaries (Terrebonne-Timbalier Bay), in the heart of coastal Louisiana's expansive marshlands, close to and between two major rivers (the Mississippi and Atchafalaya) that dictate the coastal ecosystems morphology, processes and functions, north of a productive coastal ocean, and close to the Gulf of Mexico (as the ship steams) including its deepest parts. This setting, combined with the expertise of the LUMCON faculty, provides an opportunity for student interns to pursue independent research projects focused on a dynamic coastal and marine ecosystem. The research also will support science-based policy and management. The REU program will recruit nationally and will host six interns each summer for a ten-week research experience. Students will conduct independent research projects and participate in a variety of professional development workshops, field trips and educational activities. Most of the funding supports student stipends, room and board and transportation expenses. This REU award contributes to the NSF goal of training the nation's future scientific workforce. \r\n\r\nStudents will have opportunities to conduct independent research in a variety of areas, including river/ocean interactions, delta formation and degradation, coastal loss and restoration, biodiversity, physiological, behavioral and general ecology, geomicrobiology, biogeochemistry, and acute and chronic anthropogenic and environmental impacts including climate change, eutrophication/hypoxia, ocean acidification, and oil spills on coastal and marine systems. The combination of mentor research interests and expertise with the diversity of habitats in this region provides a unique opportunity for REU interns to participate in a scientific research and professional mentoring program that interfaces fundamental research questions in coastal and marine ecosystems with problems central to science-based policy and management activities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

REU program was funded to support a total of 18 interns during a ten week summer research program over three summers. Through leveraging of support from other research grants and external funding sources we were able to support an additional 16 (34 total) undergraduates that participated in the REU program activities over the four year period including 12 interns in a virtual professional development program in the summer of 2020 and 7 interns in a hybrid program in the summer of 2021 where the interns spent 5 weeks remote and 5 weeks on site as a result of COVID-19 restrictions. Throughout each summer, undergraduate college students in the program acquired ?hands on? research experience conducting independent research projects, participated in career and skill-building workshops, went on field trips and were exposed to a diversity of research projects through both a formal seminar series and informal opportunities. Student research projects focused on the coastal zone environment that is being impacted by climate change and more direct human impacts, including fisheries, transportation, and industry. Areas of research have included biogeochemistry, benthic ecology, coastal geology, behavioral ecology, ecosystem ecology, geomicrobiology, physiological ecology, organic chemistry, wetland science and Gulf Oil Spill impacts.

Regardless of the challenges of 2020 and 2021, the LUMCON REU Site has been successful in providing research opportunities to a diverse group of undergraduate students within the 2018-2021 cohorts including 33% of REU interns being male (24%) or described as non-binary (9%), 50% from non-PhD granting institutions, 35% first generation college students and 47% from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups (20% Black/African American, 24% Hispanic/Latino, 6% American Indian, 6% Asian, and 20% multi-racial). Additionally, ~9% of REUs were non-traditional students. We were successful at continuing to work with REUs after they left Cocodrie. With the onset of the pandemic in 2020, we only have two cohorts totaling 15 REUs to evaluate their post-program research output. Almost half (7 out of 15) of the 2018 and 2019 REUs were able to attend scientific conferences and present their results, with interns being lead or co-author on 13 oral or poster presentations.
