 "awd_abstract_narration": "Crystalline basement rocks are rocks composed of crystalized minerals. These basement rocks formed early in the history of the Earth and are typically buried under younger rocks and sediment. These rocks are commonly viewed as impermeable with little or no water flowing through them.  However, faults or cracks in crystalline basement rocks can permit fluid flow. This study uses state-of-the-art instruments to image the subsurface at depths to nearly 10 km below the ground surface in New Mexico. The study examines if and when fluid flow occurs in basement rocks in a tectonically active region. The outcomes and understanding gained with this investigation can help quantify the age and amount of brackish water that resides within deep basement rocks in the western USA. This research is relevant to water resource managers and nuclear waste management agencies. The project includes training for both graduate and undergraduate students in the fields of hydrology and geophysics, supports an early-career faculty member, and supports a research team at a Hispanic-serving institution.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this project is to develop a novel framework to explore deep groundwater flow systems in extensional terrains by integrating fluid flow and transport models, magnetotelluric (MT) and time domain electromagnetic (TDEM) geophysical surveys, geochemical and isotopic tracers, temperature profile data, and outcrop-scale measurements of fracture apertures. Typically, hydrogeologists view the crystalline basement rocks as impermeable. On the other hand, geothermal explorationists acknowledge that discrete fault zones within the basement rocks can be permeable but little attention has been devoted to the source of the fluids feeding the fault zones. This study offers a compelling paradigm in which the crystalline basement in tectonically active regions can have a relatively high bulk permeability, serving as a major conveyor for water, solutes, and energy. Using the Rio Grande rift as a test bed, this project combines geophysical (electromagnetic), geochemical, and field observations with advanced numerical models to explore the flow and transport characteristics of these deep hydrologic systems to unprecedented depths. The outcomes and understanding gained with this effort will help quantify the volumes, salinity, residence times, and genesis of brackish water within deep aquifers in the western USA - an unconventional resource with the potential to offset the deficit of water and energy in arid environments. The project leverages infrastructure and equipment acquired as part of New Mexico EPSCoR Energize New Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nElectromagnetic Surveys were performed to image deep crystalline basement flow systems in extensional terrains, characterizing geothermal systems and brackish water resources. Temperature profiles indicated that temperature inversions are a steady-state phenomenon based on measurements in 1993 (others) and 2018 (this work), and, a novel 3-dimensional semi-analytical model was developed to explain the steady-state overturns assuming an upper and lower aquifer system with orthogonal flow. The magnetotelluric (MT) soundings were not only found useful to image geothermal systems, but also the distribution of brackish water resources. The first global estimate of continental brackish water was formulated in this work (5 x 106 km3) and is projected to be useful for future mapping of brackish water resources. The permeability of the crystalline basement was assessed and mathematical tools combining flow and transport models with magnetotelluric observations were developed. Multiphysics models for mountain-to-valley transitions resembling the study site were used as proof-of-concept for understanding the hierarchical nature of these hydrologic systems. Applications for the flow of water and transport of solutes and energy were refined from previous models to explore the potential of MT to characterize the multi-scale circulation using MARE2DEM. Field observations and modeling of the Tularosa and Jornada del Muerto Basins (new Mexico) reflected the general patterns of flow resistivity in 2-Dimensions and 3-Dimensions captured by the MT surveys. It is believed that the aquifer system is actively recharged through the crystalline basement having important implications for mountainfront recharge. The constraining bedrock fracture density and connectivity was investigated. Preliminary analysis suggests that active and fossil geothermal sites have the highest fracture density and the best connectivity compared to sites with no known geothermal activity. Fracture measurements for the Arroyo del Tajo area (23 sites east of Socorro, NM) and the Tinaja Arroyo (11 sites north of the main body) exhibited intense fracturing along with some fluorite-barite mineralization (west of the block hosting a fossil geothermal system), some fluorite, barite and galena mineralization (northeast) and uranium mineralization (northwest). Areas without mineralization generally exhibited fewer fractures and fracture intersections.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/28/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: AlanRBowers\n"
