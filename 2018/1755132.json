 "awd_abstract_narration": "Australian lyrebirds are the most accomplished mimics of all animals. Wild lyrebirds learn to sing near-perfect renditions of the calls of other birds and many other natural sounds, while lyrebirds that live near people are exact mimics of car alarms, chainsaws, and even camera shutters. Yet lyrebirds do not learn only from their environment; they also learn sounds from other lyrebirds. This ability to first learn and then produce a great variety of sounds has many parallels to the ways that humans learn language and other components of our cultures, making lyrebirds an excellent species on which to conduct experiments about the basics of cultural learning and information exchange that would be impossible with human subjects. The Cornell University scientists leading this project will study lyrebirds across their range in Australia to document their learning ability and track the learned components of their songs. The scientists will conduct a series of experiments in which they 'seed' a new song into a group of lyrebirds and track how it is passed from one lyrebird to another, to better understand what kinds of factors are important in cultural learning. They will also take advantage of a historical experiment using a population of lyrebirds that was introduced into Tasmania in the 1930s, tracking how these lyrebirds retained their original songs while learning new ones. The team will generate a variety of public outreach materials using videos of lyrebird displays, and engage groups of US college students through a summer research program.\r\n\r\nCultural evolution shapes the behavioral repertoires of many non-human animals, but the associated interactions among culture, genetics and ecological context remain poorly understood. Socially transmitted, multicomponent communication systems are of particular value for testing questions about the tempos and modes of cultural evolution. This project leverages the spectacular display behavior of a well-known vocal mimic, the superb lyrebird, to test a series of hypotheses about the tempos and modes of cultural evolution, using complementary comparative approaches and field-based experiments. Like humans, lyrebirds are excellent vocal mimics. In addition, they communicate using multi-component signals made up of both mimetic and non-mimetic song, and perform a complex dance display. Combined with limited dispersal and a large but patchy distribution, these attributes foster the development of diverse lyrebird 'cultures'. This project will first characterize geographic variation in audiovisual repertoires and compare this with genomic variation and divergence from local to metapopulation scales, accounting for ecological context. A temporal analysis of changes in acoustic displays, using archived recordings (1932-present), will complement the spatial analysis and strengthen conclusions regarding the tempo and mode of lyrebird cultural evolution. The project further capitalizes on a serendipitous experiment in which lyrebirds were introduced to an island (Tasmania) where they did not occur previously. Comparisons of lyrebird displays in translocated versus source population will be used to test the cultural lability of different display components. Finally, mechanisms of social transmission, and the cultural lability of lyrebird displays, will be tested directly using innovative field-based cultural transmission experiments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We used the complex displays of Australia's lyrebirds to help understand the evolution of cultural traits in the wild.</p>\r\n<p>Superb lyrebirds (<em>Menura novaehollandiae</em>), together with their sister species the Albert's lyrebird (<em>Menura alberti</em>), are large, ground dwelling songbirds found in the forests of eastern Australia. To attract mates, male lyrebirds perform elaborate song and dance displays including vocal mimicry of other species. We collected videos and audio recordings of lyrebird displays from throughout their natural range in south-eastern Australia; and from Tasmania, where lyrebirds were introduced in the 1930s and 1940s. We used these audio-visual data to investigate geographic variation in their song and dance displays. We combined our dataset with historical recordings to determine how lyrebird song and dance displays have changed over time.</p>\r\n<p>This NSF grant supported research on the form, function, and evolution of audio-visual displays in both male and female superb lyrebirds. We discovered that male superb lyrebirds not only mimic songs and calls to attract a mate, but during copulation and after failed courtship attempts males create an acoustic illusion of a flock of alarm-calling birds, in an apparent attempt to coerce females. We also demonstrated that, following copulation, males perform a unique, multimodal display. Furthermore, we found that females produce varied and highly accurate vocal mimicry, and that their mimicry varies depending on context.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, the project supported research into the form and geographic variation of displays in male Albert's lyrebirds. We showed that male&nbsp;lyrebirds 'compose' long complex songs created out of mimicked sounds 'sampled' from their environment, and that they share these songs with their neighbours. This research provides important new insights into the complex mechanisms underlying the cultural evolution of birdsong. Importantly, we also discovered that the size and complexity of male mimetic repertoires are threatened by habitat loss, likely due to reduced lyrebird population sizes in areas of fragmented habitat. Thus, our work suggests that animal cultural diversity may be impoverished by habitat loss and fragmentation in a similar way to genetic diversity. Variation in song diversity may therefore indicate population health and highlight populations in particular need of conservation action. Finally, we demonstrated the unique and remarkable way in which Albert's lyrebirds enhance their song and dance displays: by 'shaking' the vegetation that comprises their stage-like display platform in time with their song.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to the research outcomes, this grant facilitated collaborations between Cornell University and Western Sydney University in Australia, and provided intensive research training for two early career postdocs, three graduate students - including a Fulbright scholar, and thirteen undergraduate students. Many of our results have been published in peer-reviewed journal articles. Importantly, undergraduate students have led or co-authored research papers on lyrebirds, and been involved at all stages of the research process. We have shared our findings on lyrebirds in numerous podcasts, popular science articles, books for adults and children, radio interviews, and documentaries, including contributing to and appearing in the BBC documentary 'Attenborough's Wonder of Song' and the award-winning ABC documentary 'Wild Australia: After the Fires'.
