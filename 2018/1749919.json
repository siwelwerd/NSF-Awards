 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Jeremy Baskin from the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Cornell University to develop chemical probes to study biological signaling pathways vital to the health and well-being of members of society, that are mediated by the lipid phosphatidic acid. Lipids are water-repellant molecules that, in biological systems, can act as energy stores, major constituents of cellular membranes, and intracellular signaling molecules. In the latter capacity, signaling lipids such as phosphatidic acid function as second messengers that cause cells to change their metabolism, gene expression, and behavior in response to diverse extracellular stimuli. To elucidate how the locations within the cell where phosphatidic acid is produced relates to each different physiological outcome, it is critical to be able to visualize and perturb the production of this key signaling lipid. The proposed research describes chemical and biochemical tools to both report on and control phosphatidic acid synthesis, as well as their application to study an important signaling pathway thought to be under the control of this lipid. This research to gain a deeper understanding of the chemistry and biochemistry of lipids integrates with an educational plan that entails hands-on outreach activities on lipids and biomembranes targeted at underserved populations in middle and high school, to increase awareness of and interest in science in young women and underrepresented minority students.\r\n\r\nThe lipid second messenger phosphatidic acid can, depending on the context, stimulate protein kinases to cause cell growth and proliferation, polymerization of actin to promote cell migration, and vesicle budding to increase protein secretion. It remains a mystery how one lipid signal can cause such diverse physiological events. The main impediment to dissecting the varied functional consequences of phosphatidic acid is a lack of tools to visualize and modulate its production with spatiotemporal control. The research objectives of this proposal are to develop a chemical method to image intracellular sites of phosphatidic acid production within live cells, to develop a chemoenzymatic strategy to enable production of phosphatidic acid on demand at precise, subcellular locations within live cells, and to apply these tools to probe mechanistic questions about the role of phosphatidic acid at lysosomes in orchestrating cell growth pathways. This work will generate both new methodologies for studying lipid signaling and fundamental knowledge into how a single lipid signaling agent can direct precise cellular signaling outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

PA is an intracellular second messenger that controls numerous biological processes in eukaryotic cells, and it is also an important biosynthetic intermediate in phospholipid and triglyceride synthesis. To decipher all the different biological functions of PA, it is imperative to have tools capable of monitoring and perturbing this lipid with high spatial and temporal precision within live cells. This project developed two types of toolsets aimed at addressing these twin challenges, which serve as the primary elements of intellectual merit of the work resulting from this award.</p>\n<p>First, to monitor PA production with high precision, we developed a method called Imaging Phospholipase D Activity with Clickable Alcohols via Transphosphatidylation (IMPACT). Briefly, this approach involves a two-step cellular labeling protocol, where in the first step, cells are provided with a synthetic primary alcohol bearing a clickable, or bioorthogonal tag, and this alcohol is selectively used by phospholipase D (PLD) enzymes, which naturally produce PA by hydrolysis of other lipids, in a related type of reaction called transphosphatidylation, to produce clickable phosphatidyl alcohol lipids. In a second step, these clickable lipids are tagged using highly chemoselective click chemistry or bioorthogonal chemistry reactions with a fluorescent tag to enable their visualization by fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, or other analytical techniques. Several versions of IMPACT were developed, including those optimized for visualization at single-cell and subcellular levels. Numerous applications were demonstrated, including deciphering mechanisms of signaling by G protein-coupled receptors that activate PLDs, and elucidation of novel regulators of PLD signaling by the protein kinase C pathway using IMPACT in combination with genome-wide CRISPR screening.</p>\n<p>Second, to perturb PA production with high precision, this project developed optogenetic phospholipase D (optoPLD) enzymes. This tool comprises a microbial PLD that is expressed within mammalian cells as a fusion to a member of a light-activated heterodimerization pair. It is in the \"off\" state in the dark when it is in the cytosol, and it is recruited to an organelle membrane of interest using a mild pulse of blue light to switch to the \"on\" state, where it encounters its lipid substrates and rapidly produces pools of PA on the desired membrane. Directed evolution and protein engineering were used to substantially improve the performance of the original optoPLD by creating super-active PLDs (superPLDs), and the utility of optoPLDs and superPLDs was demonstrated for deciphering the role of PA pools on different membranes in numerous signaling pathways, including the Hippo, AMPK, and mTOR pathways.</p>\n<p>Collectively, these two toolsets and the applications that were demonstrated thus far speak to the utility of precise chemical biology toolsets for imaging and editing lipids on cellular membranes toward the goal of revealing new biological functions of different lipid species.</p>\n<p>The broader impacts of this proposal included several initiatives. First, a workshop called \"Beyond Bacon: Why Lipids are So Important\" was developed and delivered annually at Expanding Your Horizons, an all-day hands-on STEM educational event at Cornell University for female middle school students. A virtual, video version was created during the COVID-19 pandemic to increase the reach of the workshop, which both educated students about the importance of biological lipids and membranes. The in-person version of the workshop also provided opportunities to discuss the value of higher education in general and graduate education and scientific research in particular. The project also facilitated participation in the Cornell HHMI Accelerating Medical Progress through Scholarship (CHAMPS) program, where numerous undergraduate researchers from underrepresented backgrounds were incorporated into the PI?s research lab during summers and, in some instances, the school year as well. Collectively, the students reached by this proposal both in educational and research contexts will become part of the next generation of STEM leaders in our society.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/20/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jeremy&nbsp;M&nbsp;Baskin</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1749919/1749919_10548427_1694813159357_Fig1-IMPACT--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1749919/1749919_10548427_1694813159357_Fig1-IMPACT--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"IMPACT, a method for imaging phospholipase D activity in cells\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1749919/1749919_10548427_1694813159357_Fig1-IMPACT--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"IMPACT, a method for imaging phospholipase D activity in cells\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(A) Reactions catalyzed by phospholipase D.
