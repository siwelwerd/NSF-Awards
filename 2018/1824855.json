 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the improved safety and reduced cost of managing nuclear waste.  Current lightweight radiation shielding materials lack the required temperature stability.  New radiation shielding materials with better properties are needed to protect the health of biological, electrical, and structural systems in radioactive environments.  Radiation shielding improvements in the nuclear industry could result in upwards of one billion dollars in savings annually and result in lower electricity costs.  Commercialization of these advanced materials can also minimize the effects of disasters like Fukushima and reduce the costs of clean-up efforts.  Lightweight radiation shielding materials are also needed in airplanes and satellites to protect workers and electronic systems from cosmic radiation and for medical personnel working with radiation related treatments. \r\n \r\nThis I-Corps project is based on an innovative lightweight radiation shielding material that withstands operating temperatures nearly double those of commercially available products.  It has been demonstrated that the addition of carbon-based particles can more quickly move heat away from radioactive waste; this enables safer disposal options for the nuclear waste.  Additional technical merit lies in the fabrication process that has been developed to reduce the weight and size of the material.  It also enables the technology to be cost competitive with existing products while providing better shielding properties. The I-Corps investigation will determine the commercial potential for this material.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
