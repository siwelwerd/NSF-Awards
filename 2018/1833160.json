 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Anatolian Plate has been significantly modified by complex tectonic interactions among its surrounding plates. Studying the subsurface structures of the Anatolian Plate will provide a snapshot about how continental collision and subduction modify the lithosphere and its underlying asthenosphere. In addition, the interactions among these tectonic plates make Turkey one of the most seismically active regions in the world. There are several large fault zones, including the 1500 km North Anatolian Fault, which have generated large magnitude earthquakes and serious damage to the local community. In this project, the PI proposes to map seismic structures of the Anatolian Plate, which enable the investigators to test several scientific hypotheses, such as the behaviors of the North Anatolian Fault Zone and the magma chamber of volcanic fields. With the new seismic model, the team will simulate ground motions associated with a number of large magnitude earthquakes that may occur in Turkey. These predictions will provide valuable information for seismic hazard evaluation and mitigation, which will have significant social and economic impacts. This project will advance the development of a new geophysics group at UT Dallas by supporting an early career PI and one Ph.D. graduate student. Results from this project will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publications, presentations at national meetings, as well as an online tomographic model visualization platform.\r\n\r\nWith the support of this project, the PI's team will develop a new tomographic model for the Anatolian Plate, which includes 3-D variations in seismic velocities, azimuthal anisotropy and shear attenuation. Full waveform inversion, an advanced imaging technology which takes complicated wave physics into account, will be used to better extract quantitative information for the Earth's materials. By jointly interpreting velocities and azimuthal anisotropy, the team will test the following the following questions: (1) Is the North Anatolian Fault Zone a lithospheric or crustal scale transform fault? (2) Are there lower crust channel flows underneath the Anatolian Plate? (3) How do the mantle flows respond to the westward extrusion and counterclockwise rotation of the Anatolian Plate?  Furthermore, considering different sensitivities of attenuation and velocity to the physical states of the crustal and mantle materials, joint interpretation of these results will help to better delineate the morphology of magma chambers, and detect potential partial melt underneath the Central and Eastern Anatolian Volcanic Fields. Testing these scientific hypotheses will improve our knowledge on how continental collision and subduction modify the Anatolian lithosphere and asthenosphere.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
