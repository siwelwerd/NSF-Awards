 "awd_abstract_narration": "The past decade has witnessed a surge of intelligent systems capable of providing personalized user experiences in many aspects of modern life. Personalized adaptive systems such as personalized search, social media filtering, and e-commerce recommendation systems have demonstrated potentials to improve productivity and enjoyment. However, by catering to the immediate preferences on individuals and de-emphasizing collective needs, these systems also contributed to emergent social issues such as intellectual isolation. This project seeks to understand how to reduce the current blind spots in personalized adaptive systems and will directly address two key challenges in personalized adaptive systems: how to balance 1) short- and long-term needs/preferences and 2) needs of multiple individuals in a group. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, this project investigates how to increase and sustain physical activity using personalized adaptive systems for health. Two thirds of the adult population in the U.S. are affected by overweight and obesity, with sedentary behavior as a primary cause. In addition to address a public health issue, the technology developed in this project will advance theories in human behavior science. The empirical data generated from the planned system can shed light on the dynamic nature of people's social comparison process and reactions. To address the aforementioned challenges, the team will investigate novel participant modeling algorithms, specifically designed to model dynamic participant characteristics. Additionally, the research will contribute to the literature of experience management by developing algorithms that exploit those participant models to adapt interactive experiences to groups of users rather than individuals. The approach is innovative in bootstrapping design theory, algorithmic innovation, and health behavior science in a synergistic way to make scientific advancement.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

A main contributing factor to this problem is sedentary behavior. In this project, the research team investigated how to provide AI-based personalized digital environments to better motivate individuals for physical activities. Social comparison, a common psychological process, is known to motivate people to engage in physical activities. It has been widely used in social fitness apps through features such as &ldquo;leaderboards.&rdquo; However, contemporary social psychology theories indicate that these features only match the needs of a portion of the population, who are motivated by comparing themselves with people who do better than them. This project is among the first to investigate personalized social comparison environments automatically based on individual preferences. In particular, we investigated 1) how to detect which type of social comparison better motivates an individual and 2) how to automatically adapt digital environments to a group of people so they can be more active collectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #0e101a; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">This project resulted in several key contributions to the primary disciplines. First, the research team iteratively developed several novel applications, two web-based apps and one multiplayer game for health called &ldquo;Step Heroes&rdquo;, that personalized users&rsquo; social comparison environment to motivate physical activities. Each system advanced the science of user modeling, machine learning, and the design science of human-centered AI applications. Furthermore, these applications expanded the reach of AI personalization from individual to group users. As a result, we developed new machine learning techniques (Shapley Bandits) with built-in considerations of ethical principles such as fairness.
