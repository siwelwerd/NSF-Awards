 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently, researchers in the field of engineering have begun to turn toward understanding how an inclusive education model can help engineering programs increase the number of students that are retained and graduated from their undergraduate engineering programs.  Previous research studies have demonstrated that educators' beliefs about student abilities matter for student success. Research has also shown that effective teaching methods and learning environments can facilitate authentic learning experiences in which students are actively engage, seek deeper meaning, understanding, and real-life applications of the course material.  This has been linked to higher student test scores, retention, and graduation rates.  What has been investigated to a lesser extent is how the beliefs of faculty members influence teaching methods, learning environments, and teacher genuineness.  Some recent studies consider how faculty instructional choices and interactions transform engineering education environments into one that is more inclusive.  Characterizing the correlation between faculty members' belief regarding academic abilities and teaching methods, learning environment, and teacher genuineness can broaden our understanding of inclusive teaching practices within undergraduate engineering programs.\r\n\r\nThe study is grounded in the construct of fixed verse growth mindset as defined by Carol S. Dweck.  Individuals with a fixed mindset attribute intelligence to fixed traits and those with a growth mindset attribute intelligence to learning, effort, training, and practice.  Specifically, our research will explore the overall research question: How does the faculty mindset impact instructional practice, learning environments, and teacher authenticity? In this study, faculty mindset is defined as faculty views of student intelligence.  The study investigated how the way faculty views of student intelligence can foster a climate and culture of inclusivity and diversity.  Understanding these relationships can have implications in terms of identifying potential barriers to success of students from a variety of backgrounds, learning styles, and abilities.  This study will lay the foundation to inform improvements in engineering teaching and learning by broadening the engineering education research agenda to include growth mindsets that translate from engineering faculty to students.   This research will illuminate strategies to foster a climate and culture of inclusivity and diversity that will improve teaching and learning in engineering to positively impact all student populations, including those traditionally underrepresented in engineering.  The results of the study will produce recommendations for faculty, student support programs, and administrators who can directly implement new approaches to engineering pedagogy and learning strategies that improve academic achievement, engagement, and broadening participation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Inclusive education models in engineering programs are being studied by many researchers to increase these numbers.  Previous research studies have demonstrated that a growth mindset, effective instructional practice, and learning environments can support student success.  An extensive amount of research has also shown that effective instructional practice and learning environments can facilitate authentic learning experiences in which students are actively engaged, seek deeper meaning, understanding, and application of the course material.  This has been linked to higher student test scores, retention, and graduation rates.  What has been investigated to a lesser extent is how the mindset of the faculty influences the instructional practice, learning environment, and teacher authenticity and how these constructs support students from a variety of backgrounds, learning styles, and abilities.  Some recent studies applying expectancy value theory considered faculty motivations as an approach to transform engineering education environment one that is more inclusive.  Characterizing the correlation between faculty mindset and their instructional practice, the learning environment, and teacher authenticity can broaden our understanding of inclusive teaching practices within undergraduate engineering programs.  This study was grounded in mindset theory as defined by Carol S. Dweck.  We surveyed engineering faculty to understand the impact of engineering faculty mindset on these constructs in a way to foster a climate and culture of inclusivity and diversity.  Our study included a sample of engineering faculty currently working in colleges of engineering who responded to a quantitative survey.  The participants in the study included engineering faculty from 14 different and diverse institutions.  Our results provide an in-depth examination of faculty mindset and its contribution to the instructional practices of engineering faculty in the classroom.  Specifically, we connect the fixed mindset or growth mindset of engineering faculty to their teaching practices.\n\nOur research highlights several significant findings that add value to the literature for engineering education researchers and the education community, more broadly. The results of the study found that faculty members who identified as female had higher scores on growth mindset than faculty who identified as male.

We found statistically significant differences in the areas when the demographics of faculty were considered.  Our study suggests that administrators and faculty can and should work to create tools and training to reshape the beliefs that might have a negative effect on student success and engagement.  Significant findings related to this work provide strong cause for us to expand this research and include colleges of engineering that are larger in size and across varying regions of the country. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Fredericka D Brown"
