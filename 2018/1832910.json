 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical description of the project\r\nThe bottlenose dolphin is the most common marine mammal along the U.S. coastal states and is designated as a federally protected species under the Marine Mammals Protection Act (MMPA). As one of the apex predators and by having extensive lipid-rich blubber layers, the bottlenose dolphin is more susceptible to the bioaccumulation of lipid soluble marine contaminants. Many of these contaminants are endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and phthalates, that can adversely impact the female reproductive functions of marine mammals. Studies related to investigating the effect of marine contaminants on female bottlenose dolphin reproduction are dependent on recording whether a dolphin can be pregnant and produce a viable calf. However, it is difficult to monitor the specific impact of EDC's on the ovary and its related functions. The central objective of this research proposal is to use the cryopreservation and 3D microfluidic technologies to engineer the bottlenose dolphin ovarian function in vitro. The proposed research will allow the establishment of a high-throughput ovarian toxicity screening platform to determine the reproductive toxicity of marine contaminants on female bottlenose dolphins as well as other marine mammals.\r\n\r\nTechnical description of the project\r\nThe ovary is the primary female reproductive organ and contains follicles at various developmental stages. The follicle primarily functions to secrete sex steroid hormones and to support its enclosed germ cell oocyte for maturation, ovulation, and fertilization. The goal of the proposed research is to visit the host site at Oregon Health and Science University to learn ovarian tissue cryopreservation and the in vitro growth of follicles from large mammalian species. The first research objective of research one is to cryopreserve mouse ovarian follicles through vitrification for establishing a long-term follicle storage platform. The PI will culture follicles in vitro and examine the follicle reproductive outcomes to investigate the effect of vitrification on follicle and oocyte health and also determine the vitrification-induced cell injury. The second research objective is to cryopreserve bottlenose dolphin ovarian follicles and use microfluidic technology to engineer dolphin ovarian function in vitro. We will collect and cryopreserve ovaries from fresh-dead, stranded bottlenose dolphins, use the microfluidic platform to support a long-term dolphin follicle development and maturation, and validate this system by testing known ovarian toxic chemicals. The proposed work will allow the development of a high-throughput platform to study the female reproductive toxicity of marine contaminants on female bottlenose dolphins and enhance PI and his team's research ability in female reproductive toxicology in marine animals. The broader impact of this study will result in a platform that can be used for cryopreserving ovarian tissues and for other cell/tissue types.  Microfluidic culture will provide a novel method to three-dimensionally grow mammalian cells/tissues in vitro.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The awarded project supported Dr. Shuo Xiao, the project PI, and one of his trainees to visit Dr. Mary Zelinski&rsquo;s laboratory at the Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) to learn the ovarian tissue vitrification technique. All the proposed experiments have been successfully completed. The project outcomes are listed below: <strong>(1)</strong> Dr. Xiao and his trainee have visited Dr. Zelinksi&rsquo;s laboratory at OHSU in project year 1 and learn the vitrification technique and 3D in vitro ovarian follicle culture method. <strong>(2)</strong> In project year 2, Dr. Xiao and his team established the ovarian tissue vitrification platform in Dr. Xiao&rsquo;s home institute, the University of South Carolina; <strong>(3)</strong> Dr. Xiao and his team have demonstrated that the vitrified ovarian follicles had &gt;90% of survival rate and also exhibited comparable follicle and oocyte reproductive outcomes compared to freshly harvested follicles, including follicle survival, follicle growth and development, hormone secretion, and oocyte maturation and ovulation (Want et al, <em>Reproductive Toxicology</em>, 2020); <strong>(4)</strong> Dr. Xiao and his team have used the vitrification method to establish a high-content ovarian follicle biobank for the high-throughput ovarian follicle culture, compound exposure, and ovarian toxicity screening of both well-known endocrine disrupting chemicals (e.g. bisphenol A) and emerging environmental contaminants (harmful algal bloom toxins); <strong>(5)</strong> Dr. Xiao and his team have used the banked ovarian follicles and 3D in vitro ovarian follicle culture method to develop a tiered ovarian toxicity screening pipeline (Xu et al, <em>Toxicological Sciences</em>, 2020); <strong>(6)</strong> the vitrification and 3D ovarian follicle culture methods allows for the bottlenose dolphin ovarian tissue cryopreservation, in vitro or ex vivo culture, and reproductive toxicity testing, which allow us to study the impacts of marine contaminants on female bottlenose dolphins&rsquo; reproductive health and fertility. In addition to the above experimental results and publications, Dr. Xiao and his team have also published two review articles. The first review article summarized the literatures regarding the health impacts of environmental micro- and nano-plastics (Jiang et al, <em>Environmental Health and Preventive Medicine</em>, 2020) and&nbsp; the second article reviewed literatures studying the bioengineering models of female reproduction (Zubizarreta et al, <em>Bio-Design and Manufacturing, 2020</em>). In summary, these research data, experimental models, and published manuscripts can help us understand the impacts of environmental contaminants on female reproductive health and fertility for both humans and wildlife animals. Moreover, the developed ovarian tissue vitrification and cryopreservation method can allow us to establish a high-content ovarian tissue biobank for ovarian tissue culture, ovarian toxicity testing, and fertility preservation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/02/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Shuo&nbsp;Xiao</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1832910/1832910_10573412_1605619395187_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1832910/1832910_10573412_1605619395187_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Ovarian follicle vitrification procedure\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1832910/1832910_10573412_1605619395187_1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Ovarian follicle vitrification procedure\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Freshly harvested follicles will be sequentially equilibrated in the EDS vitrification solutions.
