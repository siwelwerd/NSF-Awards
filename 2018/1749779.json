 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atomization is the process that breaks apart a coherent liquid structure into small droplets and occurs in many engineering devices including fuel injection, fire suppression, and painting systems.  However, there is a current lack of knowledge on the physical processes that occur in an atomizing jet, which has impeded improvements to atomization systems.  Simulations of atomization have the potential to provide this knowledge, but have not been impactful due to the massive datasets produced and the challenges of extracting useful information.  This work will: 1) advance numerical methods allowing accurate simulations of more systems, 2) further the usefulness of simulations by extracting the physics of important processes, and 3) using new knowledge to developing physics-based models for use by engineers designing new atomization systems.\r\n\r\nAdvancing knowledge of atomization will be achieved with three research objectives.  The first will extend numerical method capabilities to predict the rupture of a liquid sheet using length and time scales based on physics and provide consistent and conservative transport of gas-liquid and fluid-solid interface. The second objective will make simulations results more useful by creating tools to extract atomization physics from massive datasets. The tools will compute statistics on the primary breakup instability and droplet ancestries that quantify how injected liquid breaks into small droplets. The third objective will develop physics-based reduced-order models using new knowledge on atomization. Additionally, an Atomizing Droplet Ancestry Database will be shared with other researchers developing atomization models. Overall, this work will provide a set of methods, tools, and knowledge that will allow engineers to build more precise atomizers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nAtomization is the process of liquid breaking up into droplets and occurs in many systems including fire sprinklers, painting systems, fuel injectors, breaking waves. Predicting these flows with high-fidelity simulations provides information on the atomization process to refine engineering designs and to understand physical processes. But, simulating a gas-liquid flow is challenging due the discontinuities that exist at the phase interface between the fluids. This project has advanced numerical methods that allow for accurate simulations of these flows. In particular work on simulating a class of atomizing sprays that contain electric charges that are relevant for automotive painting has been performed. Additionally, work has been done to improve the consistency of the numerical methods which increases accuracy and has the potential to reduce computational cost.\n\n\nThe simulations of atomization produced with these numerical methods contain a massive amount of data. There is so much data that analyzing it is a challenge. An accomplishment of this project is developing two techniques to extract useful information from these datasets. The first identifies the primary instability that leads to atomization. This instability controls the size of the initial droplets that are created and is a critical input to less expensive simulation that use reduced-order models. The second tool identifies the key breakup and coalescence events during the simulation, computes useful statistics on the event, and then stores the events in a graph database essentially creating a geneology of the atomization process. This geneology of the spray allows for the breakup process to be studied as a postprocessing step and is providing insights into the fundemental process of atomization.\n\n\nThis project has supported multiple outreach activities including yearly involvement in the week long MSU Explore Science Camp and MSU Science Day at Montana State University. The work has been published in 13 Journal or Juried Conference Papers.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/25/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MarkOwkes\n"
