 "awd_abstract_narration": "Just as electrical wires carry power to every room in our houses, cells have dedicated proteins carrying a current of electrons from reactions that generate electrons to vital reactions that require them.  This project addresses a newly-recognized class of 'electron transferring flavoproteins' (Etfs) that act as energy brokers, trading quantity for quality by accepting pairs of modest-energy electrons and concentrating their energy onto just one of the pair to produce one high-energy electron.  Crucially, this biochemical 'step-up station' makes it possible for cells to fix nitrogen gas from air to generate their own fertilizer, making food production possible where it otherwise would not be.  The project seeks to understand HOW these Etfs accomplish this complex process. The research seeks to learn what is special about the site at which energy is reallocated among the two electrons by studying the molecule on which this happens (this flavin is a derivative of the riboflavin vitamin B2).  The research also seeks to identify safety mechanisms built into the protein scaffold that allow such demanding transformations to occur within a benign, non-toxic protein.  Thus the work aims to articulate the underlying principles of the process, so that they can be designed into human-made devices and materials, to increase our ability to use solar power and boost the efficiency and versatility with which we use electrical energy in general.  Flavins are just one example of many plant pigments that present powerful chemical properties along with glorious colors.  The project scientists share their enthusiasm for pigments via a series of workshops and a course on plant pigments, fibers and fragrances in which participants create a fiber art project using natural materials while learning about the chemical principles underlying plant colors.  This creative chemistry course gives all participants a chance to design experiments and integrate science and art.\r\n\r\nA long-familiar family of proteins has recently been found to have a surprising capacity to re-allocate energy among pairs of electrons acquired from NADH, yielding one with more reducing power than the NADH source (electron transfer bifurcation, or 'bifurcation').  This research establishes which of the two flavins plays which of the contrasting roles identified in the newly-purified bifurcating electron transferring flavoprotein (Etf), and then seeks to understand what aspects of the protein environment are responsible for each of the different activities (conventional electron transfer vs. bifurcation).  Spectroelectrochemical titrations measure the extent to which individual amino acids change the flavin reduction potentials (Eo) in proteins bearing amino acid substitutions, and spectroscopic studies elucidate changes in flavin covalent bonding, hydrogen bonding and protonation states, mapping out the active site's role in producing bifurcating activity.  Residues to be targeted include a cysteine common to all the Etfs associated with nitrogen fixation but not conserved in others.  Thus the research may reveal the protein context needed in order to exploit flavins' capacity for this reactivity while suppressing side-effects.  The objective is to elucidate principles underlying the versatility and efficiency of bifurcation, for implementation beyond biochemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Indeed, this ETF permits solar-driven nitrogen fixation, thus allowing bacteria to produce fertilizer for crop production, but without the enormous energy cost associated with industrial fertilizer production. The ETF contains two flavin molecules that play complementary roles. We determined which flavin plays which role, based on quantum calculations as well as mutagenesis and biophysical characterizations. We investigated the two flavins' different responses to light, and showed that one, at least, can use the energy of light to produce very powerful chemicals able to donate high-energy electrons. We also found that a particular one of the two flavins has a side reaction that can change its chemical nature over time, and needs to be taken into account as we consider how this system works. The modification may even improve performance. This modified flavin seems to interact with the second flavin to produce a remarkable signal at very long wavelengths. This signal remains enigmatic, and ongoing research seeks to learn what produces it. However, we now know that one of the two participating flavins is chemically modified, and not the same as the flavins familiar in other enzymes.

Because its hallmark is commitment of the two electrons to two separate paths, the process is called electron bifurcation. &nbsp;We characterized the protein environment that surrounds the bifurcating flavin, to learn how it causes the second electron to have such an outsized fraction of the total energy of the pair. In particular, we focused on an amino acid that would be predicted to have the opposite effect from what is observed. Normally, a nearby positive charge should stabilize the flavin intermediate retaining only one electron, but in this site that intermediate is very unstable. We demonstrated that a positively charged amino acid is indeed required for the flavin to function. However, the significance of this amino acid is much larger. In its absence the flavin does not even bind to the protein, and even a smaller fragment of the flavin is absent. This can explain why this particular amino acid has been retained over more than 2 billion years of ETF evolution. Based on our experiments, including colourful optical spectra, we are now able to propose that the positively charged amino acid reaches from one domain of the protein across to the other, stabilizing binding of flavin (or fragments) at the interface between domains and holding the ETF together.
