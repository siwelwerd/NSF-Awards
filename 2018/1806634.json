 "awd_abstract_narration": "The direct detection of gravitational waves emitted by a coalescing binary black hole system by the LIGO detectors in 2015 marked the beginning of gravitational wave astronomy. The detection of gravitational waves from a coalescing binary neutron star system coincident with a gamma ray burst, with follow-up observations by traditional telescopes, demonstrated the power of multimessenger astronomy and the potential it holds. To continue making these discoveries, improvements to the sensitivity of existing gravitational wave observatories must be made, and the physics that will make the next generation of detectors possible must be developed. Quantum fluctuations of the laser fields used to measure gravitational waves will limit Advanced LIGO's sensitivity across most of its frequency bandwidth once it reaches design sensitivity. This project is focused on reducing the limitation of that quantum noise by exploiting the coupling of light to mechanical motion.\r\n\r\nThis project combines several of the key components that will make the next generation of detectors possible. Optical experiments will be conducted with microfabricated mechanical resonators with masses on the order of 100 nanograms. Specifically, the group will study the interaction of non-classical, or squeezed, states of light in an optomechanical cavity that is limited by both radiation pressure and shot noise in a broad frequency bandwidth, as Advanced LIGO is expected to be once it reaches design sensitivity. In order to achieve this goal, AlGaAs mirrors will be cryogenically cooled and placed in a high finesse optical cavity. Cryogenic operation will allow the Standard Quantum Limit to be approached, or even surpassed. At that sensitivity, these devices are good candidates for employing optomechanical interactions in filter cavities. Optomechanical filter cavities manipulate the coupling between radiation pressure and the mechanical degrees of freedom of the system to produce certain effects in light passing through the cavity. In principle, these filter cavities may be used to condition squeezed states of light to produce a frequency dependence suitable for injection to gravitational wave interferometers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle dictates that more precise measurements of one observable (such as position) will result in imprecise measurements of a complementary observable (such as momentum). Applied to the continuous detection of the position of a particle, this leads to a quantum back action noise. This effect is increasingly important in gravitational wave detectors, where it is usually referred to as quantum radiation pressure noise, as they employ higher laser power to reduce shot noise. This project supported a series of optomechanical experiments designed to demonstrate and to manipulate the effects of quantum radiation pressure on a microfabricated mechanical resonator. The resonator used has a diameter similar to a single human hair, and a mass of about 50 nanograms, but was carefully designed to have thermal vibrations of its position that are smaller than the achievable quantum radiation pressure fluctuations. \n\n\n  \n\n\nThe microresonator was placed in a high finesse optical cavity, and was operated at room temperature. The effects of quantum radiation pressure noise were directly observed as the largest noise in the system in a milestone result. Several methods of reducing the impact of the radiation pressure noise were demonstrated: the injection of a special state of light, called amplitude squeezed light, and an alternative readout that exploited correlations between the shot noise and radiation pressure noise to achieve cancellation of the latter. These methods could be employed in any experiment limited by quantum radiation pressure noise, such as gravitational wave detectors. These results reflect the strengths of the design of the microresonator &ndash; to have as flexible a support cantilever as possible. The thin support is one of the key features that allows for the low thermal noise performance.   \n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/28/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas R Corbitt"
