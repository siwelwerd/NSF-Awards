 "awd_abstract_narration": "Climate is the strongest influence on biological diversity in space and time. However, there are multiple aspect to climate (e.g., rainfall, temperature, seasonality) and how they interact to determine the number of different species living in a region is not well understood. The main objective of this research project is to achieve a better understanding of how and why climate interacts with other influences to shape the species diversity of natural plant communities. This information is important to improving our capacity to forecast how plant diversity is likely to change in the future. The researcher will review and synthesize 20 years of experimental and observational work on plant diversity in the California Floristic Province, to provide an overarching understanding of the mechanisms that shape biodiversity, from local to global scales. The project will also make useful data sets publicly available and will support efforts to educate land managers and the public about plant diversity. \r\n\r\nThe focus of this synthesis will be to better understand how climate shapes patterns of plant diversity at multiple levels (species, functional, phylogenetic) and spatial scales (local to biome), alone or in interaction with other factors (soils, fire, herbivores, invasions). Topics to be explored include why Mediterranean climates host high plant diversity, how plant diversity will change under future climate, and whether plant functional traits can be used to test the tolerance hypothesis for climate-diversity relationships. Products of this synthesis will include several review papers on underexplored aspects of the climate-diversity relationships, data publications presenting three multisite and multiyear plant community and environmental data sets, and a monograph on plant diversity for the Princeton series.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe major scientific goal of this project was to synthesize my and others' work on how plant diversity is shaped by climate.  Our most significant result was that plant diversity tends to decline in response to a drier climate.  This was true over time, where the climate became effectively drier due to warming and to altered precipitation patterns; and also in space, along a geographic gradient of increased aridity.  Strikingly, we found this pattern to be true at multiple levels of plant diversity:  taxonomic (numbers of species), functional (variety of plant traits), and phylogenetic (numbers of evolutionary lineages of plants).   This conclusion was supported by a literature review as well as by our own analyses.  Our work resulted in 2 review papers, 3 original data papers, and 3 published datasets.   Also, one of the datasets was incorporated into an international consortium of long-term vegetation data, and this consortium has produced 4 multi-dataset papers.\n\nIn addition to publishing several multi-site, multi-year datasets on plant communities and plant functional traits, the main goal for broader impacts was to contribute to training and mentoring.  During her time supported by this award, the principal postdoctoral scholar (Marina LaForgia) attended professional meetings, wrote two successful fellowship proposals, networked with other plant ecologists, gained experience in teaching and mentoring, engaged in outreach through her leadership in conservation and restoration associations, and continued expanding her quantitative skill set. She has now begun a tenure-track position at Sacramento State University.   Mentored by this postdoc as well as me, a PhD student (Rebecca Nelson) learned valuable informatics and analytic skills, including how to curate, update, and use long-term datasets.  Two other postdocs (Jesse Miller and Daijiang Lee), not funded by this award, collaborated with us and gained valuable experience and first-authored publications that helped one of them (Lee) to attain a tenure-track job (Louisiana State University).\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/29/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Susan P Harrison"
