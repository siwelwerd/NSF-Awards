 "awd_abstract_narration": "Helicity is an inherent fluid flow property that physically relates to the local streamlines of a flow having helical-shaped structure. In the application of wind energy, a wind turbine can induce non-zero helicity in its turbulent wake. The speed of this wake flow has a strong impact on the power produced by a downstream turbine in a wind farm. This project will examine the effect of manipulating wake helicity generated by a vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT) on the development of wake turbulence. In particular, the relationship between helicity and the turbulent entrainment of kinetic energy, which is critical to wake flow speed recovery, will be a primary focus. The project is a collaborative effort that exploits field, laboratory, and computational facilities using state-of-the-art equipment and novel methodologies to overcome the challenges of investigating highly turbulent flows. The project will also encompass education activities, such as involving undergraduate student researchers, facilitated by an emphasis on the connection between the fundamental physics of fluids and wind energy applications.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this three-year project is to develop an understanding of the effect of helicity on the development of free-shear turbulence in high Reynolds number flows. A VAWT is employed as a 'helicity generator', where initial helicity in the turbine wake is controlled by turbine blade geometry and rotational speed, and the subsequent evolution of the turbulent wake is examined. Key components of this collaborative research effort will include: (1) field experiments to quantify wake helicity for utility-scale VAWTs in an atmospheric boundary layer flow using 3D particle tracking velocimetry, (2) wind tunnel experiments to achieve high spatio-temporal data of the VAWT wake using time-resolved stereoscopic particle image velocimetry, and (3) large eddy simulations to efficiently probe the effects of helicity by means not easily measured in the experiments. This combined effort offers an opportunity to investigate the physical effects of helicity at high Reynolds number, which contributes to basic fluid dynamics knowledge that could be used to inform turbulence models or more directly in applications such as wind farming.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nVertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs) have great potential for applications in local communities due to their relatively small footprints, insensitivity to wind direction, and easy maintenance.  Among various existing VAWT designs, the straight-bladed VAWTs have been studied and deployed more frequently due to their relatively simple blade geometry.  The helical-bladed VAWTs have attracted increasing attention in recent years, but the effects of their helical-shaped blades on the turbine wake flows have not been well understood.\n\nThe project aimed at developing computational tool to address the aforementioned question. The large-eddy simulation (LES) method combined with the actuator-line model (ALM) of VAWT was utilized to model the wind-VAWT interaction and the development of the turbulent wake flow.  The effects of blade geometry on the wake characteristics of single VAWT were explored based on urban- and utility-scale VAWTs, which operate at different tip-speed ratios (TSRs).  At the urban scale, small 5-blade helical and straight VAWTs were considered, which rotate at relatively low TSRs of about 0.4-0.6 at the wind speeds of 7-13 m/s.  At the utility scale, helical- and straight-bladed VAWTs based on a commercial VAWT design were considered, which are composed of 3 blades and rotate at a higher TSR of 1.19 at the wind speed of about 11-12 m/s.  At low TSRs, the wakes behind straight-bladed VAWTs were found to expand primarily in the spanwise direction due to the quasi-2D vortex shedding effect from the straight blades; in contrast, helical-bladed VAWTs were found to generate highly 3D wake flow structures to produce a relatively narrow wake with faster decay of turbulent intensity.  At high TSRs, helical-bladed VAWTs were found to cause vertical tilting of the wake and affect the turbulent entrainments of kinetic energy from the surrounding wind into the wake region, leading to faster wake wind speed recovery than the corresponding straight-bladed VAWTs.\n\nIn order to investigate the effects of blade geometry in large wind farm environments, the LES-ALM model has been further optimized to be able to simulate large arrays of independently rotating VAWTs.  Using the improved LES model, large arrays of utility-scale helical- and straight-bladed VAWTs with coarse, intermediate and tight spacings were studied.  Statistical analysis of the LES data showed that using the helical-bladed VAWTs may improve the mean value and reduce the temporal oscillation of the VAWT power coefficient.  The helical-bladed design may also help reduce the fatigue load on the VAWT structure by reducing the temporal oscillation of the spanwise bending moment relative to the base of the VAWT.\n\nThis project has created training and research opportunities for 8 graduate students (including 4 PhD students) and 4 undergraduate students at University of Houston.  A total of 3 journal paper manuscripts (1 published, and 2 reviewed and revision invited) were produced, and 7 conference presentations were given by the principal investigator and the graduate/undergraduate students.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/29/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Di Yang"
