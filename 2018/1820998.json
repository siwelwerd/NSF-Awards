 "awd_abstract_narration": "Preparing to Teach Mathematics with Technology - Examining Student Practice (PTMT - ESP) is an IUSE Development and Implementation project. It will address the documented need for undergraduate prospective secondary mathematics teachers (PSMTs) to possess strong technological pedagogical content knowledge needed to incorporate technology-based mathematics tasks in their future classrooms. Engaging students in meaningful mathematical tasks and capitalizing on available technological tools has been shown to improve attitudes towards mathematics and increase learning. Whether or not the use of technology will enhance students' learning depends on teachers' decisions when using technology tools to design and implement meaningful tasks. These decisions are informed by teachers' knowledge and application of mathematics, technology, and pedagogy. PTMT - ESP will develop and research a set of video case materials to support PSMTs' development of this knowledge. Furthermore, this project will grow and support a community of technology-using mathematics teacher-educators at other universities through professional learning workshops and the distribution of materials on a free web-based portal. Strong preparation of secondary mathematics teachers is needed to support future generations of students prepared to enter STEM fields. Ensuring teachers are prepared to anticipate and draw upon students' understanding in technological contexts by improving their use of technology tools in mathematics classroom will better prepare students to pursue STEM careers, in support of the national interest.  \r\n \r\nPTMT-ESP is a collaborative project across four institutions that will build on the theoretical foundations of technological pedagogical content knowledge, video case pedagogies, and professional noticing, along with the success of previous PTMT projects (DUE &#8203;0442319, 0817253, 1123001)&#8203;. The PTMT-ESP project will utilize design-based research to create, refine and study video-enhanced materials for PSMTs to examine secondary students' authentic mathematical practices on technology-based algebraic tasks. Three objectives provide a framework for the project's activities. First is the design and refinement of seven curriculum modules for undergraduate mathematics education students to examine secondary students' mathematical practices when engaging with technology-based algebra tasks. Second is the execution of a research study to examine PSMTs' development related to understandings of secondary students' technology-based algebraic practices and their own algebraic knowledge. Third is the expansion of support for existing teacher educator communities through professional learning opportunities. The research that corresponds with the creation of the project's learning materials aims to advance knowledge about how examining authentic secondary students' mathematical practices on technology-based algebraic tasks can support prospective secondary mathematics teachers' development of technological pedagogical content knowledge.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
