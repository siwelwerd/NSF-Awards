 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chen Huang of Florida State University is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Division of Chemistry to develop new theoretical and computational methods for investigating the electronic properties of large, complex molecules and materials. The ability to model large systems at the electronic level is essential for the industrial and technological design of molecules and materials for clean energy, efficient batteries, and novel data storage devices. However, it is challenging to investigate large systems with the most accurate electronic structure methods, since computational cost grows exponentially with system size. Dr. Huang and his group are developing new quantum mechanical embedding methods for determining the electronic properties of large systems in a divide-and-conquer manner. The methods are focused on accurately describing the microscopic interactions among electrons---their quantum correlations---at scale. Finding new ways to address this \"electron correlation problem\" is regarded as one of the grand challenges of 21st century science. Dr. Huang's new algorithms and methods will be implemented in state-of-the-art, open source quantum chemistry codes and made available to the broader research community. Integrated with his research, Dr. Huang is training a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students from engineering, chemistry, physics, and materials science to effectively utilize electronic structure methods, through a new problems-based density functional theory (DFT) course. The course lectures and YouTube tutorials are aimed at lowering the barrier for students to integrate DFT simulations within their research. Working with outreach programs at FSU, Dr. Huang is involving middle school and high school students in his research to increase their interest in pursuing STEM careers.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop new quantum mechanical embedding methods to obtain accurate reaction energies and electronic structures that scale to large chemical systems. The basic idea of embedding methods is to utilize a high-level electronic structure method within a region of interest, and to treat the rest of the system (\"the environment\") with a low-level, computationally-efficient method. Dr. Huang and his group are extending embedding methods in three new directions: (i) generalizing density-matrix embedding to metallic systems using a pseudopotential-like approach; (ii) extending the XCPP (exchange-correlation potential patching) methodology to construct RPA (random phase approximation) correlation energies and potentials in large systems in an atom-by-atom manner; and (iii) accelerating the convergence of RPA energy differences calculated with a stochastic sampling scheme by imposing appropriate moment constraints. The new techniques are being applied to challenging problems of significant fundamental and technological interest, including investigating the role of metallic copper in methanol synthesis; charge transfer and magnetic coupling at YBa2Cu3O7/La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 (superconducting/ferromagnetic) interface; and transport, storage, and release of oxygen in ceria for heterogeneous catalysis. The methodologies are being implemented as open source code in the ABINIT, Psi4, and CP2K quantum chemistry packages. The educational plan is focused on developing a problems-based DFT course including YouTube tutorials, to enable students to develop expertise in this widely-used tool of contemporary molecular and materials modeling.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Supported by this NSF Award, the PI's group has developed several new methods to achieve reliable KS-DFT simulations in large systems. The first method is the embedded cluster density approximation (ECDA), which is a local correlation method designed for scaling up accurate KS-DFT simulations. This is achieved through a divide-and-conquer approach, in which the electronic correlation of each atom is determined based on the nearby electron density, as illustrated for the propylene molecule in the figure. ECDA is a nearly black-box method that can be applied to systems with various bond types. The second method aims to accelerate the convergence of stochastic quantum chemistry methods, which are limited by the central limit theorem and have slow convergence with respect to the number of samplings. This new method focused on calculating the energy difference between two systems, a very common task in practice, and shows that the convergence can be greatly accelerated using the correlated sampling technique. It proved effective in accelerating reaction energy calculations, achieving a maximum acceleration of four times. The third method, called spatial mixing of model potentials (SMMP), aims to produce reliable exchange-correlation (XC) potentials, a crucial term in KS-DFT that fully determines the electronic properties of systems. The XC potentials are constructed by properly mixing two model potentials in real space, with the mixing parameter determined by the constraint that the electron density changes linearly as the number of electrons changes between two adjacent integers. The mixing parameter for the ethylene molecule is illustrated in the figure. SMMP is fully first-principle and is expected to be found useful for studying the electronic structures of many challenging systems with unpaired charge carriers, such as mixed-valence systems, radicals, and polarons. These systems are often encountered in various applications, such as solar cells, batteries, and catalysis.</p>\n<p><br />On the educational aspect, the PI developed a graduate-level, problem-based DFT course to teach graduate students at the Florida State University (FSU) about DFT.
