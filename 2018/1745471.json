 "awd_abstract_narration": "Elizabeth Rush Mueller plans to produce a creative nonfiction book that explores ice loss in Antarctica and its impact on those who devote their lives to better understanding this phenomenon. She will immerse herself in the Thwaites Glacier fieldwork in early 2019.  She will produce a collection of essays that bear witness to the changes physically transforming Antarctica and relay how those changes impact the polar scientists at the forefront of this research.  Additionally, upon returning from Antarctica, she will design and teach a new Advanced Creative Nonfiction Writing Workshop based on her Antarctic experience to help students develop the skills necessary to communicate science to a broader public. \r\n\r\nThe International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC) is the largest joint US-UK project undertaken on the southern continent in 70 years.  Mueller will deploy on the R/V Nathaniel B. Palmer Thwaites cruise, January-March 2019, which will afford her the opportunity to observe and interview scientists and better understand the field work of this major research effort and communicate its story to the public.  Mueller's goal is to document not just the physical transformations reshaping the Thwaites Glacier, but also the emotional, physical, spiritual and personal impact on those who are endeavoring to better understand these changes.  Her unique perspective, focus and style will provide a distinctive addition to the Antarctic Artists and Writers portfolio. It is anticipated that her dispatches, essays, and articles from her Antarctic experience will receive significant attention. Her book will be published by Milkweed Editions and her articles, by magazines such as Orion.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Palmer to the Thwaites Glacier in West Antarctica. As part of International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration, a five-year effort to gather data that will create more accurate models of sea-level rise rates for the coming century, she joined scientists from around the world as they set out to gain a more holistic understanding of this key glacial system. Unlike East Antarctica, where the ice sheets tend to ride on solid ground, much of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet rests on land that lays up to two kilometers below sea level, making the system inherently unstable and runaway ice sheet collapse a possibility. Thwaites is the choke-point, holding much of the ice sheet in place. But the toe-hold it has on the solid earth--also known as the glacier's grounding line--recently began to recede. If Thwaites goes, it could take the whole of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet with it, rising sea levels as much as twelve feet.</p>\n<p>And yet for many people in the world beyond the Antarctic scientific community the threats that Thwaites poses remain abstract in part because they are often communicated using complex climate change models that are difficult for the lay-person to understand. For this reason, Ms. Rush sought to centralize the emotional and practical responses those aboard the Palmer have to their own work, thus ideally lessening the perceived distance between future readers and that far away continent where game-changing geological transformation is ongoing.</p>\n<p>While aboard the Palmer she recorded and transcribed 193 interviews with her fellow shipmates. Ms. Rush spoke to all different members of her floating community including the scientists studying Thwaites, crew members, kitchen staff, and marine technicians. She shot thousands of photographs, a handful of minute-long videos, and filled ten notebooks with hand-written observations. In each of her personal interviews she explored a set of questions that invited those on the ship to reflect on the ways in which their lived experience of glacial retreat shapes their lives on land. She asked: How does what is happening in Antarctica influence the decisions you make back home? Has your work on glacial collapse shaped your reproductive choices? How and in what ways? When you imagine your homeplace in 50, 100, 200 years what do you see? How has your vision of the future changed the more you learn about Thwaites?</p>\n<p>In order to better understand the methodology that goes into Antarctic field work, Ms. Rush labored alongside each of the scientific teams onboard. She used plastic spoons to scoop thousand-year-old mud into tiny plastic bags so that paleo-climatologists might get a sense of just how quickly Thwaites retreated in the past. She dug pits on remote islands and searched for ancient penguin bones so that another team of scientists might better calculate how this quickly land rebounded after the most-recent glacial retreat. She poured seawater from the seafloor into Nalgene bottles and tested its relative salinity so that a handful of physical oceanographers might better calculate just how much warm water is working its way under Thwaites today. In short, she rolled up her sleeves, got her hands dirty, and in the process gained a much keener understanding of the science taking place on board the Palmer and the skills--both physical and emotional--needed to work in such remote and harsh conditions. Not only will the data collected as a result of these activities make future climate models more accurate, Ms. Rush's work will help to communicate these findings and their potential impact on the fate of our coastal communities and, more generally, human civilization as we know it.</p>\n<p>Since returning, Ms. Rush has begun a draft of her creative nonfiction book tentatively titled, <em>The Mother of All Things</em>.
