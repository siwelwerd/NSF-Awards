 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative project involving both NWRA and Hampton University supports a study of atmospheric dynamics within the region of the Earth's atmosphere that is not accessible by low Earth orbiting satellites or by balloons. Air that is associated with the wind flow over mountainous terrain is disturbed by a class of 'primary' atmospheric gravity waves (GWs) that is called 'mountains waves' (MWs). These waves break or reach critical levels in the lower or middle atmosphere at altitudes below 70 km. This process not only creates small-scale secondary GWs with horizontal wavelengths considerably less than that of the MWs, but also creates horizontal 'body forces' (i.e., horizontal accelerations localized in space and time). These in turn are thought to excite a broad spectrum of secondary GWs with horizontal wavelengths larger than that of the MWs. The main objective of the research is to quantify to the extent possible the effect that secondary and tertiary GWs from MW attenuation has on the thermosphere (the neutral atmosphere above 200 km) via this multi-step coupling process. The research includes a unique combination of detailed, targeted modeling combined with data analyses studies. A graduate student associated with Hampton University would participate in the research work described.\r\n\r\nSeveral different simulations would be used in sequence to simulate the entire process. Data from the Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) satellite would be analyzed to extract GWs parameters observed for specific regions on Earth, and the simulations will be compared to these satellite observations. The project will involve applying these results to the study of MWs to investigate the extent to which secondary and tertiary waves that affect the thermosphere are produced. The research if successful should significantly advance the research community's understanding of the process of momentum transfer from orographic forcing to the thermosphere via GWs in this multi-step coupling process. This research is expected to lead to a much better appreciation of the variability and structure of the thermosphere from these processes (i.e., space weather from below) thus helping to achieve a significant broader impact because a predictive capability might possibly be developed for such thermospheric wave structures were this momentum transfer process be understood much more completely as a result of research work represented by this award.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nAtmospheric gravity waves (GWs) are waves that are created in the Earth's atmosphere. They are created by thunderstorms, tornadoes, wind blowing over mountains, volcanoes, and by the polar night jet in the stratosphere. Once created, they move upward higher and higher into the Earth's atmosphere. As they do, their amplitudes get larger and larger until eventually they break, similar to how an ocean wave breaks just before it hits land. After they break, they deposit momentum and energy into the atmosphere over a small localized region. (Here, the momentum of a car is its mass times its velocity, and its energy is 1/2 times its mass times its velocity squared). That deposition accelerates the atmosphere in that small region, thereby causing the air there to create another set of so-called \"secondary\" GWs; half of these secondary GWs travel upward, and half travel downward. This shows the first 2 steps of the so-called \"multi-step vertical coupling\" (MSVC) and is the process by which momentum and energy within waves travels from near the ground to the F region in the ionosphere (which begins approximately 180 km=112 miles above the surface of the Earth). The GWs generated in the third or higher step(s) are called tertiary or \"higher-order\" GWs.\n\nWe saw this 3-step process occur over the Southern Andes, South America, during the wintertime, both in data (including satellite data) as well as in model simulations. In that case, the GWs in the thermosphere (from altitudes of 90 to 500 km above the Earth's surface) were tertiary GWs and had ring-like structures. We also saw this 3-step process occur over Europe during a polar vortex jet event during January 2016. In that case, we showed that GWs are generated by the gradient of the wind in th polar vortex jet, that these GWs break and dissipate, that secondary GWs are generated, and that these secondary GWs break and dissipate at altitudes of 70-110 km above the Earth's surface. We then found that tertiary or higher-order GWs are generated, many of which propagate throughout the thermosphere. As these GWs interact with the ions in the ionosphere, they \"push\" the ions along the Earth's magnetic field, thereby creating waves in the ionosphere called traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs). These TIDs have been seen when observing the TEC, which is the integrated number of electrons between the Earth and a GPS satellite at a given location. Most of these electrons are in the F region. We found good agreement between the simulated TIDs and the observed TIDs.\n\nFinally, we saw this 2-step process occur after the Tonga volcanic eruption in January 2022. We simulated the event with 3 separate models (MESORAC, HIAMCM and SAMI3), and found that the secondary GWs and TIDs agreed well with satellite and other data. Therefore, we have shown through this project that MSVC is very important for understanding and modeling/predicting the waves in the thermosphere and ionosphere.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/06/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: SharonLVadas\n"
