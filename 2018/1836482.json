 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum communication offers the tantalizing possibility of sending secure messages over long distances.  However, developing materials that can act as the central information carriers, the \"bits\" in quantum communication, is difficult. One strategy for creating quantum bits, or \"qubits\", is to combine the quantum mechanical properties of light with molecules, or plasmonic nanoparticles. With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry and Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods Programs in the Division of Chemistry, Professor David Masiello of the University of Washington and Professor Randall Goldsmith of the University of Wisconsin Madison are developing ways to force repeated interaction between light and molecular or nanoparticle quantum emitters, enabling them to act as qubits. The research discoveries could have broad implications for emerging quantum-based technologies, including quantum computing and quantum communication.  The project is also providing interdisciplinary training at the graduate and undergraduate levels at the intersection between optics, photonics, quantum information, and nanomaterial fields, as well as public outreach activities demonstrating the importance of photonics (the interaction of light and matter) and quantum information.    \r\n \r\nWorking with their students, Professors Masiello and Goldsmith create small disk-shaped structures called toroidal microresonators decorated with molecules or nanoparticles.  Light injected into the disk undergoes total internal reflection, causing it to propagate almost endlessly around the periphery of the disk with very little loss. As it moves around the disk, it interacts with molecules or nanoparticles placed on its surface, enabling the structure to maintain strong coupling between a variety of molecular and nanomaterial quantum absorbers.  The project, which contains a strong interplay between theory and experiment, focuses on production and manipulation of states that demonstrate Dicke superradiance. Characterization of new coupled states is achieved by microresonator photothermal spectroscopy and photoluminescence, with experimental observation being understood in the context of an underlying theory that describes the state evolution and relevant dissipation processes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProfessor Randall Goldsmith at the University of Wisconsin Madison and this team performed investigations into new ways to use photonic devices, devices that control or later the properties of light, to mediate that way quantum objections can communicate with each other.  A key element was collaboration with Professor David Masiello, a theorist at the University of Washington, to produce a joint theory-experimental investigation.  Our main objects of study consisted of plasmonic gold nanoparticles, where the plasmon refers to the collective oscillation of the mobile electrons in the gold, and whispering gallery mode microresonators, devices that confine light for large amounts of time in a microscopic space.\n\nThe first major project outcome concerns our ability to extract key mechanistic details from coupled plasmonic-photonic systems.  A major advance was to combine absorption spectroscopy with the ability to collect and spectroscopically analyze photons elastically scattered from a free space beam into the microresonator via interaction with the nanoparticle, and then collected by a fiber optic.  By fitting the absorption spectra and the scattering spectra simultaneously, we were able to build and then apply a theoretical framework that allowed us to extract quantitative values for all of the rate processes describing the coupled system, Figure 1.  The new availability of this framework means that researchers can use this model system and technique to engineer a fully characterizable coupled photonic-plasmonic system.  This work was featured on the cover of Nano Letters, Figure 2.    \n\nThe second major project outcome concerns our ability to add a degree of control to the interactions investigated above.  We switched to a microbubble system, where we can control the nature of the solvent, and thus the dielectric environment, inside of the microbubble.  By replacing the air with chloroform, we can substantially alter the nature of the hybridization between the photonic and plasmonic modes.  Simulations largely reflect our ability to control the coupling strengths.  A manuscript describing these results is in in preparation. \n\nTaken together, we have invented new ways to ascertain and control the details of coupling between plasmonic and photonic systems.    \n\nThis project principally supported one PhD student and provided additional support to two other PhD students.  The interdisciplinary nature of the research has provided a substantial number of training opportunities.  On the instrumentation side, students learned microscope building and maintenance skills, photonics skills, and electronics and optics.  On the theory side, the student learned about plasmonics, numerical simulations, and the mathematical physics surrounding plasmonic nanosystems.\n\nSupported students participated in the PEOPLE (Pre-college Enrichment Opportunity Program for Learning Excellence) program where they taught, co-taught, or helped with preparation of science lessons for low-income or STEM under-represented high school students.  Supported students worked on a module that focuses on binary number system and its importance for designing computers.  Supported students also participated in a single-molecule demo for the WISCIENCE STEM immersion program.
