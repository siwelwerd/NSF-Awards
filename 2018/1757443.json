 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Northeastern University, located in Boston, MA, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2018- 2020. Undergraduates will participate in team-based interdisciplinary research across biological levels while exploring related research questions from different perspectives. While each participant will have a specific project with a mentor, participants will work in pairs with pairs of faculty advisors and other lab members. This program will encourage both scientific inquiry and professional development, promoting a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of life and also preparing students for advancement in research. Research project topics will be diverse (e.g., skin regeneration, microbial biofilm formation, social immunity,  mitochondrial DNA inheritance, termite-mammalian fungal interactions). Student growth will be fostered by mentored group meetings as well as expert-led interactive sessions to improve leadership abilities and performance in research teams. Additional enrichment will include workshops on graduate studies, career opportunities, ethics and responsible conduct of research, and seminars exploring interdisciplinary themes. Each participant will present a poster of the individual project at a summer research symposium.\r\n \r\nIt is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Among the target populations will be returning veterans and reservists enrolled in undergraduate STEM programs, and students underrepresented in the sciences including first generation college students and underrepresented minorities. Students will learn how research is conducted, and will be encouraged to present the results of their work at scientific conferences.\r\n \r\nA common web-based assessment tool used by all REU Site programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program is available by visiting http://www.northeastern.edu/cos/biology/undergraduate/reu-site/, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Wendy Smith at W.Smith@northeastern.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Rebeca Rosengaus at r.rosengaus@northeastern.edu).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The current grant supported 33 REU students, as well as one post-baccalaureate student for a full year as a REPS supplement to our award.</p>\n<p>The overarching goal of our program was to increase the numbers of students who pursue research careers, particularly from groups underrepresented in science, including minorities and first-generation college students. To enhance participation by students who might otherwise not have access to intensive research experiences, we prioritized admitting students from institutions that lacked doctoral research programs. Students were mentored in planning and conducting intensive research projects accompanied by associated training in research ethics and other aspects of professional development. A special aspect of our program was teamwork in science, with teams consisting of pairs of PI's, each with one REU student and a designated graduate student near-peer mentor. The teams examined interrelated projects from different perspectives, promoting a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of research in the life sciences, while also providing a close relationship of each participant with their individual labs and related teams. As a Biology department, the available range of topics and model organisms was broad. Research organisms ranged from bacteria to salamanders, with research topics including novel approaches to discovering microbial defense strategies; investigation of relationships between mitochondria and stem cell function; and exploration of the neural and genetic pathways responsible for regulation of regeneration, motility and aging. Students developed hypotheses and outlined formal research strategies articulated in short peer-reviewed proposals and, at the end of the program, presented their work in a poster session for all interested campus members. Enrichment sessions were provided weekly; in addition to training in responsible conduct of research, sessions included teamwork and leadership with an expert from our Engineering Leadership Institute, scientific writing, and poster and oral presentation skills. Enrichment sessions also included panels on applying to graduate school led by current doctoral students, and on careers in biology led by local professionals ranging from biotechnology to science communication. Weekly seminars were presented by Northeastern researchers in informal settings that encouraged deeper discusson of science and of research careers. Students were housed in new dorms on campus, and to the extent possible we made sure rooms were clustered to enhance interactions not just among research teams but the entire group. A yearly field trip to our Marine Science Center in Nahant offered new research perspectives and an opportunity to enjoy the beach.&nbsp;Optional weekend activities included exploration of Boston's many museums and parks, and kayaking on the Charles River.</p>\n<p>Over 80% of our participants were from non-doctoral-degree-granting institutions.

Of the remaining three-quarters of our alumni, over a third are currently enrolled or have been accepted to PhD programs, a third are working as lab researchers at universities or teaching hospitals, and a quarter are enrolled or have been accepted to medical or dental school. We also have one JD alumna planning a career in environmental law.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our participants' work was disseminated widely, including student presentations at local or national meetings (23 such presentations in all) including 13 presentations at the national CUR/REU conference.
