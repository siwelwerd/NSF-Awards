 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an IUSE: EHR Exploration and Design Tier for Engaged Student Learning project that seeks to provide robust learning experiences in physical science for non-science majors, specifically pre-service elementary teacher majors.  The specific aims are to: 1) increase pre-service elementary teachers' physical science content knowledge; 2) increase their science-related pedagogy knowledge; and 3) change the teaching practices and approaches used by instructors of physical science undergraduate courses for non-science majors. If this approach is successful, then teachers who received this education will be better positioned to engage their elementary students in rich learning activities. Furthermore, this curriculum has the potential to be used beyond pre-service elementary teachers, extending to all undergraduate non-science majors and contributing to a more scientifically literate populace.\r\n\r\nUsing a Design-Based Research approach, this project will examine the successful model of the Making Sense of Science (MSS) professional learning courses for K-8 teachers to identify key elements that led to success. Using MSS and a situated learning framework, the project will design, develop, and deliver a non-major physical science content course. This course will be designed with appropriate pedagogical techniques and integrated with mathematics and literacy.  The aim is that this course will deepen the science content knowledge and science pedagogy knowledge of pre-service elementary teachers, so they will be better prepared to enter their future classrooms. The project intends to employ a convergent-parallel mixed methods approach to compare a treatment group (students in the new course) to a control group (students in the traditional course). This design includes quantitative instruments that explore changes in the science and science pedagogy understandings of the pre-service teachers. The qualitative component of the study integrates data from interviews, artifacts, and participant observations, along with the use of focus groups. The results of this project have the potential to advance understanding of how to improve science teaching and learning in higher education, providing a knowledge base upon which others can build.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
