 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants. This Innovations in Development project will develop and test a model for audience assessment that STEM professionals can use during their public engagement efforts.  These on-the-spot assessments will allow scientists to monitor audience understanding and use this to make immediate improvements to their activity.  This project fills a critical gap in the field of public science communication as expressed by outreach scientists and by the professional and academic organizations that train them.    Project partners include The Astronomical Society of the Pacific, Oregon State University, Pacific Science Center, and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory.\r\n \r\nResearch questions include: (1) How and under what conditions can scientists, regardless of discipline, learn to build assessment into outreach activities?  (2) To what degree are scientists willing and able to change their outreach activities to include assessment to ascertain audience attentiveness or understanding?  (3)  To what degree will scientists be able to adjust their outreach and engagement efforts based on audience feedback, and what support do they need to do so?  (4) With constraints on their time and resources, how can the model help scientists conduct audience assessment on their own?  (5)  Are audience members finding events more enjoyable and fruitful that use assessment techniques?    Several iterative rounds of R&D will be used in the spiral design-based approach.  A group of Design Testers will start each of the iterative cycles for the initial development and testing techniques, associated training, and support.  Later phases will use Field Testers using a rubric for usability, validity, and reliability of various strategies.  The summative evaluation of the project will begin early and add data over the life of the project.  A mixed methods approach will be used including surveys of scientists once each year after they have participated in the Prototype training.  Descriptive and inferential statistics will be used to document the extent to which the project has achieved its intended outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Specifically, the OTSF project gives scientists tactics to use during outreach events that spark audience interest while simultaneously revealing what people are thinking so immediate improvements can be made to the engagement. For example, after misunderstandings are revealed, scientists can address audience confusion by facilitating a hands-on activity, adjusting their lecture, or introducing a new demonstration. The Astronomical Society of the Pacific (ASP), Oregon State University (OSU), the Institute for Learning Innovations (ILI), and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) collaborated to design and deliver the professional development for scientists, create resources and materials, and conduct research on the impact of the project on scientists' public outreach practices.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The project's </span><strong>intellectual merit</strong><span> are the contributions made to informal STEM evaluation theory and design, reflective practice, and the use of embedded assessment to monitor learning.

(2) To what degree are scientists willing and able to change their public engagement activities to include some form of assessment to ascertain audience attentiveness or understanding? (3) To what degree will scientists adjust their engagement efforts based on audience feedback, and what support do they need to do so? (4) With constraints on their time and resources, how can scientists learn to get audience feedback on their own? Using iterative design-based research, the team worked with scientists across numerous disciplines and locations to create, field test, and investigate a variety of audience feedback tactics. The result was the development of a cyclical approach to public engagement in which scientists solicit and collect audience feedback, reflect on audience understanding in the moment, adjust activities and presentations immediately, observe the results, and reflect on improving practice after the event. The </span><strong>broader impact</strong><span> of the OTSF project is an increase in the quality and quantity of public discourse and engagement facilitated by scientists, leading to the strengthening of public trust, understanding, and appreciation for STEM.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Because the OTSF project was carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic, the professional development provided to scientists was delivered online. Moreover, because venues typically used for public events were closed during the pandemic, scientists delivered their engagement events online as well.

Scientists adjusted their events to be more responsive, indicating a shift away from didactic presentations to engaging and responsive science events. Scientists reported giving attention to audience-driven interests, the use of props and models, and individualized attention to audience participants when possible.
