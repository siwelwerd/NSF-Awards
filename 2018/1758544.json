 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is aimed to develop and commercialize an extendable/retractable telescopic structural wall for flood protection. This technology will enable more resilient infrastructure in flood-prone areas.  Coastal cities and riverine communities are vulnerable to flooding hazards. These population centers tend to be located near bodies of water, and finding the space to accommodate increasing populations, as well as hazard-resilient infrastructure, represents a challenge for city officials and the engineering community in general.  The commercial opportunity of the technology lies on the increasing worldwide need for flood protection. In fact, the World Bank estimates that 50 billion dollars a year will be spent worldwide in measures to mitigate this hazard. In U.S. only, floods are considered one of the costliest and deadliest natural hazards with an estimated 7.9 billion dollars in damages and 82 fatalities per year. This technology, when developed, will provide a paradigm shift for the prefabricated concrete industry. It will also develop and validate new methods for telescopic interconnection of structural elements.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in a unique concept where structural boxes, made out of fiber reinforced concrete, can be deployed telescopically to withstand forces imposed from external sources, and then return to a retracted position. In Phase I, the feasibility of the concept was demonstrated by the ability of specimens to withstand the forces from three flooding scenarios representative of the targeted market sector: riverine, storm-surges and tsunamis. The Phase II project will focus on assessing the technical features of the walls based on lead-off customer sites. These will include the height of the walls, type of soil, and the hazard assessment, among others technical factors. Studies will be conducted on the local and overall structural response of the walls and the functionality of their mechanical components. Analytical and numerical models will be built and validated with tests on specific components and on full-scale models. The full-scale specimens will be subjected to storm-surges, hurricane, tsunami, slow-rising waters, and impacting debris forces. Robust theoretical framework along with analytical and numerical models and design guidelines will be built to reliably scale and replicate the technology for virtually any site where flood protection is needed.",

This NSF SBIR Phase II project helped the company go from feasibility of the entire system, to a fully functional structural prototype of the Telescopic Structural Flood Walls (TSFW) -- precast Ultra-High-Performance Concrete (UHPC) walls with extension and retraction capabilities. The aspects that represent the intellectual merit of the system were conceived, analyzed and tested. A rapid prototyping approach was initially taken to produce small-scale physical models to prove scalability of designs. This includes the designs of the molds, along with the design of the molding/unmolding process. A full-size prototype was then designed and built using easy-to-machine materials such as PVC (See Fig. 1). This proved to be a great strategy for prototyping UHPC physical models. This full-size prototype is fully functional from the standpoint of the mechanical functionalities being developed. One of the unforeseen outcomes of the project was the need to develop specialized equipment for the testing of some of the individual subassemblies without the need of constructing a full TSFW assembly. This is the case of the Lifting and Retracting Testing Unit (LRTU) (See Fig. 2). The LRTU gave the ability to test virtually any telescopic interconnection. It is equipped with sensors to measure displacement as well as tension and compression forces. Critical aspects of the mechanics of the telescopic motion at the interconnection were studied and understood thanks to the LRTU. Non-UHPC prototypes and analysis of individual subassemblies led the company to conceive, design and built a dimensionally-reliable UHPC final prototype (See Fig. 3). One of the main outcomes was that this UHPC physical prototype served as the final test for critical aspects of the design, manufacturing, and functionality of the electro-mechanical components, as well as for the molding, mixing, placing and unmolding process of the UHPC structural components (See Fig. 4). The theoretical framework subsequently developed was supported by numerical models of individual constitutive components, as well as analytical models of entire structural and mechanical subassemblies. The main outcomes of these models were grouped in the following key aspects that fulfilled the intellectual merit of the project:</p>\n<p><strong>Study of structural elements and mechanical components at the interconnection between deployable boxes.</strong> The structural element in charge of transferring the forces at any given stage of the extension and retraction of the TSFW is known as the interconnection block. Analytical models were developed to characterize the motion of the block in each of those stages. Several internal mechanisms that provide the TSFW with extension and retraction capabilities were conceived, designed, implemented and tested. Analytical and numerical models of these components yielded designs where deformations and stresses were such that linear-elastic behavior of the mechanisms is expected. &nbsp;An optimization process of some of these components was carried out, yielding a critical outcome of de-coupling the structural behavior from the mechanical behavior. This was reached by implementing a strategy where none of the internal mechanisms was carrying any loads from the TSFW when operating as a structural element in both, the extended and retracted position.</p>\n<p><strong>Functionality of seals.</strong> Two types of seals were identified, the box-to-box (BTB) seals and the wall-to-wall (WTW) seals. Both are basically comprised of bulb seals that press against each other upon extension of the structural deployable boxes. One of the key outcomes was a set of analytical models developed to couple a large number of geometric parameters that are needed to characterize the structural response and mechanical functionality of the TSFW, and the compressibility and buckling limitations of the bulb seals.</p>\n<p><strong>Initial investigation of lifespan.</strong> Several extension and retraction cycles were carried out with no failure of any of the UHPC structural assemblies, nor of any of the non-UHPC mechanical subassemblies. One of the main outcomes was the fact that the use of conventional materials (such as steel, aluminum or similar) for the mechanical subassemblies and embedded components produced designs that may be considered overconservative. This opened the door of contemplating other types of materials that may lead to the optimization of such mechanical subassemblies and embedded components by using manufacturing processes that enable a mass-production approach.</p>\n<p><strong>Implementation of algorithms for the semi-automation of the designs. </strong>One of the main outcomes is the implementation of the analytical models into a Coordinate-Based Algorithm (CBA). It refers to an algorithm to run analytical-geometry models that use a global set of coordinates to yield the coordinates of a specific subassembly within the TSFW, and the coordinates needed to characterize the design of a part or subassembly. In doing so, the design of critical mechanical subassemblies and the structural geometry of the TSFW are now coupled, with a set of parameters and instructions clearly defined, such that the implementation of semi-automated design of the entire TSFW is enabled.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/20/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jorge&nbsp;Cueto</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1758544/1758544_10529887_1657803430926_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1758544/1758544_10529887_1657803430926_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1758544/1758544_10529887_1657803430926_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">UHPC Prototype</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Smart Walls Construction, LLC</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jorge&nbsp;Cueto</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fig. 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1758544/1758544_10529887_1657803382964_Fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1758544/1758544_10529887_1657803382964_Fig2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1758544/1758544_10529887_1657803382964_Fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">LRTU</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Smart Walls Construction, LLC</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jorge&nbsp;Cueto</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fig. 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1758544/1758544_10529887_1657803485307_Fig4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1758544/1758544_10529887_1657803485307_Fig4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1758544/1758544_10529887_1657803485307_Fig4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Molding, Casting, Pouring of UHPC</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Smart Walls Construction, LLC</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jorge&nbsp;Cueto</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fig. 4</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1758544/1758544_10529887_1657803327568_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1758544/1758544_10529887_1657803327568_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1758544/1758544_10529887_1657803327568_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">PVC Prototype</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Smart Walls Construction, LLC</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jorge&nbsp;Cueto</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fig. 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
