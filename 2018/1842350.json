 "awd_abstract_narration": "Single-photon emission at low-loss telecom C-band wavelength ~ 1550 nm is a critical component for the development of future long-distance quantum information and communication technologies using the existing fiber-optical-based infrastructure or in free-space. Recent attempts at realizing a telecom C-band single-photon source are limited by their unsuitable emission wavelength, and stringent fabrication and operation temperature requirements. This EAGER project proposes to develop critical device properties enabled by the development of erbium-doped silicon carbide photonic crystal nanostructures towards the realization for the first-time of room-temperature CMOS-compatible single-photon emitters at 1550 nm. The nanowire-array-based photonic crystal structures are grown in a self-aligned manner at predetermined positions through an innovative chemical synthesis route. The nanostructures not only facilitate the deterministic placement of erbium ions in the nanowires but are also pivotal in engineering the erbium-induced 1550 nm emission. The underlying hypothesis is that erbium integrated into photonic crystal nanostructures can experience a redistribution of its spontaneous light emission. By properly engineering photonic crystal nanostructures it is possible to control which optical modes are allowed or inhibited due to the photonic bandgap effect. The proposed scalable nanostructure platform provides high design adaptability, tunability, and integration capabilities with silicon nanoelectronics. The attained knowledge can be transformative as this project addresses key challenges and unknowns about the material and quantum properties of erbium ions in technologically-friendly silicon carbide photonic nanostructures. The fundamental understanding of these photonic nanostructures can expedite the incubation of pathways towards ubiquitous advances in nanophotonics, defect-based biological imaging and sensing, quantum storage of single-photons and long-distance quantum signal processing. Research and education are integrated as this project focuses on promoting scientific literacy through direct students' involvement in the proposed research. Students conducting this research will be trained and educated in a multifaceted research environment.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to surpass the performance of state-of-the-art telecom quantum emission in solid-state hosts by integrating erbium ions into silicon carbide ultrathin photonic crystal nanostructures. The project involves fundamental research in developing vital properties, such as high precision placement and reduced non-radiative decay of erbium ions in silicon-based nanostructured materials, high pumping efficiency, photoluminescence yield, and photostability, enabled by this new class of silicon carbide photonic nanostructures, and the understanding of their interactions with external optical excitations. Two interlocked hypothesis-based research thrusts will be pursued: (a) Development of novel silicon carbide photonic crystal nanostructures through the deterministic placement of nanowires and erbium ions, and (b) Modification of the telecom-1540 nm emission of erbium ions by silicon carbide photonic nanostructures. The effects of erbium ion implantation (e.g., ion dose, incident angles) on the structural modifications (e.g., defect accumulation, ion redistribution) of nanowires will be explored to achieve single erbium ion isolation. Simulated statistical-distributions of the implanted ions and the structural properties of erbium-doped nanowire-based structures will be correlated with their optical characteristics to develop optimal ion implantation conditions to maximize the efficiency of erbium-induced 1540 nm emission. Theory and modeling will be employed to navigate experimental efforts and to engineeringly modify the erbium quantum luminescence properties, and light-matter interactions that are enabled by the photonic crystal nanostructures.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
