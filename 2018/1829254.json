 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Texas Tech University (TTU), through a National Science Foundation I-Corps Site (Site) award, promotes the growth of innovative ideas into commercially viable products in the South Plains of Texas and Eastern New Mexico.\r\n\r\nInnovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.\r\n\r\nThe TTU Site promotes, encourages, mentors, and catalyzes the translation of research with commercial potential. Focus areas include healthcare, natural resources such as food, fiber, and energy, including cybersecurity, which are all major components of the local economy. The TTU Site accelerates successful licensing and business formation of productized technologies. The TTU Site grows the existing ecosystem by also offering entrepreneurial curricula to students, faculty and the community while deepening the awareness of commercialization practices through the Business Model Canvas and Lean Startup methodologies. Finally, the TTU Site strengthens innovation locally, regionally, and in collaboration with the national NSF I-Corps network to grow the quality and quantity of teams in the pursuit of commercialization, validation, and startup creation. The TTU Mentors program supplies the teams with qualified and motivated mentors to assist in a broad range of business activities, including: marketing, intellectual property law, sales, product development, accounting, finance, and human resources. The TTU Site benefits the local and state economies through the economic development gains achieved by students, faculty and the community as they start new businesses. In addition, TTU serves a large and growing Hispanic population (approx. 27% of the student body), as well as many veterans.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Sling Health teams further participate in the regional I-Corps program to validate their problem statements and focus on product development.\nThe Faculty C-Startup program awards grants to faculty ?ambassadors? to develop new courses or enhance existing ones using the Business Model Canvas and Lean LaunchPad methodologies. This program supports faculty across all disciplines program and has fostered a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship across TTU.\n\n\n 3.     Recognition and Awards:\n\nThe Faculty C-Startup program received the      \"Most Innovative Program Award\" at the International Business      Innovation Association meeting in 2023.\nTexas Tech University currently has 35      faculty ambassadors promoting innovation and entrepreneurship across      disciplines.\n\n\n 4.     Virtual \"Partner\" Training Program (VPTP):\n\nA supplemental award allowed the      development of the VPTP, creating a virtual video library on Business      Model Canvas principles.\nThe VPTP provides valuable resources to faculty      ambassadors, I-Corps teams, and other Innovation Hub program participants.\n\n\n 5.     Funding and Investment:\n\nI-Corps Site teams were supported in      applying for NSF I-Corps Teams grant and internal award competitions like      the TTU Accelerator, Prototype Fund, and Presidents' Innovative Startup      Award.\nTotal additional funds invested by Texas      Tech University for the 29 National teams recommended from the Site      program exceeded $450,000.\nOverall funds invested in all Texas Tech      University System (TTUS) National teams surpassed $1 Million.\n\n\n The NSF I-Corps Site grant at Texas Tech University has successfully cultivated an entrepreneurial culture, provided training and resources to researchers, and facilitated the commercialization of innovative technologies.
