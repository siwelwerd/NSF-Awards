 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research development workshop will be held April 6-8, 2018 in New Haven, CT, focused on improving sustainability engineering methods and tools for use in healthcare delivery. This workshop will bring together experts from environmental and industrial engineering, materials science, clinical care, public health and policy, health care administration, and health economics, to identify knowledge gaps and develop a strategic action plan to fill these gaps in addressing one of the grand challenges of healthcare environmental sustainability: balancing patient safety with waste reduction and pollution prevention. An aim is to discover synergies that arise from combining different approaches and various perspectives to address this challenge. The workshop will describe the scope of evidence-based information, identify gaps, and development research priorities in order to produce information/tools to support clinicians/healthcare administrators in efforts to reduce health care pollution and waste. The workshop intends to develop a strategic action plan for sustainability in healthcare which identifies critical research needs and the obstacles and opportunities in safely addressing the resource consumption of medical and clinical care. \r\n\r\nThe impetus for this workshop lies in the excessive waste and resource use of current US healthcare services. Through the systems lens provided by sustainability engineering, researchers have begun to quantify material use and environmental emissions from medicine, yet the broadening of these quantification studies and their translation into clinical practice have been slow in developing. This workshop will (1) bring together interdisciplinary researchers to help reinforce ongoing and forge new research connections to tackle healthcare sustainability in an actionable way, and (2) develop strategies to develop, test, and implement clinically-relevant sustainability interventions, so that the actual footprint and resource-use of medicine will be minimized.",

Climate change resulting from greenhouse gas emissions has been named the number one public health issue of the 21st century. Ironically, the health care sector, itself, is a major emitter of environmental pollutants that adversely affect human health, with the US healthcare sector emitting 10% of the nation&rsquo;s greenhouse gases and 9% of air pollutants. Researchers and clinicians have begun studying various aspects of healthcare activities and resulting emissions, to help identify and prioritize mitigation strategies. The Workshop enabled participants to reflect on this new field and to develop a comprehensive strategy to lead and encourage its value and expansion.</p>\n<p>The recommendations made by Workshop participants focus on three aims: Research, Implementation and Evaluation, and Education. The research aims are the most substantial, with focus on mapping all existing literature on clinical sustainability, developing a framework of evaluation, and identifying priority research areas for future study. Some research gaps include certain &ldquo;levels&rdquo; of healthcare services, including at the hospital or facility-wide level and in certain clinical specialties. The principles of Circular Economy need to be reframed for healthcare services to minimize and redirect healthcare waste streams from linear life cycles. In order to conduct this work effectively, improved research tools are needed, which may include healthcare-specific life cycle inventory databases and utilizing existing health management systems (including electronic health records) for use in sustainability assessments. In addition, as clinical sustainability is a new field, the workshop participants discussed ways of improving publishing and funding opportunities.</p>\n<p>In terms of implementation and evaluation, the workshop participants discussed ways of framing sustainability research for optimal clinical equipoise, so that the work can help inform and change clinical practice starting with the framing of the research questions. The participants supported integrating sustainability into existing healthcare reporting metrics, rather than creating separate metrics. Moving forward with this research requires integrating the avoidance of waste and pollution into infection control ideology at the facility and national levels. Workshop participants also agreed that sustainability studies should be integrated with quality and value paradigms already present in medicine, creating a comprehensive &ldquo;triple bottom line&rdquo; evaluation framework.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Workshop participants discussed the continuing need for education in healthcare sustainability. Interdisciplinary partnerships and learning are absolutely crucial for this research. To implement effective changes in the medical system, research results need to be framed and communicated for specific audiences (whether healthcare leadership, clinicians, or sustainability engineers) and this requires cross-disciplinary learning. To ask the right questions and actually modify clinical practice, the existing and incoming clinical workforce needs to be aware of healthcare-specific sustainability issues and the public health consequences of various pollutants. Such training could be accomplished through seminars or courses on sustainability or efficiency during medical training, or conference presentations and continuing education units targeting these topics. Likewise, engineering and sustainability science students need to be aware of the many opportunities to use their skillsets for improving the medical sector, whether by instrument design and manufacturing or by the design of health services and medical facilities.</p>\n<p>This workshop enabled a detailed review of the state of clinical sustainability research, as well as in depth discussions on the direction of this important field. Participants in this workshop created a strong bond and renewed focus on environmental sustainability issues in medicine. We expect to see many more collaborations as a result, ranging from basic Life Cycle Assessments of clinical practice to a proposed Commission focused exclusively on improving sustainability and efficiency in global medical care.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/13/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Cassandra&nbsp;L&nbsp;Thiel</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1818038/1818038_10528304_1530635114065_IMG_5127--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1818038/1818038_10528304_1530635114065_IMG_5127--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Speaker Anthony Costello\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1818038/1818038_10528304_1530635114065_IMG_5127--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Speaker Anthony Costello\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Dr. Anthony Costello gives a keynote presentation at the Workshop for Environmental Sustainability in Clinical Care</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Garrett Sendlewski</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Cassandra&nbsp;L&nbsp;Thiel</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Speaker Anthony Costello</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1818038/1818038_10528304_1530635683126_IMG_5316--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1818038/1818038_10528304_1530635683126_IMG_5316--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Breakout\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1818038/1818038_10528304_1530635683126_IMG_5316--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Breakout\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Participants in the Workshop for Environmental Sustainability in Clinical Care report and summarize their thoughts after a breakout discussion session.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Garrett Sendlewski</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Cassandra&nbsp;L&nbsp;Thiel</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Breakout</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1818038/1818038_10528304_1530636177148_IMG_5278--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1818038/1818038_10528304_1530636177148_IMG_5278--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Steering Committee\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1818038/1818038_10528304_1530636177148_IMG_5278--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Steering Committee\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Steering Committee Members of the Workshop for Environmental Sustainability in Clinical Care (from left: Dr. Melissa Bilec, Dr. Harriett Hopf, Dr. Cassandra Thiel, Dr. Jodi Sherman, Dr. Robert Dubrow, Dr. Matthew Eckelman.
