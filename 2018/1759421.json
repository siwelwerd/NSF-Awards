 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project tackles the urgent need to encourage and support young, African American women to pursue studies and careers in computer science (CS). The researchers will design year-long activities that include workshops and an online peer learning community to immerse 120 female African American high school students from Alabama in computing content and career awareness. The program begins with an intense summer experience that prepares students for the College Board's Advanced Placement CS Principles (CSP) course. Online and face-to-face interactions continue throughout the academic year, and students will learn advanced computing concepts through culturally-responsive instruction, project-based learning, and by connecting new learning experiences to their personal lives and career aspirations. African American women constitute a mere 3% of the computing workforce. The project's learning communities are designed to address the challenges faced in helping young women of color realize their potential for participation in computer science and other STEM-related occupations. This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase student motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM).\r\n\r\nThe research questions examine how participation in the program: (1) increases self-efficacy and competency with computer science; (2) improves attitudes towards computer science and lead to academic choices to strengthen their proficiency; (3) raises awareness and desires to pursue computer science careers, and; (4) reduces social and cultural barriers that might reduce students' likelihood of pursuing CS and related professions. Findings from this research will be disseminated through journal and conference publications, presentations, and social media to benefit the national computer science education community. The generated knowledge and research will illuminate factors central to promoting interest in computer science among young women of color from rural and other settings and cultivating their persistence in pursuing computer science and related STEM careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Residential summer institutes at the University of Alabama (UA) and Tuskegee University (TU) immersed students in inquiry-based, collaborative, and culturally-responsive project-based AP CSP activities facilitated by four highly experienced Black women (Teacher Leaders [TLs] from AL). The TLs mentored the students as they explored the AP CSP Big Ideas, acquired core Computational Thinking Practices and worked on their AP CSP portfolio projects (Create Performance Tasks [PTs]). Intertwined with its academic activities, LEGACY created a peer community of Black young women AP CSP learners. Social media (e.g., texting groups) maintained this network through the academic year, as students completed the AP CSP course in their home high schools. During the academic year, students participated in five study sessions on various AP CSP topics and also virtually met with the four TLs six times. The study sessions and TL webinars continued the student collaboration while participating across the whole state geography. A culminating event each year brought each cohort back for an NCWIT Aspirations award ceremony where the previous cohort inspired the next cohort who was just arriving for their first summer experience. Interactions with Black women computer science (CS) professionals added to the role modeling opportunities for the LEGACY students, building their identification with CS and CS career awareness. Students in need also received resources (e.g., loaned laptops, AP CSP exam fee) to mitigate barriers that often hinder talents from historically underrepresented communities to reach their full potential in CS and other STEM careers.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The AP CSP curriculum is based on equity and broadening participation as the course&rsquo;s primary goals. In the first three cohorts of LEGACY (2019-20, 2021-22, 2022-23; suspension of the program for 2020-21 due to the Pandemic), 71.8% of students obtained a qualifying score (3 or above), which is higher than the 2022 National passing rate of 63.3% [22] (see attached figure and SIGCSE paper referenced below). This suggests that LEGACY&rsquo;s preparatory model promotes deep learning of CS concepts, culminating in stellar performance in the AP CSP exam. Students exhibited significant gains in computational thinking (developing computer programs and using pattern matching to solve computational problems), identification with CS, and desire to pursue careers that are computing-based. Follow-up interviews with past students currently in college revealed that a significant number of LEGACY alumnae chose to pursue STEM careers, and credit their participation in LEGACY with giving them the confidence to persist in their chosen college major despite encountering challenges.
