 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantitative reasoning (QR) involves the use of mathematical skills, such as algebra and statistical analysis, to understand and interpret data.  The field of biology has become increasingly reliant on the use of quantitative reasoning to interpret large datasets, such as those gathered in genomic analysis and population studies.  This project is designed to improve quantitative reasoning skills in students at community colleges preparing to transfer into biology majors at four-year institutions.  These students are often underprepared to successfully complete biology majors and to continue to graduate education or to enter the STEM workforce.  To achieve long-term gains in students' abilities to apply QR in biological contexts, this proposal seeks to leverage a university/community college partnership to expand and deepen the QR content in core biology courses across the major.  The program aspires to provide a model for how consortia of community colleges and universities can facilitate course awareness and alignment to improve student gains in QR.  This project will test the hypothesis that this type of collaboration enhances pedagogy and transfer student success at four-year institutions.  Further, repeated interaction with QR modules within the core biology curricula are hypothesized to positively impact the success of all students in upper-level coursework.  These efforts are designed to strengthen the course performance measures of all students, including both direct entry and transfer students.  Improving student success and retention in STEM majors such as biology supports the goal of improving access of all students to scientific and technical careers.\r\n\r\nThe focus of the project will be on enhancing the QR skills of undergraduates through the creation of active learning modules focused on quantitative skill development, verified with validated assessment instruments.  Three scholarly communities will be established: 1) a Curricular Alignment Team, which will review curricula in four core courses (Introductory Biology: Cells and Molecules, Introductory Biology: Ecology and Evolution, Genetics, and Cell Biology) at the community colleges and the four-year institution in the collaboration, and identify areas for action, with emphasis on the development of QR abilities in biology majors; 2) the NEXUS Institute in Quantitative Biology, which will involve teams of faculty from each institution developing, piloting, and assessing QR modules for the core biology curricula and assessing the impact on student performance and retention; and 3) a Faculty Development Community, which will involve a series of shared faculty development workshops on evidence-based teaching approaches, to include the use of the created QR modules, and a common teaching certificate program.  These three communities will come together annually at a regional symposium, where the consortium products (QR modules) and findings (student assessment data) will be disseminated.  Taken together, this work will shape intra- and inter-institutional perspectives and practices relating to the importance of QR in the success of undergraduate biology majors.  By developing faculty collaborations through the scholarly communities described above, this project will provide training in modern pedagogical methods and module development for biology faculty at community colleges and four-year institutions.  The project will map the processes involved and disseminate the project findings widely to ensure that it serves as a model for other institutions that wish to take this approach to improve transfer student success and better prepare all biology majors for the modern STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project had three major goals defined by the research questions. The first goal was to comprehensively review curricula within the introductory core biology sequence: Introductory Biology 1, Introductory Biology 2, Genetics, and Cell Biology. This review was used to identify barriers to content mastery with a focus on quantitative reasoning skills, and to develop modules to address overcoming these barriers. For the first goal, 21 modules were developed over the grant period across the 4 courses. These were designed with Mathematics faculty to guide evaluation of quantitative reasoning. All 21 modules have been evaluated and assessed.\n\n\nThe second goal was to identify teams of faculty from partnering institutions to develop, revise, implement, assess, and disseminate quantitative reasoning modules related to content in the four course sequence. Teams were established that were representative of the five partnering institutions for each of the courses, as well as a mathematics curriculum alignment team. Over the course of the grant several positions were replaced with additional faculty, but the representation of the institutions was maintained. In terms of dissemination of the modules, several manuscripts and multiple posters have been developed and presented and several conferences. Of significance was the development and implementation of the NIQB Annual Symposium offered in each year of the grant. At these events, our data team shared results of the analyses on the qualitative and quantitative student assessment outcomes of module implementation. Our external evaluator presented the results of the most recent surveys of participants in the collaboration, identifying strengths and challenges faced.
