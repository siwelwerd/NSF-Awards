 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will study how brain systems for face perception differ across individuals. Face perception plays a central role in interactions among people.  The ability to recognize faces and interpret expressions can vary greatly in healthy adults.  Efficient face perception develops slowly through childhood and into early adulthood.  Face perception is much more efficient for familiar individuals with whom we interact frequently.  We will use new, state-of-the-art methods for modeling the brain's system for face perception.  The model has interacting processing pathways.  Each pathway serves a different function.   These include recognition of identity, interpretation of expression, and activation of social knowledge.  We study individual differences using a new approach, called hyperalignment. Hyperalignment allows us to see how information is encoded in fine-scale brain patterns.  These studies can make it possible to address questions about the effects of development, education, culture, and clinical disorder on brain organization.   \r\n\r\nThe project will investigate individual variation in the human cortical functional architecture for face perception that leverages our previous work on multivariate models of information in the distributed neural system for face perception and our work creating hyperalignment to build high-dimensional common models of information spaces in cortex. Our approach discovers shared basis functions for information that is encoded in fine-scale cortical topographies, affording reliable measurement of individual differences in the representation of this detailed information.  We will investigate individual variation in cortical systems for face perception as a function of cognitive ability, development, and learning, and build the common model of cortical information spaces using fMRI data collected during viewing of naturalistic movies and in the resting state.  We will use response hyperalignment and connectivity hyperalignment to derive a common model of the face perception system with shared basis functions for fine-scale variation in response tuning and functional connectivity. By modeling shared neural representation at a fine scale, measures of deviations from shared representation are more sensitive to the inter-individual variation that underlies differences in cognitive function.  Our methods have the potential to provide a firmer and more nuanced basis for addressing questions about the effects of development, education, culture, and clinical disorder on brain organization.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We have shown that we can predict topographic idiosyncrasies in the fine-grained details of face-selective topography with high fidelity by using hyperalignment to project others topographies into the individually-specific cortical architecture of a new subject. Surprisingly, we also have found that we can use our method to predict face-selective topographies in adults who have been blind since birth. Even though these people have never seen a face, the topography for visual category selectivity exists in their brains and looks just like what we see in sighted people, suggesting that these topographies develop in the absence of visual experience. This project was the result of a collaboration with researchers at the IMT School for Advanced Studies in Lucca, Italy. We have presented these findings at scientific meetings and are preparing a report to post as a preprint and submit for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\n\nWe also have investigated the relationship between individual differences in fine-scale cortical topographies and cognitive ability. We have shown that individual differences in patterns of fine-grained functional connectivity far better predict individual differences in general intelligence than do differences in coarse-grained connectivity. Surprisingly, in a study of fMRI data from twins, we showed that the differences in fine-grained connectivity are less heritable than differences in coarse-grained connectivity, even though they better predict cognitive abilities. These results suggest that fine-grained and coarse-grained cortical architecture are fundamentally distinct in terms of the information that they encode and the factors that guide their development. Coarse-scale architecture encodes coarser distinctions between broadly defined cognitive functions, e.g. face perception versus scene perception or working memory versus mental arithmetic, and appears to be more dependent on heritable factors, thus providing the rough framing for cortical organization of cognition. Fine-scale architecture, on the other hand, encodes finer distinctions, e.g. among face identities or differences in person knowledge for different individuals, and its development is more dependent on environment and learning. Under this hypothesis, individual differences in fine-scale architecture reflect differences in the knowledge and cognitive skills that have been learned.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/17/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JamesVHaxby\n"
