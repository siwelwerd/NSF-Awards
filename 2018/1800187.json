 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molecular crystals made from conjugated molecules are oftentimes called organic semiconductors. These materials can absorb light and efficiently transport the energy or excitation (called excitons), making them attractive for solar energy conversion applications.  In addition, they support unique phenomena, such as the splitting of a single exciton into two lower-energy excitons, called singlet fission. In this project funded by the Chemical Structure Dynamics and Mechanism (CSDM-A) program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Chris Bardeen of the University of California, Riverside is combining novel sample preparation with time-resolved optical microscopy to study excitons in organic crystals.  The characterization of excitons in organic solids is challenging, since the fragile nature of the crystals makes it difficult to perform measurements.  Professor Bardeen and his students overcome this challenge by encapsulating these crystals beneath two-dimensional sheets of graphene or hexagonal boron nitride. These atomically thin layers form an optically transparent and chemically-resistant coating for the crystal. The encapsulated crystals are then studied using high-resolution microscopy techniques that can follow the excitons as they move through the crystal and undergo singlet fission . Insights from the work could advance our understanding of light-emitting diodes and organic photovoltaic cells. The project is also exploring implications for fields such as quantum computing. The project is providing the graduate and undergraduate students involved in this research with advanced training in spectroscopy, materials characterization, microscopy, and data analysis, as well as supporting outreach efforts to Taft Elementary School. Ongoing projects include science demonstrations for various grades, science fair tutorials, a day-long visit to UCR by the fourth-grade, and classroom visits by undergraduate volunteers. A hands-on experiment for third graders has been developed in which each student builds a customized solar-powered car.\r\n\r\nThe project focuses on prototypical molecular crystal semiconductors like perylene, tetracene ,and diphenylhexatriene.  Plate-like molecular crystals with variable thicknesses are grown and then covered with graphene and hexagonal boron nitride.  With this enabling technology in place, two categories of experiments are pursued.  The first involves measuring the properties of the encapsulated crystal and its interaction with the environment using microscopy and photoluminescence methods.  Questions that can be addressed include whether the exciton behavior in molecular crystals heterogeneous on length-scales down to 20 nm and whether it is possible to transfer energy and charge across the atomically thin membranes.  The second category of experiments focuses on new space and time-resolved experiments to determine whether spin-entangled states of triplet pairs produced by singlet fission can extend over mesoscopic distances.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEnergy in materials can be transported in the form of excitons, which can be thought of as propagating particles analogous to the photons that carry light.  Excitons in crystals composed of conjugated organic molecules can have long lifetimes and spin degrees of freedom that could be useful for applications in quantum information science.  The goal of this research was to develop tools that allow can allow researchers to examine the dynamics of excitons on nanoscopic length-scales by encapsulating molecular crystals under atomically thin sheets of graphene or hexagonal boron nitride.  The research program had three major goals:  1) develop new methods to encapsulate molecular crystals under two-dimensional (2D) materials like graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN); 2) measure interfacial interactions between the crystals and the 2D membrane and outside environment; 3) use nanoscopic probes to measure exciton motion underneath the 2D membrane.  These types of structures can be thought of as composites, where two different material types are brought together to form a new type of material with new properties. \n\n \n\nWe successfully encapsulated molecular crystals under 2D membranes and demonstrated that these delicate structures were well protected from solvent dissolution, ambient oxygen, and other damaging effects from the environment.  However, we also found that the 2D materials were not innocent bystanders:  they typically had defect states that affected the exciton dynamics in the crystals beneath them, typically by quenching their luminescence.  Exfoliated 2D materials, especially hBN, had a very low concentration of defects and avoided this problem, but they raised a new problem of how to cover the crystal.  Exfoliated 2D membranes are typically very small, on the order of 10 microns in length, making complete encapsulation difficult or impossible.  Because of this limitation, we decided to concentrate on modulating the properties of molecular crystals in other ways.  One direction was the use of focused ion beam milling to shape molecular crystals in a well-defined way.  In collaboration with other researchers, we explored methods for blending molecules together to create mixed crystals with tunable properties, like the rate of singlet fission.  Layered structures were also studied, as these interfaces are important for organic light-emitting diodes.  These types of materials relied on non-covalent interactions between the different molecules, but we could also use covalent bonds to link two or more molecules together to form a different type of assembly with novel properties.  An example was a molecular cage whose bars were composed of bithiophene chromophores.  These cages could be designed to have long-lived charge-transfer states.\n\n \n\nOverall, the science accomplished in this grant will facilitate the design of new types of composite materials that could have applications in organic electronics.  The limitations of current encapsulation strategies were defined, and it is now clear what improvements in 2D materials and techniques will be required to create robust molecular crystal samples that can be studied using scanning probe microscopy techniques.  This grant also supported outreach efforts to augment science education at Taft Elementary, a Title I (&gt;70% socioeconomically disadvantaged) school that is also &gt;70% underrepresented minority.  Activities included science fair poster tutorials, demonstrations to different grade levels, and a field trip to the university for the entire fourth grade class. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/21/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christopher J Bardeen"
