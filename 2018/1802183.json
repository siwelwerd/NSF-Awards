 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flowering time is an important biological phenomenon, affecting human societies through its effects on agricultural crops, pollinators, pests, and biodiversity.  Given the sensitivity of flowering times to climatic conditions, a thorough understanding of how plants respond to changing environments is necessary for predicting the consequences for pollinators, herbivores, parasites, and plant populations.  A record of historical flowering times is found within the nation's herbaria.  This award establishes a thematic collection network (TCN) dedicated to understanding flowering time shifts in the California flora.  California has the most diverse native flora of any state in the U.S., containing more than one-third of all U.S. plant species.  The state is a biodiversity hotspot due to the high number of endemic species that are also threatened.  The Capturing California's Flowers (CCF) TCN will record flowering times from and create images of over 900,000 herbarium specimens from the oldest records, the most diverse families, and most threatened families in California.  Twenty-two institutions spanning the state, including public universities, state agencies, museums, and botanic gardens, will participate in these efforts.  This project will generate data that will increase our understanding of flowering time shifts - a critical need for agriculturalists, conservation biologists, plant taxonomists, land managers, and wildlife biologists.\r\n\r\nDigitization of each specimen in the CCF TCN will result in a high-resolution image, a databased record of collection metadata, a georeferenced point, and the reproductive status of the specimen.  New tools will be developed for the public to search and display phenological data through a Symbiota portal interface.  The CCF TCN will develop novel data standards for capturing and sharing trait data from specimens.  Building on already successful national and regional programs, the CCF TCN will partner with schools, universities, botanical clubs, and the general public to crowd source phenological measurements through online expeditions, workshops, new college courses, and K-12 educational programs.  The CCF TCN will provide a historical record of plants currently being monitored through the National Phenology Network and other regional programs.  Finally, this award will expand efforts to train the \"next generation\" of museum curators, collectors, and researchers.  This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program, and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Specimens targeted in this project included 1) the oldest specimens (pre-1930's): to establish a phenological baseline before the onset of anthropogenic climate change; 2) the most diverse plant families in California: to understand the evolution of phenological shifts; and 3) plants monitored by the USA National Phenology Network and the California Phenology Project. The dataset produced by this effort permits us to generate a broader picture of the relationship between phenology and climate.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The California Botanic Garden Herbarium (RSA) imaged 105,864 specimens (106% of the total goal) and fully transcribed and imaged 20,397 newly accessioned specimens. Further, RSA imaged 5,886 specimens from the Colorado Desert District, California Dept. of Parks and Recreation Herbarium (BSCA) and 4,200 specimens from the California State University, San Bernardino Herbarium (CSUSB). Below we highlight project outcomes for each institution.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">RSA</span></p>\n<p>This project provided training and professional development opportunities for students at various levels in their academic career. At RSA, seven undergraduate interns and two curatorial staff worked on barcoding, imaging, and transcription of specimens. Undergraduate interns and curatorial staff gained valuable herbarium curation and digitization skills, as well as a deeper knowledge and appreciation of the research utility of herbarium specimens.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The RSA Herbarium routinely provides tours to the public and notably to students from academic institutions in the Greater Los Angeles Metropolitan area. RSA permits classes to waive their tour fee in exchange for volunteering a small amount of their time to barcode specimens, the first step in digitization. This approach provides students with hands-on experience in a natural history collection setting and an opportunity for active learning rather than a passive tour. In addition to showcasing the collection, tours emphasize the California Phenology Project, and how specimens are used to assess shifting phenologies of California plants, as well as demonstrating our digitizing techniques. Over the first two years of the project (prior to Covid-19) we provided tours to five classes from five different institutions. More than 150 graduate and undergraduate students toured our collection and barcoded over 1,500 specimens for the project.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>RSA has a long-standing partnership with faculty at California Polytechnic University, Pomona. During the project we provided undergraduate students in the Form &amp; Function in Plants course and Plant Evolution course extra credit opportunities to barcode specimens. We held four sessions with a total of 23 students and over 3,100 specimens barcoded. During each session, students learned about the California Phenology Project, including a demonstration of the CCH2 portal and online tools. Each session was followed up with a tour of the collection. Through informal surveys of the students, we learned that most had never been to California Botanic Garden before and 98% had never set foot in a natural history collection before. From these sessions we recruited three students as interns on the project.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To inform the broader community of the California Phenology Project and significant results, dissemination included announcements on social media tracking our progress and the people involved; publication in the California Botanic Garden volunteer?s newsletter, Oak Notes; and a zoom presentation to the California Native Plant Society, Orange County Chapter. A publication for the broader scientific community by the CAP TCN members highlighted the project, its participants, workflows, and methods for phenological scoring of specimens was produced (Yost et al. 2019).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">CSUSB</span></p>\n<p>Four undergraduate students participated in digitization activities, learned herbarium protocols, and developed skills for managing collections. Specimens that were digitized during year 1 of this project served as a valuable resource for a Local Flora course, which was forced online in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This course, which combines plant taxonomy, plant identification, and local plant ecology, used images produced to teach students basic plant characteristics and to hone their understanding of research. Student efforts to distinguish reproductive structures on herbarium specimens contributed to phenological scoring of specimens in plant families targeted by this grant. Additionally, students were introduced to uses of herbarium collections and used digitized specimens to analyze each specimen's value for different uses and/or research goals. The spring 2020 class involved 42 students, and has since expanded in the following years.
