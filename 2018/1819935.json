 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer science is not just the scientific discipline behind the information technology revolution; it is also an apt framework for understanding the world around us.  This project is about applying the point of view of algorithms -- and their antithesis, complexity -- to understanding phenomena and challenges in a variety of domains, including the Internet, markets, evolution, and the brain.  To understand the Internet and the networks and markets it entails and enables, one must combine algorithms with ideas from economics and game theory.  This research will focus on online markets and particularly their dynamic (that is, multi-stage) nature, on incentives for improving congestion in network routing and air traffic, on algorithms for propagating influence in social networks, as well as new kinds of algorithms that take their inputs from competitors (who may choose to misrepresent their data).  The PI will continue his research on how computational insights can shed light on some key problems in evolution,  including certain rigorous connections between natural selection, machine learning, and a problem in Boolean logic.  Finally, the PI will work to reconcile learning algorithms with new insights from neuroscience.\r\n\r\nThe project includes research on certain crucial problems at the interface between computation and game theory/economics/networks,  while continuing past work employing computational concepts to elucidate evolution and, more recently, neuroscience.  The PI will  study the important problem of dynamic mechanism design in economics from the point of view of computational complexity and approximate implementation. He will also study mechanisms for managing congestion, with possible applications to air traffic control.  The project will explore the computational and graph-theoretic properties of several novel and promising game-theoretic models of network creation.  It will study from the complexity standpoint Nash equilibria with continuous strategies, and extensions of the Nash equilibrium concept beyond utility theory.  The project will also explore new and timely modes of computation in which all inputs (ultimately, all computational components) are provided by selfish rational agents. In evolution, the PI will explore the connections between learning algorithms, games, and natural selection, and a different connection between Boolean satisfiability and the emergence of novelty. The PI also plans to develop a new genre of learning algorithms that are more faithful to the new insights we are gaining into the brain.  Finally, from the standpoint of algorithms and complexity, the PI will look at several computational problems ranging from network variants of the set cover problem to linear programming and optimizing multivariate polynomials.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe advent of the Internet in the 1990s changed Computer Science research.  Computer scientists realized that, in order to come to grips with the Internet, they have to delve into the social sciences &ndash; because the Internet is about people, and to understand it you must first study people, their cognition, social behavior, incentives.  A new research area was born at the interface between Economics and Computer Science, using tools from algorithms, game theory, and microeconomics to study the new global information environment.  \n\nAlgorithmic Game Theory (AGT) is now a rather mature field, and has produced some important insights. One of these is a 2006 result by the PI?s group on the intractability of the Nash equilibrium.  A Nash equilibrium of a social interaction is a state in which no participant has an incentive to change their behavior.  Nash proved in 1950 the fundamental result that all games have such a state, and much of modern economic thought utilizes the Nash equilibrium as a crucial theoretical tool &ndash; hence the intractability of the Nash equilibrium means that we must reconsider much of our methodology.  But that result had left a glimmer of hope: Perhaps the Nash equilibrium can be easily approximated so closely that the difficulty of finding the precise answer does not matter much.  This had been for over a decade one of the most challenging open questions in AGT. One of the most significant outcomes of this project is establishing that this too is impossible &ndash; existence of a fast approximation would violate widely held beliefs in complexity theory.  The result follows from a series of papers by the PI?s group, culminating in a paper by Aviad Rubenstein, a PhD student supported by the grant and now teaching at Stanford.  \n\nAd auctions, the economic mechanisms whereby the attention of Internet users is allocated to competing advertisers, have great economic importance (with revenue totaling many tens of billions annually) and entail dire research challenges.  This project made two significant contributions in this arena: We pointed out the dynamic nature of such auctions (the same agents engage in repeated economic interactions) and showed that dynamic mechanisms are far more subtle, and harder to optimize, than the one-shot mechanisms economists had been successfully tackling for decades. Secondly, in collaboration with MIT researchers we pointed out a flaw in the current analysis of such auctions, having to do with their complex information structure (the auctioneer/platform knows much about the user but not enough about the bidder/advertiser). As a result of this information structure the correct framework turns out to be not a single-item auction &ndash; the standard framework used &ndash; but a multi-item auction, a far more challenging framework.  \n\nMachine learning (ML) is a computational methodology of towering current importance and accomplishment, and this project initiated a line of research which creates a productive interface between AGT and ML.  Three facets of this novel interface are explained next.  (1) ML is often used to classify data points into, say, legitimate or suspicious credit card transactions.  The point is that, once the ML algorithm used for this is made public (for a variety of legal and technical reasons) then the \"data points\" will adjust their behavior &ndash; and this is a game!  (2) The data used in ML may be provided by selfish agents, who will need incentives to try harder and provide higher quality data &ndash; this is a novel contract design problem!  (3) Finally, in a game players do learn how to react to the actions of others.  This facet of the games-learning interface has been studied classically, but the PI in collaboration with Georgios Piliouras developed a new theory of learning in games based on the topology of dynamical systems, which seems to already have some impact in both theory and practice. \n\n The last prong of this project was the PI?s algorithmic research on understanding the Brain.  How do molecules, neurons, and synapses effect cognition, intelligence, reasoning, language?  This may be the most challenging question in all of science.  As the illustrious experimental neuroscientist Richard Axel recently put it, a \"logic\" &ndash; a formal system! &ndash; is needed to address this mystery.  The PI, within the framework of this project and in collaboration with Santosh Vempala and the computational neuroscience groups at Columbia and TU Graz, has developed a computational system called the Assembly Calculus which can possibly serve as the logic sought by Axel.  Its basic data type is the assembly (a large population of excitatory neurons), with operations such as project, associate, and merge.  These operations can be shown to be realizable in terms of neurons and synapses, capable of rather powerful computation, and may underlie syntactic operations in natural language. Work with experimentalists is under way to detect evidence of assembly-related activity in the human brain.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/25/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christos Papadimitriou"
