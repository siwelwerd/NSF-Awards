 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of FLIP (Diversifying Future Leadership in the Professoriate), an NSF INCLUDES Design and Development Launch Pilot, is to address the broadening participation challenge of increasing the diversity of the future leadership in the professoriate in computing at research universities as a way to achieve diversity across the field. According to the 2016 CRA Taulbee Survey, only 4.3% of the tenure-track faculty at PhD-granting universities are from underrepresented minorities. This challenge is important to address because diverse faculty contributes to academia in the following critical ways: serve as excellent role models for a diverse study body, bring diverse backgrounds to the student programs and policies developed by the department, and bring diverse perspectives to the research projects and programs. Further, the focus is on research universities, because in practice, key national leadership roles, such as serving on national committees that impact thefield of computing, often come from research universities.\r\n\r\nThe shared purpose and broad vision of the FLIP launch pilot is to increase faculty diversity in computing at research universities by increasing the diversity of PhD graduates from the top producers of computing faculty. The focus is on four underrepresented groups in computing: African Americans; Hispanics; Native Americans and indigenous peoples; and Persons with Disabilities. The long-term goal is to pursue this vision through strategic partnerships with those institutions that are the top producers of computing faculty and organizations that focus on diverse students in STEM, as well as partnerships that collectively adopt proven strategies for recruiting, graduating, and preparing a diverse set of doctoral students for academic careers. The purpose of the pilot is to establish a unified approach across the different partners that will build upon proven strategies to develop novel practices for increasing the diversity of the PhD graduates from key institutions, thereby increasing the faculty diversity in computing at research universities. For the pilot, FLIP will focus on recruitment and admissions and professional development for current PhD students.",

The monthly conference calls with the FLIP PIs, Advocates, and computer science graduate admissions staff has served as a vehicle for continuity and furthering the building of this community. The agendas and conference call minutes were provided to all participants prior to conference calls through Google drive where there is also a mutual sharing of institutional documents and information to inform conference call  discussions but also in email communications between calls.

Project continuity is maintained within the various institutions and the FLIP Alliance even though there is frequent turnover in the faculty and staff Advocates.\n\nRecruitment &amp; Admissions Data\n\nOver the course of the project, Alliance members have developed efficient strategies for sharing and discussing data related to recruiting and admitting their students. In the spirit of a genuine interest in increasing representation from the targeted groups, all participating institutions signed a confidentiality agreement to facilitate candid conversations where members can work to address barriers to recruitment and admission without judgement or concerns about privacy.
