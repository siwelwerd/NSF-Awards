 "awd_abstract_narration": "Approximately 2.9 million people die prematurely from conditions arising from indoor air pollution annually. A significant proportion of cases are due to household reliance on biomass fuels and exposure to airborne toxicants in biomass smoke. Significant expenditures are made by the U.S. government to combat exposure. The cost-effectiveness and sustainability of potential spending on interventions to improve air quality depend on understanding the local context, however, including perceptions of strategies to mediate risk from environmental pollution and their interaction with community health patterns. Airborne toxicant exposure are already known to disproportionately impact individuals from disadvantaged socioeconomic status. This study, which trains a graduate student in methods of rigorous, empirical data collection and analysis, explores variation between cultural perceptions of risk and vulnerability to pollution exposure and biological outcomes. Further, this project will build capacity and scientific infrastructure through international scientific cooperation, and enhance public scientific understanding by broadly disseminating findings to organizations engaged in issues related to air pollution.\r\n\r\nDavid Dillon, under the supervision of Dr. Christopher McCarty of the University of Florida, will investigate whether perceptions of risk and vulnerability mediate human exposure to airborne toxicants from biomass fuels. The research takes place in Eastern Province, Zambia, an ideal setting for studying airborne toxicant risk; in sub-Saharan Africa, household air pollution (HAP) is fourth in the top ten list of risk factors for high burden of disease. Previous research on biomass fuel use demonstrates that both risk perception and cultural aspects of traditional cookstoves significantly influence individual exposure levels. This study employs a purposive matched sampling design that stratifies households by the primary source of household fuel while capturing variation in local demography. The co-PI tests hypotheses linking culturally constructed risk perception to specific and measurable biological outcomes using ethnographic data collected through semi-structured interviews and environmental health data on airborne toxicant exposure. Intellectually, findings from this research contribute to understanding how risk perception and local biology contribute to patterns of human-environment interaction and health inequalities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The study took place over a period of twelve months in Chipata, Zambia. The Co-PI enrolled participants which were entirely reliant on biomass fuel and a pseudo-control group which had consistent access to electricity. The five main aims of this research were to (1) determine the prevalence of cardiovascular/pulmonary diseases in these communities, (2) &nbsp;determine environmental and personal airborne toxicant exposure levels for both groups, (3) assess the extent of shared cultural models of disease and cooking practices within and between these two groups, (4) determine if risk perceptions mediate exposure to airborne toxicants, (5) and lastly identify if there is cultural significance of braziers (cookstoves) and whether this significantly affects their use. There were no significant differences between these two groups in the prevalence of cardiovascular or pulmonary disease or function. Both groups were exposed to air pollution at levels far higher than safe thresholds outlined by the WHO; however, the biomass group was significantly higher between the two for particulate matter (both PM10 and PM2.5) and the urinary metabolite of benzo[a]pyrene, 1-hydroxybenzo[a]pyrene. Bayesian cultural consensus analysis showed mixed results between groups. Nearly all participants indicated they routinely performed tasks that increased their risk of exposure to household air pollution such as cooking indoors using charcoal. Relatively little risk is associated with the use of charcoal even inside the home. While most participants expressed a desire to have electric stoves, electricity is still prohibitively expensive. This cost constraint leads to certain everyday foods being cooked over charcoal regardless of access to electricity. Further complicating these findings are droughts and climactic instability in the region that restricts access to electricity even to those who are able to afford it. In a country reliant on hydroelectric power, droughts result in long periods of electricity rationing and blackouts. The results of this study demonstrate human exposure to chronically high levels of airborne toxicants attributable to biomass fuel use and points to the need for more research on this topic in sub-Saharan Africa.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/03/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: David&nbsp;Dillon</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
