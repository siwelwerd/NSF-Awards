All for early career scientists including post-docs. The project is supporting the following two broad objectives: (1) training and career development for the health and vitality of marine research; and (2)increasing inclusion and diversity in marine field science. The proposed program will provide many opportunities for participants to learn not only the logistics of developing and conducting a sea-going field expedition, but also have the opportunity to actively participate in conducting research at sea with a diversity of collaborators that cover the spectrum of volcanic, hydrothermal and biological phenomena at active mid-ocean ridge eruption sites.\r\n\r\nPart II\r\nA cruise involving R/V Atlantis, along with deep- sea exploration vehicles Alvin and Sentry, has been funded and is planned for Dec. 3-20, 2018. The objectives of the cruise are to conduct four  Alvin and three Sentry AUV dives at the 8? 20?N seamounts, west of the East Pacific Rise (EPR) axis near 8? 20?N (a continuation of the Gregg/Fornari/Perfit/Wanless NSF-OCE-MGG funded research), and then to conduct four Alvin and four Sentry dives at the 9? 50?N eruption area, which will be the focus of Early Chief Scientist (ECS) Training that will involve 9-10 early career scientists (NSF-OCE-Facilities funded EAGER). The ECS Training includes: (1) Pre-cruise training via teleconference and webinars; (2) At-sea training which will include a synergic telepresence into the Fall 2018 American Geophysical Union (AGU); (3) A Post-cruise Forum and Outreach event in San Diego, CA on Dec. 22 that will invite local community colleges and high schools; and (4) Follow-up and Assessment of the ECS program and tracking of participant research in deep submergence.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The goal of the ECS expedition was to provide hands-on training in the development and management of a seagoing research cruise, with particular emphasis on utilization of deep submergence technologies that are part of the National Deep Submergence Facility (NDSF) at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI).&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Summary of Recruitment, Applications, and Selection</strong></p>\n<p>Ten scientists were selected out of an applicant pool of 53 to participate. The application process for the ECS training program was coordinated by the PIs through the UNOLS Office. Effort was made to attract a diverse range of early career scientists, both in discipline and background, and from a balanced geographical demographic, including both small and large educational institutions. The applications were solicited using a wide variety of on-line methods including UNOLS listservs and email distribution lists including the DESSC mailing list, Earth Science Women's Network, and disciplinary listservs. Once a short list was selected, considerable effort was placed on ensuring a geographic and disciplinary balance as well as a reasonable gender balance for the prospective candidates that also conformed to available berthing onboard RV Atlantis. Of the ten participants, eight were Assistant Professors and two were Postdocs at the time of the program (Figure 1).</p>\n<p><strong>Summary of Pre-Cruise Training&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Communication and science planning for the sub-disciplinary groups was critical in the lead up to the expedition. To foster communication between the participants and mentors a Slack group was created for the entire team, including shore-based participants and mentors. Groups were asked to develop specific science goals that could be integrated into the multidisciplinary mission. These efforts were enhanced by webinars that provided information about the EPR field area, use of the deep submergence facilities to conduct research, general UNOLS information on conducting oceanographic science, as well as specific discussions with ECS mentors about the opportunities presented by the use of Alvin and Sentry for the 4 days on station to conduct the ECS diving. The pre-cruise webinar topics are presented in Table 1 and included basic overviews of operational and scientific information to help participants to prepare for the cruise. Each webinar was 1 hour with scheduled opportunities for questions and feedback after each presentation. The webinars were also recorded by the AGU team and are available for review online in the AGU archives.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary of At-Sea Training</strong></p>\n<p>The pre-cruise training program was followed by a condensed 3-week expedition on AT42-06 where the ECS participants performed a wide range of tasks related to planning and executing deep submergence vehicle dives and collaborative seagoing research. Participants were exposed to the details of coordinating field experiments and data collection in partnership with shipboard technical and operational personnel and NDSF vehicle operators. Nine of the twelve ECS participants had the opportunity to dive in HOV Alvin - 3 of the participants had previously dived in Alvin (Table 2). Additionally, training in science writing, communications and effective use of social media for informing the public about oceanographic research and technology was carried out with the ECS participants, facilitated by an onboard science communications expert (Mr. Ken Kostel - WHOI). The outreach included telecons to classrooms on shore as well as live broadcasts at the Fall American Geophysical Union (AGU) meeting held in Washington D.C. during the expedition. ECS participants played a large role in the implementation of the large outreach event held in San Diego, CA directly following the expedition.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary of Critical Outcomes</strong><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>A primary goal of the ECS expedition was to provide training to young scientists and broaden the use of NDSF resources. All ECS participants responded that the program had Moderately (62.5%) or had Very Much (37.5%) changed their perception of the purpose, capabilities and availability of the UNOLS Fleet (Q31). Additionally, All ECS participants responded that the program had Moderately (37.5%) or Very Much (62.5%) changed their perception of the purpose, capabilities and availability of NDSF facilities. When asked how the program influenced the likelihood that the participant will request UNOLS ship time for future research, 87.5% of participants responded that the training had increased their likelihood (12.5% reported no change).</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most critical assessment is the potential of ECS Participants to write a future grant proposal using NDSF resources (Figure 2). All of the participants responded they would submit a proposal to utilize NDSF vehicles, with 75% saying they would likely do so in 1-2 years.</p>\n<p>Finally, the ECS participants were asked about their confidence to lead a future research expedition. 75% of participants responded \"Yes\" that they feel they are now prepared to lead an oceanographic research cruise.</p>\n<p><em><br /></em></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/26/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Patricia&nbsp;M&nbsp;Gregg</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1834797/1834797_10552517_1614358326732_ECSGroupPhoto--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1834797/1834797_10552517_1614358326732_ECSGroupPhoto--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"ECS Science Party 2018\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1834797/1834797_10552517_1614358326732_ECSGroupPhoto--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"ECS Science Party 2018\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The science party of AT42-06 Early Career Scientist (ECS) Training Program Expedition, 2018</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">D.
