 "awd_abstract_narration": "The low performance and retention of students in STEM classes are often attributed to lack of engagement and motivation.  Interactive online learning environments have the potential to engage students and motivate learning, and thus may contribute to increased performance and retention of students in STEM.   This project seeks to examine the efficacy of different configurations and design elements in a course platform for interactive, online learning. This platform, OneUp Learning, was previously developed by project team members.  The research study will measure the effects of the platform on the engagement and academic performance of students in computer science and data science courses.  It is expected that results of this research will lead to better design of online learning environments that support student motivation and contribute to improving undergraduate STEM education.\r\n\r\nThe research design of this project will be guided by Self Determination Theory, a well-validated psychological theory for understanding motivation and behavior change. The project will pursue three objectives: 1) conduct a series of empirical studies on the application of different elements of the OneUp platform in different learning contexts; 2) extend the OneUp platform by adding new elements to strengthen the platform's social dimension; and 3) develop instructional materials to help faculty use the OneUp platform to develop interactive modules for other courses at the participating institutions. To disseminate the results of these studies, the project team will solicit active community participation, through workshops, crowdsourcing, and related strategies. The project is a collaboration between two institutions, one of which is minority-serving. The partnership between institutions with different student populations will enable exploration of the impact of various platform features on diverse demographic groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project on online interactive learning platforms aimed to accomplish the following outcomes:\n\n\n1.  Build on prior work to develop a flexible, engaging online learning platform  OneUp, designed and built at Winston-Salem State University, provides an environment in which a teacher can design and build the learning environment best suited for their classes.  Although there are many options for inclusion, the teacher chooses only the ones that are appropriate for the class.  OneUp is independent of any specific subject matter.  Instructors enter quiz items suited to their subject area and the level of their students.  They also choose which game elements are most attractive to their environment.  The biggest burden in the system is the need to enter a large number of quiz items.  To address that, we developed auxilliary tools to allow instructors to share their materials and also to incorporate materials already posted in an online content management system.\n\n2.  With many options available to configure the system to suit a need, the question becomes what options and combinations of options are most effective.  A primary focus of this award was experiments in the effectiveness of a variety of combinations of game tools.  With partners from other institutions the team explored options in institutions with varying demogratics of the students, varying levels of the classes, as well as variations in the collections of tools used. Despite the variation in environments, course level, and selection of game elements, no significant differences were found in the outcomes of the experiments.\n\n3,  Although this award has ended, the project continues at Winston-Salem where an in-depth analysis of the effects of various game element combination continues.  This work is expected to be completed in Spring 2023 and will be reported in a journal article.\n\n4.  A goal of this grant is the wide distribution of access to the tools and to the experiences of other innovators.  Presnetations have been made at conferences and the sessions were well attended.  Participants in sessions were invited to become experiment sites and this resulted in a good variety of locations and courses.  In the most recent period, the following locations and courses provided research data:\n\n* Villanova University (Pennsylvania): Discrete Structures\n*Park University (Missouri): Computer Networking\n* Millersville University (Pennsylvania): Fundamentals of Programming I\n* Holy Cross College at Notre Dame (Indiana): Discrete Mathematics\n* University of Koblenz, Germany: Motivation psychology in the context of schools\n* Kyrgyz Turkish Manas University, Kyrgyzstan: Discrete Structures.\nMost of the courses are in computer science, but the recent project using motivation psychology and previous projects involving physics and other subjects illustrate that the tool and approach serves a broad spectrum of subject areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/29/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lillian N Cassel"
