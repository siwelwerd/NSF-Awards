 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through the National Science Foundation?s Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) program, this project provides a major data network upgrade for the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) that makes scientific data flows a priority. AMNH conducts scientific research and education activities spanning astrophysics, geosciences, and genomics. Scientific collaborations require increasing network capacity among scientific instruments, collaborators and researchers. These data networking improvements to AMNH directly support these research activities. AMNH's ability to move large data sets quickly between its campus and other sites across the nation and throughout the world is critical to the success of the Museum's research program.\r\n\r\nIn the project, AMNH implements a high-speed Science DMZ, a network specifically tuned for large data transfers. Through the Science DMZ, AMNH connects to the NYSERNet Research and Education Network, which provides pathways to the higher education community in New York State, Internet2, and beyond. Using purpose-built Data Transfer Nodes (DTNs) based on the FIONA concept, AMNH scientists can move diverse, large-scale data sets between research facilities, supercomputing centers, and collaborators via a dedicated 10Gb/s connection. The efficiencies gained enable greater collaboration, more intelligent and timely coordination of research, and increased research throughput and quality. To further facilitate collaboration, the project leverages the GLOBUS file transfer system to easily orchestrate data transfers and for disseminating AMNH's research to the broader research community. Additionally, AMNH integrates with the InCommon Federation, utilizing a common framework to provide researchers secure access to online resources. Using perfSONAR, the Science DMZ is continually monitored to ensure that throughput, latency, and performance targets are met, and data can flow unimpeded. This allows Museum researchers to focus on science rather than the logistical details of moving data. Additionally, the work of AMNH scientists informs the Museum's educational and curatorial programs, directly benefitting AMNH students and the public.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This connection is separate      and distinct from the Museum's commodity Internet connections, allowing      the full capacity of the NYSERNet/ Internet2 link to be dedicated to      research needs. This connection is also available for Museum educators and      students, giving them faster access to R&amp;E resources available via the      Internet2 and beyond.

The Museum's Microscopy and Imaging Facility (MIF) utilizes its DTN to send image data between lab instruments and remote facilities for analysis.

The SciDMZ also provides high-speed pathways to cloud based computational resources hosted at Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the Open Science Grid (OSG).
