 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tidal internal waves arise from the interaction of the surface tide with topography, with their generation, propagation and dissipation forming a key pathway for tidal energy in the ocean. Internal tides can constitute a dominant energy source on continental shelves, where they can lead to processes such as soliton generation, turbulent mixing and cross shelf exchange, with wide ranging implications for transport, biological productivity and near-shore pollution. This study will explore how internal tides are transformed near the shelf break to propagate along the coast and how quickly they decay by radiating some of their energy offshore.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the deep ocean internal tides usually manifest as low vertical mode waves, however, close to the continental shelf break they may take the form of \"leaky\" (superinertial) baroclinic coastal trapped waves and edge waves. These modal structures are superinertial analogues to the well studied subinertial coastal trapped waves, having a component that radiates along the shelf break. However, they are distinguished from subinertial waves by exhibiting coincident radiation offshore (i.e. \"leaking\"). The goal of this study is to better understand the nature of internal tides close to the coastal margin, where the presence of leaky baroclinic trapped internal tides may contribute to the along shore variability and propagation of tidal energy. The study will consider the forcing of these waves by both the local astronomical tide, and by remotely incident deep ocean internal tides. The approach will include idealized, linear, two-dimensional (cross-shore) analyses; idealized, three-dimensional, nonlinear numerical simulations of the coastal response to local and remote forcing; and a suite of realistic numerical simulations to investigate leaky trapped internal tide energy along the U. S. West coast due to local and remote forcing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project was focused on the generation and energetics of internal tides along the coastal ocean.  Internal tides are waves that oscillate at tidal periods and propagate along density differences in ocean waters.  Along coasts, oscillating currents caused by internal tides are often strong and can dominate high-frequency variations in coastal currents.  The energetics of internal tides in the coastal ocean is an important topic and remains poorly understood, in part due to the challenges of quantifying alongshore internal tide energy transport using field measurements and traditional analysis methods.  The research involved three major topics. The first described and quantified the challenge of separating contributions to energy and energy transport in coastal regions by internal tidal processes and tidal waves directly driven by astronomical processes (often referred to as the barotropic or surface tide).  The challenge arises because traditional separation methods are derived from 'flat-bottom' theory for which the distinction between the internal and barotropic tides is straight forward.  In the coastal ocean, where bathymetry changes substantially due to the presence of a continental shelf and continental shelf, applying flat-bottom theory to separate the internal and barotropic tides can lead to erroneous interpretations of the energetics of the two processes, and we show that this method can lead significantly underestimating internal tide energy and energy transport on continental shelves.  Second, we extend previous research and apply advanced approaches to quantify the generation of internal tides by the interaction of the barotropic tide with bathymetry and density variations at the coastal ocean.  Our research expands on previous work by more thoroughly determining how density structure, topographic parameters, and latitude impact the energy and energy transport of the generated internal tide.  Through this work, we developed a self-similar scaling that predicts internal tide energy transport that can be expressed in terms of physical parameters.  Finally, in the third component of our research, we utilized numerical simulations of the coastal ocean to quantify the generation of coastal trapped internal tides through internal tides propagating incident to the coastal ocean or the barotropic tide propagating along the coastal ocean interacting with coastal bathymetry that varies in the along-shore direction.  Coastal trapped internal tides are internal waves that propagate along the coast and are trapped (energy is isolated) to the coastal ocean.  At typical internal tide oscillation periods, coastal trapped waves eventually lose their energy through dissipation or through generating internal tides that propagate away from the coast.  In our idealized simulations, we focused on coastal bathymetry that varied along the coast with spatial oscillations having a fixed alongshore wavelength.  We found that coastal trapped internal tides could be resonantly generated dependent on the wavelength of the bathymetric variations, the angle at which the incident internal tide propagated toward the coast (for the incident internal tide experiments), and the natural wavelength of the coastal trapped wave as determined by linear theory for the coastal geometry and density field used in the numerical simulations.  We showed that the resonant generation condition for internal coastal trapped waves is the same theoretical condition developed previously for scattering of barotropic waves.  Internal tides are energetic along most coasts in the global ocean.  This research advanced our understanding of their energetics and provided methods for predicting internal tide generation along the global coastal ocean and predicting under what conditions coastal trapped internal tides will be energetic along the coastal ocean.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/13/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James Lerczak"
