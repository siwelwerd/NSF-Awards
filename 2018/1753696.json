 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geochemical and geodynamic investigation of lithospheric drip magmatism \r\nbeneath the East African Rift\r\n\r\n\r\nContinental rifting is a fundamental part of the Wilson Cycle that defines the geological paradigm of plate tectonics. In this context, however, the relationships among magmatism, lithospheric thinning and crustal extension are poorly constrained. The PIs will evaluate the role of lithospheric drip magmatism as a trigger for successful continental rifting by studying alkaline mafic lavas from the Bufumbira and Toro Ankole volcanic fields in western Uganda. A growing body of evidence suggests that density instabilities in the lowermost lithosphere can undergo abrupt localized destabilization in response to regional thermal or mechanical stress. This physical thinning of the lithosphere, occurring on a scale of 20-50 km, enhances both magmatism and the likelihood of extensional failure, i.e., successful continental rifting, and thus controls the ultimate shape of continental margins. The work couples detailed geochemical analysis of proposed drip-related lavas and their accompanying mantle xenoliths with geophysical modeling of lithospheric drip and the ensuing crustal extension. The implications of this work to the understanding of continental extension represent a new approach to predicting the locus of new ocean basins and the forces required to produce them. At a regional scale, this work is of high importance to nations along the East African Rift: drip magmatism does not sustain the shallow long-lived magma chambers that are necessary for viable geothermal energy production. In terms of human resources, this project supports female researchers from a wide range of educational institutions as well as graduate and undergraduate students in geochemistry and geodynamics, and brings a short-course in geophysics to geology undergraduates who seek careers in this field. \r\n\r\nThe lithospheric mantle is foundational - literally and conceptually - to the construction, destruction and division of tectonic plates. Modification of the lithospheric mantle by magma and fluids affects its composition and, by extension, buoyancy. If the bottom of the lithosphere is made denser, the base of the lithosphere can detach and sink, leading to small-volume basaltic volcanism, lithospheric thinning, and potentially rifting. Geochemical data on lavas suggest lithospheric drips drive volcanism in several parts of the East African Rift. Also, xenoliths from this area show significant metasomatism by melts and fluids, and lithospheric removal has been invoked to explain the timing and rates of recent uplift. In order to test this hypothesis, the role of lithospheric drips will be evaluated by: 1) obtaining detailed petrographic and mineral-scale compositional data on lavas and pyroxenite xenoliths, 2) calculating the physical conditions recorded by lavas and xenoliths, and 3) applying those calculations to 2D and 3D geodynamic models to whether lithospheric drip tectonics and melting explain the rocks themselves. Lithospheric drip melting is somewhat paradoxical, because cold descending lithosphere should not melt unless it is heated through conduction more rapidly than it becomes compressed during descent. It may be that additional complexity to symmetrical dripping is required, such as edge-driven convection during rifting or a nearby upwelling plume. This project will promote collaboration between 3 U.S. universities, including an REU institution, and provide opportunity for researchers from Uganda.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Bulk rock geochemistry and geochronology of lavas from this area provide insight into the source domains and petrogenetic processes involved in regional magmatism, as well as insight into the spatial variability of metasomatic history of the lithospheric mantle. Basalts from the Bufumbira volcanic field (Virunga Volcanic Province, southwestern Uganda) have geochemical compositions that reflect the complex tectonic history of the underlying continental lithosphere. These mafic lavas are potassic (K<sub>2</sub>O/Na<sub>2</sub>O = 0.3-2.7) and enriched in incompatible trace elements (e.g., (La/Yb)<sub>n</sub> = 12-132). A subset of lavas record <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar ages between 21-662 ka, with compositional trends that document the progressive development of the volcanic field, including tapping of deeper source regions over time. The compositions of Bufumbira lavas require significant input from metasomatized sub-continental lithospheric mantle. Their Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf-He isotope variations reveal contributions from two different lithospheric domains with distinct ages and histories of interaction with spatially varying carbonatitic and silicate metasomatic agents. One source domain is over 1 billion years old and is locally heterogeneous, with readily melted veins of garnet, amphibole, and phlogopite with accessory titanite, apatite, and zircon embedded within a pyroxenite-rich mineralogy. Over time, vein melts become progressively diluted by melts from a deeper lithospheric source that appears to be present beneath the entire Western Rift; this Common Lithospheric Mantle domain was metasomatized &sim;450&ndash;500 million years ago. The pyroxenitic deep source material is gravitationally unstable and founders off the base of the continental lithosphere. Basaltic lavas that record mixing between the deep widespread source region and a heterogeneous shallower source domain are found in each Western Rift volcanic province, suggesting this style of melt generation is fundamental to continental rifting in areas of limited magmatism and extension. The implications of our work are critical to understanding continental rifting, and the processes by which metasomatized and thickened cratons can be thinned, ruptured, and eroded. These results have been welcomed by the geophysical community broadly and thereby contribute to a more robust and integrated interpretation of planetary evolution.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our work supported the professional development of three graduate students, one of whom is a female faculty member at Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda, and two first-generation female college undergraduates.
