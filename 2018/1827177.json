 "awd_abstract_narration": "Data-intensive science applications in research fields such as bioinformatics, chemistry,\r\nand material science are increasingly becoming multi-domain in nature. To augment local\r\ncampus CyberInfrastructure (CI) resources, these applications rely on multi-institutional resources\r\nthat are remotely accessible (e.g., scientific instruments, supercomputers, public clouds).\r\nProvisioning of such federated CI resources has been traditionally based on applications'\r\nperformance and quality of service (QoS) requirements. This project aims to augment\r\ntraditional resource provisioning schemes through novel schemes for\r\nformalizing end-to-end security requirements to align security posture\r\nacross multi-domain resources with heterogeneous policies.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses the end-to-end multi-domain security design for\r\nscientific applications by defining and formalizing security specifications along an application's workflow lifecycle stages.\r\nThe research work will advance the current knowledge for a CI engineer in the following areas:\r\n(i)\thow to intelligently perform resource allocations among private and public cloud locations;\r\n(ii)\tby streamlining end-to-end security posture across domains that are constructed via dynamic network services; and\r\n(iii)\thow to \"bring your own compute\" programs in large facilities to reduce turnaround times in a secured and policy-compliant manner.\r\nThe resulting security formalization and alignment schemes will be implemented as a security middleware coupled within a unified resource broker framework that: (a) operationally integrates various software tools and systems such as perfSONAR, OpenStack, iRODS and Shibboleth; and (b) supports prototypes of web-portals and actual users (e.g., researchers and educators) within usability evaluation and validation experiments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
