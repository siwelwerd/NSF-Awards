 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the building of a new experiment at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) that will be sensitive to a neutron electric dipole moment at a very small scale.  Neutrons are subatomic particles and, along with the proton, are the basic constituents of atomic nuclei. They are electrically neutral, but nothing in principle prevents the neutron from having positive and negative poles, a so-called \"electric dipole moment\"(EDM).  Big-bang theories of the origin of the universe predict that matter and antimatter are created in equal parts, which should have annihilated long ago. The current observable universe has much more matter than antimatter, thus there should be processes which caused this imbalance in the evolution of the cosmos. These mechanisms require the behavior of matter and antimatter to be slightly different from each other's mirror image. The same underlying mechanism also predicts that the neutron should have an EDM large enough to be observable. Thus, neutron EDM experiments attempt to shed light on the question as to why there is any matter in the universe at all.   This award supports the construction of instrumentation needed to improve the sensitivity to the nEDM by a factor of ten beyond current limits, taking advantage of the increased ultracold neutron (UCN) yield from the upgraded UCN source at LANL.  In developing the knowledge and technical basis needed for the nEDM search, students and postdoctoral researchers will become the next generation of scientists.\r\n\r\nExperimental searches for the neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM) have been conducted since 1951. To date, no evidence for an nEDM has been found. In many theoretical scenarios, successful matter creation leads to strict lower bounds on the nEDM on the order of 10^-27 e-cm.  If no nEDM is discovered, this experiment, in combination with ongoing EDM searches in atomic and nuclear systems, will push the limits on the mass scale for new symmetry violating physics above 100 TeV. This exceeds the current and future energy reach of the Large Hadron Collider.   On the other hand, discovery of a nonzero nEDM at this level would reveal a completely new source of symmetry violations, contributing to the development of a unified theory of the fundamental forces of nature that is consistent with cosmology.  Achieving the target nEDM sensitivity requires high densities of polarized ultra-cold neutrons (UCN) and an apparatus capable of controlling systematic effects. The experiment design is based on Ramsey's method of separated oscillatory fields using a two-cell measurement chamber, state-of-the-art magnetic shielding, novel magnetic field configurations, and sensitive magnetometry (both external and co-habitating) to control systematics. This room-temperature design (unlike many cryogenic designs under development) will allow the instrument to be assembled, tested, and commissioned on a three-year timescale. The development is leveraged by the existing technical strengths of Indiana University, the University of Kentucky, LANL, the University of Michigan, and Yale University.  This project will partner with the private sector to build a magnetically shielded space for the experiment, atomic magnetometers, and improve magnetic resonance measurements which may have an impact on medical imaging technology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nNeutrons are subatomic particles which, together with the proton, form the core of atomic nuclei. Although neutrons are electrically neutral overall, the laws of physics do not prevent the neutron from having a slight separation of positive and negative electrical charge within their interior, the existence of which would represent a so-called ''electric dipole moment'' (EDM) of the neutron. The discovery of a neutron EDM would be revolutionary to our understanding of why there is more matter than anti-matter in the universe, as the physics responsible for the existence of a neutron EDM is closely related to the physics responsible for the preponderance of matter over anti-matter in the universe.\n\n\nA new experiment designed to search for a neutron EDM at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) is under development. The experiment utilizes an intense source of Ultracold Neutrons (UCN) at LANL, and requires, among other components, a highly uniform magnetic field. The magnetic field is utilized for measurements of the rate at which the UCN's spins undergo rotation about the magnetic field and a strong electric field. If the rate at which the UCN's spins undergo rotation about the magnetic field and electric field changes when the fields point in the same direction and then when the fields point in opposite directions, this would provide evidence for the existence of a neutron EDM. However, this requires careful consideration and accounting for any non-uniformities in the magnetic field.\n\n\nThis award supported work on state-of-the-art design of a magnetic field coil system to create the requisite high uniformity magnetic field. Prototypes of the magnetic field coil system were constructed and evaluated, and results from these prototyping studies informed the design of the final magnetic field coil system. The final magnetic field coil system was then constructed and installed in the magnetically shielded room at LANL for the neutron EDM experiment. A separate system of magnetic field coils required to efficiently guide the UCN's spins was also designed and constructed. This work culminated in the Ph.D. theses of two graduate students, who received forefront training in magnetic field design and custom fabrication and machining techniques.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/27/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: BradleyPlaster\n"
