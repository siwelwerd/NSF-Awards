 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research experience for undergraduates (REU) site has a focus on security of cyber-physical systems such as self-driving cars, unmanned aerial vehicle systems, robots, smart electrical grid systems and internet of things devices that are among the most important devices to secure due to their real-world interaction with humans, other equipment and the environment.\u00a0These devices are also critical to manufacturing efficiency and national competitiveness. This program provides student participants an opportunity to gain experience in developing and analyzing cyber-security-related software for such cyber-physical systems.\u00a0Through this experience, students learn about the process of and techniques for conducting research in cybersecurity, cyber-physical systems and the computing disciplines in general.\u00a0They also come to better understand their own capabilities and interest in pursuing research careers, refining and potentially changing their career and educational goals.\u00a0 The project, thus, promotes the progress of science by allowing students to evaluate the pursuit of careers in research through immersive participation in a real-world research environment, and\u00a0it advances national security and welfare through its focus on the area of cybersecurity.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe projects focusing on topics such as self-driving cars and robots excite student participants and provide the opportunity for hands on work with hardware, allowing students to see the effect of decisions they have made regarding software design and security. Sample projects involve 1) the design of secure coordination systems, intrusion, and malicious data detection, 2) issue prevention and detection, 3) data trustworthiness, 4) sensor data trust assessment, and 5) supervisory control and data acquisition system security, and reliability analytics.\u00a0Through these, students gain exposure to multiple sub-disciplines related to these projects, allowing them to experience in multiple related areas. They also gain an appreciation for the importance of each sub-discipline as well as the opportunity to work on a large project from start to finish in conjunction with their cadre-mates.\u00a0Participating students complete research projects, including software development, results analysis and technical write-ups.\u00a0 They are mentored by North Dakota State University faculty through cadre-group, scheduled one-on-one and ad-hoc meetings.\u00a0 They gain appreciation of the importance of quality assurance processes, particularly for ensuring software security and the safety of cyber-physical systems, and they learn about the software lifecycle and proper software development practices.\u00a0 The projects are designed so that students, despite working on their own research goal and serving as the \"lead scientist\" on this goal, rely on other students for their success.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project Research Experience in Cyber-Security for Cyber-Physical Systems provided over 30 students with an opportunity conduct real-world cybersecurity research related to cyber-physical systems. In addition to students funded by the REU program, a number of additional students received benefit from this program.  Several students participated in follow-on projects (or project completion) during the academic year and several graduate students benefitted from working with the undergraduate researchers (either during the summer or those working on project completion or follow-on projects during the year).\n\nThe project was initially scheduled to be completed over the course of three summers; however, it extended to a fourth due to a reduction in the number of participants during the summer most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.  This allowed us to provide greater support to students who were working on their research from a distance.\n\nDuring the research experience, students conducted a study from start to finish.  They brainstormed with a faculty mentor regarding project ideas, based on suggested topics provided by the faculty member.  Then, they conducted a literature search to gain an understanding of prior work on the topic.  Following this, they designed (with the aid of their mentor) and conducted a research experience and wrote up the results.  In many cases, these papers were submitted for publication.  To-date, as of this writing, 31 publications have been generated from this award (additional papers are still in the process of review or revision).  The majority of them are student research publications (a small number present analysis of the REU itself).\n\nResearch topics spanned a considerable number of areas relevant to cyber-physical system cybersecurity.  They included studies in steganography, fuzzing, penetration testing automation, attacker identification and preventing adversarial machine learning attacks.\n\nWe also provided our undergraduate researchers with a number of professional development opportunities and experiences.  These included training in research ethics, writing training and support and training and support related to experimental design and conducting computer science experiments.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe principal results of the project from the perspective of intellectual merit are the research performed by the students (and the results generated from it), which are summarized in the various published papers that have been produced, and the student learning.  There was demonstrable benefit from program participation.  This was demonstrated in the results of surveys conducted of students each year (which can be found in the published assessment papers).  Additionally, we are already anecdotally hearing anecdotal reports of the benefits that the project has had on students (in some cases, now graduates) career choices, graduate school admissions and other positive outcomes.\n\nBroader Impact\n\nThe principal source of broader impact from this program is the benefits that it provides to students.  The REU site exposed numerous students to cybersecurity and computer science-related research, in many cases for the first time.  This allowed them to see if they had an interest in future careers in this area.  The REU also provided students with an opportunity to work on a larger-scale project than is typical in undergraduate computing curriculum and to develop excellent resume items and experience.\n\nIn addition to the benefits provided to student participants, a number of the projects' research outcomes provide broad public benefit.  Student projects performed analysis and development that can enhance the safety of computing systems, robots and various other electronic devices.  A number of datasets were generated and have been released through data publications, making them available to other researchers (as well as citizen scientists) to use for future research.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/05/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeremy Straub"
