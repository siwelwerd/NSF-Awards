 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Antarctic Dinosaurs project is a media development initiative that seeks to leverage the popularity and charisma of dinosaurs to draw museum audiences into an educational science adventure, exploring the history and transformation of Antarctica and the planet's polar ecosystems, and revealing how understanding changes of the past may help predict and protect our future. This project will address critical gaps in public understanding of polar science concepts, reaching over 8 million museum visitors through the development of new immersive educational content, including a high impact large format film, a traveling exhibition, and an outreach plan that will allow children, families and lifelong learners to participate in meaningful engagements with diverse scientists and STEM professionals.  These products will offer the public a more nuanced understanding of how the field of paleontology connects to other disciplines--from evolutionary biology to climate science--and will provide a deeper appreciation for the pursuit of scientific research in many fields.  By offering a glimpse of the facilities, logistics and support systems that make up Antarctica's unique research community, the project will also highlight the many diverse participants and roles that contribute to Antarctic science, creating STEM role models and inspiring young viewers to consider joining the STEM workforce.  All project efforts seek to portray the southernmost frontiers of the planet as parts of a connected and changing global community, increasing public appreciation for the value of scientific research, the process of science, and participation in STEM pursuits.\r\n\r\nThis project builds on a successful history of collaboration between producers Giant Screen Films and David Clark, Inc., and with the Field Museum.  The project will document the work of scientists conducting research funded by NSF lead proposal #1341304 (Collaborative Research: Understanding the evolution of high-latitude Permo-Triassic paleoenvironments and their vertebrate communities); as well as additional related projects.  Digital filming and photography will support powerful visual storytelling about field work and the science adventure to unearth evidence of dinosaurs and other prehistoric life in Antarctica.  Shoots will take place at McMurdo Station and at field sites in the Shackleton Glacier region, including Shackleton Camp and at several satellite camps where data collection and excavation are planned.  The project will employ cutting-edge high definition (4K) and high dynamic range (HDR) cameras to capture imagery of the continent.  The media content generated will reach the public through a high impact large format film, Antarctic Dinosaurs, for distribution to museum cinemas worldwide (including IMAX and other giant screens).  Content will also be incorporated into narrative video elements in a synonymous traveling exhibition that will be hosted by an extensive list of global museum institutions.  The unique size and emotional impact of the giant screen canvas, as well as diverse exhibition interactions, will make a distant continent seem less remote, building a connection to scientists as adventurers, imparting a greater understanding of polar science, and inspiring a deeper appreciation for the Earth's changes.  An extensive educational outreach plan, encompassing museum events, screenings and panel discussions, industry conferences, social media, and educational resources will be developed.  The film/exhibition collaboration will serve as a model for museum-based practitioners seeking to promote learning across experiences in those venues, and will lay the groundwork to evaluate the integration of science content into new media. The project is supported by NSF's Office of Polar Programs.",
