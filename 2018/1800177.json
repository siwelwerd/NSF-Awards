 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic & Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor John Goeltz of the School of Natural Sciences at California State University, Monterey Bay is developing new classes of liquids for applications in energy fields.  This research targets liquids that can store charge without the addition of any active materials for development of new capabilities for existing battery materials such as fast charging without reduced battery lifetimes and a chemical method of protecting against failure due to overcharging.  This project is especially well suited to the training of undergraduate scientists with diverse interests and career goals.  Development of student researchers' writing and assessment techniques will also be part of the funded project as the students develop and deploy training materials to enable other undergraduate scientists to advance beyond a first-year level skill set in electrochemistry.\r\n\r\nSolvents that exhibit reversible redox activity hold promise in energy conversion and storage yet remain relatively uncommon.  This project involves application of chemical design principles to low-temperature ionic melts known as deep eutectic solvents (DESs) and related materials. Researchers will synthesize and characterize precursor molecules and prepare redox-active liquid ionic materials. They are characterizing these materials by rheology, voltammetry, UV-vis spectroelectrochemistry, and 2-dimensional NMR techniques. Undergraduate researchers are: 1. thermally and electrochemically characterizing a solvent in multiple oxidation states; 2. measuring the energetics of hydrogen bonded assemblies that define the solvents through voltammetry and NMR; and 3. demonstrating the first bifunctional redox active solvents that can be reversibly reduced or oxidized and isolated in any of three oxidation states.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These researchers were trained in research methods that leave them prepared to contribute to our current and future energy challenges, including renewable fuels and improved energy storage.  Many presented their work in oral and poster sessions at national meetings, and two entered PhD programs in chemistry at UC campuses despite not having majored in chemistry, granted entrance based on the strength of their publication records.\n\nLaboratory work focused on deep eutectic solvents (DESs), an engaging class of materials most commonly prepared by mixing an organic salt and a hydrogen bond donor.  If selected properly, the resulting material is a fluid at room temperature despite being composed of what were solids under the same conditions.  The most highly cited paper to date supported by this funding, \"Ternary Deep Eutectic Solvent Behavior of Water and Urea?Choline Chloride Mixtures,\" quantified the effects of water added to the most common DES.  This work has been popular because 1. it quantifies an phenomenon that is nearly always present in DES work (adventitious water) and 2. it reveals a new set of easily accessible, non-toxic materials with interesting properties.  By combining three common and low-cost materials (water, choline chloride, and urea), one can prepare a material with a freezing point of -50 C (-58 F).\n\nUndergraduate researchers also published peer reviewed papers describing a method and materials for introducing students to electrochemistry; an electrochromic device that changes color with applied voltage; and method of tuning a \"safe shut-down\" material that could be further developed to prevent battery fires.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/09/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John C Goeltz"
