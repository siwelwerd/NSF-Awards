 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific societies are a critical stakeholder and leader in bringing about cultural change toward open data across the sciences. The American Geophysical Union (AGU) has played a key role in being a change agent in open science specifically by leading the Earth and space science communities in enabling research data to be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). The AGU proposes to host a workshop and one-on-one follow-up conversations with targeted societies within the Earth and space sciences and in adjacent disciplines. The goal of the proposal is to engage and empower more scientific societies on their way to adoption of open science principles through education, tools, materials, and consultation. The intellectual merit is in evaluation of the effectiveness of the open and FAIR data tool suite for societies and their members and in moving societies forward in open science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Additional conversations were had with participants that could not make it to the meeting increasing exposure to 25 societies. \nParticipating societies provided updates on their progress in encouraging and requiring open and FAIR data sharing.  This sharing brought an awareness of both common challenges and those that are more unique, but important in cross-discipline, transdisciplinary, or collaborative efforts. \nThere was positive support to continue working together on the challenges around data and software sharing as a broad community. \nWorkshop output: Stall, Shelley. (2019). Open and FAIR Data - Meeting of Societies - Workshop Reports. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6251316\nWith limitations on travel due to the COVID19 pandemic we added the third goal to the effort to host a seminar series on data sharing. During 2021, we conducted the Data Sharing Seminar Series for Societies, in collaboration with 10 other societies and federations:\n\nAAAS/Science\nAmerican Astronomical Society (AAS)\nAmerican Chemical Society (ACS)\nAmerican Meteorological Society (AMS), Board on Data Stewardship \nBritish Ecological Society (BES)\nCouncil of Scientific Society Presidents (CSSP)\nEcological Society of America (ESA)\nFederation of American Societies For Experimental Biology (FASEB)\nFederation of Associations in Behavioral and Brain Sciences (FABBS)\nInternational Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC)\n\n\n \nEach month we held a seminar on different aspects of sharing data.  The final seminar, our \"Pinnacle Seminar\", is schedule for April 2022 where each of the collaborators will participate in panels that include:\n\nBringing awareness to scientific societies on how they can help meet the aspirations of open and FAIR digital research products and encourage the culture of sharing.\nDiscussing how societies can provide incentives for sharing data and software through actions such as updates to honor and awards criteria. \nSharing current practices and resources for updating publication policy and author guidelines around availability statements and citations for data and software. \n\n \nNearly 800 people registered for the entire series.  An average of 107 attended each event, and there was an additional average of 213 views (as of 20 February 2022) of the materials for each seminar. \nThe titles, speakers, slides, and links to the recordings are preserved in our Zenodo Community: https://zenodo.org/communities/data-sharing-seminar-series-for-societies/.  \nThe seminar series is promoted on: https://WeShareData.org \nWe continue this work in an upcoming workshop in March 2022 hosted by AAU, APLU, and AGU to connect the goals of the APARD project with the societies and their researchers.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/23/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Shelley Stall"
