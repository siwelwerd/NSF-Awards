 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professors Cort Anastasio and Davide Donadio of the University of California at Davis are funded by the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Division of Chemistry to study chemical reactions that take place on the surfaces of ice and snow. Snow contains a variety of chemical contaminants, some of which are toxic.  It was originally thought that contaminants in deposited snow are preserved, bit recent work shows that these chemicals can be degraded by sunlight.  These photochemical reactions can remove toxic contaminants from the snow.  However, they can also make toxic products, some of which are released to the air.  Unfortunately, understanding of these processes is limited, in part because there are few studies.  But there is also a discrepancy in the existing studies: some report that sunlight reactions are faster in snow than in water, while other studies find no difference.\r\n\r\nIn this project, an understanding about how conditions (e.g., snow, ice) impact photochemistry are being investigated.  As well, an understanding about the mechanisms responsible for making snow photochemistry faster are being considered.  These goals are being pursued with a combination of laboratory experiments and modeling of chemical contaminants on snow.  This project includes outreach to the public, highlighting the impact of chemistry on everyday life. It also includes activities at K-12 schools, and the training of undergraduate and graduate students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSunlight degrades numerous organic and inorganic molecules in deposited snow. These reactions are important because they can destroy toxic pollutants, release reactive gases into the atmosphere, and alter ice core records of the past. Prior to our project, there were significant disagreements about how quickly molecules in/on snow were degraded by sunlight: some studies showed enhancements for molecules in (or on) ice compared to in solution and others showed no acceleration.  There was also little understanding about why degradation could be enhanced.\n\nIn this project, we studied the light-driven degradation of five environmentally relevant pollutant molecules in solution and in/on ice: four organic compounds (that are common products of hydrocarbon combustion and wildfires) and nitrate.  The four carbon-containing aromatic molecules that we examined all showed a consistent picture: slowest loss in solution, faster loss inside ice pellets, and fastest loss at the surface of ice pellets or lab-grown snow.  Relative to solution, the ice enhancements depended on the molecule and ranged from factors of 3 &ndash; 6 in ice to 15 &ndash; 77 at the surface of snow.  These larger enhancements can decrease lifetimes of the pollutants in snow-covered regions. \n\nWe also studied the reasons why light-driven degradation can be enhanced, which can result from by two potential factors: a change in light absorption by the molecule and/or a change in the efficiency with which the molecule breaks down after absorbing light.  Based on molecular modeling, we determined that light absorption is increased for the four organic pollutants at the surface of ice, but that increases in degradation efficiency were the dominant factor.  We also examined an inorganic compound &ndash; nitrate &ndash; that is present throughout the environment.  Our past results showed that nitrate in ice behaves the same as in solution, while our new results show that its decay was enhanced by roughly a factor of 6 at the surface of snow.  Molecular modeling of light absorption reveals that the enhancement in nitrate loss at the snow surface is primarily because of an increase in reaction efficiency.\n\nResults from this grant indicate that nitrate behaves differently from the four organic molecules.  This suggests that there are systematic differences between how sunlight degrades organic and inorganic molecules in solution and in/on ice.  Overall, our work indicates that reactions at the surface of ice might increase the degradation of pollutants in snow-covered regions, although the environmental impact of this enhancement depends on how much of a given pollutant is present at the ice surface compared to in the ice. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/28/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Cort Anastasio"
