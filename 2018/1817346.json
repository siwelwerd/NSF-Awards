 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advances in wireless communication technologies have enabled communications among vehicles, and between vehicles and the associated infrastructure. These technologies can be significantly leveraged to enhance the safety and performance of current roadway transportation systems. This study seeks to understand how traffic information spreads among vehicles and between vehicles and the roadside infrastructure, and how that data can be efficiently collected and used to develop real-time traffic management strategies, so as to improve safety, mobility, and sustainability. Further, through the education programs at Illinois Institute of Technology and Purdue University, this study will aid the development of new skills for the workforce that can leverage these emerging technologies for innovative applications, and broaden research and educational opportunities for under-represented groups.\r\n\r\nThis study seeks to develop real-time coordinated traffic management strategies built upon dynamic information propagation and aggregation in connected vehicle systems. To achieve this goal, it investigates three interrelated research challenges: (i) information propagation dynamics, (ii) distributed information aggregation, and (iii) coordinated real-time traffic management. These methods bridge advanced scientific knowledge in computer science, transportation science, and operations research. Further, they adapt well-known and/or emerging concepts in traffic flow theory, network modeling, wireless communication, optimization theory, stochastic modeling, and algorithm design. The novelty of this research is highlighted through the holistic consideration of the unique features of a connected vehicle system: a distributed system with dynamic information propagating therein. At a fundamental level, the study outcomes will contribute to scientific knowledge and technologies for connected vehicle systems in the following aspects: (i) a better understanding of the interactions between information dynamics and traffic flow dynamics; (ii) the opening of a new research venue related to distributed information processing methods; and (iii) the understanding of real-time traffic management through the coordination of individual vehicle knowledge and centralized traffic control.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We found that both road/intersection geometric features (i.e., the size, the angle and the number of the branches at an intersection and the number of lanes, the capacity on a road) and traffic congestion levels significantly influence the levels of interference, which further affects the information connectivity and propagation via V2V. Figure 1 shows one of the results.</p>\n<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Developed mathematical formulations to estimate the information propagation delay via V2V on a road segment. The numerical experiments based on NGSIM data illustrate that our analytical formulations are able to precisely estimate the time delay of information propagation on a one-way or two-way road segment under various traffic conditions; the connectivity and delay of V2V communication network is significantly affected by the traffic congestion levels on a road segment.</p>\n<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Built upon our results in items 1) and (2), we established a mathematical simulation model named as IT-CTM to track information spreading on a road segment, integrating existing cell transmission model (CTM) to capture temporal-spatial traffic flow dynamics. Numerical experiments based on simulation and field data indicate that the IT-CTM can accurately track the dynamical movements and coverage of information wave as a single or multiple piece(s) of information propagating via V2V on a one-way or two-way road segment. Figure 2 shows one of the results.</p>\n<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Built upon our results in items 1)-3), we further developed a network-wide mathematical simulation model named as INFM-CTM to capture network wide information dissemination via V2V. Mainly, the INFM-CTM is able to track information propagating on a road segment by IT-CTM, at intersection by INFM, and further capture information wave front dissemination over a roadway network by integrating IT-CTM and INFM.

Both the theoretical analysis and the simulation results indicate that our local (or biased) information provision strategy outperforms global (or perfect) information provision strategy for improving system level network performance under medium or high network traffic loads. The merits are more significant as the penetration of smart vehicles increases over the network. Figure 6 shows the some results regarding biased information provision.
