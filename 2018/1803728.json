 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mixtures of small, rigid particles in solutions of polymers are widely used in advanced technologies such as 3-D printing and energy storage. The particles impart function, such as conductivity needed to transport electrons through 3-D printed wires. The polymers are added to control the flow behavior of the mixture. Tuning the properties of these mixtures requires controlling the distribution of the particles -- conductivity, for example, requires the particles to form a connected network. One factor that affects particle distribution during flow is shear-induced migration, in which particles migrate away from the walls and accumulate near the center of a narrow channel. This project will use experiments to determine the effect of polymers in solution on the distribution of particles as they flow through narrow channels. This knowledge will provide new routes to control the structure and functional properties of particulate suspensions for applications in next-generation energy storage and transport.\r\n\r\nSuspensions of microscale particles in complex fluids offer transformative opportunities in materials engineering for energy storage and transport. Miniaturizing these technologies requires increasing the suspension conductivity, by ensuring particle connectivity, while minimizing clogging in small channels. Complex fluid additives such as polymers or surfactants needed for suspension function or stability, however, may alter particle connectivity and density. Hence controlling particle density in the presence of additives is essential for attaining the desired functional properties of confined particulate suspensions. Polymers added to particulate suspensions may alter shear-induced migration, one mechanism that generates non-uniform density profiles in confined flows, in at least two ways: by generating aggregates or by enhancing normal stresses. Systematic understanding of how to control microscale particle migration in polymer solutions is currently lacking. The objective of this project is to understand how polymers alter shear-induced migration of colloidal particles during microchannel flow. To test the hypothesis that the extent of migration reflects competition between polymer-enhanced normal stresses and polymer-driven migration, the PI will use bulk rheology and microchannel confocal imaging experiments to characterize the normal stresses and particle microstructure in strongly and weakly migrating suspensions containing either adsorbing or non-adsorbing polymers. Measurements of particle velocity and concentration profiles will be compared to existing theoretical models for shear-induced migration of hard-sphere particles in simple liquids. This plan of work will identify the relative impact of the two competing mechanisms on shear-induced migration, leading to unprecedented control over particle density in models of technologically important materials and allowing existing models for shear-induced migration to be extended to include polymer-mediated interactions. This project will thus generate new design rules for suspensions to maximize particle connectivity during complex fluid flow while minimizing clogging. The PI will disseminate results to scientists in Houston's energy and medical industries through tutorial workshops aimed at oil and gas professionals and through the Texas Soft Matter meeting, which she founded and organizes, and will expand her ongoing outreach activities to K-12 students and the general public to include new hands-on activities on complex fluid flow.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Because colloidal particles are small, typically between 50 nm and 5 microns, thermal fluctuations can drive their motion in solutions. Particles are a convenient way to add functional properties to materials (for example, enhanced optical, electrical, or mechanical properties) when mixed with complex fluids that contain macromolecules and/or surfactants. These additives affect the interactions between the colloidal particles. Processing routes for these particle/macromolecule feedstocks (for example, printing, coating, spraying, or jetting) typically involve flow through narrow geometries (for example, nozzles, thin films). In such confined geometries, the non-uniform flow profile can drive changes in the particle concentration via shear-induced migration. Thus, this project?s original goal was to understand how the presence of polymer additives affect shear-induced migration as colloid-polymer mixtures are flowed through microchannels.</p>\n<p>Intellectual Merit: The outcomes from our project were focused on two main areas. First, we explored the effects of polymer additives on the shear and extensional rheology of colloid-polymer depletion mixtures, in which non-adsorbing polymers induce effective entropic attractions between the particles. (1) First, we showed that adding depletant polymers of various molecular weights to a concentrated suspension of particles could enhance shear thickening, and the mechanism of shear thickening depended on the polymer size. Based on this result, in which we compared the polymer size when fully extended in flow to the average separation between the colloidal particle, we conducted both shear and extensional measurements on polymer solutions and depletion mixtures. (2) In polymer solutions without added particles, we found that the molecular weight of the polymer affected the extensional relaxation time of the solutions, determined using dripping-on-substrate rheology. The increase in the scaling exponent of the extensional relaxation time with polymer concentration is attributed to coil-stretch hysteresis, which screens excluded volume interactions under extensional flow. (3) In suspensions containing both particles and polymers, we found that adding polymer delays the breakup time of colloid-polymer mixtures, and that the extensional relaxation time is controlled by the polymer (and its properties). Together, these results suggest that particle and polymer concentration provide separate knobs by which to tune the shear and extensional responses, respectively.</p>\n<p>Second, we explored the phase behavior, structure, dynamics, and rheology of colloid-polymer bridging mixtures, in which polymers adsorbed to the particle surfaces generate enthalpic attractions when they bridge between two particles.
