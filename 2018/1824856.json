 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engaging in solving problems through engineering design develops the critical thinking and problem solving skills needed to address future societal and environmental challenges. In order to develop such skills in all learners, the new K-12 science standards and the Next Generation Science Standards include engineering design as a significant focus across all grade levels - from kindergarten through high school. However, integrating engineering design into their curriculum will be a significant challenge for teachers nationwide, as K-12 teachers are not prepared to facilitate high quality engineering design activities and generally have little knowledge or experience related to engineering. New models of instruction and teacher development are needed. This design and development project will create an engineering education program that links students' field trip experiences in an interactive science center directly to classroom experiences while helping teachers learn about teaching engineering design through working with their own students. The project will serve as a sustainable model for helping teachers develop expertise and confidence in facilitating engineering design curricula. Improving K-12 teachers' capacity to engage students in authentic engineering design is a critical step towards increasing the number of students pursuing an engineering career.\r\n\r\nThis project will follow a design-based research model focused on the design and testing of an intervention through multiple iterations and will involve a collaborative partnership between a university and an interactive science center. The intervention will consist of engineering design field trip experiences and coordinated classroom lesson plans to be conducted in K-12 classrooms before and after the field trips. Teachers will be supported through an online guide and curricular supports within the lesson plans. Qualitative and quantitative data collected will include observations, video recordings, pre- and post-assessments, interviews of students and teachers, surveys and examples of student work. Analysis will focus on two primary areas: (1) Identifying the learning opportunities for students through coordinated field trip and classroom extension programs that engage students in engineering design and (2) Identifying the curricular features that support teachers in effective engineering design instruction and lead to teacher learning about facilitating engineering design curriculum. Research in these areas will lead to best practices for developing engineering design curriculum and facilitation that advance both student and teacher learning.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This is a significant shift from earlier sets of K-12 science standards and is a positive step forward in introducing students to engineering; however, K?12 teachers will need support implementing these standards. Interactive science museums have playful science and engineering focused exhibits and activities, and staff with expertise in science learning, making them well-positioned to offer engineering design programs for schools through fieldtrips. Unfortunately, field trip experiences are rarely well connected to classroom learning, a missed opportunity for ensuring deep learning of engineering.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Engineering Explorations project created a program that took advantage of the varied opportunities of schools, museums, and after school programs across a community to support engineering instruction for youth, while building the capacity of educators and meeting the needs of each organization. Specifically, MOXI, The Wolf Museum of Exploration + Innovation and the University of California, Santa Barbara partnered to develop and test 9 modules of mutually reinforcing classroom and field trip activities that provide engineering learning experiences for youth, while increasing local teachers? capacity to deliver high-quality engineering learning opportunities that align with school standards.</p>\n<p>Each of the nine field trip activities focuses on a different engineering design challenge completed at MOXI during school field trips. While the field trip activities are stand-alone programs, pre- and post-field trip classroom activities support the field trip learning. Classrooms that complete the full module for any field trip complete two pre-field trip activities and one post-field trip activity, taught by the teacher in the school classroom, in addition to the field trip program. The first activity engages students in an experiment that introduces science ideas that are used in the engineering design challenge. The second activity introduces students to the engineering design process. The third activity, facilitated by informal educators during the field trip to MOXI, engages students in an authentic engineering design challenge and the fourth activity is a reflective activity that ties the first three activities together and links back to school standards. Each activity is completed in 50 minutes and is tied to grade-level standards in science, math, and literacy.</p>\n<p>In addition to supporting student learning, the Engineering Explorations curriculum also provides opportunities for teachers to develop expertise and confidence in teaching engineering design through educative curriculum elements including content storylines, explanation of the rationale behind specific pedagogical choices, descriptions of anticipated student ideas, and suggested prompts to elicit student ideas and support student sense-making.</p>\n<p>The field trip programs were tested with over 5,000 K-6 students and the full classroom modules were tested with over 600 students and twenty-seven teachers. Several of the lesson plans and engineering design challenges were adapted and tested for an afterschool program serving girls in grades K-8. Observations, video analysis, interviews, surveys, and feedback informed improvements to the curriculum over multiple iterations of the design.</p>\n<p>Over 15,000 children were exposed to engineering design through MOXI field trips and more than 500 teachers were exposed to engineering design through the teacher guides and observing the facilitated field trips. Teachers can access the curricular resources through public websites at MOXI and UCSB. The MOXI Engineering Explorations field trip program will broadly impact Santa Barbara?s school children. Twenty-two percent of Santa Barbara?s school children live below the poverty level and 14.5% of the Santa Barbara Unified School District student population are classified as homeless. The project will also serve as a model for helping teachers develop expertise and confidence in facilitating engineering curricula.</p>\n<p>The project has also led to findings about how to teach engineering to children, particularly the need to help students understand the criteria and constraints of a problem, identify when early prototypes fail, and focus on the importance of testing engineering designs. In addition, it has led to findings about how children talk about their own solutions and how they use physical prototypes to convey ideas. Finally, this project has led to models for researcher-practitioner partnerships across formal and informal institutions and for developing curricula that span informal and formal educational contexts.</p>\n<p>To date, the project has produced 13 peer-reviewed publications, with further papers in development and work has been shared through 28 conference presentations.
