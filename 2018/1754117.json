 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will document seaweeds (algae) living on deep coral reefs around the Hawaiian Islands. Visible light reaches a depth of 100 to 500 feet in the clear ocean waters of the tropics and subtropics. As a result, coral reefs of this deep region, called the mesophotic zone, include seaweed species that provide food and habitat for many marine animals, including game fish. However, this region is challenging to explore because it is beyond the limits of traditional SCUBA diving. As a result, seaweed species that live on deep coral reefs are not well-documented. Researchers will identify hundreds of seaweed specimens collected over the past 10 years and will share these data widely. New species will receive scientific names that recognize the long-standing significance of seaweeds in Native Hawaiian culture. Results of the project will also uncover how deep coral reefs may help shallow coral reefs recover after damage. Shallow coral reefs are important sources of tourist and fisheries revenue but are prone to disturbance. The project will train undergraduate and graduate students, including members of under-represented groups, and support the professional development of an early-career researcher. Researchers will share with the public the cultural, ecological and economic importance of seaweeds through an educational, traveling museum exhibit and a television program that will be accessible online to K-12 educators.\r\n\r\nThis project will bring together the taxonomic and phylogenetic expertise of several researchers who specialize in algae of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Researchers will discover and analyze the mesophotic seaweed flora of this region as well as test hypotheses regarding patterns of biodiversity in deep-reef ecosystems. A DNA barcoding approach will be used to initially characterize the almost 1,800 mesophotic algal specimens already in hand. Morphological data will complement this approach to flag a subset of species or groups of species for more in-depth study. Comparison of chloroplast genomes of select species will allow an additional level of analysis of the differences between shallow and mesophotic seaweeds, which experience different light environments. Outcomes of this project will include improved understanding of the biology and biogeography of the Hawaiian mesophotic seaweeds, the description of 60-80 new species, and long-term archiving of specimens.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
