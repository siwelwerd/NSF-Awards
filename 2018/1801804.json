 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support two workshops: \"Representation Theory of Algebraic Groups and Lie Superalgebras\" at the University of Georgia in June 2018 and \"Geometric and Categorical Representation Theory\" at Louisiana State University in May, 2019. These workshops are part of the annual Southeastern Lie Theory Workshop Series held at universities in the southeastern region of the U.S. since 2009. The aim of this workshop series is to bring together senior and junior researchers, as well as graduate students, in order to build cohesive research groups in various aspects of Lie theory, to stimulate and enhance research collaborations in Lie theory, and to instill a strong tradition of research and research-oriented education in the region. A long-term goal is for the workshop series to foster the research development of mathematics departments in the southeastern region of the U.S. in order to attract more minority and underrepresented groups to the mathematical sciences.\r\n\r\nRepresentation theory of Lie algebras, algebraic groups, Lie superalgebras, and related algebraic structures has become a central research area in mathematics, with numerous applications in many areas of mathematics and theoretical physics. The first workshop in Georgia in 2018 will focus on the representation theory of algebraic groups and Lie superalgebras. The second workshop in Louisiana in 2019 will focus on categorification and geometric approaches to representation theory. Each workshop will feature one or two main speakers, each giving two or three expository talks in the theme area, which are accessible to graduate students and postdocs. In addition, there will be invited talks by other researchers. There will be ample time for informal discussion among participants. Considerable time will be devoted to informal discussion among participants in small groups, led by invited team leaders chosen from among the participants. There will also be contributed talk sessions to provide opportunities for junior researchers, postdocs, and advanced graduate students to disseminate their research. The website for this workshop series is: http://pi.math.virginia.edu/lieworkshops/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
