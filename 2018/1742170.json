 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the National Science Foundation's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (S-STEM) program, this project is providing support to low-income students with demonstrated financial need and academic promise to succeed in mechanical engineering at University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC).  STEM industries face a looming challenge and opportunity as skilled baby boomers begin to retire and leave the workforce.  Recognizing current and future needs for a diverse skilled workforce in mechanical engineering and the rising cost of higher education that acts as a barrier for many talented students with interests in engineering, this S-STEM Track 2 (Design and Development: Single Institution) project focuses resources and research on financial support coupled with curricular and co-curricular activities designed to facilitate student degree attainment, career development, and employability in STEM-related jobs.  To support student efforts to earn baccalaureate degrees in mechanical engineering at UMBC, approximately forty-five academically talented undergraduate students with demonstrated financial need, including students transferring from Maryland community colleges, will receive scholarship support of up to $6,000 per year for up to four years.   Scholarship recipients will participate in an integrated set of activities designed to support their success.\r\n\r\nRecognizing the potential of engineering to address societal issues, the project engages students in undergraduate research experiences that apply mechanical and bio-engineering approaches to solve human problems associated with aging.  The project builds on an established partnership between the UMBC and Maryland community colleges to improve and investigate the transfer experience of community college students to four-year programs, student retention at UMBC, and job placement and pathways to graduate school and employment.  A mixed-method quantitative and qualitative research study will examine the implementation and outcomes of proactive recruitment; participation in selected high impact practices, such as orientation, one-to-one faculty mentoring, peer mentoring, and community building; participation in research-focused activities, such as research seminars and undergraduate research experiences; and participation in career and professional development activities.  The project will examine and compare outcomes, such as retention, graduation, and success, of students participating in project activities to the outcomes of peers not participating in project supports and activities.",

In this funded NSF grant, our long-term goal is to develop a highly trained workforce that meets the current and future technological needs of society.

Support services for these students included faculty mentoring, peer support, summer orientations, access to tutoring, and help with identifying careers and research immersions. The project also fostered a formal consortium relationship between UMBC and local community colleges, via faculty visiting community colleges, thus providing a doorway for easy transfer of community college students to the ME programs. Mentoring of the scholarship recipients occurs through one-on-one mentoring with a faculty member/investigator, peer group mentoring, community building activities, and research experiences/projects and internships.

The retention rate within the scholarship program is 85%, with only 9 students left the scholarship program. For the 9 students who left our scholarship program, they either transferred to another university or stay at UMBC to continue to pursue their BS degrees.&nbsp; Among the 42 scholars who were retained and graduated from the ME undergraduate program, 64% are currently working in industry and 33% enrolled in the graduate school.</p>\n<p>This project has provided insights on effective strategy to achieve the program goals. Our program proactively recruits, enrolls, and graduates students in Mechanical Engineering with special emphasis on women and underrepresented minorities, by providing scholarships, academic intervention, multilayered faculty mentoring, and an institutional support infrastructure to increase retention of the participants and their success. The cooperative relationship between UMBC and local community colleges in Maryland have improved the transfer process and increased the number of students transferring to the four year Mechanical Engineering program at UMBC.&nbsp; The research experiences via research seminars and access to research laboratories in engineering have facilitated the participant's retention and supplemented their skill base. More than half of students in our scholarship program (55%) have engaged in research activities in research labs and more than 40% had internships. The academic and professional development opportunities have helped them identify potential industrial employment (i.e. early career placement) and/or successful paths for graduate study.
