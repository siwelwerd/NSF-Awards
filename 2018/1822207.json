 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most public health systems around the world are investing into initiatives promoting and supporting the convergence of medicine and technology for improving the healthcare delivery systems. These efforts rely on integrating sensing, logistics, computing, actuation and communication functionalities in everyday practices. The University of Arizona will work with Arizona State University, University of Southern California, University of Connecticut, and Southern Illinois University to form a new IUCRC for Networked Embedded, Smart and Trusted Things (NESTT). The vision of NESTT is to contribute to the development of an equitable, safe and secure connected world. NESTT will achieve this vision by focusing on creating holistic IoT solutions, integrating technology disciplines with expertise in medicine, law, business, and humanities.\r\n\r\nIn order to make these transformative approaches and technologies a reality, machine learning and artificial intelligence are some of the emerging tools for processing the massive amounts of IoT data and information that will shift the medical decision making processes from simple binary modes to complex \"nuanced\" and \"near real-time\" models. UofA NESTT site will co-organized workshops to design industry specifications and prototype health logistics appliances, wearable sensor systems, ambient intelligence and A.I. data algorithms that can be integrated effectively into the regulatory framework and processes of the healthcare delivery system by enabling the IoT advanced technology solutions planned at the other NESTT nodes.\r\n\r\nThere is trend in digitalization of medicine and healthcare, especially with the emergence of the Internet of Things which will disrupt the healthcare industry in this decade. UA NESTT site will investigate this digital transformation through the entire value chain, from discovery to bedside. Health platforms designed to address unmet needs and improve medical access to underserved large populations will provide useful solutions to the global healthcare challenges. UA NESTT academic, clinical and business partners will contribute their expertise to provide contextualization and standardization of information to offer real-world insights in digital transformation of the healthcare sector.\r\n\r\nThe agenda and documentation of activities for the NESTT IUCRC planning meetings will be made available on UofA's website for the Center for Applied Nanobioscience and Medicine (https://phoenixmed.arizona.edu/anbm ). It will be maintained until the establishment of NESTT, and then merged with the NESTT site.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
