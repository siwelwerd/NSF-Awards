 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will digitize and modernize an extensive long-term marine fish, invertebrate, and algae collection and integrate specimens, documenting research by the Vantuna Research Group (VRG), into The Moore Laboratory of Zoology (MLZ), a museum well known for an outstanding bird and mammal museum of approximately 65,000 specimens from the west coast and southwest United States, Mexico and Latin America.  This unique VRG collections includes over 686,000 specimens from five decades of intensive surveys of marine habitat in Southern California, representing the largest spatial scale marine study in the region and longest continual time series of nearshore reef habitats in the world.  Consolidation of this meticulously curated collection into the MLZ enables long-term preservation of the specimens, makes specimens publicly available through digital records, and actively integrates the VRG's field-based program with the forthcoming MLZ genomics center.  The specimens will not only enhance cutting-edge, biological research but also will continue to be used in undergraduate courses and research.  In addition, specimens will be incorporated into educational displays and exhibits within the MLZ to enhance public outreach.\r\n\r\nOver the course of the project, all marine specimens will be moved to a new compactor system where they can be safely and permanently housed in this effort to integrate field and museum research programs.  Individual specimens will be digitized, with their data managed in Arctos and shared with iDigBio (iDigBio.org).  These collections comprise nearly 1,000 fish species and 400 marine sediment infaunal species from rocky reefs, kelp beds and nearshore habitats. The collection includes a wide range of specimen types - adult and larval fish, fish tissues, fish otoliths, fish gonads, fish gut contents, infaunal specimens, plankton and algae samples. The specimens not only encompass the full spatial extent of the southern California rocky reef ecosystem, but also represent over 40 years of monthly collections. All specimens will be made available for loan to researchers. As an outcome of this project, researchers and undergraduate students will be able to seamlessly cross platforms, including field-based research, data intensive analysis, and genomics. This 'end to end' vision from molecules through marine ecology represent an opportunity to foster specimen-based research for long-term assessment of an important ecological region in the face of global environmental changes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Historically, this natural history collection was housed in improper facilities and although well maintained, specimen records were inaccessible online and thus only utilized by a small network of collaborators who were aware of it. Over the past four years, project staff have been organizing, curating, and digitizing this marine biodiversity collection with the support of this award to make this extensive collection finally accessible to the broader research community. These efforts included uploading and georeferencing all specimens and data, making them publicly available through online repositories including Arctos, VertNet and iDigBio, and relocation of the specimens to a new state-of-the-art climate- and access-controlled space outfitted with museum-quality shelving. Twenty Occidental undergraduate students participated in specimen curation through a 2-credit museum science class and 14 additional undergraduate students have worked directly with the collection through directed research projects under the guidance of the Co-PIs. Three undergraduate students were hired using award funds to work in the collection to meet the goals and objectives of this project. As an element of the newly-renovated Moore Laboratory of Zoology building, curated displays have been designed to highlight the collection and to enable public outreach through tours.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A supplementary award through the NSF Research Experience for Post-baccalaureate Students (REPS) program supported a full-time post-bac participant for 12 months. The REPS participant primarily focused on integrating the use of the specimens in college-level course curriculum at Occidental by creating lab modules that highlight the biodiversity present in the collection. In addition, the REPS participant dedicated one day per week at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County and worked&nbsp;closely with the curator and the collections manager of the ichthyology collection to learn best practices and apply them to the collection at Occidental.&nbsp;The REPS participant worked with PI Pondella to develop, test, and implement field protocols for collecting whole specimens and samples during course field trips. This facilitated undergraduate student participation in the full museum curation process from specimen collection to publishing records on Arctos and iDigBio - over 300 whole fish specimens were collected and added to the collection during the lifetime of this award, and growth at this rate is expected to continue. Courses that utilized the collection include Marine Biology (BIO105), General Zoology (BIO115), Biology of Marine Fishes (BIO356), Biological Oceanography (BIO369), and Museum Science (BIO310), in addition to faculty-led directed research (BIO395). Over the past 4 years, this award enabled visits or research experiences to the collection for over 450 individuals, including biology majors and non-majors, local high school students, volunteers, and children from Occidental&rsquo;s Child Development Center (ages 2-5).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/30/2023<br>\nModified by: Daniel&nbsp;Pondella</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1756456/1756456_10556484_1703952816790_IMG_0054--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1756456/1756456_10556484_1703952816790_IMG_0054--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Marine Biodiversity Collection\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1756456/1756456_10556484_1703952816790_IMG_0054--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Marine Biodiversity Collection\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Marine Biodiversity Collection in its permanent home -
