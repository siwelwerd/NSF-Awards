 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapid accumulation of information stored as computer files, such as images, videos, etc. require a lot of computer and internet data storage. The ways we maintain computer data today may cost a lot of money and energy (especially cooling); also, the materials on which the files are written are not too stable - they get spoiled with time, so that data may be eventually lost as a matter of few decades. To solve this issue, a new technology of writing and reading digital data in the molecular strings will be developed, based on DNA, the molecules from which the genetic code is also made. All living cells rely on DNA molecules for storing the instructions to run our cells and tissues, and these molecules are more stable than magnetic tape or paper. If successful, this DNA-based storage of computer data would readily retain all of the world`s current electronic data.\r\n\r\nTo develop a DNA-based data storage technology, a coding scheme that can reliably write and read back data in segments of DNA is proposed. One approach will involve the use of combinatorial molecular barcodes for addressing and random access, to generate the data blocks as well. Synthesis schemes to write long segments of DNA will be employed, where millions of such segment will be generated in parallel. Longer segments allow one to divide large files into fewer segments and thus require shorter index and random access barcodes. The use of nanopore DNA sequencers that generate long sequences will permit reading this data. Sophisticated mathematical coding techniques will be utilized to robustly reconstruct such a written message after accounting for errors specific to the write and read platforms, with a special emphasis on using nanopore technology. The coding techniques are tailored to the higher error rates in nanopore sequencing, which is the most promising for a scalable sequencing scheme. A DNA storage simulator will also be developed, that will allow researchers to model specific application needs, using predefined or custom error models for DNA write and read platforms and a variety of coding models for addresses and data. This will allow the trade-offs between cost, robustness and efficiency to be simulated at data scales from Gigabytes to Exabytes. Several cohorts of students will be trained in the field on the interface of genetics, biochemistry, electrical engineering and coding theory in the course of the proposed work.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This data includes our country?s notable accomplishments and history, our administrative and experiential data, and even our environment?s genetic makeup.  Current media storage technologies lack the capacity required to maintain the sheer volume of data being generated, and lack the persistence required to store data in the longer-term, ideally for millennia.  If we continue with current technologies, the cost of long-term storage of our data will become impossible to maintain.\n\nTo solve this problem Our approach is focused on a DNA storage compendium.  We will develop efficient and robust molecular technologies and computational architecture for storing information in DNA.  The promise of DNA storage is impressive.  DNA is extremely dense and extraordinarily stable, theoretically allowing for the long-term storage of data on the scale of exabytes.  Potentially, this approach would entail only a small fraction of the current cost, given the advantages of DNA?s compression and chemical stability.\n\nThere are several challenges in DNA storage, where previous attempts fall short.  Our approach had major advantages over these previous efforts.  First, the challenge of writing data into DNA at scale requires a multidisciplinary approach: a significant amount of error correction is needed in order efficiently and cheaply write and read from DNA storage.  We developed coding schemes that are used to synthesize and sequence DNA for data storage in a scalable fashion.\n\nSecond, we developed a method to ?random access data.?  That is, the ability to read just the data one is looking for, without reading out all data that is stored.  Previous DNA-based random-access schemes have significant limitations and high costs; we are in the process of developing much cheaper technology to get access to stored data.\n\nThird, to provide long-term storage, we developed a DNA-based system that allows for an essentially unlimited number of read and write operations.  In existing schemes, read operations ?use up? the sample of DNA, and so after too many reads the system will fail.  We have developed a technology to store DNA in ?information packets? in a reusable molecular format, so that we can repetitively read the specific information without disturbing or destroying the DNA storage media.  Moreover, this DNA-substrate storage media has the potential under the appropriate storage conditions to be maintained for centuries if not longer.\n\nOverall, our approach provided an efficient and robust reusable scheme for data storage at enormous scale, where other schemes fail or become extremely costly.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/12/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Hanlee Ji"
