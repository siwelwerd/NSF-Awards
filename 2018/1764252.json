 "awd_abstract_narration": "Enantiomers are two molecules that have the same arrangement of chemical bonds, but have three-dimensional structures that are mirror images of each other, like left and right hands. These 'chiral' chemicals play a central role in living-organisms, where only the left- or right-handed forms are present; but not both. As a result, most biologically active molecules, such as pharmaceuticals, must also be chiral molecules, and they must match the handedness of the biochemicals found in life.  However, producing enantiomerically pure forms of molecules is a challenging problem. In this collaborative research project funded by the Chemical Structure Dynamics and Mechanism A (CSDM-A) program of the National Science Foundation Division of Chemistry, Professors Andrew Gellman (Carnegie Mellon University) and Charles Sykes (Tufts University) are studying the chemistry of chiral molecules adsorbed on metal surfaces where the atomic structure also has a specific handedness.  Working with their students, Professors Gellman and Sykes are developing curved metal surfaces that present a systematic variation in chiral structures. The designed surfaces enable the study of many atomic configurations with a single sample.  Sophisticated spectroscopies map the chemical reactivity across the surface, while isolated chemical reactions are observed using a high-resolution microscope that can map the positions of individual atoms. In addition to providing training opportunities for future scientists, insights gained from the project could guide the design of surfaces for enantiospecific production of chiral chemicals in the pharmaceutical industry.  \r\n\r\nThe research targets the surface chemistry of two chiral compounds, tartaric acid (TA) and aspartic acid (Asp), on chiral Cu(hkl) surfaces.  Single crystal Cu surfaces are polished into spherical shapes such that each point on the surface of the sphere exposes a plane with a different atomic structure.  This makes it very efficient to study the adsorption and surface reactions of TA and Asp on all possible structures of a Cu surface; i.e. all possible Miller indices (hkl).  The atomic structures of these surfaces are imaged with and without adsorbed TA and Asp using scanning tunneling microscopy.  Independent measurements of TA and Asp decomposition kinetics are made on hundreds of different Cu(hkl) surfaces, all on a single sample.  These data elucidate surface reaction rate constants as a function of surface orientation, ks(hkl), and hence enable an understanding of the effect of surface structure on chemical and enantiospecific reactivity.  Combined, these data are used to identify those surface orientations with the highest enantioselectivities towards decomposition of the two enantiomers of TA and Asp.  Imaging with the scanning tunneling microscope is then used to determine the atomic structure of the surfaces having greatest enantioselectivity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNSF Project Outcomes for the General Public\n\nThe intimate connection between surface chemistry and atomic-scale surface structure is one of the core concepts underpinning our modern understanding of catalysis, electrochemistry, adsorption, corrosion as well as many other surface-related phenomena.  One of the earliest triumphs of surface science was the rigorous demonstration that surface reaction kinetics depend on surface structure and relating that dependence to catalytic activity.  However, understanding the relationship between surface structure and reactivity at a predictive level remains a challenge.  One reason is the infinite number of different surface orientations that can be obtained from any bulk crystal structure.  Experimental studies of one surface orientation at a time cannot begin to span orientation space comprehensively.  Furthermore, computational studies suffer from the same limitation and, perhaps, are even more challenged because modelling of low symmetry surfaces requires the use of very large unit cells.\n\nThe PIs have developed the unique ability to study both surface reaction kinetics and atomic-scale surface structure across 100?s of crystal planes spanning surface orientation space on a single sample.  Specifically, we have implemented the use of Structure Spread Single Crystals (S4C) that have been shaped into spherical domes to expose a continuous distribution of surface orientations around the crystallographic directions of their center points.  Each S4C-library allows STM imaging, surface analysis and measurement of surface reaction kinetics on 100?s to 1000?s of different surface structures.  Using this methodology, we have been able to make direct comparisons of the surface reaction kinetics of both enantiomers of amino acids across surface structure spread single crystals and discover the most enantioselective chiral surface facets for enantioselective autocatalytic decomposition which is key for understanding the mechanistic origin of enantiospecific surface reaction kinetics.  These data sets also enable quantification of the surface structure sensitivity of rate constants in terms of the number and type of sites (terraces, steps and kinks of different low Miller index planes) exposed by surfaces with different initial orientation.  Ultimately, models of structure sensitive surface chemistry developed from this work will serve to guide the rational design and preparation of surfaces with tailored chemical activity and enantioselectivity.  Related to this we have also developed and demonstrate a method for the controlled growth of chiral metal oxide films on intrinsically chiral metal substrates whereby a small degree of chirality in the metal can be amplified into a dense homochiral oxide.\n\nThree graduate students and a postdoc were mentored at Tufts University and Carnegie Mellon University under this collaborative research grant.  Three Ph.D.  theses as well as a total of nine papers resulting from this grant have been published (including papers in Nature Materials and ACS Nano). Graduates were trained in single molecule studies, scanning probe microscopy/spectroscopy, cryogenics, surface analysis, concepts in chirality and programming for automated analysis.  Our Reverse Science Fair between Tufts and Medford High enables ~300 students per year to interact with graduate researchers in the run up to their science project presentations.  We also gave nanoscience presentations and live STM demonstrations (most recently online due to Covid) to diverse populations at a variety Boston high schools.  At Carnegie Mellon, we have been engaged with the Scott Institute for Energy Innovation and its programming that reaches a broad audience.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/09/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew J Gellman"
