Until recently, this assembly could not be directly seen because of the very small size of nanoparticles.  For this proposal, a new imaging method has been developed that can resolve the structure and motions of individual nanoparticles assembled on a liquid interface.  The method combines the high resolution of electron microscopy, about 100-1000 times greater than optical microscopy, with the nonvolatility of ionic liquids, essentially liquid salts, to probe the two-dimensional assembly of nanoparticles as a function of nanoparticle size, geometry, bulk chemistry, surface chemistry, and degree of liquid wetting.  Unlike larger particles, nanoparticles can interact with each other over distances as large as the particles themselves, a feature that facilitates assembly into well-ordered structures. Also unlike larger particles, these interactions are weak, allowing the particles to \"jiggle around\" so as to find the best arrangement. In many experiments, different sorts of nanoparticles are mixed, increasing the diversity of the ordered structures, or in other cases, creating a frozen disordered \"jammed\" state.  Determining conditions under which nanoparticle particles organize, understanding how these changes affect organization, and uncovering ways to make completely disordered systems are the key project objectives.  This research is performed by undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral fellows, and the outcomes are often striking images or movies easily understandable by everyone.  In the long term, the tools and techniques emerging from this research should apply easily to other technologically important materials such as gels, emulsions, liquid crystals, and suspensions, all of which display bulk properties determined by nanoscale features and events.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL ABSTRACT\r\nDespite a need to impose vacuum, scanning electron microscopy can be performed on open liquid specimens when the components are wetted by, or dispersed in, a nonvolatile ionic liquid.  At an imaging resolution of 3-5 nm, several frames per second can be acquired over an unlimited time.  Preliminary experiments established the feasibility of scanning-electron-microscope, single-particle tracking even for dense nanoparticle packings and non-spherical particle shapes. The method functions much like optical video microscopy but at 10-100X greater magnification.  Two-dimensional nanoparticle ordering on ionic liquid surfaces is now pursued comprehensively and quantitatively, examining effects of nanoparticle size, geometry, bulk chemistry, surface chemistry (i.e., polymer ligand type), and degree of liquid wetting.  In addition, different types of nanoparticles are mixed. Unlike larger colloidal particles, nanoparticle interactions are typically weak, allowing equilibrium assembly under Brownian motion alone. The interaction potential will be evaluated for all listed parameters, with greatest attention on ligand type, which controls the interaction length scale, reaching or exceeding the particle size. Ligands also affect the contact angle, which dictates how deeply the interface-trapped particle protrudes into the underlying liquid, and, in turn, this depth influences particle dynamics. A new transmission-electron-microscopy approach to nanoparticle contact angle is being assessed, and by the new scanning-electron-microscopy tracking method, the associated interfacial nanoparticle dynamics are being quantified. Both ordered and disordered dense nanoparticle packings are being studied, with the latter facilitated by mixing particles of different size/shape. To control nanoparticle areal density, a unique device for control of interfacial area is placed inside the microscope, with areal adjustments made in situ as image sequences are collected.  Assembly into dense structures is analyzed by calculating translational and orientational parameters.  Lastly, an interesting and unexplained coupling between the electron beam of the microscope and solid metallic or metal-coated nanoparticles is being pursued to create precise nanoparticle patterns on liquid surfaces.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNanoparticles, almost molecular in size and thereby too small to observe in an ordinary light microscope, can attach as monolayers at liquid surfaces, where the particles can arrange in just two dimensions, i.e., in the plane of the surface.  When their packing is dense, they may jam and/or crystallize, with positioning of the particles either ordered or disordered.  We previously developed new methods to image nanoparticle organization at liquid surfaces by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), an instrument able to resolve objects much smaller than possible in a light microscope.  Further, our new methods allow single nanoparticles to be tracked in time as they interact and order at high areal density; tens of thousands of such particles can be visualized and tracked simultaneously, sometimes up to the point of interface solidification.  These nanoparticle systems already have many applications as soft materials, such as in emulsions, coatings, and membranes.  Understanding of nanoparticle ordering at interfaces, however, is incomplete, and improved control of their behavior will pave the way for nanoparticles to be incorporated into more advanced technologies, as exemplified by our own efforts to develop 'underwater' 3D printing as well as membranes for highly selective solute transport.\n\nMuch of this project was focused on the ordering of interfacial NP spheres as their areal fraction increased.  Our NP model system consisted of ligand-decorated silica nanospheres physically attached as a Gibbs monolayer to an ionic liquid surface. The in-plane interactions measured between two isolated NPs nearly conformed to expectation for ideal hard spheres, and their interfacial binding energy was large, reaching thousands of kBT per NP.  Thus, while each NP had high mobility while moving across the surface, its attachment to the surface was irreversible.\n\nTypically, as NP areal fraction increased, the spheres first crystallized, forming a polycrystalline monolayer, and then jammed, displaying no long-range motions.  Displacements of the spheres above the onset of crystallization but below the threshold of jamming were complex and highly cooperative, resembling behaviors predicted by simulations and theory for somewhat analogous glassy materials.  We did a number of statistical analysis to quantify these displacements, and to explore the underlying dynamics in greater detail, we built a liquid cell that compresses/decompresses the NP-bearing interface, thereby systematically varying in time the NP areal density while observing packing rearrangements.  In many cases, the observed dynamics were time-dependent; a fast decompression, for example, led to liquid-like re-ordering, while a slow decompression, led to solid-like re-ordering (including cracking).  \n\nFigure 1 shows some of the statistical analyses performed for a bidisperse NP sphere packing; the results report local order metrics, which capture the degree to which spheres are locally correlated either in position or bond orientation.  These order metric \"maps\" clearly highlight regions of high order (crystal domains) and low order (grain boundaries, bulk regions of disorder).  Bidisperse NP sphere packings, which tend to show high disorder, are often chosen in applications to reduce the detrimental impacts on interface properties originating in grain boundaries.  Our study varied the size and number ratio of the different-size NP spheres, uncovering choices that provide the most uniform interfacial properties.\n\nAnisotropic NPs, such as carbon nanotubes, metallic nanorods, and cellulose nanocrystals, also assemble at liquid interfaces, where they better respond to electrical, optical, or magnetic fields than NP spheres. A number of anisotropic NP model systems were prepared and studied in this project, with NP size and shape the key variables.  Once again, the particles were decorated with polymer ligands.
