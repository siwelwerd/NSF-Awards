 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Workshop on Networked Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR) Communications convenes researchers and practitioners to identify key research challenges in the rapidly developing area of networking for assisted-reality technologies. The 2-day event will be held in Crystal City, VA, on April 23-24, 2018, and attendees will include industry participants, government technologists, and academic computer scientists and engineers representing the networks, theory, systems, and applications communities.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the workshop are to: (1) identify key technical problems for the academic research community to investigate; (2) establish a long-term vision and corresponding research agenda to realize the envisioned future of ubiquitous networked VR/AR applications; (3) increase research community understanding of the requirements for future networks to support these applications, and (4) identify new applications and societal benefits associated with augmented reality applications. Dissemination of workshop findings will be made through the publication of a workshop report.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
