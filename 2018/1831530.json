 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research tackles a long-standing question about the relationship between genotype and phenotype.  A gene called EPAS1 illustrates that complex relationship by modifying the expression of hundreds of target genes that cause biological responses to maintain oxygen homeostasis when oxygen supplies are low at high-altitude or relatively low after high-oxygen therapy.  Healthy people with a dampened response to high-altitude, reflected by an absence of the typical increase in hemoglobin concentration at high altitudes, provide a natural laboratory for discovery.  In addition to explaining the different ways to adapt successfully to low oxygen environments, this special case may improve understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships under other conditions.  Examples include inappropriately engaging oxygen homeostasis pathways by premature infants, people with wounds that will not heal, and fighter pilots who are all exposed for hours or days to extremely high oxygen levels and are at risk of pathologies including blindness upon return to normal oxygen levels.  Learning the balance of healthy levels of gene products and their associated physiological traits in the study population can provide a model for designing successful clinical interventions.  This project will also support international research collaborations, community science outreach, and undergraduate student training and mentoring. \r\n\r\nThe relationship between genetic, phenotypic and reproductive variation is central to the goal of understanding the sources of human biological variation. This research is designed to determine pathways from the EPAS1 locus to biological adaptations in a sample of 400 women living above 3000m who participated in a previous study. The proposed research will revisit them to collect new hematological, cardiopulmonary, and respiratory traits and integrate them into the rich body of genomic, physiological, and reproductive data they have already provided.  Variation at the EPAS1 locus and its target genes and their proteins will be assessed for the extent to which they associate with the adaptive phenotypes and the lifetime reproductive success of these women.  An integrated genomic approach will choose a subset of target genes hypothesized to associate with physiological adaptations.  Analyses will consider factors such as sociocultural influences, iron, and infection status.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project was designed to advance knowledge of the biological factors enabling Tibetan women to thrive and reproduce under the severe stress of hypoxia (low levels of oxygen in the air and body). 430 ethnic Tibetan women 46  86 years old, residing between 3500 and 4100m (11,600'  13,500') in Upper Mustang, Nepal, provided information on their reproductive histories, social and demographic factors, physiological measurements of heart, lung, and blood, and genetics. An average concentration of hemoglobin, higher percent of oxygen saturation, and larger blood flow to and from the lungs and heart are associated with more pregnancies and livebirths; larger lungs are associated with more children surviving to age 15. Genetic, developmental, and air pollution factors all contributed to variation in these traits and reproductive success. A variant at the EPAS1 locus that is unique to populations of the Tibetan plateau associated with unelevated hemoglobin concentration and lower pulmonary artery pressure, both beneficial traits suggesting genetic adaptation to mitigate the response to high altitude found in non-adapted populations. In addition, genetic variants at other sites in the genomic associated with other oxygen transport traits including higher oxygen saturation of hemoglobin and larger lung volume. Because these genetic variants occur globally, this finding suggests new avenues of genetics research related to the health of the oxygen transport system regardless of altitude.\n\n\nThe broader impacts include collaborations among disciplines (anthropology, demography, genetics, statistics, medicine), countries (U.S. and Nepal), universities, and research institutes. For example, we developed a statistical analytic pipeline for the analysis of traits influenced by many factors as well as other biological traits. Students from undergraduate through post-docs and professionals at all career stages participated in various stages of the research; two dissertations will present aspects of this research. Public meetings in the study communities disseminated the results of our research and showed that participating in research can result in usable knowledge, such as the benefits for child survival of delaying first births and early treatment of anemia for successful pregnancy outcomes. Improved understanding of factors influencing reproductive success benefits maternal and child health globally because they also affect health and disease. The characteristics of healthy hypoxic individuals, such as the women in this study help distinguish adaptations from pathologies in patients at all altitudes.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/08/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: CynthiaMBeall\n"
