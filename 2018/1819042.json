 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many scientific and engineering applications, it is necessary to\r\nsolve an inverse problem; that is, to determine quantities defining an\r\nobject or a system through indirect measurements.  The mathematics\r\nused to produce images in devices such as X-Ray Computed Tomography\r\n(CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are excellent examples.  The\r\nmathematical models describing an inverse problem are often so\r\ncomplicated that it is not possible to find an exact analytical\r\nsolution, and it is necessary to use an approximation based on a set\r\nof simpler equations.  However, many equations may be needed; in\r\nmedical imaging, for example, it is not unusual to compute\r\napproximations by solving millions of equations.  Additional\r\ncomplications arise because an inverse problem may have infinitely\r\nmany solutions, or the solutions may change dramatically if there are\r\nsmall errors in the indirect measurements.  Thus, additional\r\nconstraints and mathematical tools (often referred to as\r\nregularization) are needed to narrow the search to a set of\r\nappropriate feasible solutions, and to stabilize the computations.\r\nThe type and amount of regularization is problem dependent, requiring\r\nthe algorithms to be able to easily adapt to user and/or problem\r\nspecifications.  The aim of this project is develop a flexible and\r\nadaptable computational platform that can be used for this important\r\nclass of problems, which arise in many application areas, including\r\nspace object identification, geophysics, microscopy and medical\r\nimaging. Thus advancements made from this project have the potential to\r\nbenefit national defense, energy exploration, and human health.\r\n \r\nEfficient iterative methods to compute regularized solutions of\r\nlarge-scale discrete ill-posed inverse problems will be developed.\r\nThe approach will use flexible Krylov subspace iterative methods, and\r\nwill exploit low-rank structure of data, solutions and operators. The\r\napproach will allow to incorporate a variety of regularization\r\ntechniques, including sparse and low-rank constraints on the solution.\r\nThe methods developed in this project can be used as tools to obtain\r\napproximate solutions of ill-posed inverse problems, and optimized\r\nimplementations will be included in a new MATLAB package called IR\r\nTools (Iterative Regularization Tools).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
