 "awd_abstract_narration": "Providing learning and support opportunities for early-career faculty is an important strategy to improve undergraduate geoscience education, strengthen faculty research and scholarship, and address issues of diversity and inclusion in the Geosciences. To this end, in partnership with the National Association of Geoscience Teachers, a team of experienced faculty leaders in geoscience education will host three annual workshops to help early-career geoscientists advance their understanding of best practices in pedagogy. The project supports NSF goals of fostering the development of a globally competitive scientific and engineering workforce.\r\n\r\nThe Early Career Faculty Workshops will be held at the University of Maryland and will include approximately seventy-five participants each summer. The workshops will be nationally advertised, and participation by faculty who are from minority serving institutions and community colleges will be encouraged. In addition to evaluation of the workshop activities, the project will complete a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of the Early Career Workshop program, including a longitudinal study of past participants. This evaluation will provide important insights into the long-term impact of early career professional development and training. This project is funded by Division of Undergraduate Education, the Division of Earth Sciences, Division of Ocean Sciences, and the Office of Polar Programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
