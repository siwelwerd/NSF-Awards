 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2018, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. The development of methods to quantify mercury stable isotopes provides new insights into sources of pollution in ecosystems.  This powerful tracer reveals whether mercury accumulated in fish tissues was derived from local weather sources, long-distance atmospheric sources, or regional human activities. To date, use of mercury isotopes in fish has been restricted solely to near present-day samples. The remarkable archives of fish tissues preserved in museums can expand the size and the time-scale for analyzing mercury in fish. However, these archives have never been used for large-scale assessment of mercury contamination. This proposal will be one of the first to assess mercury contamination in multiple different collections of fish. Recognition of mercury as a global threat, due to neurotoxic effects in humans and wildlife, has led to efforts to reduce mercury contamination in many nations.  The data from this proposal can help to better understand where these levels of mercury are coming from, which can help to inform mercury management and mitigation efforts.\r\n\r\nThis project includes three core elements: 1) A rigorous experimental test of how chemical preservation affects the concentration and isotope ratios of mercury in fish. 2) Comparing recent and historical collections from Africa?s Lake Victoria (where erosion, gold mining, and aquaculture have increased mercury) and Lake Tanganyika (where anthropogenic inputs of mercury are minimal) to reconstruct changes in mercury sources and concentrations in these massive lacustrine fisheries. 3) Quantifying pollution through time for major riverine fisheries worldwide. These approaches will use archived specimens to reveal the spatiotemporal evolution of global contamination of freshwater fisheries. After developing correction factors for interpreting results from preserved tissues, we will resolve the impact of human activities relative to natural geogenic inputs of mercury. Using fish rather than sediment cores to infer temporal shifts in mercury bioaccumulation will sidestep assumptions about bioavailability that have complicated previous approaches. Coupling mercury concentrations and isotope data will give insight to sources of intensive pollution, and the resulting geography of health threat. Findings will be conveyed to national fishery management authorities and the United Nations Global Mercury Program, to develop targeted mitigation strategies. The information can also motivate local education efforts to make subsistence anglers aware of the threat to their family's health.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our proposal and approach, though expansive in its effort, was relatively simple. First, we sought to determine the suitability of museum-preserved fishes to reconstructing mercury concentrations and mercury isotope ratios to determine whether the vast fish collections within the world?s museums could be used to measure mercury in and mercury sources to fish through unparalleled space and time. Subsequently we sought to apply this new technique. We found that after three years of lab preservation, fishes were susceptible to inorganic mercury contamination but not methylmercury contamination. So, we determined that Hg stable isotope values of methylmercury were suitable for methylmercury reconstructions. We also found that there was a mass loss of an identified elemental constituent that resulted in modest but quasi-predictable increases in methylmercury concentrations (25 - 40%), where the extent of concentration increase was inversely proportional to the lipid content of the original fish tissue.</p>\n<p>Early results from this work revealed high fish mercury concentrations and previously unobserved mercury isotope values in tropical Africa. As a result, we coordinated with both the Ministry of Water and Forests, the Sea, and the Environment of Gabon and the Agence Nationale des Parcs Nationaux of Gabon to perform a national assessment of the sources and extent of mercury contamination in areas that have illegal gold mining (using liquid mercury) and those that do not. This pilot work has spurred further national inventory work and aspects were included in their National Action Plan to the Minamata Convention on Mercury.</p>\n<p>Central to the project's theme, the historical reconstruction of mercury sources to fish using museum specimens is now underway. Due to our familiarity of the study area and its history of mercury use, our existing collection of contemporary data and the robust, available collections already archived in a spatially and temporally comprehensive way, we worked closely with the Royal Museum for Central Africa to reconstruct fish trends in the Congo River of central Africa as well as within Gabon at locations that are spatially proximate to our 2019 Gabonese survey. These specimens await methylmercury extraction for Hg isotope measurements and this process has been significantly delayed by instrument access during the pandemic. This work will continue into 2023.</p>\n<p>While the method development to determine whether museum-preserved fishes would be suitable sentinels to track temporal and spatial mercury trends was ongoing, we began working on another fish archive collected, stored (whole frozen 5-fish composites), and supported by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The Great Lakes Fish Monitoring and Surveillance Program specimens constitute size-standardized gamefish collections (mostly <em>Salvelinus namaycush</em> [lake trout] but <em>Sander vitreus</em> [walleye] in Lake Erie) that were harvested simultaneously in all five Laurentian Great Lakes, starting around 1978. This project?s first reporting period is forthcoming but generally we?ve found that mercury sources to fish in all five lakes are uniformly changing monotonically in response to reductions in atmospheric mercury emissions. This is encouraging but we?ve also found that invasive species that disturb energy flows, morphotyping by lake trout and ecosystem changes result in shifts in each ecosystem?s bioenergetics that propagate to gamefish and make mercury concentration trends complicated. Using isotope ecology, we can identify the more precise causations for instances when trends deviate from our expectations and we are now working to incorporate that information into a mercury concentration model that is more palatable for the scientific, public and management communities. In the meantime, we have and continue to produce pieces of literature that will be informative cogs to achieving our final goals for this work. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/31/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ryan&nbsp;F&nbsp;Lepak</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1812211/1812211_10630240_1659308533272_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1812211/1812211_10630240_1659308533272_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Benchtop preservation scheme\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1812211/1812211_10630240_1659308533272_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Benchtop preservation scheme\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Various iterations of this scheme allowed us to simultaneously track trends of isolated fish, fish exposed to inorganic mercury contamination, methylmercury contamination and potential contamination from co-preserved fishes.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ryan Lepak</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ryan&nbsp;F&nbsp;Lepak</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Benchtop preservation scheme</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1812211/1812211_10630240_1659308668580_Picture2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1812211/1812211_10630240_1659308668580_Picture2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Mercury concentration trends in Great Lake fish\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1812211/1812211_10630240_1659308668580_Picture2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Mercury concentration trends in Great Lake fish\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">These are gamefish trends in Lakes Erie, Michigan and Superior.
