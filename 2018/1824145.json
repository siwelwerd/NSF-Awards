 "awd_abstract_narration": "Languages rely on acoustic differences (contrasts) between similar sounds to distinguish words with different meanings, such as between /p/ and /b/ in 'pen' and 'Ben'. Arabic contrasts three types of sounds: plain dental, emphatic, and pharyngeal consonants. For dentals, the tongue tip touches the upper teeth, while pharyngeals have a constriction in the throat. Emphatic consonants combine the dental and pharyngeal constrictions and sound similar to plain dentals to those who do not speak Arabic. Speakers must recognize the differences between these consonants to distinguish words with important meaning differences (such as between the Arabic words for 'member' and 'enemy'). The acoustic characteristics of these consonants are not well understood. This research tests the hypothesis that listeners identify these consonants through their effects on adjacent and non-adjacent vowels within the same word. This project will explore how speakers produce and identify plain, emphatic, and pharyngeal consonants in Palestinian Arabic. The outcomes of this project can improve language recognition programs, develop teaching materials for learners of Arabic, and inform our understanding of human language processing. \r\n\r\nData will be collected through production and perception experiments. For the production experiments, native speakers will record words containing plain dental, emphatic, or pharyngeal consonants. The investigator will measure acoustic characteristics of these consonants and of adjacent and non-adjacent vowels to explore how these consonant classes differ, how they affect adjacent vowels, if they affect different vowels, and whether their effects extend to the whole word or only the adjacent vowel. The findings of the production experiments will be used to conduct a perception experiment that tests how speakers use these acoustic cues to distinguish the different classes of consonants. The combination of experiments will identify which effects are crucial to distinguish these classes, and the comparison to pharyngeals may provide clues about the articulation of emphatic consonants. This project will further the field of linguistics by expanding our understanding of phonological and phonetic processes to account for non-local phonological processes in Arabic.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Arabic has two types of guttural consonants: primary gutturals (uvular and pharyngeal) and secondary gutturals (emphatic), which are coronal obstruents with a [+back] secondary articulation. The secondary constriction has been debated to be uvular or pharyngeal and contrasts with primary coronal obstruents. The emphatic consonants also affect vowels through long-distance emphasis spread, which is manifested in the backing of mid low /a/ to back [&#593;], where / s&#740;ata&#720;r/ is produced as [s&#740;&#593;t&#593;&#720;r]. It has been argued that primary gutturals have similar effects on vowels, but it may be restricted to adjacent vowels. This assimilation is assumed to affect all vowels but has also not been established for the high vowels /i u/. The process of emphasis spread is not well understood, since it is not localized and may be iterative. This project examined the acoustic correlates of emphatic consonants and emphasis spread, as well as how coarticulation and phonological processes contribute to the perception of phonemic distinctions in Palestinian Arabic. Two production experiments and one perception experiment examined the production and perception of plain, emphatic, and pharyngeal consonants in Palestinian Arabic and their effects on adjacent vowels.</p>\n<p>In Experiment 1, words containing /a&#720; i&#720; u&#720;/ following plain /s/, emphatic /s&#740;/, or pharyngeal /&#295;/ were recorded. The center of gravity (CoG) of the fricatives and height and backness of the vowels were measured. The CoG of pharyngeal /&#295;/ was lower than the CoG of plain /s/ and emphatic /s&#740;/, but there was no difference in the CoG of the two coronals (see CoG graph). Vowels adjacent to pharyngeals were lower and vowels adjacent to emphatics were further back, in comparison to vowels in the plain environment. These effects were greatest in low /a/ and smaller in high /i u/ (see vowel formants graph). These results suggest that, in this dialect, emphatics are likely uvularized, not pharyngealized.</p>\n<p>Experiment 2 examined the perception of the plain/emphatic contrast using synthesized stimuli. The stimuli contained a frication interval followed by low /a/ or high front /i/. The frication was extracted from plain /s/ or emphatic /s&#740;/. The vowels were higher or lower and had several different backness levels. Listeners relied on the backness of the vowel to identify emphatic consonants. Identification of the consonant was more consistent for low /a/ than for high /i/ (as shown in /a/ and /i/ graphs). This finding further supports that the plain/emphatic distinction is less distinct in high vowel environments.</p>\n<p>In Experiment 3, the effects of pharyngeals and emphatics on adjacent and non-adjacent vowels were measured. Vowels that were either adjacent to or several segments away from emphatic and pharyngeal consonants were measured. All vowels in words with emphatic consonants were backed (see emphatic graph), while only vowels adjacent to pharyngeals were lowered (see pharyngeal graph). In this dialect, emphatic consonants caused long-distance assimilation of vowels within the word, while pharyngeals do not. There were no directionality or distance restrictions on the effects of emphatic consonants.</p>\n<p>The nature of the secondary guttural articulation and the acoustics of long-distance effects suggest that primary and secondary articulations have different characteristics and phonological effects. Therefore, the guttural class may exclude emphatic consonants because the primary pharyngeals and the emphatic consonants have different phonological effects. This project showed that pharyngeal consonants cause a gradient phonetic effect (coarticulation), while emphatic consonants cause a categorical phonological change. It also provided evidence for long-distance emphasis spread and suggested that previous claims about restrictions on emphasis spread are not accurate. The empirical evidence of emphasis spread improves our understanding of non-local spread, tying together phonetics and phonology through research on an under-documented language.</p>\n<p>The research supported by this grant has broader applications in both education and technology. Learners of Arabic struggle to distinguish plain and emphatic consonants, and the aim of their instructors is to teach students to perceive and produce emphatic consonants in a manner similar to native speakers. Teaching methods can be adapted to focus on the cues that native speakers produce and recognize to distinguish plain and emphatic consonants. New pedagogical resources for learners of Arabic will help students increase their proficiency in Arabic. Similarly, technological applications, such as speech-recognition, seek to mimic human language processing, but they cannot mimic a process that is not well documented and analyzed. The identification of the cues that distinguish plain, emphatic, and pharyngeal consonants can improve automatic speech recognition and synthetic speech production in Arabic. Improving technological applications for Arabic speakers will increase access to information in a rapidly-growing region of the world.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/13/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Laura&nbsp;Faircloth</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1824145/1824145_10548502_1597330521715_ex1formants--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1824145/1824145_10548502_1597330521715_ex1formants--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Formants of Vowels in different environments\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1824145/1824145_10548502_1597330521715_ex1formants--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Formants of Vowels in different environments\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This graph shows the differences in the effects of plain, emphatic, and pharyngeal consonants on different vowels.
