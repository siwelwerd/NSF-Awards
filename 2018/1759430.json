 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) by engaging in hands-on field experience, laboratory/project-based entrepreneurship tasks and mentorship experiences. The Mobile County Public School System (MCPSS), in partnership with STEMWorks, LLC and the University of Southern Mississippi (USM),  will  leverage two existing programs- a local Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC) and a workforce development organization to increase the interest and competency of grade 9-11 students in pursuing STEM careers. The project's main intervention will be a one-week long summer residential academy where cohorts of students engage in physical conditioning, JROTC activities, site visits, and STEM projects.  A major goal of the project is to study the short-term and long-term effects of participation in the JROTC STEM Leadership Academy. Another goal is to formalize a JROTC-centered STEM workforce development summer academy model that can be replicated regionally and across the United States. \r\n\r\nThe project will study the effects of participation in the JROTC STEM Leadership Academy using Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) as a framework that will be applied to organize and measure the relative effect of different factors on student choice. The project will utilize a mixed methods comparison group design to investigate the effects of strategically situating STEM learning and workforce experiences within a traditional JROTC summer leadership and fitness camp in order to increase the number of high school students in the STEM pipeline. The research includes Brinkerhoff's Success Case Method, sampling a subset of students who chose a STEM trajectory to develop in-depth stories of the student's experiences before, during and after the intervention in order to identify the internal and environmental support that lead to choosing a STEM pathway.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The project used a mixed methods comparison group design to investigate the effects of strategically situating STEM learning and workforce experiences within a traditional Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps (JROTC) summer leadership and fitness camp, called the JROTC STEM Leadership Academy, in order to increase the number of high school students (grades 9-11) in the STEM pipeline. Our goals for the three-year project were three-fold:</p>\n<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Explore the unique and synergistic aspects of its JROTC STEM Leadership Academy that is embedded in a large southern public school&rsquo;s JROTC program as a regional STEM workforce development strategy.</p>\n<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Study the short-term and long-term effects of participation in the JROTC STEM Leadership Academy, using Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) as a framework.</p>\n<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Formalize a JROTC-centered STEM workforce development summer academy model that can be replicated regionally and across the US.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit Outcomes. </strong></p>\n<p>Through a mixed methods randomized control trial, we parsed out which outcomes were tied to a single JROTC STEM Leadership Academy component (either Workforce, STEM, or JCLC), and which outcomes were the result of students drawing connections between two or more components. Short-term impacts included moderate and positive effects on students&rsquo; STEM content knowledge, STEM self-efficacy, 21st Century workforce skills, and knowledge of STEM careers. Long-term outcomes were more varied and suggest that students incorporate different elements of the STEM Academy into their conceptions of themselves and their trajectories after high school.&nbsp; Perceptions of the STEM Academy varied from being confirmatory to career plans, shifting their focus, increasing their motivation, helping create good work habits, or solidifying their interest in JROTC. The diversity of the outcomes suggest that simple mean comparisons between groups may not reveal the multiple and complex effects an intervention can have on students. This project produced and verified a set of STEM curricular units, assessment instruments, and a replicable model for blending STEM learning and workforce experiences into an existing, national summer camp program, the Junior Cadet Leadership Challenge (JCLC).&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts. </strong>In addition to impacting over<strong> </strong>400 cadets, 50 JROTC instructors, and 30 STEM teachers during the 4-year ITEST project, this work will continue broadening its impact as districts across the country replicate this model. All JROTC programs across the country are required to hold a week-long leadership camp, the Junior Cadet Leadership Camp (JCLC), each summer, and directives from JROTC Army command are calling for increased emphasis on STEM through co- and extra-curricular strategies.&nbsp; As a result of the research findings, and their dissemination, in fall 2021 the United States Department of Defense (DoD) through its DoD-STEM program awarded the MCPSS funding to replicate the JROTC STEM Leadership Academy model as a hybrid JCLC (JCLC+STEM+Workforce) across the country to districts with active JROTC programs (#HQ00343110009). As a result of the DoD-STEM grant, 10 JROTC programs representing seven states (Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, and Texas) will implement the JROTC STEM Leadership Academy from 2022 to 2025, impacting over 2,500 cadets, 380 Cadre, and 130 STEM Instructors. &nbsp;Additionally, &nbsp;the potential for continued broadening of impact is substantial.
