 "awd_abstract_narration": "Following the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland, a primary scientific goal of high energy physicists has been to characterize the properties of this new particle. The Higgs itself is a potential portal to new physics, providing connections between the Standard Model of particle physics and new phenomena, such as signatures of possible new forces of nature or evidence of dark matter. Through this CAREER Award, Martinez Outschoorn and her UIUC research team will address such issues both analytically and technically in the ATLAS Experiment.   \r\n\r\nThe UIUC group is developing and implementing new analytical tools to search for Higgs bosons decaying into pairs of hypothetical new spin-zero particles, which subsequently decay into known particles such as b-quarks, electrons and muons that can be observed directly in the ATLAS detector.   This is tactically challenging, because although the Higgs Mass is large, the masses of the sought for spin-zero particles are low and the energies of the observed particles are similarly low. Additionally, these events are expected to be very rare, and to find them requires high intensity colliding beams at the LHC over several years.  To enhance the technical capabilities of the ATLAS detector to observe these particles, the UIUC group is collaborating with ATLAS colleagues in the development of new electronics upgrades to the experiment, to allow for the effective triggering and recording of these particles.   \r\n\r\nMartinez Outschoorn brings significant experience in outreach and education to her companion program called the \"Particle Adventure\", which will connect elementary and middle school students in grades 4-8, including children from underrepresented and at-risk groups, to the excitement of physics with the aid of undergraduate and graduate student volunteers from the UIUC Physics Department.  This creative project brings concepts of particle physics into school classrooms in an interactive way and provides opportunities for young students to interact with physicists at work both locally and at CERN.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Specific activities include multiple searches for new decay modes of the Higgs boson that could be indications of dark matter or could help explain the observed excess of matter over antimatter in the universe. The group has been focusing on Higgs boson decays to new light scalar particles that decay into standard model particles such as b-quarks, muons and taus. These searches are challenging because the mass of the new particle is low compared to the Higgs mass, and the energies of the decay products are similarly low. The search for such signatures has required new experimental and data analysis techniques. One key development has been a new b-quark identification method to identify the decay of two b-quarks in a single jet at low momentum, which has made it possible to gain sensitivity at low mass. This award has also supported an upgrade to the ATLAS muon trigger and readout electronics, the Monitored Drift Tube chamber (MDT) trigger processor. Muons are a powerful signature of several interesting events in the collisions and among the most widely used triggers to collect data in the ATLAS experiment. This upgrade is key to take advantage of the large amount of collisions expected in the High-Luminosity LHC, by increasing the number of triggers on muons of interest, while rejecting large backgrounds. During the period of this grant, the design and implementation of the trigger and readout hardware and logic has been completed, the final design review has been completed successfully, and the project is transitioning into the production phase. Finally, this award has supported several education and outreach programs. Events have been held for children in middle schools, as well as the general public in science fairs.
