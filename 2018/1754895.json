 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earth's upper atmosphere is densely populated by molecular, atomic and ionized meteors. These particles are important for maintaining the conductivity of the E region ionosphere (~90-150 km). They can be sensed using radio and optical methods, and therefore provide a great deal of information about the state of the upper atmosphere and the extraterrestrial environments of their origin. However, current estimates of total meteoric input are accurate only to within approximately two orders of magnitude. It is important to improve upon such estimates, since meteor chemistry affects Earth from roughly 150 km above the surface all the way down to the ice cores. \r\n\r\nThe research will apply radar data and first-principles computer models to trace the evolution of meteor plasma in the ionosphere. The project will support a full-time graduate student and an undergraduate. The Principal Investigators (PIs)' work will yield knowledge of the types of meteors that contribute most to Earth's upper atmosphere. This information is important to Space scientists, engineers, and astronomers. Spacecraft designers need to know the distribution of particle orbits and masses in order to mitigate potential hazards. Meteor population characteristics provides greater understanding of the evolution and composition of the outer solar system. The PIs and co-PI will continue their efforts to share their knowledge and enthusiasm about space and meteor science with the larger community through outreach to K-12 schools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
