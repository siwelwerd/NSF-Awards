Klaas van Wijk, Cornell University\r\n \r\nShort abstract EAGER application 1834636\r\n\r\nPart 1: A nontechnical description of the project.  Plants and algae are different from other organisms, such as humans and bacteria, in that they have an extra type of organelle in their cells, namely chloroplasts.  These chloroplasts contain several thousand different proteins that fulfill many critical functions, including photosynthesis.  The chloroplast also contains several enzymatic systems, named proteases, which selectively degrade chloroplast proteins once they are no longer needed.  This project aims to build an experimental system that will allow to determine the signals within proteins that lead to their removal by proteases.  A better understanding of the stability rules of proteins is important for improvement of crops and also will help in a better design of chloroplast proteins that generate products of pharmaceutical value and biofortification of crops.  The project will also serve to educate and train students and postdocs in STEM, including members of underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nPart 2: A technical description of the project.  Protein amino (N) termini are prone to modifications and are major determinants of protein stability in bacteria, eukaryotes, and perhaps also in chloroplasts and non-photosynthetic plastids.  The role of the N-terminus in protein stability is conceptualized in the N-end rule, which states that certain amino acids, when exposed at the N-terminus of a protein, act as triggers (degrons) for degradation.  Based on several types of indirect experimental evidence, as well as evolutionary arguments, we postulate that an N-end rule in plastids must exist, however that has not been proven. The main impediment for testing for an N-end rule in chloroplasts is a suitable in vivo quantitative reporter system.  This EAGER proposal aims to generate such a system based on a combination of novel quantitative tools and techniques developed for other biological systems.  The proposed research will then use this system to directly test possible N-degrons in chloroplasts and the involvement of chloroplast ClpS1 and the Clp protease and chaperone system in Arabidopsis.  Therefore, this work could make a transformative contribution to chloroplast proteostasis and the evolutionary adaptation of the N-end rule for protein stability in organelles.  Identification of such an N-end rule would be highly predictive for chloroplast protein stability.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The main aim of the project was to develop an&nbsp;<em>in planta (Arabidopsis thaliana)</em>&nbsp;quantitative reporter system that allows direct testing of the effect of specific N-terminal (Nt) residues on reporter protein stability in dependence of the chloroplast Clp protease system, including CLPS1 and CLPF. We generated all the planned constructs and created both stable transgenic lines in Arabidopsis and transient transformations in isolated Arabidopsis protoplasts. This included the Dexamethasone (DEX) inducible cTP-TEV protease, as well single and tandem cTP-N-degron-GFP/YFP reporter lines. We were very pleased that DNA sequencing confirmed that all constructs were correct as planned. Furthermore, we observed reproducible amounts of transcripts for all constructs (as determined by RT-PCR) in the transgenic lines in the wild-type as well as<em> clps1 </em>single null and <em>clps1xclpf</em> double null lines, including the DEX-inducible cTP-TEV. However, despite repeated efforts with different primary antisera (against TEV and YFP/GFP), we have not been able to detect reproducible signals for any of these transgenics proteins. Positive controls clearly showed that the immunodetection worked well and we remain puzzled as to why no transgenic proteins can be detected. We have a few hypotheses that could explain this phenomenon: i) lack of translatability of the mRNAs - even if Sanger sequencing confirmed intended sequences, ii) protein instability perhaps due to the TEV recognition site that we cloned into all FGP/YFP reporter constructs, iii) insufficient mRNA levels - even if detected by RT-PCR, resulting in insufficient stable protein accumulation. We have developed a plan to test these different hypotheses and formulate alternative approaches to circumvent the lack of stable protein accumulation. We remain highly motivated to establish a robust reporter system to test the N-degron pathways in chloroplast, since this still seems the best way forward to study the N-end rule in plant chloroplasts. We did publish an opinion paper on N-degron pathways in plastids in Trends of Plant Science (Bouchnak &amp; van Wijk, 2019). In this paper we argue for the existence of N-degron pathways in plastids of apicomplexa, algae, and plants. The prokaryotic N-degron pathway depends on a caseinolytic protease CLPS recognin (adaptor) for the recognition and delivery of N-degron-bearing substrates to CLP chaperone-protease systems. Diversified CLP systems are found in chloroplasts and non-photosynthetic plastids, including CLPS homologs that specifically interact with a subset of N-terminal residues and stromal proteins. We outlined experimental test strategies for plastid N-degron pathways. The ideas outlined in this opinion paper align with the objectives in this EAGER project. We also published an invited review focused on a comparative analysis of Clp chaperone-protease system across cyanobacteria (as progenitor of plastids), chloroplasts and apicoplasts (in the malaria parasite <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em>) in the Journal of Biological Chemistry (Bouchnak &amp; van Wijk, 2019). Other major activities included training of a summer (2019) NSF REU minority student and a postdoc. Unfortunately, the 2020 summer REU program was cancelled due to COVID-19. The PI gave invited talks about the chloroplast Clp system, including ClpS1 and ClpF at the 2019 ASPB annual meeting in San Jose, and in Japan at a US-Japan workshop (October 2019) on chloroplasts. I was scheduled to talk at the 2<sup>nd</sup> meeting on the International Society of Protein Termini (ISPT) in Bergen, Norway in June 2021, as well as other conferences.
