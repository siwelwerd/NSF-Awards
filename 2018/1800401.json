 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this collaborative project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professors David Rovnyak, Timothy Strein, Michael Krout, and Maria Panteva seek to understand how bile salt assemblies interact with chiral (right or left handed) molecules.  Naturally occurring bile salts are of interest because of their significant physiological functions and for potential applications in the design and analysis of chiral functional materials. This project investigates how specific regions on the complex surfaces of bile aggregates control selective interactions with chiral guest molecules. Advanced tools in magnetic resonance, separation science, chemical synthesis, thermodynamics and computation are applied to achieve a detailed understanding of molecular-level interactions.   Undergraduate researchers take leading roles throughout this work, including participating in experiment design and dissemination of results.  Emphasis is on close interactions with faculty, who mentor students while they develop the expertise needed to perform independent data acquisition and analysis.  This research provides opportunities for women and for students from under-represented groups who plan careers in science.\r\n\r\nBile salts undergo concentration-dependent stepwise aggregation, accompanied by intricate changes in their surface and bulk chemistries.  Despite considerable study, a precise description of the structure, the surface-available binding sites, and the enantioselective \"hot spots\" of bile aggregates is only beginning to emerge.  With an expanded, multi-disciplinary toolkit, this research provides detailed understanding of the molecular-level interactions characteristic of both natural and unnatural bile salt systems.  Specifically, this work involves several complementary foci: (1) Development of more detailed models for chiral selection by bile micelles, including how bile aliphatic chains contribute to chirally selective solubilization of guests. This research employs a suite of one and two-dimensional NMR experiments, as well as micellar electrokinetic capillary electrophoresis (MEKC),  to characterize chiral binding by measurements of mobility difference.  (2) Investigation of how temperature changes tune the enthalpic and entropic driving factors for chiral selection of guests. Isothermal titration calorimetry is used to isolate the heat difference associated with binding different enantiomers by bile aggregates.  (3) Strategic synthesis of analogues of bile acids through functionalization of key regions.  This advances understanding of the mechanisms of chiral selection and permits the design of improved bile salt analogues. (4) Employment of  rigorous, unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of spontaneous bile salt assembly. In synergy with experiments, computations help to understand and predict aggregate structure and stability.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nBile acids are naturally occurring molecules that are important to many physiological processes, but which also are being used in applications from topical gels to helping prepare carbon nanotubes.\n\n\nMolecules can have different handed forms, where the drug discovery pipeline depends on isolating the specific handed form of a drug molecule that causes the biological response. Isolating a specific handed form of a molecule can be both challenging and expensive. Bile micelles are capable of preferentially binding one handed form of a molecule over the other, and could be used to perform this task in the drug pipeline and other applications if these complex micelles can be better understood and optimized for this task.\n\n\nIn this work, we have been able to show bile micelles form in a step wise fashion, a long-suspected behavior which has been difficult to observe directly. We developed an intuitive model of step-wise micellization and used the model to extract the individual micelle formation steps from sets of magnetic resonance data obtained with several types of bile micelles. With this knowledge it is possible to better control the types of micelles formed in solution.\n\n\nThis project next gained several insights into how bile micelles are able to interact more strongly with one handed molecule versus the other. First, methods to create new types of bile acids were developed and implemented, where it was possible to alter the chemical make-up of bile acid structures at specific locations to test how bile micelles choose guest molecules.\n\n\nNext, this work showed that smaller bile micelles are the workhorses for selecting handed guest molecules, and also revealed that the short chain on the bile molecule is helping to select which guest molecules bind strongly. Finally, to help us better understand the arrangement of monomer molecules that make up bile micelles, we turned to advanced computer simulations which predict that short-lived bile dimers form at low concentrations, but these dimers may be remodeled into more complex cage structures in the stabler larger micelles.\n\n\nThe fundamental insights gained from this work have advanced our understanding of how bile micelles form and how they select for certain guest molecules, supporting avenues for rationale design and improvements in the applications of these natural molecules.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/14/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DavidSRovnyak\n"
