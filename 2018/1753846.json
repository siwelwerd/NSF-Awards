 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project concerns an apparent contradiction in human color perception. When a human observer is asked to detect a colored target that is barely visible (near threshold), her/his visual system adds color signals across space to achieve maximum sensitivity. But when one views a scene that contains highly colored objects at normal levels of visibility (suprathreshold), the visual system seems to subtract color signals. In this project, we will investigate how those two mechanisms (addition and subtraction) combine in the human visual cortex to produce perception. The project has important implications for all perceptual research. Our results indicate that perception at threshold can be very different from suprathreshold perception. The project's results will explain how these differences relate to color perception. These results will have  potential applications across a wide range of areas including communication and industrial design.\r\n\r\nIn our experiments, we will measure the spatial pattern dependence of color perception in humans over a range of cone contrasts from color threshold to highly saturated color, using the technique of hue and saturation scaling. In parallel, we will make measurements of the dependence on spatial stimulus variables of the human cVEP (color-Visual Evoked Potential, an EEG measure of color responses in early visual cortex) recorded with a dense array of electrodes on the scalp. The cVEP experiments have already proven that there are two cortical mechanisms that are the basis of color perception near threshold and suprathreshold: single-opponent and double-opponent neuron populations. The experiments in the continuation project are aimed at studying interactions between the two mechanisms and how interactions affect perceived color.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This result is illustrated in Figure 1 where the outlined region in the upper blurred square is physically identical to the sharp-edged square to the lower right of the figure. Obviously the color is greater (technically it is more saturated) in the square with the sharp edge. Therefore, perceived color depends on the spatial pattern not just the local spectral properties of the target region.</p>\n<p>Second, we found that color contrast affects how pattern influences color. At low color contrast, near color threshold, the visual system perceives color by summing incoming signals over a wide region of the visual image. However, it perceives high-contrast, very visible color patterns differently, deriving surface colors from signals at the boundaries of surfaces, as in Figure 1. The inescapable conclusion is that color perception changes fundamentally with color contrast.</p>\n<p>We proposed an explanation for this transformation with contrast. Our hypothesis is that there are two separate visual systems that contribute to perception. One --composed of cortical single-opponent cells--is more sensitive to color contrast and dominates perception of color at low color contrast. The other system's response grows more steeply with color contrast so that at supra-threshold contrast the second system -- composed of cortical double-opponent cells-- predominates.</p>\n<p>We designed an experiment to test the two-mechanisms hypothesis. The idea was to measure color saturation for different spatial patterns as color contrast increased from near threshold to highly visible levels. We measured perceived saturation with the method of saturation scaling. The two patterns used were a fine checkerboard pattern composed of equiluminant red and gray checks, and a large uniform square--as in Figure 2. Results were unequivocal and consistent with the appearance of the colors in Figure 2. The perceived color of the uniform square grew very little with cone contrast because, we infer, single-opponent response grows little with contrast. The perceived saturation of the checks in the checkerboard grew more steeply with contrast because the percept is derived from the activity of double-opponent cells that, by hypothesis, becomes much larger at higher cone contrast. At high color contrast as in Figure 2, the color in the checks of the checkerboard was more vivid, technically more saturated, than the color of the corresponding region of the large square.</p>\n<p>Then, we used the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">chromatic visual evoked potential</span>, the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">cVEP</span>, to study responses in human visual cortex evoked by equiluminant color stimuli. Large-area, colored squares were used to stimulate Single-Opponent cells in the visual cortex preferentially, and fine color-checkerboard stimuli were used to activate Double-Opponent responses. cVEP results are illustrated in Figure 3. The amplitudes of cVEPs to large squares (upper panel) were smaller than those to checkerboards (lower panel) and the latency to the peak of the cVEP response to squares was significantly less than the checkerboard latency. The latency of cVEP responses to the squares varied little with cone-contrast unlike the steep reduction of latency with cone-contrast observed in responses to color checkerboard patterns. The differences in response size and dependence on color contrast between cVEPs to squares and checkerboards support the hypothesis that a distinct neuronal mechanism responded to squares: Single-Opponent cells. And a different distinct population of cortical cells, the Double-Opponent cells, responded to color checkerboards.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we found both behavioral and electrophysiological evidence that there are two separate color-responsive neural mechanisms in human visual cortex that have different functional roles in color perception.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/08/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Robert&nbsp;Shapley</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1753846/1753846_10543762_1662500088882_NSF-Outcomes-Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1753846/1753846_10543762_1662500088882_NSF-Outcomes-Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Color Perception and Edges\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1753846/1753846_10543762_1662500088882_NSF-Outcomes-Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Color Perception and Edges\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Two equiluminant color images with different spatial profiles.
