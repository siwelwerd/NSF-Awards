 "awd_abstract_narration": "The SIAM Central States Section (SIAM CSS https://www.siam.org/sections/central/) was formed in 2014 to serve SIAM members in Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, and Oklahoma. The 4th Annual Meeting of SIAM Central States Section will be held 10/5-10/7, 2018 on the Norman campus of the University of Oklahoma. The url for the conference website is http://www.math.ou.edu/conferences/siam2018 .\r\n\r\nThe theme of this conference will be centered around applied and computational Mathematics. This award will be used solely to support junior researchers (students/postdocs/early career faculty), minorities, people with disability and colleagues from 4-year colleges. Our long-term goal is to build a stronger computational and applied Math program throughout all the central states. The SIAM CSS annual conference series provides a very important platform for computational and applied mathematicians to exchange knowledge and network with experts from all over the U.S. and other countries. This conference will give ample opportunity for people to interact at discussions during the breaks, between talks, as well as after the talks. In particular we expect participants from the central states (that may or may not present at the conference) to have the opportunity to establish interactions with researchers that they would not often have a chance to meet in this part of the country.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Most of the speakers granted us the permission to record their talks and the recorded talks are publicly available through the forum's website. The participants range from faculty/postdoc/graduate students to retired faculty and government lab research scientist, as well as industry researchers.
