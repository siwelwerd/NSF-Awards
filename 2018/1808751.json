 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical description:  The ability to tailor materials at the nanoscale has been a key enabler for many technology breakthroughs, exemplified by the continuing development of semiconductors for computing and information technologies. Over the last few years, a new class of electronic materials has emerged - atomic crystals with a thicknesses of only one or a few atoms, known as two-dimensional materials.  These materials systems provide a new platform for electronic and photonic devices. One interesting approach to investigating the nature of these materials is by stacking various types of them to form new hybrid layered materials. The electronic properties of the resulting stacks are governed by electrical forces and interactions between the various layers. This research explores the controlling factors that determine the interlayer interactions. Findings from this study are used to achieve rational design of stacks with desirable electronic and optical properties, which may be suitable for new types of optoelectronic devices.  Educationally, a special topic course work is designed to introduce this new frontier of materials research to graduate and undergraduate students. In addition, a laboratory-based discovery process is designed to reach out to high school students through a summer internship program.\r\n\r\nTechnical description:   The introduction of semiconductor heterostructures enabled many novel designs of electronics and photonics, leading to transformative semiconductor technologies. The recent emergence of atomically thin crystalline two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors creates exciting new opportunities for pushing semiconductor heterostructures towards a new frontier.  In particular, vertically stacked van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures were quickly recognized as a powerful platform for creating atomically thin heterostructures with great design flexibility.  A central scientific issue is the role of interlayer coupling, which can alter the electronic structures of each vdW layer individually, and the stack as a whole.  This project systematically investigates how interlayer atomic alignment impacts the electronic structure of vdW heterostructures. Moreover, using interlayer coupling as the design parameter, the research creates a sequence of 2D electronic superlattices with novel electronic and photonic properties. Scientifically, activities provide researchers in the field with important design parameters to tailor the electronic and photonic structures of vdW heterostructures. Technologically, the new generation of electronic and photonic materials and devices driven by this new line of research have important applications that benefit society. Educationally, graduate students trained through this study gain a broad scientific perspective. Through the design of a special course, the PI continues to enhance campus-wide graduate/undergraduate education in nanoscience and nanotechnology. The research also enables broadening participation of students from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nStacking two sheets of atomic lattices can create a superstructure pattern referred to as the moir? superlattice (MSL).  The periodicity of MSL can be tuned by the lattice mismatch of the two atomic sheets, or the stacking angle between them, or both (see Fig. 1(a)).  The realization of 2D electronic materials in van dee Waals (vdW) layered materials have fueled intensive research activities in using vdW homo-bilayers (two sheets of same materials) or hetero-bilayers (different vdW layers) as the building blocks to design MSL with attractive electronic and photonic properties.  In MSL, the electronic interactions between two vdW layers depend on the local interlayer stacking configuration which shows periodic variation (see Fig. 1(b)).  Thus, understanding how interlayer interactions manifest as a function of local stacking configurations, plays a central role in enabling scientists to design the electronic structures of MSL.  This is precisely the goal of this proposal. \n\nIn this proposal, we combine advanced materials synthesis techniques and advanced material characterization to achieve this goal.  The material synthesis entails controlling the formation of MSL using two different methods: (a) direct growth of one vdW atomic layer on top of the other; (b) exfoliating vdW monolayers and stacking them on top of the other vdW monolayers.  The advanced characterization techniques include: (a) investigating the 2D variation of electronic structure at atomic scale directly using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S); (b) investigating the collective optical phenomena as a result of MSL formation using laser spectroscopy; and (c) revealing the electronic structures in momentum space using angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES).  \n\nThe main outcome of our research activities is primarily reflected in the number of publications and the number of presentations in major conferences.  Here we specifically highlight two papers.  The first paper entitled ?Tailoring excitonic states of van der Waals bilayers through stacking configuration, band alignment, and valley spin? was published in the Science Advances in 2019.  Excitons in monolayer semiconductors have a large optical transition dipole for strong coupling with light. Interlayer excitons in heterobilayers feature a large electric dipole that enables strong coupling with an electric field and exciton-exciton interaction at the cost of a small optical dipole. We demonstrate the ability to create a new class of excitons in hetero- and homobilayers that combines advantages of monolayer and interlayer excitons, i.e., featuring both large optical and electric dipoles. These excitons consist of an electron confined in an individual layer, and a hole extended in both layers, where the carrier-species?dependent layer hybridization can be controlled through rotational, translational, band offset, and valley-spin degrees of freedom. We observe different species of layer-hybridized valley excitons, which can be used for realizing strongly interacting polaritonic gases and optical quantum controls of bidirectional interlayer carrier transfer.   The essence of this result is summarized in Fig. 2.\n\nThe second paper, entitled ?Time-resolved ARPES Determination of a Quasi-Particle Band Gap and Hot Electron Dynamics in Monolayer MoS2,? was published in Nano Letters in 2021.  The electronic structure and dynamics of 2D transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers provide important underpinnings both for understanding the many-body physics of electronic quasi-particles and for applications in advanced optoelectronic devices.
