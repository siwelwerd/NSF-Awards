 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sleep is crucial to the body's ability to function but scientists have yet to uncover all the reasons for why we sleep. Recent evidence shows that sleep contributes to memory, although how that happens is not yet well understood. This project explores the idea that the ability to remember depends on sleep-based changes in how memories are stored. The investigators have the special opportunity to obtain recordings of brain activity from sensors placed inside the human brain. In some patients with frequent epileptic seizures, when pharmacological treatments are ineffective, a surgical treatment can greatly enhance quality-of-life. Sensors placed in selected brain locations can isolate the source of abnormal activity, after which this brain tissue can be removed. These patients are usually willing and able to help the investigators understand what happens during sleep to preserve memories. The investigators will explore how the reactivation of new memories during sleep improves the ability to remember the information. This type of memory processing during sleep could constitute an essential ingredient for learning. Results from this project may have implications for educational advances and for approaches to improving memory across the lifespan. The investigator plans activities to increase public understanding of science and to bolster recognition of the vital benefits of sleep.\r\n\r\nA key hypothesis in the field is that a brain region known as the hippocampus functions during sleep to help consolidate memories. This can entail linking anatomically disparate components of a memory, gradually integrating new knowledge with prior knowledge, securing memory storage, and potentially transforming what is stored. The investigators will analyze recordings of brain activity from functional brain tissue to determine how memory storage is altered when audio input during sleep promotes memory reactivation. Brain oscillations identified previously (so-called slow oscillations, sleep spindles, and hippocampal ripples), and their precise temporal interrelationships, are hypothesized to be critical. Analyses of these signals obtained during memory reactivation are thus positioned to provide new knowledge about neural mechanisms of sleep-based memory improvement, thus advancing fundamental understanding of what allows a small subset of the massive number of memories people acquire each day to survive for the long term.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Prior research has shown that (a) memories are reactivated during sleep and that (b) when memories are reactivated during sleep, improved memory performance is observed after sleep. The ability to remember thus appears to depend on intervening memory processing during sleep, even though people need not know that they process memories during sleep. In this project, we gained additional insights into this contribution of memory reactivation during sleep to learning and into the associated neural mechanisms. Our studies were conducted with the generous cooperation of people who received treatment for seizure disorders that could not be controlled using medications. This treatment included the surgical implantation of electrodes inside the brain, as recordings from these electrodes were used by a clinical team to guide their approach to help the patients. For our research, we visited patients while they were in the hospital. They learned the spatial locations of a set of objects in the evening and the next morning they were tested on their ability to recall that spatial knowledge. When each object was viewed during the evening learning session, a unique sound was heard concurrently. For example, a picture of a cat was paired with the sound of a cat meow. During slow-wave sleep, two types of sounds were presented quietly so as to avoid awakening the patients. One type was called cue-sounds; these were sounds that had been presented with objects during the learning session. Half of the cue-sounds from learning were presented during sleep. The second type of sound was called standard-sounds; these sounds were selected from the same large set of sounds associated with objects but had not been used during a particular patient?s learning session. An equal number of cue-sounds and standard-sounds were presented, in random order, and these sounds were repeated multiple times. We found that memory was influenced by presentations of sounds during sleep, in that location recall was more accurate for objects cued during sleep compared to objects not cued during sleep. We infer that sound presentations during sleep provoked reactivation of the corresponding spatial knowledge, which improved storage of that specific information. Electrophysiological recordings from the brain linked specific types of brain activity to processing of this spatial information, particularly in a part of the brain known as the hippocampus. During sleep, hippocampal responses to cue-sounds differed from those to standard-sounds. These differences, and additional relationships to memory performance, provided new evidence about memory processing during sleep that adds to the existing literature on hippocampal function in both human and nonhuman learners. In addition to linking brain activity during sleep to enhanced memory storage, we found that some patients exhibited abnormal brain activity in the hippocampus during sleep. In this subgroup of patients, the presentation of cue-sounds was not associated with a memory benefit but was instead associated with a memory deficiency that was specific to the objects corresponding to those sounds. These findings add to our knowledge of how memories are stored, expanding our understanding of the critical processing takes place during sleep to support memory storage, and also showing that this processing does not transpire effectively in individuals with epilepsy-related abnormalities in hippocampal function.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/15/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ken&nbsp;A&nbsp;Paller</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
