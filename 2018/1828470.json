 "awd_abstract_narration": "The US astronomical community has embarked on a systematic effort to monitor the dynamic sky, leveraging advances in robotic telescope operation, remote-imaging sensors, large-scale computing and machine learning to find, classify, and unveil transient cosmic sources. Numerous surveys already operate at visible wavelengths, but the high cost of conventional sensors has discouraged similar efforts in the infrared (IR), despite strong scientific motivation.  Advances in material growth driven by the defense and surveillance markets have yielded lower-cost IR sensors of the semiconductor InGaAs, with sufficiently low noise to detect faint astronomical sources. The Wide-field Infrared Transient Explorer (WINTER) will mosaic six High Definition format InGaAs detectors to produce the world's widest-area IR camera and conduct a deep robotic survey of the dynamic infrared sky. In addition to its primary science mission, studying how the heaviest elements of the periodic table are synthesized in colliding neutron stars identified via gravitational waves, WINTER will devote observing time to support undergraduate research and laboratory education at the intersection of Big Data and the physical sciences.\r\n\r\nWINTER is an infrared camera with a 1.2 x 1.0 degree field of view that will be installed on a dedicated 1-meter robotic telescope at Palomar Observatory. A simple prototype shows that thermo-electrically cooled InGaAs behind an ambient temperature optical train yields broadband images (at 0.9-1.7 microns) limited by shot noise from the sky, rather than sensor noise. This removes the requirement for cryogenic optics and vacuum cryostats, greatly reducing system cost and complexity relative to traditional IR imagers with HgCdTe sensors. During each year of a 5-year baseline survey, WINTER will monitor the entire Northern sky to a depth of J=19.2 (single visit), or J=20 (combined), and release calibrated images and transient alerts to the public. WINTER is sensitive to emission from the r-process enhanced ejecta of kilonovae over the full horizon of Advanced LIGO, and will autonomously interrupt its sky survey to search for the isotropic infrared counterparts of gravitational-wave events.  WINTER's IR capability is uniquely sensitive to emission from both binary neutron star mergers and neutron star-black hole mergers independent of viewing angle, opacity, mass ratio and remnant lifetime.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

WINTER observes in the Y, J, and a custom shortened H-band, spanning 900-1700 nm in the shortwave infrared. The custom camera features six indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) detectors coupled to the telescope with a novel image slicer design, achieving a &gt;1deg square field of view. As of February 2024, WINTER has completed commissioning and begun regular operations performing a seeing-limited time domain survey of the infrared (IR) sky to detect, discover, and characterize astrophysical time-domain phenomena. WINTER achieves a J-band limiting magnitude (AB) of 19 in 960 s, its baseline survey mode. This represents a dramatic improvement in depth over previous infrared surveys like 2MASS, though our team continues to investigate future upgrades to improve this depth.

MIT designed, assembled, aligned and installed the WINTER infrared camera. Design and production of the InGaAs sensors at Teledyne-FLIR&nbsp; and the readout electronics, firmware, and software at MIT were significant research and development efforts, requiring close collaboration between the WINTER team and the sensor vendor. The WINTER sensors are the largest commercially-produced InGaAs detectors. A key requirement of the camera design was to achieve a nearly continuous 1 deg sq. field of view despite splitting the field between 6 individually packaged sensors that cannot be directly abutted. Achieving this required developing a novel compact imaging design, where each sensor has its own identical optics which are truncated and close-packed together achieving a &gt;95% fill factor over the field of view.&nbsp; Through close communication with the lens manufacturer (Optimax) we developed a method to produce lens arrays ground and assembled to micron level tolerances that could be practically aligned in the lab using available metrology.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>In addition to the camera itself, our collaboration developed the complete observatory from the ground up during the period of support from the MRI.

Caltech developed an automated data reduction pipeline for WINTER, the Modular Image Reduction and Analysis Resource (MIRAR). MIRAR handles astrometric and photometric calibration of the images, produces composite stacks of dithered images, and executes automated reference image subtraction routines to detect transient and variable astronomical images. As WINTER builds up its own volume of reference survey data, the pipeline primarily uses reference images from the UKIRT infrared survey.
