 "awd_abstract_narration": "Amplified Arctic warming in recent decades has caused a multitude of changes in terrestrial ecosystems that have potential for strong feedbacks to the global system. Arctic vegetation greening may not necessarily result in increases in carbon sequestration in Arctic tundra due to complex and uncertain soil processes. Arctic tundra tends to have a thicker organic soil horizon (peat) than most other zonal biomes; research shows that peatlands comprise a sustained carbon sink. If shallow peatlands are widespread throughout the Arctic, the overall net carbon storage capacity of tundra might be underestimated globally. However, the factors controlling the formation, distribution, and dynamics of these peat patches across the Arctic are not well understood. The overall goal of the project is to understand organic soil (peat) accumulation processes in the tundra biome and to assess the role of peat in regional and pan-Arctic carbon budgets at decadal and centennial timescales. The project will examine potential peat migration/expansion frontiers in a warming Arctic and their significance in the regional and pan-Arctic carbon cycle. The project will train undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs from diverse socio-economic and cultural backgrounds in both data analysis and modeling. The public education and outreach program includes STEM activities involving middle and high school students and a symposium on Arctic environments. The understanding of environmental conditions and processes that control the formation and northward migrations of the green peat frontier will inform Arctic stakeholders in their use of natural resources.\r\n\r\nThis multidisciplinary research team of researchers will integrate (1) new data collection from multiple tundra sites along the northernmost peat-forming frontiers of the North American Arctic, together with (2) laboratory incubation experiments, (3) a synthesis of existing data from the tundra and boreal biomes, and (4) ecosystem-scale process model simulations. The overarching question is: will the warming Arctic transform into a peat-rich landscape, as the boreal zone is now, or are there essential conditions lacking in a warming Arctic that will prevent this? To address this broad question, the research focuses on two key elements of the Arctic peat-forming ecosystems: peat patches, and the role of Sphagnum in the formation, persistence, and rapid rates of carbon sequestration of these potentially incipient peatlands. Using observational, experimental, and modeling results, along with synthesis products from a coordinated international research network, the research team will test hypotheses on (1) the ages, carbon accumulation rates, and continental pattern of these rapidly forming and migrating peat patches; (2) the various responses of production and decomposition processes to temperature and moisture change; and (3) the role of Sphagnum in modifying microclimate and shifting balance between their productivity and decomposability.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Over hundreds to thousands of years, soil carbon accumulates as peat (partially decomposed organic matter), due mainly to slow decomposition of plant litter in waterlogged and anoxic conditions.

Shallow &ldquo;peat patches&rdquo; (typically dominated by peat moss (Sphagnum) and cotton grass (Eriophorum) are distributed across tundra landscapes. These patches, with a surface organic layer generally too thin (&lt; 30 cm) to be classified as peatlands, may represent the initial stage of deeper peatland formation in the Arctic region, in a warming climate.

Lab experiments revealed that the nature of the soil (peat vs. non-peat) was much better at explaining differences in CO2 production than temperature. When normalized by soil dry weight, peat cores lost more carbon than their upland/non-peat counterparts; when normalized by soil organic carbon (SOC), we observed a reverse relationship from the normalization by dry weight.

Simulations indicated that while these peatlands continue to accumulate carbon in their surface soil layers through enhanced vegetation growth, more carbon is lost from slightly deeper in the soil profile. As a result, most sites were projected to lose relatively small amounts of carbon compared to how much they contain (&lt;5%). A regional-scale model was used to simulate the accumulation of about 400 billion tonnes of peat carbon across ~3 million square kilometers of northern peatlands over the past 15,000 years. Under recent warming, simulated peat carbon accumulation rates increased in the colder permafrost regions, while in the warmer discontinuous permafrost and permafrost-free regions peat C accumulation rates decreased. This result suggests that if permafrost regions switch to permafrost-free conditions, the peat C accumulation rate of the entire pan-Arctic region will decrease with higher temperatures.
