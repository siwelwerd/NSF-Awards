 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gamma-rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation.  Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe and can be used to test fundamental physics. The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS), located in southern Arizona, is designed to perform high-sensitivity pointed observations of both galactic and extragalactic sources.  This award supports scientists at California State University East Bay (CSUEB) in their work on VERITAS.  Dr. Furniss and her group will analyze VERITAS data to study high-energy gamma-ray emitting galaxies and probe the extragalactic magnetic fields that permeate the Universe.  This project will directly engage undergraduates in particle astrophysics research.  Students involved in the project will visit the VERITAS observatory and contribute to on-site operations and data collection.\r\n\r\nThe CSUEB group will collect and utilize VERITAS observations of very high-energy emitting active galaxies to study extragalactic gamma-ray photon propagation.  The group will contribute to the first VERITAS extragalactic catalog of these sources.  The isotropy of gamma-ray galaxies will be tested, and the location of the sources with respect to the integrated mass density along the source lines-of-sight will be characterized using publicly available catalogs.  A theoretical connection between the extragalactic magnetic fields along the lines of sight to detected sources will be investigated through the use of simulations of extragalactic gamma-ray initiated cascades.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These data, collected and analyzed by undergraduate physics, computer science and computer engineering students from California State University East Bay, allowed us to investigate if the gamma-ray emitting galaxies are located evenly throughout the cosmos, or instead are located in some relation to grand structure, e.g. void space.\nOne of the immediate results of this work was the collection of VERITAS data on gamma-ray galaxies, motivated by the uncertainty that surrounds where and how this gamma-ray light is made in these extreme objects.  Gamma-ray emitting galaxies are some of the most energetic sources in the universe.  The gamma-ray light from these sources can be affected by light and magnetic fields that reside between Earth and these sources.  The amount of this interaction remains an unknown since the amount of light and the strength of the magnetic fields remain uncertain.  What is known, is that the gamma-ray interaction with the intervening light and magnetic fields decreases the overall observed gamma-ray light as compared to what the galaxy released.  \nThis project supported the detailed investigation of gamma-ray galaxies, attempting to characterize the density of baryonic matter along the path to the galaxies.
