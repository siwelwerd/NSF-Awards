 "awd_abstract_narration": "As we know from human appearance, physical variation is essential for recognizing individuals. Recognition of individual appearance in animals can have consequences for choosing a mate, and consequently the trajectory of a species' evolution, as well.  On the one hand, evolution is typically believed to reduce the variation of individual appearance within a species. On the other, evolution has been shown to favor individuality when it promotes recognition.  This project seeks to better understand these seemingly contrasting consequences of evolution through experiments with paper wasps, insects commonly used to study the evolution of behavior.   The research will focus on a paper wasp species with highly individual facial patterns, and investigates how facial variation is encoded in its genes, how it is maintained, and to what extent natural selection favoring individuality contributes to divergence of populations to create new species. This project will also promote science education through a collaboration with the Sciencenter of Ithaca, NY and the local state park system.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work will study the selective and demographic processes shaping patterns of diversity in a uniquely tractable paper wasp. The color patterns of Polistes fuscatus wasps mediate individual recognition among co-nesting queens and show dramatic variation both within and between populations. Previous work has demonstrated that the color pattern diversity in P. fuscatus is the result of selection for individuals to advertise their identity and facilitate recognition. The extreme color pattern diversity, relatively simple genetic architecture of color variation, small genome size and abundant populations make these wasps ideal for addressing fundamental questions regarding the maintenance of phenotypic and genetic diversity in recognition systems. This powerful system will be used to investigate four major topics using a combination of comparative, population and functional genomics approaches coupled with detailed phenotyping of specimens: (1) What is the genetic architecture of individual identity signals? (2) How do phenotypic diversity and genetic architecture interact to determine patterns of genetic diversity? (3) What are the roles of selective and demographic forces in shaping patterns of phenotypic diversity? (4) Does selection on recognition systems lead to the maintenance of variation or rapid turnover in diversity across time and space?\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In terms of social behaviors, animals frequently need to distinguish among individuals that they interact with. Many species, including humans, can recognize individuals based on distinctive traits. Understanding how diversity in traits used for recognition evolves, is therefore a basic question at the heart of social biology. This research examined the evolution and genetics of color patterns used for individual facial recognition in paper wasps. This work produced the first high quality genomes and population genomic resources for this group of organisms as well as analyzed patterns of selection related to recognition. Our results revealed two dramatic, and unexpected, discoveries. First, we identified a large geographic cline in cooperative nesting behavior and color pattern diversity. Paper wasps in the northern part of the species range (in New York state) had previously been shown to be highly variable and able to recognize each other. We discovered that populations in the southern part of the range showed distinct social behaviors, lacked color pattern variation, and lacked the ability to recognize individuals. Thus, this work has identified a remarkable example of within species variation in cognitive abilities and social structure in addition to variation in signaling of individual identity. Second, in conducting population and quantitative genomic analyses related to color patterning we discovered that what had been classified as a single species, was in fact two divergent lineages. Both lineages have diverse facial patterns and are cooperative. Analysis of genomic data indicates that recent hybridization and introgression between the two distinct lineages is likely to have contributed to the recent evolution of color pattern variation and cognitive abilities found in the northern lineages. Collectively, these studies indicate that complex traits, including individuality and cognitive abilities, can evolve rapidly and may be shaped by complex histories of introgression and natural selection.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This grant also supported outreach work in collaboration with the Future Science Leaders program of the Sciencenter of Ithaca, NY.

Additionally, the Future Science Leaders program collaborated with researchers to develop interpretative signage about the paper wasp research funded by this grant, which have been erected in one of the most highly visited parks in the Finger Lakes region of New York.
