The workshop will provide lectures and hands-on training to researchers, faculty, and students on how to utilize Unidata's software tools. It will incorporate information technology to address the challenges of locating, retrieving, processing, analyzing, and managing large volumes of geoscience data.  The workshop will keep community users current on new technologies and software to assist with data-driven science. It is expected that approximately 85 people will attend.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
