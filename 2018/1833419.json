 "awd_abstract_narration": "Midocean ridge earthquakes, while not as large and damaging as subduction zone earthquakes, are nevertheless important for understanding the geological processes that form ocean crust.  These earthquakes arise due to motion on faults associated with tectonic plate extension or from magmatic activity associated with seafloor volcanic processes.  Earthquakes are also generated by crustal cracking that results from hydrothermal cooling of ocean crust.  Ocean Networks Canada have operated a cabled observatory at the Endeavour midocean spreading center segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge off the Pacific Northwest coast since 2011.  Initially, the cabled observatory supported a variety of instruments in two hydrothermal vent fields, but just a single seismic station.  In 2016, the seismic network expanded to four stations and several more are being added in summer 2018, together with more instruments to monitor the hydrothermal vent fields.  This study will create an earthquake catalog for the Endeavour cabled observatory that will update in near real time.  Seismicity from two prior experiments with autonomous ocean bottom seismometers will be relocated with three-dimensional seismic velocity models from recent a tomography. The scientific goals are to characterize how the seismicity has evolved as extensional stresses have accumulated since the segment last ruptured volcanically two decades ago, improve the interpretation of two complex earthquake swarms in 2005, constrain the linkages between hydrothermal seismicity and heat uptake above the magma chamber, and provide a public earthquake catalog that can be used by researchers to investigate temporal linkages between seismicity and variations in the hydrothermal fields.  In terms of broader impacts, this project will train a postdoctoral researcher and foster an international collaboration with Canadian scientists studying the Endeavour hydrothermal fields.\r\n\r\nLong term observatories are an important tool for capturing the seafloor spreading events that form the upper oceanic crust and for understanding the evolution of hydrothermal systems and the chemosynthetic biological communities they support.  About 1 meter of extensional strain has accumulated since the last non-eruptive diking event on the central Endeavour segment in 1999, and the rates of seismicity and level of tidal triggering are likely to evolve as the current spreading cycle approaches its culmination.  The two swarms that occurred in 2005 on the northern Endeavour segment and West Valley propagator were difficult to interpret because of large systematic location errors.  Relocating the earthquakes with an accurate three-dimensional model and the double-difference technique will allow earthquakes to be associated with morphological features and facilitate a better understanding of the magmatic and tectonic contributions to these swarms. Existing locations for the earthquakes above the axial magma chamber have absolute errors of several hundred meters and relocating these events with an accurate three-dimensional velocity model will contribute to the understanding of hydrothermal heat uptake by constraining the position of earthquakes relative to the axial magma chamber.  It may also resolve changes in the configuration of the hydrothermal system as a result of deepening of the hydrothermal system as heat is mined from the axial magma chamber and/or the injection of fresh magma.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOceanic spreading centers, also known as mid-ocean ridges, are locations where new oceanic crust is created by volcanism as two tectonic plates pull apart at rates of up to a few inches per year.  They account for about 80% of Earth?s volcanism and the hydrothermal fluids that cool these volcanoes support unique biological communities in the absence of sunlight that may mimic the setting in which life first evolved on Earth.  Understanding these volcanoes, which are located a mile or two beneath the surface of the ocean, is challenging because most scientific experiments can last no more than a year or two while the volcanoes are only active every decade or two.\n\nIn the past decade two sophisticated cabled observatories have been installed off the coast of the Pacific Northwest that extend to the Juan de Fuca Ridge, where they support long-term real time observations of oceanic spreading center volcanoes.  The objective of this project was to utilize data collected by seismometers on the Ocean Networks Canada NEPTUNE cabled observatory on the Endeavour segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge to create a catalog of the time, location and size of earthquakes associated with plate spreading, volcanism and hydrothermal activity.  In addition, some seismic data from earlier experiments at this location was reanalyzed using improved techniques.  The resulting earthquake catalog comprises over 50,000 earthquakes recorded by the Ocean Networks Canada seismometers from 2016-2021 as well as nearly 40,000 from earlier experiments in 1995 and 2003-2006.\n\nThe catalog shows that the seismicity of the Endeavour segment is dominated by the complex geometry of the plate boundary where the volcanoes that create new crust, overlap.  The last volcanic extension episode was the result of a series of non-eruptive intrusions of magma in 1999-2005.  Stresses and patterns of seismicity have progressively evolved since then as the system builds towards its next bout of volcanic activity.  The distribution of earthquakes also plays key role in creating the fractures that allow hydrothermal fluids to circulate in the crust and support the vigorous long-lived hydrothermal systems that characterize the Endeavour segment.  The software developed for this project will be used going forward to update the earthquake catalog and capture the next volcanic event which is still likely a few years away.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William S Wilcock"
