 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chirality is a ubiquitous property of life, found at many levels of biological systems from left-handed amino acids to right-handed glucose. It gives rise to the inherent chirality to DNAs, proteins and more, which remained hitherto unexplored due to the unavailability of precise characterization techniques. These chiral biomolecules can be present in both handed symmetries with undistinguishable physical properties, such as density, molecular weight or electronic and vibrational transitions frequencies making them almost impossible to differentiate with common spectroscopic techniques. Here a unique achiral plasmonic surface is proposed, which outperforms previous approaches. In the preliminary work chiral molecule detection sensitivity that is four orders of magnitude higher compared to the conventional technique, but without the extensive and tedious sample preparation and at much lower sample volume, is demonstrated. Pharmacological and toxicological characterization of chiral molecules plays a crucial role in the pharmaceutical drug industry and FDA approval process. The proposed project will also serve to train graduate students in nanolithography and device fabrication. Based on these attributes the proposed novel molecular chirality detection scheme has high potential to generate commercial interests and can become real world sensing technique in near future.\r\n\r\nTechnical: The proposed unique cavity-coupled achiral plasmonic surface outperforms previous approaches in the following aspects: It does not have geometrical chirality, hence no chiral signal from the substrate; It creates strong near-fields on the upper surface exposed to the target analyte; The near-field is 100% single-handed chiral and flip handedness depending only on the excitation handedness on the same substrate. Such a unique mechanism of superchiral near-field generation is possible due to the coherent interaction between degenerate plasmonic and photonic cavity modes. These attributes are exclusive compared to any previous attempts where inhomogeneous chiral near-field and structural CD diminishes chiral signal from molecules. In the preliminary studies, chiral light-matter interaction through surface enhanced vibrational circular dichroism with about four orders of magnitude enhancement in detection sensitivity compared to conventional volumetric CD (VCD) technique is demonstrated. The proposed system will permit efficient chiral-light matter interactions for the detection of vibrational molecular chirality in the MIR domain relevant for drug screening. Unlike previous demonstrations where two independent chiral substrates with opposite handedness were needed, the proposed work promises chiral near-field interaction on a single achiral plasmonic substrate paving the path towards surface enhanced chiroptical spectroscopy.\r\nThe main focus of the project will be to develop a sensitive chiral compound identification technique using our achiral plasmonic substrates. The system will be benchmarked with pharmacologically significant chiral drug compounds like Ibuprofen, Thalidomide, propranolol, Albuterol, and Isoflurane. These chiral compounds will allow us to start the characterization of the system and will further expand. The pharmacological and toxicological characterization of enantiomers plays a crucial role in the pharmaceutical drug industry and FDA approval process. Therefore, there is still an active need for efficient enantiomer detection, precisely and cheaply. We strongly believe that the proposed research will allow us to overcome some of the previous challenges and enable us to develop a low cost, high throughput, high sensitive chiral molecule detection technique.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In this subsection, we have experimentally demonstrated a plasmonic multispectral pixelated array exhibiting hybrid localized plasmon resonance in the mid-IR wavelength range to create unique chiral-based molecular barcodes based on their absorption fingerprints. The nanostructured platform generates simultaneously enhanced localized and symmetric electric and magnetic near-field modes at resonance on excitation with CPL. These in turn generate enhanced near-field optical chiral density which is homogeneous and whose sign can be controlled by the polarization handedness of the excitation without requiring multiple separate chiral nanostructures. The system&rsquo;s spectral resonance, and in turn its enhanced chiral response, can be tuned by changing the system&rsquo;s geometrical parameters, which has been utilized here to generate a multispectral array-based sensor.</p>\r\n<p>Surface enhanced vibrational dichroism (SEVCD), or VCD in general, provides valuable information about molecular structure and conformations that would not be possible in the UV-visible region. Owing to the system&rsquo;s symmetry and the local nature of the enhancements, we demonstrated surface enhancd infrared absorption (SEIRA) and SEVCD measurements simultaneously using the same platform. This enables us to not only extract information about the molecule&rsquo;s IR chemical properties but also provide structural information that facilitates enantiomeric discrimination and higher-order structure identification based on a unique chiral barcoding scheme. To demonstrate the efficacy of the scheme, we apply this platform to experimentally distinguish between an enantiomeric pair of small molecules and two spectroscopically similar large biomolecules based on their unique chiral barcodes. Furthermore, the response of the nanostructured system can be readily extended through parametric scaling to encompass a broader range, from mid to far infrared regions, aligning with the absorption fingerprint of the targeted chiral drugs or biomolecules.</p>\r\n<p>Present bulk liquid based conventional VCD measure dissymmetry values within 10<sup>-10 </sup>~ 10<sup>-6</sup> &micro;m<sup>-1</sup> range for molar concentrations in the order of 10<sup>-1</sup>&nbsp;M. In contrast, our thin-film approach (film thickness ~160nm) can measure dissymmetry factors (g~10<sup>-1</sup> &micro;m<sup>-1</sup>) even for concentrations as low as 50<sup> </sup>&micro;M based on extremely low volumes of a few &micro;L. Combining both path length and concentration there is about <strong>13-orders of magnitude enhancement</strong> of the normalized g-factor compared to present state-of-the-art method. Such ultra-low concentration chiral molecule detection was never reported before. The sensors are easy to fabricate based on simple large area nanoimprinting technique and can be reused after simple cleaning steps.

On molecular adsorption, the combined system&rsquo;s CD response depends on the degree and positional overlap of the molecule&rsquo;s absorbance and sensor resonance. The near-field electromagnetic and chiral density enhancement is utilized to perform simultaneous SEIRA and SEVCD within a single measurement setup at the same time. The measured signal is analyzed and encoded to generate a &lsquo;chiral barcode&rsquo; for uniquely identifying the adsorbed chiral molecule.
