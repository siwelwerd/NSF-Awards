 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engaging underrepresented and underserved students in computer science is an important goal for the development of the future workforce. The primary goal of this project is to create a sustainable ecosystem of young programmers (primarily middle school students), mentors, and teachers in the city of Newark, NJ. To achieve such an ecosystem, the project will: 1) Provide computing education to underrepresented and underserved middle school students; 2) Involve parents in and educate them about the importance of computational thinking and computing for their children's education, career, and future life; 3) Develop and maintain mentor-mentee relationships in coding; 4) Teach practicing (and potential future) teachers introductory programming concepts and how to pass them on; and 5) Fully involve teachers in the research problem-solving cycle. To accomplish these tasks, the project will run 10-week Saturday programs for middle school students each semester at participating middle school campuses. Before the start of the program, the project will have a parents' night at a local middle school to educate parents about the program, computing, and why their children should participate in the program. Each Saturday will consist of a 7-hour day, split into a morning session (building a website with HTML and CSS) and an afternoon session (learning text and block programming languages). Every other week, a guest speaker from the community will give a brief presentation of her/his career and how it was advanced by computing. Each class will have a minimum of one teacher from the middle school and a minimum of two university students who will co-teach the class and learn from each other. Once the students have finished their 10-week program, the project will invite them to join the Coding House of the Urban League of Essex County, a designated space in central Newark for local K-8 and university students to continue with their coding activities. Here, the students can learn from each other, work on projects, and develop mentor/mentee relationships. This research and development project has the potential to inform other communities about integrating computing education into their schools, involving parents, providing opportunities for practicing teachers to learn about computing topics, and giving university students practical teaching experience (who may also become interested in becoming alternate path K-8 teachers themselves). This project is supported by the Information Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers and Computer Science for All programs. \r\n\r\nThis research will contribute new insights into parental motivation/education, how to effectively train practicing teachers in computational thinking, how to facilitate the entry of university student co-teachers into the teaching profession (if they wish), and how to create an ecosystem to keep students engaged with programming through a community coding space. The project will address the following research questions: What are the specific needs of our community's parents (or guardians), and how can the project assist them to help their children succeed? How can the project train practicing (and potential future) teachers in a non-invasive, safe environment? How can middle school teachers formulate pedagogical content knowledge targeted towards computing in the context of an equitable Research-Practice Partnership with the project team? How can the project provide and prepare accessible, relatable, and effective near-peer mentors and role-models who are knowledgably in computing to NJ middle school students? Data will primarily consist of: responses from questionnaires; written notes from Parents' Night events, teacher interviews, and teacher observations; attendance records from Newark Kids Code's participating middle schools; visitor logs from the Urban League (Parents' Night events and Coding House participation); server logs from Gidget website and online repositories of Newark Kids Code Student Scratch and code.org projects. The project will use pre-post analysis and coding of qualitative data to describe the impacts of the interventions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We hosted parents' nights at local schools and a community center to educate parents about the program, computing, and why their children should participate in NKC. All NKCs were taught exclusively by near-peer mentors (instructors not much older than the students, mostly also living in Newark), who developed strong mentor-mentee relationships with the student participants. In-service middle school teachers also participated in NKC activities (e.g., logistics and helping to keep students on-task; but were not involved in teaching/instruction). During NKC, we invited guest speakers from the New York Metropolitan area to give a brief presentation of her/his career and how it was advanced by computing. Next, we provided free, summer, professional development courses and certification at our university (NJIT) for in-service high school teachers to learn more about technology, computing, and programming. We also held outreach activities throughout the academic year to NJ high schools, where our female students would present on computing and had Q&amp;A sessions with high school students and teachers. Finally, we also helped launch the Technology House (originally called the Coding House), a local community center (renovated, former residential home) for youth to gain access to computing resources such as fiber-optic internet connectivity, laptops/computers, 3D printers, drones, video equipment, and virtual reality (VR) headsets. Students who finish NKC are given priority access to the Technology House, which also has college students available on-site and virtually as mentors. NKC alumni are also invited to be mentors for subsequent NKCs and the Technology House.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Through the course of this project, we made several discoveries. For example, we found that our middle school students did not have mentors or role models in technology. We also found our middle school students came to our camps with high interest in technology, computing, and programming, and that the experience helped solidify these interests and also provided them with mentors and roles models to aspire towards. We also learned that our female youth came in with lower self-efficacy in computing compared to their male counterparts, but that participating in NKC positively increased both female and male students' self-efficacy to similar levels. These results set a clear agenda for future curriculum and after school programs, particularly targeted at underserved and underrepresented youth. These insights will be increasingly important as more jobs require computing skills, demanding rapid and effective learning.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The project had many direct impacts on society. We published 15 peer-reviewed articles, which have been read throughout the world. We taught and engaged 224+ underserved and underrepresented middle school students with coding activities. We provided 44 near-peer mentors (high school and college students) to these middle school students, creating lasting bonds between them. We also involved and motivated numerous families through parent nights, having parents/guardians pledging to be accountable for their children's attendance - which resulted in a 96%+ attendance rate throughout our program. Our professional development courses also certified a total of 22 in-service high school teachers. The project brought together community leaders and organizations, including a non-profit and public-school system. We also assisted in the development of the Technology House, which has the potential to engage, motivate, and inspire more local youth in computing for years to come.</span></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/27/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michael&nbsp;J&nbsp;Lee</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1837489/1837489_10574249_1656324982711_nkc1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1837489/1837489_10574249_1656324982711_nkc1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Newark Kids Code Graduation Ceremony\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1837489/1837489_10574249_1656324982711_nkc1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Newark Kids Code Graduation Ceremony\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A photo of one of our Newark Kids Code graduation ceremonies, celebrating the accomplishments of our young programmers.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Michael J.
