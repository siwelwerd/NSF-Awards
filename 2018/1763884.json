 "awd_abstract_narration": "PacketLab is a universal internet traffic measurement abstraction that lowers barriers faced by both experimenters and operators of internet measurement infrastructures. Internet measurement has had a major impact on science and society broadly, from helping us in identifying network threats like botnets, to providing a factual foundation for discussing internet policy issues. This work aims to serve the needs of the entire network measurement community by developing a universal interface that simplifies network measurement and facilitates resource sharing between research groups. PacketLab will make it easier to share measurement resources, and this will broaden access to these resources by institutions that would normally not have the resources to develop and maintain their own measurement platform. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to answer several fundamental questions in network measurement including 1) how to express measurement experiments using a small number of measurement primitives; 2) whether experiment logic can be effectively moved off the endpoint conducting the measurement; and 3) how measurement platform operators can ensure conformance with their platform policies while encourage resource sharing. \r\nPacketLab is built on two key ideas. First, it moves measurement logic away from the measurement endpoint to a separate experiment control server, making each endpoint a lightweight packet source or sink. Second, it provides a way to delegate access to measurement endpoints while retaining fine-grained control over how endpoints are used by experimenters, allowing research groups to share measurement infrastructure with each other with little overhead.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBroadly, this project aimed to develop a measurement infrastructurecalled PacketLab, as well as consider related measurementtechniques.  The Internet is highly heterogeneous and worksdifferently at different locations---e.g., home networks, corporatenetworks, universities, mobile networks, etc.  Therefore,researchers aiming to understand large-scale Internet behavior aimto launch measurements from as many vantage points as possible.Obtaining vantage points is generally an arduous process thatinvolves trading access with colleagues or asking friends to hostmeasurements.  This is often compounded with uncertainty about whatthe measurements will do or what problems a host may face fromrunning these measurements.  Our first goal in this project was toaddress this situation via our PacketLab platform.\n\n\nWith our colleagues at UCSD and UIUC we developed the PacketLabplatform.  The platform allows researchers to explicitly craftpackets that will be launched from PacketLab probes situated aroundthe Internet.  These packets will form the basis of measurementcampaigns.  The packets can be as simple as standard ICMP probepackets, but can also be complex custom packets required for a morespecific measurement of some new protocol or facet of the network.This packet-level access is novel in measurement platforms aspreviously most such systems worked in larger units (e.g., a webtransaction).  By working at the packet level the system afford thehost of a PacketLab vantage point the ability to closely control andconstrain measurements via policy knobs.  For instance, one vantagepoint may allow only TCP and UDP packets while another may allowtransmitting only 5 packets every second.  By giving fine-graincontrol of these probes the aim is to give hosts a way to hostPacketLab vantage points in a way that is consistent with localpolicy.  Our implementation of PacketLab is available at:https://github.com/PacketLab/packetlab.github.io\n\nIn parallel with developing the PacketLab platform we investigatedmeasurement techniques that could eventually leverage the platform.One example of these is Internet Heartbeats (IHB).  IHBs are theopposite of the pervasive scanning the Internet measurementcommunity uses.  Scanning involves send some measurement probe toeach IP address in the Internet and collecting the response.  Whilethis technique has lead to many useful insights about the Internet,it has limitations.  A crucial limitation is that all hosts are notreachable via such probe packets---e.g., hosts behind firewalls ornetwork address translators (NATs).  The IHB mechanism aims to helpbring such hosts into the measurement landscape.  Under the IHBmechanism, each host send a low-rate stream of \"heartbeats\" into thenetwork.  These can be sent to random places or directed to somecollector.  Since these heartbeats originate from end hostsfirewalls and NATs will not block these packets as they will forincoming packets.  Collecting such packets from end hosts can informus about various aspects of the network.  For instance, if wegenerally observe heartbeats arriving from some university networkand suddenly they stop arriving we may conclude that there is somesort of outage.  In turn, we can investigate this outage todetermine it's root cause---which could be as benign as a powerfailure or more malicious like an Internet routing attack.  We haveimplemented IHBs as part of this project as an example use ofPacketLab.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/31/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark Allman"
