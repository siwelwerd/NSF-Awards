 "awd_abstract_narration": "Diverse species worldwide are endangered because of habitat loss and increased exposure to human activities. Research is needed that moves beyond the current focus on protected areas to other human-modified landscapes to determine how wildlife and humans can coexist. This doctoral dissertation project combines behavioral, ecological, demographic, and genetic data from an endangered lemur species that lives in a landscape shared with humans, to assess how this species is affected by human activities. In addition to furthering knowledge about human-lemur dynamics, the project will provide a model for wildlife biologists and managers of protected areas to investigate human-wildlife dynamics more generally. As part of this project, investigators will train students in field and laboratory techniques, including behavioral data collection, wildlife surveys, and DNA extraction and amplification. Further, the project will contribute to public science outreach, international research collaborations, and primate conservation. \r\n\r\nThe investigators will conduct a fine-scale analysis of the impacts of human activities on the ecology of the Verreaux's sifaka, including how this lemur species responds to disturbances and which types of human activities are most threatening. Behavioral, demographic, and geographic data will be collected for sifakas living in areas subject to differing degrees of human disturbance. These investigations will be focused at Bez\u00e0 Mahafaly Special Reserve, a recently expanded protected area in southwest Madagascar that includes core conservation areas as well as areas of regulated human use. At a larger landscape scale, investigators will survey unprotected forest fragments in the Bez\u00e0 region and conduct landscape genetic analyses, using fecal DNA. These analyses will determine how sifakas move across the human-dominated landscape and how the structure of the sifaka population is influenced by patterns of human land use. Finally, investigators will combine long-term demographic data from the core sifaka population at Bez\u00e0 with data on sifaka movement into and out of the reserve to predict the population's future growth and stability.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
