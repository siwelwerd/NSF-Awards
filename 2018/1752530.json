 "awd_abstract_narration": "Steels are ubiquitous as structural materials, and are found in nearly every piece of transportation, shipping, construction, or mining equipment; in buildings, roads, pipelines, appliances, and in many other applications. In the past 15 years, driven by increasingly challenging fuel economy standards, sheet steels used in automotive bodies have achieved strengths that are five times those of previous alloys. Normally, increasing strength results in a compromise in ductility - the ability for a material to stretch or bend without fracture - but these new Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) sheets minimize the severity of this compromise. The primary way this has been achieved is by designing the microscopic structure of the steels to resist fracture, based on new understanding of how to control this structure when manufacturing steels. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) Award supports fundamental scientific research to uncover the relationships between the processing of these steels, the microscopic structure, and their properties and performance. A broad range of deformation conditions will be studied to better understand the material response and allow the design of steels with even better properties. This will further improve the automobile structures and help meet stringent fuel economy standards, and can also be translated to other sectors to improve the efficiency and performance in many other steel applications.\r\n\r\nThis work will aim to close the design loop to develop a fundamental understanding of austenite stability during thermomechanical processing (TMP) of advanced high strength steel (AHSS) alloys that use the Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) mechanism to yield exceptional combinations of strength and ductility. The ability for strain-induced austenite-to-martensite transformation to suppress strain localization, and thereby produce excellent properties, is dependent on the thermal and mechanical stability of the austenite; if austenite is too stable, it will not transform during deformation, and if austenite is unstable, it will not be retained at room temperature. Current approaches to stabilize austenite focus on increasing carbon content by performing precise thermal cycles that allow diffusion of carbon from other phases to austenite. Here the research focuses on the use of deformation conditions, including strain rate, strain state, temperature, and stress state/pressure, to understand how to further control austenite stability by performing focused mechanical testing of specifically designed alloys. The understanding developed in this work will result in a science-based understanding of austenite stability in AHSS that can be incorporated into thermodynamic and mechanical materials models, and which will enable the use of Integrated Computation Materials Engineering (ICME) and Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) principles to realize advanced manufacturing and further improve the exceptional properties that can be realized in these low-alloy, low-cost materials that underpin our efforts for lightweight structures in the transportation sector and beyond.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

However, deformation conditions may vary during these processes, which is problematic because the martensitic phase transformation is intrinsically responsive to strain rate and temperature. This is known to influence the balance of strain accommodation and strengthening via transformation-induced plasticity and dislocation slip. This thesis explores the processing-property relationships that govern the performance of 3GAHSS created with the Quenching and Partitioning (Q&amp;P) process, with the goal of better understanding the influence of deformation processing factors on the austenite stability and mechanical performance. Two grades of Q&amp;P steel, having different fractions of ferrite and ultimate tensile strengths of 980 and 1180 MPa, were mechanically tested over a range of temperatures from 22 to 250 &#9702;C and strain rates from 10&minus;4 to 103 s&minus;1, while the martensitic transformation was tracked by a combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron microscopy. In some instances, XRD was performed ex-situ with a lab diffractometer, while in higher resolution experiments, XRD was performed in-situ using high-energy synchrotron light. After fracture, spatially-resolved electron backscatter diffraction kernel average misorientation (EBSD-KAM) analysis was performed to complement the bulk XRD data. Several studies used ex-situ XRD to elucidate the effect of the martensitic transformation on the mechanical properties, as a function of tensile specimen orientation and strain rate, respectively. The orientation of tensile specimens relative to the rolling direction of the sheet appeared to strongly influence the extent of the martensitic transformation, which may have been caused by crystallographic texture that developed during cold rolling and Q&amp;P heat treating. Meanwhile, increasing the strain rate appeared to suppress the martensitic transformation, but it was unclear whether deformation-induced heating or the strain rate increase was responsible. An additional experiment was performed using a thermal-mechanical simulator, to decouple the influences of deformation-induced heating and strain rate on the martensitic phase transformation. By the combination of ex-situ XRD and EBSD-KAM analysis, it was observed that deformation-induced heating suppressed the martensitic transformation, while increasing the strain rate promoted the transformation. To resolve the martensitic transformation with greater spatial and temporal resolution, quasi-static elevated-temperature tensile tests and dynamic-rate room-temperature tensile tests were performed, while XRD data were collected in-situ using synchrotron light. Because the XRD was performed in-situ, the bulk mechanical response, as well as the amount of deformation-induced martensite, the stresses/strains on individual phases, and the peak broadening due to the elastic strain fields of dislocations, were measured concurrently. A strong temperature dependence of the martensitic transformation was observed, and the highest quality fit against existing empirical models for the transformation was reached when the strain partitioning between the phases was incorporated. The temperature dependence may have been linked to both the driving force for the transformation and the number of available martensite nucleation sites.
