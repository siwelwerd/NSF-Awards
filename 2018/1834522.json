 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Alliance for Inclusive and Diverse STEM Faculty (NAIDSF) is an NSF INCLUDES Alliance which intends to increase the learning, persistence, and completion of students from underrepresented groups (URG) in STEM throughout postsecondary education, and thereby increase their contributions to the U.S. STEM enterprise. Broadening participation in the STEM workforce will bring diverse perspectives, improving our nation's ability to solve complex social challenges, and expanding the technological and innovation-based economy. The Alliance's overarching strategy is to improve professional development and hiring practices of STEM faculty across three interactive change strategies at institutional, regional, and national levels. To facilitate Institutional Change, NAIDSF will help institutions examine their practices for recruiting, hiring, and retaining URG faculty; enhance faculty inclusive practices; develop action plans to increase diversity among STEM faculty; provide resources to help implement needed reforms; and provide training for the next generation of diverse institutional leaders. Recognizing that career pathways for faculty at 2-year colleges often occur within regional ecosystems, NAIDSF's Regional Change initiative will build Regional Collaboratives of 2-year colleges, 4-year regional universities, local research universities, and the private sector--all collectively developing and onboarding more faculty who are skilled in teaching diverse student populations and increasing the number of diverse faculty in the 2-year colleges where many URG students begin higher education. NAIDSF will seek National Change by partnering with disciplinary, URG-focused, and professional development organizations to align faculty disciplinary experiences with their institutional experiences that are fostered through the Alliance's Institutional and Regional Change initiatives. Together, these efforts will create and advance national systemic change for STEM faculty, STEM departments, disciplinary societies, and institutional leadership.\r\n\r\nAnchored by the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU) and the Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning (CIRTL), over 50 universities, three regional collaboratives (Iowa, California, and Texas), and more than 35 cross-sector partners have already committed to collectively achieving the Alliance goals. Using collective impact to work across sectors (diverse institutional types and disciplinary societies) as well as across systems (institutional leaders, departments, faculty, and professional development systems), the Alliance aims to enhance the use of inclusive practices to increase the diversity of the national STEM faculty at the institutional, regional, and national levels. Goals will be evaluated through a comprehensive plan providing both formative and summative assessments within the change streams and across the Alliance. A set of common metrics will be used to align activities and foci across the Alliance. NAIDSF includes both research and evaluation teams assessing the Alliance's theories of change, immediate impacts, and feeding back on collaborative processes. Integrating CIRTL's success in shared leadership decision-making and APLU's engagement with multiple groups of institutional leaders, the leadership team will develop and share Alliance policies, coordinate activities across workstreams, and engage with leaders of partnering and related efforts. Connecting the entire project, the Alliance backbone will coordinate and integrate activities and provide a multifaceted communications structure. Alliance programming is designed to be modular, portable, and adaptable, making it both accessible and sustainable at both institutions and disciplinary groups that vary in size, resources, and mission.\r\n\r\nThis NSF INCLUDES Alliance is co-funded by the NSF's Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) program, which targets increasing the number of historically underrepresented minority faculty in STEM disciplines.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Aspire is collaboratively led by six institutions as part of an NSF cooperative agreement. Aspire has 3 change teams (Institutional Change, Regional Change, and National Change); 3 support teams (Backbone, Research, and Evaluation); and<strong> </strong>4 goals: 1) Deepen the preparation of all future, early-career and current STEM faculty to be inclusive and effective in their undergraduate teaching, research mentoring and advising; 2) Diversify the national faculty through effective recruitment, hiring, and retention of underrepresented group (URG) STEM faculty via institutional transformation in practices, policies, and resources; 3) Foster postsecondary organizational cultures that recognize and value inclusivity and diversity broadly, and in the context of STEM faculty work specifically; and 4): Collective Impact and Collaborative Infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Change Team Impacts &amp; Activities</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The Institutional Change Team</strong> has built thriving communities of practice, both within and across institutions, to address inclusive hiring and retention practices. 64 institutions have conducted self-assessment exercises, developed action plans, and implemented policy and practice changes as part of the IChange Network. Other key programs include:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aspirealliance.org/institutional-change/iaspire-leadership-academy\">IAspire Leadership Academy</a> for URG emerging leaders (88 fellows to date) and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aspirealliance.org/institutional-change/ichange-network/ithrive-collective\">IThrive Collective</a> for BIPOC faculty and allies.</p>\n<p><strong>The Regional Change Team</strong> supports partnerships between&nbsp;2- and 4-year institutions to build inclusive pathways for diverse graduate students&nbsp;to&nbsp;explore&nbsp;and secure&nbsp;positions as STEM faculty at 2-year institutions. They have formed 9 Rregional Ccollaboratives which have engaged over 200 graduate students from 35, 4-year institutions in mentored teaching practicums at 22, 2-year institutions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>The National Change Team</strong> develops resources based on the Inclusive Professional Framework (IPF) for future/current faculty, staff, and postdocs in inclusive teaching, mentoring, advising, leadership, and colleagueship. They have partnered with institutions, disciplinary research societies and professional organizations to develop and facilitate 74 workshops and trainings, including 4 annual week-long Aspire Summer Institutes, with 22 unique institutions, 1 lab, and 5+ different grant initiatives, and engaged over 2500 participants through these efforts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Research Output</strong></p>\n<p>Collectively the Alliance has <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/aspire-alliance/resources/reflection-lab-aspire-to-impact\">produced</a> 8 peer-reviewed scholarly articles, over 19 resource guides and white papers, and provided dozens of presentations on topics ranging from how organizations facilitate DEI change, the role of boundary spanners in a collective impact organization, and the foundations of a DEI professional development framework for faculty.</p>\n<p><strong>University of Wisconsin-Madison Specific Activities and Impacts&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>The UW-Madison team has made strong conceptual contributions to the field through the Inclusive Professional Framework (supported by 11 publications and over 30 workshops and presentations to date) and the SEER Process (www.theseerinstitute.org), which has integrated the IPF as the foundation for examining and engaging in organizational change by better seeing the humanity of the individuals within organizational systems while at the same time, the larger dynamics in play related to structures, policies, and practices. The SEER Process enables organizational change leaders and project teams to better <strong>See</strong> their project within larger system dynamics, <strong>Enact</strong> informed and collaborative actions, <strong>Evaluate</strong> the success of interventions, and regularly <strong>Revisit</strong> goals, actions, and evaluation strategies. The IPF has also been expanded beyond a faculty-focused context and now includes applications for STEM disciplinary and professional (IPF:Societies), faculty and academic advising (IPF: Advising), and institutional staff (IPF:Staff, which is still in development).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition, the UW-M team advanced timely and needed professional development programming for a wide range of constituents in the STEM higher education landscape with evaluation results demonstrating increases in knowledge and self-efficacy with a high likelihood of post-event implementation. The UW-M team also made important contributions through impactful publications (n=11), workshops and trainings (n=74), publicly available resources (n=4), a sustainability rubric created by the Center for Evaluation &amp; Research for STEM Equity (CERSE) at the University of Washington for complex STEM reform projects, and have collaborated on the advancement of 4 new initiatives (i.e., LED-BIO (NSF #: 2134725); ACCESS+ (NSF #: 2017953); REVIIS (NSF #: 2305550); and EVOLVED (NSF #2233790).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Lastly, building upon the foundation of the first five years of the Aspire Alliance and to plan for ongoing sustainability, the UW-M team launched the SEER Institute in 2023 to pursue both new grant funding opportunities and a fee-for-service model in five key areas, namely, strategic planning, team and project development, grant development, research and evaluation, and professional development. To date, the UW-M team has met with 16 potential institutional and organizational clients, 11 of which have led to additional engagement. The UW-M team completed sustained engagement programming using the SEER Process with 2 campus teams, developed 3 professional development clients, collaborated on three grant proposals, and have 2 contracts to deliver professional development programming in the Fall.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 09/03/2024<br>\nModified by: Lucas&nbsp;B&nbsp;Hill</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div

Aspire has 3 change teams (Institutional Change, Regional Change, and National Change); 3 support teams (Backbone, Research, and Evaluation); and 4 goals: 1) Deepen the preparation of all future, early-career and current STEM faculty to be inclusive and effective in their undergraduate teaching, research mentoring and advising; 2) Diversify the national faculty through effective recruitment, hiring, and retention of underrepresented group (URG) STEM faculty via institutional transformation in practices, policies, and resources; 3) Foster postsecondary organizational cultures that recognize and value inclusivity and diversity broadly, and in the context of STEM faculty work specifically; and 4): Collective Impact and Collaborative Infrastructure.\n\n\nChange Team Impacts & Activities\n\n\nThe Institutional Change Team has built thriving communities of practice, both within and across institutions, to address inclusive hiring and retention practices. 64 institutions have conducted self-assessment exercises, developed action plans, and implemented policy and practice changes as part of the IChange Network. Other key programs include:IAspire Leadership Academy for URG emerging leaders (88 fellows to date) andIThrive Collective for BIPOC faculty and allies.\n\n\nThe Regional Change Team supports partnerships between2- and 4-year institutions to build inclusive pathways for diverse graduate studentstoexploreand securepositions as STEM faculty at 2-year institutions. They have formed 9 Rregional Ccollaboratives which have engaged over 200 graduate students from 35, 4-year institutions in mentored teaching practicums at 22, 2-year institutions.\n\n\nThe National Change Team develops resources based on the Inclusive Professional Framework (IPF) for future/current faculty, staff, and postdocs in inclusive teaching, mentoring, advising, leadership, and colleagueship. They have partnered with institutions, disciplinary research societies and professional organizations to develop and facilitate 74 workshops and trainings, including 4 annual week-long Aspire Summer Institutes, with 22 unique institutions, 1 lab, and 5+ different grant initiatives, and engaged over 2500 participants through these efforts.\n\n\nResearch Output\n\n\nCollectively the Alliance has produced 8 peer-reviewed scholarly articles, over 19 resource guides and white papers, and provided dozens of presentations on topics ranging from how organizations facilitate DEI change, the role of boundary spanners in a collective impact organization, and the foundations of a DEI professional development framework for faculty.\n\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison Specific Activities and Impacts\n\n\nThe UW-Madison team has made strong conceptual contributions to the field through the Inclusive Professional Framework (supported by 11 publications and over 30 workshops and presentations to date) and the SEER Process (www.theseerinstitute.org), which has integrated the IPF as the foundation for examining and engaging in organizational change by better seeing the humanity of the individuals within organizational systems while at the same time, the larger dynamics in play related to structures, policies, and practices. The SEER Process enables organizational change leaders and project teams to better See their project within larger system dynamics, Enact informed and collaborative actions, Evaluate the success of interventions, and regularly Revisit goals, actions, and evaluation strategies. The IPF has also been expanded beyond a faculty-focused context and now includes applications for STEM disciplinary and professional (IPF:Societies), faculty and academic advising (IPF: Advising), and institutional staff (IPF:Staff, which is still in development).\n\n\nIn addition, the UW-M team advanced timely and needed professional development programming for a wide range of constituents in the STEM higher education landscape with evaluation results demonstrating increases in knowledge and self-efficacy with a high likelihood of post-event implementation. The UW-M team also made important contributions through impactful publications (n=11), workshops and trainings (n=74), publicly available resources (n=4), a sustainability rubric created by the Center for Evaluation & Research for STEM Equity (CERSE) at the University of Washington for complex STEM reform projects, and have collaborated on the advancement of 4 new initiatives (i.e., LED-BIO (NSF #: 2134725); ACCESS+ (NSF #: 2017953); REVIIS (NSF #: 2305550); and EVOLVED (NSF #2233790).\n\n\nLastly, building upon the foundation of the first five years of the Aspire Alliance and to plan for ongoing sustainability, the UW-M team launched the SEER Institute in 2023 to pursue both new grant funding opportunities and a fee-for-service model in five key areas, namely, strategic planning, team and project development, grant development, research and evaluation, and professional development. To date, the UW-M team has met with 16 potential institutional and organizational clients, 11 of which have led to additional engagement. The UW-M team completed sustained engagement programming using the SEER Process with 2 campus teams, developed 3 professional development clients, collaborated on three grant proposals, and have 2 contracts to deliver professional development programming in the Fall.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/03/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: LucasBHill\n"
