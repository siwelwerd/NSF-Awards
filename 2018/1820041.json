 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase 1 project will create an educational technology that accelerates the acquisition of foundational English language skills by children (4 to 10 years old), by melding English and Spanish language instruction, delivered via a personalized digital learning platform. Using state-of-the-art text-to-speech and speech-to-text engines, students that are English Language Learners (ELL) will engage in deliberate literacy practice across the four modalities of language (listening, speaking, reading, writing). Over the last decade, the number of ELL students enrolling in public schools has steadily increased while there remains a shortage of bilingual or certified ELL teachers. Technology can help these teachers to personalize instruction and extend the school day which in turn increases engaged learning time. Achieving college and career readiness is an economic imperative for all students, especially ELL students given the importance of English communication skills to career success. While developing technologies for use in classrooms by young children can be a risky proposition due to the nature of the modern classroom, the reward far outweighs the risk. This project will produce a high-impact technology solution designed for young children that integrates the latest text-to-speech and speech-to-text technologies and is grounded in sound research about language skill acquisition across the four modalities.\r\n\r\nThe key innovation of this SBIR Phase 1 project is a plurilinguistic (e.g., Spanish and English) approach to literacy development across the four modalities of language (e.g., reading, writing, speaking, listening) where young students (aged 4-10 years old) are immersed in personalized learning experiences specifically tailored to support and accelerate language development. The first research goal is to test the feasibility for using and adapting proprietary English and Spanish language text-to-speech and speech-to-text engines with young children. The second research goal is to examine the impact of a dual-language personalized learning platform on children?s acquisition of foundational listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills. Participants will be ELL students whose first language is Spanish. The research is based on a plurilinguistic framework for second language acquisition; researchers hypothesize that a dual-language application that leverages students' first language to learn English will score significantly higher on independent measures of foundational literacy skills and self-efficacy for learning compared to students who are using an English-only personalized learning application. A mechanism of growth may be the amount of time students are immersed in deliberate practice of literacy skills. A dual-language personalized learning platform has the potential to extend teacher-led literacy instruction and increase the amount of time students spend engaged in learning English.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Students who are English Language Learners (ELL), especially those in pre-kindergarten and early elementary grades as well as those new to the United States, are at-risk for not attaining college and career readiness. Based on current research, High Road Learning, Inc (HRL). partnered with educators and linguists to create Educyte, a dual-language literacy platform that provides personalized practice in the four modalities of literacy (reading, writing, speaking, listening). Educyte is based on the principles of deliberate practice: practice should (1) be targeted to the ability of the student, (2) provide immediate feedback as tasks are completed, (3) be spread over time, understanding that mastery takes thousands of hours to develop, and (4) be self-directed by the learner when possible.</p>\n<p>The first major goal of this project was to integrate the most effective text-to-speech and speech-to-text technologies given the age of the audience. These technologies were critical in providing students with practice in all four modalities of language. It is important to note that all data was collected for both English and Spanish, as both languages had to be present to create a true dual-literacy platform. The services offered by Google and Amazon respectively provide state-of-the-art engines that were tested. To evaluate text-to-speech technologies (computer-synthesized voice), letters, words, and sentences were played for students, parents, and educators and they were asked which voice they preferred and understood best. There was not a significant difference in preference between the Google and Amazon voice. Each voice was considered clear and understandable. To evaluate speech-to-text (computer-transformation of human voice to text), students were asked to speak letters, words, and sentences and the recorded audio was transformed into text via each speech-to-text engine and scored by a human. The Amazon speech-to-text engine was slightly more accurate than the Google engine, but the margin was small. On average, Amazon?s service was able to correctly recognize 85% of the collected speech samples. Sampling the incorrectly recognized recordings showed atypical pronunciations (e.g., elongated or delayed letter sounds) and other aspects that a human ear was better-able to overcome.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The second major goal was to evaluate whether dual language deliberate practice leads to more rapid language acquisition than total immersion in a single language. Both ELL and native English-speaking students used Educyte during the Fall semester of the 2019-2020 academic year. Students used Educyte in either a pull-out setting or blended learning model in the classroom; the approach adopted was developed in collaboration with classroom teachers and building-level administrators. The specific objectives were: (a) to have students use Educyte an average of 20-30 minutes per day, (b) immerse children into different ratios of English to Spanish literacy activities, and (c) enhance children's literacy skills in English and Spanish as a function of their immersion in both languages. Students in both the ELL and non-ELL groups were active during the Fall 2019 semester, completing almost 19,000 activities across the four modalities of language. As expected, writing was the most time-consuming activity due to either student age (e.g., slow keyboarders) or writing task (e.g., writing letters versus words versus paragraphs). Based on student performance, Educyte artificial intelligence made mastery judgments to advance students through the learning progression. Educyte detected over 3,600 mastery events (e.g., a student mastering writing the letter 'd', recognizing the digraph 'ch').</p>\n<p>To support implementation of the project in schools and classrooms, HRL created professional learning teams (PLT) at participating schools. Each PLT was comprised of at least one: (a) general education teacher, (b) teacher who speaks Spanish, (c) learning scientist, and a technologist. At the start of the project, team members focused their professional learning on three key topics: (1) Alignment of Educyte's learning activities to promoting bi-literacy among children and adolescents learning English as a second language, (2) strategies for using Educyte in authentic classroom settings, and (3) Identification and sharing of effective strategies for blending teacher-led direct instruction with technology-enabled deliberate practice. These conversations provided the design team with key insights into how educators use technology to personalize each child's literacy practice, create new classroom routines to promote effective and equitable use of technology, and recommend classroom routines and strategies to teachers who joined the project later in the implementation. Creating resources and blending face-to-face professional development with technology-enabled adult learning opportunities to facilitate PLTs within a school was a critical component of the project's success.</p>\n<p>Lastly, HRL collaborated with school district staff and community members to conduct programs to reach out to Latino families. Members of the community were invited to use Educyte to enhance both their Spanish and English literacy skills. The project expanded into additional general and special education classes (Pre-kindergarten-12<sup>th</sup> grade), Spanish and English language learning classes, and community organizations (e.g., church ministry outreach).</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/27/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Carl&nbsp;W&nbsp;Swartz</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1820041/1820041_10550691_1580156741106_DashboardES--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1820041/1820041_10550691_1580156741106_DashboardES--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Student Dashboard (Spanish)\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1820041/1820041_10550691_1580156741106_DashboardES--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Student Dashboard (Spanish)\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The student dashboard provides easy access to the different Educyte activities.
