CAV is one of the premier conferences in computer science, dedicated to the advancement of the theory and practice of computer-aided formal analysis methods for hardware and software systems. The purpose of Verification Mentoring Workshop is to provide mentoring and career advice to early-stage graduate students, to attract them to pursue research careers in the area of computer-aided verification. Funded students will benefit greatly from the opportunity to engage in the critical technical, professional, and social exchanges that both conferences foster.\r\n\r\nComputer-aided verification covers a broad range of applications, from ensuring the correctness and safety of computer systems, to improving design and development productivity. The funded students will attend CAV, a top conference where they will learn about current research problems and interact with leaders in the field, and the VMW workshop which will focus on mentoring and career advice specific to early-stage graduate students who aim to pursue research careers in the area of computer-aided verification.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

VMW is intended to focus explicitly on mentoring and career advice, along with an opportunity for participants to attend a top conference. The previous three VMWs were co-located with CAV 2015 (San Francisco, USA), CAV 2016 (Toronto, Canada), and CAV 2017 (Heidelberg, Germany), respectively. Through the generous support of NSF for VMW 2015, we supported the travel of 17 US-based students, of which 6 were women and 3 were from underrepresented minority groups (including one woman). In 2016, we supported 17 US-based students with support from NSF, of which 4 were women. In 2017, we supported 11 US-based students with support from NSF, of which 6 were women. All three VMWs received positive feedback from students and other attendees.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>CAV 2018 was held on July 14-17 in Oxford, UK, as part of the Federated Logic Conference (FLoC) which brings together 9 major international conferences related to mathematical logic and computer science, as well as and 79 workshops.
