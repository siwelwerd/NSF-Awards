 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plant pathogens can lead to severe crop yield loss, thereby threatening global food security.  Understanding the molecular mechanisms of plant immunity will ultimately help develop better disease control strategies.  An integral part of plant immunity is the activation of a large number of defense-related genes upon pathogen infection.  This project is focused on a potential master regulator of plant defense gene expression with a critical role in plant immunity.  The main goals of the project are to i) identify the spectrum of genes that are directly regulated by the regulator, ii) establish the mechanisms by which the regulator activates plant defense-related genes and iii) determine the regulation of the regulator during the activation of plant immune responses.  Results from this project will enhance our understanding of the process of differential gene expression fundamental not only to plant immune systems but also to all complex processes in living organisms.  This project will integrate research with training, learning, diversity and outreach activities. Postdoctoral fellows and students working on the project will receive interdisciplinary training in a wide range of molecular approaches.  The project will be integrated into classroom learning for students, including those from underrepresented groups and high school students, to increase the general public's awareness of science and technology.\r\n  \r\nTranscription reprogramming in plant immunity is achieved through concerted action of specific transcription factors (TFs) through recruitment or release of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II).  The RNAP II holoenzyme contains a group of general TFs (GTFs), which are believed to be required for transcription of all genes.  Transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) is a GTF for RNAP II.  Interestingly, Arabidopsis have 14 genes encoding TFIIB-related proteins including six plant-specific TFIIB-related proteins (pBrps).  This project is focused on Arabidopsis pBrp1.  The pbrp1 mutants are compromised in both disease resistance and defense gene expression. In uninfected plants, the pBrp1 protein is retained on the plastid envelop and nuclear pBrp1 is detected only when proteasome pathways are inhibited.  Pathogen infection induces pBrp1 accumulation.  These results suggest that pBrp1 is a regulated GTF of a special RNAP II holoenzyme that directs a defense gene transcription program.  To test this hypothesis, the project will identify the direct target genes of pBrp1 using genome-wide transcriptome profiling and ChIP-seq.  The direct association of pBrp1 with RNAP II will be determined using co-immunoprecipitation to confirm pBrp1 is a GTF for RNAP II and to identify other components in the complexes with roles in the action and regulation of pBrp1.  The protein levels and nuclear translocation of pBrp1 will be manipulated to determine the importance of the tight regulation of pBrp1 for balancing plant defense with fitness.  These studies will help elucidate transcriptional regulation of plant immunity, as well as the intricate mechanisms for timely, accurate and effective activation of plant defense.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nAn integral part of plant immunity is altered expression of many plant host genes involved in plant immune responses through concerted action of specific transcription factors (TFs) that activate or repress genes through recruitment or release of RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Pol II is assembled into Pol II holoenzyme at the promoters through association with a group of general transcription factors to activate transcription. Transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) is a general transcription factor for Pol II. Unlike other eukaryotic organisms, plants have a large family of TFIIB-related proteins with 15 members in Arabidopsis including several plant-specific TFIIB-related proteins (pBRPs). Molecular genetic analysis has revealed important roles of some TFIIB-related proteins in plant reproductive processes. As the founding member of the pBRP protein family, pBrp1 from model plant Arabidopsis thaliana was first reported in 2003 but its biological function is still not unknown.\n\n\nThis project has revealed that mutations of pBRP1 gene do not affect plant growth and development but cause hyper-susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Using genomics approaches, the project has further uncovered that pBRP1 regulates pathogen-induced expression of a large number of plant defense-related genes, including those involved in biosynthesis and signaling of plant defense signal molecule salicylic acid (SA). Pathogen-induced SA accumulation and SA-responsive defense gene expression are reduced in the pbrp1 mutant plants. Exogenous SA can rescue the brp1 mutants for resistance to the bacterial pathogen. These findings support an important role of pBRP1 in plant immune responses by promoting expression of plant defense and defense-related genes including those in SA-mediated defense signaling.\n\n\nThe project has also discovered that pBRP1 is associated with a variety of proteins including chloroplast proteins, transcription factors and proteins involved in protein degradation. pBRP1 is normally localized on the surface of chloroplasts. Upon pathogen infection, nuclear accumulation of pBRP1 is elevated. The project has found that pBRP1 acts as a strong transcription-activating factor in both yeast and plant cells. pBRP1 is also associated with Pol II subunits and associated general transcription factors. These findings indicate that pBRP1 functions as an accessory protein for the Pol II complex that may direct the transcription of a broad set of defense- and stress-responsive genes by Pol II. Transcriptional reprogramming plays an essential role in plant stress response and progress in understanding the underlying mechanisms will help develop new strategies for protecting plants against stress conditions. Establishment of a general transcription factor as a critical regulator of plant defense gene expression challenge our current understanding of eukaryotic gene transcription with implications beyond plants.\n\n\nIn addition, the project has provided scientific and professional training to both graduate and undergraduate students, including those from underrepresented groups. Some of the experiments from the project has been integrated into classroom teaching. The knowledge from the research part of the project has been disseminated to the scientific community through publications, as well as posters and talks at scientific meetings.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/04/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ZhixiangChen\n"
