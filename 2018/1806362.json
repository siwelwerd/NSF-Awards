 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will use an ensemble of neutral atoms cooled to temperatures lower than anywhere else in the known Universe, held in a crystal formed by intersecting laser beams, superbly isolated from the outside world, and detected with highly sensitive imaging methods, to model and understand the properties of solid-state materials. The broad goal of this work is to promote the progress of science in two specific areas that are presently of high scientific and economic interest. First, experiments on these ultracold atomic gases will unravel central mysteries in materials science, specifically those pertaining to materials with strongly correlated electrons and frustrated magnetic interactions, both of which lead to novel phases of matter. These novel phases may enable advances in information storage, information processing, or high-temperature superconductivity. Second, this project advances capabilities in preparing and controlling complex quantum systems. These capabilities are expected to fuel the development of new quantum technologies. In fact, the graduate students and postdoctoral researchers conducting this work will gain valuable skills and be positioned to make significant contributions to the nascent quantum technologies sector, as well as in academic and other research positions. \r\n\r\nMore specifically, this project focuses on the quantum properties of itinerant particles in two new non-primitive two-dimensional crystal structures: a trimerized Kagome lattice and a hexamerized honeycomb lattice. In the current experimental setup, the itinerant particles are rubidium atoms and the crystal structure is formed using a bichromatic optical lattice. In both lattice structures, strongly bonded multi-site plaquettes are coupled weakly to one another. In the limit of zero coupling between plaquettes, the lattices are composed of many fully isolated, few-site, few-particle quantum systems. Measurements will probe the single-body and few-body quantum states of these plaquettes, advancing our capabilities in quantum state engineering and realizing minimal representations of bosonic Laughlin states. In the regime where coupling between plaquettes is introduced, many-body physics emerges in a controlled manner. Measurements will be performed to reveal interesting orbital-magnetism states and characterize rapidly rotating lattice-trapped quantum gases.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In this approach, the ultracold atoms serve as a proxy for electrons or other itinerant particles, and the optical lattice serves as a proxy for the ordered crystal in which these particles propagate.  Constructing a direct simulacrum (also known as a \"quantum simulation\") of materials using ultracold atoms and optical lattices has the advantage that the model system is precisely characterized, that there is great flexibility in tuning the model system to see how microscopic properties of materials influence their macroscopic behavior, and that we can apply a broad suite of measurement techniques to probe these model systems.\n\nSpecifically, this project focused on two dimensional optical superlattices, and resulted in three major outcomes, each described in prominent peer-reviewed publications.

The band structure of a material, which characterizes the motion of non-interacting particles in a crystalline potential, is the standard starting point for understanding materials properties.  In some instances, however, this non-interacting band structure does a poor job at describing a real material in which the itinerant particles interact with one another.  The modification of band structure owing to the effects of interactions is known as band-structure renormalization.  In our work, we studied the motion of thousands of atoms that were all excited into the same state within the band structure of the kagome lattice.
