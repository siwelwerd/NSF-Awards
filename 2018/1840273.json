 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cells containing multiple nuclei (syncytial cells) are common across the entire tree of life and are found in every biosphere from bone, muscle, placenta and embryos of animals to the complex networks formed by fungi, water- and slime-molds. Yet little is known about the advantages an organism receives from having multinucleated cells, or how multiple nuclei communicate and coordinate to control cell behavior. This project will use biological and mathematical tools to test whether and how nuclei within multinucleate cells of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa adopt different roles in response to changes in the fungus' environment - allowing for a flexible division of labor within the cell. In addition to revealing general rules for nuclear coordination, the project has potential to enhance fungal productivity for food production and biotechnology. The project will offer graduate and undergraduate students interdisciplinary training in mathematical modeling, cell biology, genetics and novel microscopic imaging technology. In addition, new K-12 outreach activities will be catalyzed, including training of teachers and creation of new lesson plans on real world applications of mathematics and the utility of quantitative analysis in biology. Finally, the syncytial cell research community will be stimulated by a workshop that brings together mathematicians and scientists studying multinucleate cells in diverse organisms, including fungi.\r\n\r\nMultinucleate cells allow the proportion of nuclei that contribute to any specific function to be dynamically tuned according to cellular requirements. But such division of labor is impossible if nuclei that share cytoplasm also see identical proteins and environmental cues. So, for nuclei to behave autonomously, protoplasm must be organized to control communication between adjacent nuclei. This project will use computational imaging, genetics and mathematical modeling to study how nuclei form communities within multinucleate cells and to dissect cellular processes that control these emergent communities. The focus will be on digestion of complex carbohydrates by Neurospora crassa to: 1) analyze the adaptive costs/benefits of nuclear coordination and division of labor; 2) determine the length scales of nuclear cooperation and autonomous behaviors; and 3) develop a linked mathematical model for inter-nuclear communication and coordination, focused on identifying general mechanisms that enable nuclear communities to stably emerge from interactions of relatively few macromolecules whose abundances are dominated by Poisson noise. The project will help discover new rules of life for how coordinated behaviors emerge from autonomous nuclei in filamentous fungi, and in syncytial cells generally, within cellular compartments that range from microns to meters in size.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nFungi are an essential component of the biosphere with varied roles. Fungi work to process carbon in terrestrial environments and to structure microbial communities while also posing major problems as plant, animal and human pathogens. Cell organization is central to these diverse fungal functions. Many fungi can form a mycelial network state which are syncytial meaning that many nuclei are found in a single cell. In this project we set out to determine how this form of multinucleate organization gives rise to the critical functions of fungi. The intellectual merit of this grant focused on examining the genetic and biophysical basis of how multinucleate cells form and function.\n\n\n\n\n\nNuclei in a syncytium could work together or compete for the resources of the cytoplasm. We asked if many nuclei that share the same cell compete with one another or divide up tasks and cooperate for the common good of the collective cell. To do this, we made chimeric cells with a combination of mutant and normal nuclei and found that both forms of nuclei can be maintained and propagated into spores. This suggested some form of cooperation that maintains mutants despite them being less fit. This leads to bet hedging of the cells to maintain different genotypes for a potential future advantage. However, these results depended on the exact type of mutation and in some cases we observed a winner-take-all phenotype where one of the types of nuclei dominated without apparent competition. Thus, syncytial nuclei can be both cooperative or competitive, depending on the situation.\n\n\n\n\n\nA major product of any nucleus-both in mononucleated and multinucleated cells- is transcription which is the process of expressing a gene into mRNA that encode proteins. Transcription is known to be very noisy which leads to major fluctuations and variability in the numbers of mRNAs produced at a given time and in a given nucleus. This heterogeneity can be useful or harmful, depending on the context. We hypothesized that another possible function of syncytia is to buffer this noisy process in the large common cytoplasm where nuclei can share gene products. This would mean that variations can be evened out over a larger area and lead to less heterogeneity. We developed a mathematical model to test the possibility of this idea and also measured mRNAs in syncytial fungi to support that syncytial cells are robust at suppressing variability from transcription and this may be one reason they are commonly seen in biology.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile some gene products are shared amongst nuclei we know that others are kept restricted and act locally rather than globally in the cell. This local control helps these large cells react to a spatially restricted cue or grow in a specific direction. We analyzed how the structure of the cytoplasm may vary in certain areas to promote the retention of gene products in certain areas. We developed AI-based tools to analyze the motion of particles in cells to map how heterogeneous the cytoplasm is and indeed found some areas of the cell enable rapid exchange between nuclei and others limit diffusion to create more specific territories.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe broader impacts of this work include, education, training and community outreach. This project supported training of students and postdocs who have been historically excluded from science. The work was communicated to the public through several events in NC including Darwin day and microscope tables at local farmers markets to enable shoppers to look at fungi at the cellular level. Teachers in LA were trained in how to use biology in their math lessons to provide concrete examples of math in action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/05/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: AmySGladfelter\n"
