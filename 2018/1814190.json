 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop new open-source processor architectures with advanced security features. The security features will be added to existing open-source processors to help protect the confidentiality and integrity of data and to protect against side-channel attacks. Beyond the design, the project will also provide new methodology to verify the proposed security feature, to provide assurance that the processor hardware itself is provably secure. \r\n\r\nThe first thrust of the project focuses on side-channel protections, especially of processor caches, and other functional units that can be exploited to leak secret information. It further adds security counters and new means to protect trusted software modules. The second thrust focuses on the design of the security verification approaches for hardware, including the use of satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) based solvers and temporal logics.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this will make open-source processors and their applications more secure against attacks. It will enable the academic community to further develop and extend the capabilities of the ope-source secure processor and further education in hardware security.\r\n\r\nAll artefacts developed by this project will be available online at http://caslab.csl.yale.edu/code/ or http://palms.ee.princeton.edu. The web sites will be maintained for the duration of the project and as long as the research groups involved in this project are active.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We studied hardware defenses for known and new attacks, and new approaches for improving security using deep learning.  We studied security defenses for cache side-channel attacks and the recent devastating speculative execution attacks on microprocessors.  We focused initially on the open source RISC-V processors, then broadened this to all microprocessors.\n\nSpeculative execution attacks exploit hardware performance optimization features to illegally access secret information, then leak the secrets to an unauthorized recipient.

Towards this end, we showed how deep learning can improve security across very different computer systems, from power-grid controllers, smartphones, IOT devices, to cloud computers.  We showed how a tiny hardware module can be added to detect anomalous behavior in a smartphone to detect imposter usage of the smartphone.
