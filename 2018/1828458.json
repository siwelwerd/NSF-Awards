 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fifth generation (5G) cellular and millimeter-wave (mm-wave) networks are expected to play a significant role in next generation communication and sensing systems. Indeed, mm-wave technology provides multi-Gigabit-per-second (Gbps) data rates to mobile and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, projected to grow to 200 billion by 2020. Currently, 5G/mm-wave research is very active. However, to effectively study, design, and characterize 5G/mm-wave systems, new state-of-the-art instrumentation is needed, traditionally not present in academic labs. The proposed instrumentation will provide unprecedented measurement and characterization capabilities of 5G/mm-wave antennas and devices. Therefore, it will enable Florida International University (FIU) to: (a) conduct current and future cutting-edge 5G/ mm-wave research projects, (b) develop novel 5G/mm-wave technologies for cellular networks, satellite and airborne communications,  as well as brain studies and cancer diagnoses and treatments, (c) offer new opportunities to train post-docs, graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 students to become experts in high frequency radio frequency (RF) technologies, creating much needed national workforce in this area, (d) serve as a state-of-the-art technical hub in South Florida, attracting new statewide, national and international academic and industry collaborators, (e) foster new opportunities for cross-disciplinary and multi-institutional research, and (f) support the growth of a strong and diverse U.S. workforce in RF communication. Therefore, the proposed instrumentation will have significant impact in research, education, and technology development. This acquisition will further advance FIU's educational efforts to broaden participation of women and other underrepresented groups in STEM through curriculum development, REU programs, and outreach efforts. \r\n\r\nThe proposed instrumentation from Microwave Vision Group (MVG), called -Lab, is highly specialized and incorporates important requirements for compatibility and interoperability, across 18 GHz to 110 GHz. This instrumentation consists of an anechoic chamber equipped with absorbers, precision positioning control system, RF equipment modules (network analyzers, coaxial cables, waveguides, probes, etc.) and data post-processing.  Different modules are required for different frequency bands viz. K (18-26 GHz), Ka (26-40 GHz), V (50-75GHz), and W (75-110GHz) bands. Research in the frequency range 18-110 GHz has so far been impeded by the lack of affordable testing equipment with large measurement inaccuracies. This is mostly due to the small footprint of related RF devices. As a result, research activities in related communications, biomedical, and other scientific fields have been so far limited to much lower frequency range. The procurement of such instrumentation will eschew traditional limitations often encountered with high frequency testing and characterization of future mm-wave, terahertz, and IoT components devices and systems. The broadband frequency (18-110GHz) offered by this instrumentation will enable groundbreaking and transformative research in RF communications with multi-Gbps data rates.  Such capability will revolutionize a) cellular networks, b) airborne and satellite communication systems, c) vehicle-to-vehicle communications, d) reconfigurable and deployable RF systems, e) wearable and implantable devices, f) brain and cancer studies, g) terahertz and mm-wave cameras, h) terahertz sources and on-chip terahertz antennas, and i) secure communications among others.  In summary, research in 5G and mm-wave technologies, which will be enabled by the proposed instrumentation, is expected to have great impact on information technology, telecommunications, diagnosis of diseases and biomonitoring, thereby improving quality of life and health.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
