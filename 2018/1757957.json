 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Nebraska, located in Lincoln, NE, supports the training of 10 students over 10 weeks during the summers of 2018-2021. The principle investigator is Professor Mark Griep. This site is supported by the Division of Chemistry in the Mathematical and Physical Science Directorate. It offers undergraduate participants original research projects in the area of chemical assembly. These projects, tailored to inspire student curiosity, give students the opportunity to advance knowledge in areas such as biosensors and energy storage. While engaging in chemistry research, students learn about careers in the chemicals industry, the graduate school application process, and how to disseminate research results through publications and presentations to a variety of audiences. Participants take part in the Upward Bound Math Science (UBMS) program, where participants teach and develop scientific communication skills with economically disadvantaged high school students. The UBMS program helps to inspire high school students to pursue science related degrees, propagating the impact of this REU site. In a commitment to broadening participation in STEM, this program supports women and students from underrepresented groups. By the completion of this program, students develop complex analytical and communication skills and have a deeper knowledge of science and engineering careers.  \r\n\r\nThis REU site offers a range of research projects in chemical assembly, extending from the controlled assembly of colloids on surfaces, to the synthesis of assembled nanoscale catalysts, and to the directed modification of biomolecules. These projects guide participants from undergraduate textbook learning to discovering and solving challenging research problems. Students also develop skills by communicating their research to scientists and the public, take part in field trips to explore industrial careers, learn about careers in academia, and are trained in ethics in research. Best practices gleaned from this site are shared with the wider REU community through publication of a book on chemistry REU sites in an effort to disseminate evidence-based, effective methodology more widely.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
