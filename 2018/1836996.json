 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 20th International Symposium on Aviation Psychology (ISAP) will be held May 7-10, 2019 in Dayton, Ohio. ISAP is a forum to present the latest research on human performance problems and opportunities within aviation, envision design solutions that best use human capabilities in safe and efficient aviation systems, and bring together scientists and operators to bridge the gap between research and application.  The symposium encourages researchers to focus basic research on applied needs. The knowledge generated would not be limited to aviation applications. For example, principles of perceptual representations that could guide cockpit display designs should also apply to displays for spaceships, automobiles, nuclear power plants, and other interactive control displays.\r\n\r\nThe symposium covers basic research issues on cognition, perception, and neuroscience. These topics are studied in the context of cognitive systems, human-system integration, display and visualization, training and simulation, automated and autonomous systems, personnel selection, and sociotechnical system effectiveness, as applied to aviation systems on the ground, in the sky, and in space. One common approach to reduce the often significant time lag between discovery and application is to allow practical needs to inform basic research priorities. In contrast, the philosophy of ISAP is that meaningful dialogues between researchers and practitioners are key to advancing knowledge and putting knowledge to practical use. In two companion ISAP plenary panel sessions, practitioners (e.g., pilots, air traffic controllers, maintenance personnel) present the critical safety issues that they face and researchers present the latest scientific and technological approaches to achieving solutions. These sessions are in addition to three invited plenary speakers purposely selected from different scientific disciplines and pertinent aviation domains. Over the course of the symposium, researchers will have the opportunity to present their latest scientific, engineering, or methodological work in either a spoken or a poster session. ISAP also places a special emphasis on fostering student involvement by conducting a Best Student Paper Competition.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
