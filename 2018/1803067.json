 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project seeks to explore the fundamental chemistry occurring in low temperature plasmas (LTPs) used for plasma-assisted catalytic (PAC) processes designed to remove atmospheric pollutants. Plasmas contain a broad spectrum of reactive species that can work synergistically with a catalyst to enhance the overall elimination of contaminants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The mechanisms for these cooperative actions, however, are not well understood. The proposed work will combine electronic structure calculations with multiple spectroscopic analysis tools to unravel the complexity of reactions occurring in this system. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research will combine experimental and theoretical approaches to decipher energy partitioning and inter-twined reactions to elicit predictive outcomes. These studies are designed to illuminate key factors that address critical foundational science challenges associated with LTP processes, including determining how energy is partitioned in LTPs and how reactive species are formed in these systems. On a molecular level, the project seeks to determine how substrate architecture (including micro- and nanostructure) affects plasma-surface interactions as well as the mechanisms for plasma-substrate interactions. The proposed experiments will provide robust experimental data to improve computer models of relevant LTPs that currently rely on either incomplete data or extrapolated information for plasma properties. A key element is a comprehensive approach that connects gas-phase chemistry with molecule-surface interactions to elucidate the underlying chemistry in PAC systems with enhanced performance. Spatially- and temporally-resolved absorption and emission spectroscopies along with mass spectrometry will be used to probe dynamics, energy partitioning and synergisms among chemical processes in LTPs.  Substrates and plasma processing systems selected for the proposed study are designed to improve performance of plasma-catalytic removal of atmospheric pollutants. The PI has a strong track record of mentoring groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM and is currently leading efforts to establish a cross-college, multidisciplinary School of Advanced Materials Discovery (SAMD) at Colorado State University. SAMD will house interdisciplinary degree programs and serve as an umbrella organization for materials-related education and outreach. Based on the proposed work, the PI and her trainees will further develop materials-focused kits for use in K-12 classrooms and demonstrations that emphasize materials chemistry and plasma processing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit \nThis project examined fundamental chemistry occurring in low temperature plasmas (partially ionized gases) aimed at optimizing plasma-assisted catalysis (PAC) for removal of atmospheric pollutants.  Plasmas contain many reactive species that can react in the gas phase or at the gas-surface interface, ultimately creating new materials or significantly modifying existing materials.  Although it has been well known that the use of plasmas can improve catalytic processes, the underlying chemistry and fundamental physical properties of these systems are not well known.  The major outcomes of this work focus on the kinetics and energetics of multiple plasma systems with and without a catalyst, including nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which are known atmospheric pollutants.  Utilizing time-resolved optical emission spectroscopy and broadband absorption spectroscopy, we found that addition of a catalyst within the plasma could have dramatic effects on the internal temperatures of various species and also impacted decomposition pathways in the system. The foundational science performed during this project illuminated key factors that clearly indicate differences in species densities, lifetimes, and excitation pathways affect energy partitioning within the plasma, with and without a catalyst.  This allowed for optimization of the synergies afforded by combining plasmas with catalysts to address pollutant removal.  For example, by tuning plasma properties, the decomposition of NOx species was dramatically increased.  In a similar vein, the project also sought to develop paper-based metal oxide sensors that when plasma-treated, improved their sensing properties.  Importantly, this allowed for room temperature operation of the sensors, a significant achievement over most metal-oxide based systems which require high operating temperatures.  Results from this work have been published in nine peer-reviewed articles in leading scientific journals.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThe PI has a strong track record of mentoring groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM, as evidenced by the six students who were supported on this project (4 women, 2 from underserved populations).  All six of the students completed advanced degrees (3 Ph.D, 3 MS) during the project period and are currently employed in different sectors (semiconductor manufacturing, quality assurance, and analytical services).  Key undertakings included leadership and facilitation of multidisciplinary workshops on team science to enhance awareness of how convergence research enhances innovation and discovery.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/16/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ellen R Ellen"
