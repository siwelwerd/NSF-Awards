 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Planning Grants for Engineering Research Centers competition was run as a pilot solicitation within the ERC program. Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research.\r\n\r\nThe intended planning grant for the Engineering Research Center for the Arctic 2050 (ERCA2050) will develop the workforce, processes, and technologies necessary to plan, build, and maintain resilient communities for Arctic peoples displaced by climate change. This planning effort will develop a structure for ERCA2050 by connecting research partners across the world, developing workforce development pathways with Alaska?s homegrown students as well as those outside Alaska, incorporating diverse perspectives, and exploring opportunities for innovation toward marketable engineering solutions, testbeds for these products, and aggregated and accessible data. This planning effort is aligned with NSF?s new vision for ERCs: it features a strong social impact as described above, incorporates convergence by drawing from across a wide array of disciplines, features a diverse stakeholder community advisory committee to ensure broad engagement, and incorporates specific expertise in team science organization and science communication. This project also aligns with two of NSF's Grand Challenges: Navigating the New Arctic and Growing Convergent Research. \r\n\r\nKey components and deliverables include a dedicated fellow to coordinate planning activities, two community innovation festivals, and a year-long seminar series to enhance stakeholder connections. The community festivals will explore questions around convergence, stakeholder community, team formation and effective leadership and management, and societal impact. Information from these discussions will be synthesized into different levels of maps and spatial representations, which will be overlaid to find connections, gaps, and needs. These conceptual maps will be constructed for local resource availability, landscape parameters, social livability factors, educational and innovation pathways, and global impacts, factors that will ultimately form the components of ERCA2050.  This planning project will seek to design an ERC that will engage students in research at all levels, with recruiting efforts targeting students from Alaska?s rural communities, and students from communities in similar contexts. The effort will broaden participation by Alaska Native populations by including them as key stakeholders in our process, both in planning our ERC roadmap and in their active role as participants in resilience efforts. Project personnel reflect NSF's commitment to gender and racial diversity. The creation and regular involvement of the stakeholder advisory committee will enhance partnerships between academia, communities, government, and industry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In Alaska, over 30 coastal communities are grappling with erosion, flooding, and the loss of clean water and infrastructure caused by rising temperatures. Due to the more rapid advancement of climate change in the Arctic than in the rest of the world, these communities can serve as the first line in developing a coordinated and sustainable approach to adaptation to the new paradigm of a warming climate.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Arctic Engineering Research Center (ERC) planning project formed a framework and identified the engineering focus areas for a future Arctic ERC. The Arctic ERC?s vision is to bring researchers together with communities and leaders at the forefront of climate change to improve Arctic community resilience and sustainability by engineering buildings, energy technologies, and knowledge systems that are equitable, culturally integrated, and applicable to threatened communities worldwide. The Arctic ERC?s research would focus around the integrated systems necessary to address complicated, intertwined issues that originate when warming temperatures affect buildings, energy systems, and even the soil on which communities are located. These systems will use deployable, accessible, affordable, and culturally appropriate technologies and will be tested by displaced communities in the Arctic. They will address three main engineering pillars identified during the planning project: gathering and mapping data on changing conditions, infrastructure that can adapt to changing conditions or move to a new location, and local, renewable energy for communities. The Arctic ERC team will maintain a community focus during all phases of research and development but will also look outward in an attempt to translate the technologies, procedures, and lessons learned to other displaced communities worldwide.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The NSF ERC planning grant allowed researchers from the University of Alaska to form an Arctic ERC planning team. Over the course of 18 months, the team conducted a stakeholder survey, stakeholder meeting, partner interviews, a planning workshop, quarterly videoconference meetings, and in-person small group discussions to identify and gather input from community members, engineering researchers, researchers in other disciplines, educators, government employees, and others who work with communities currently facing relocation due to climate change. They used this information to form a vision statement, focused engineering areas, and a framework for an Arctic ERC. Further, project team members recruited several organizations to the ERC team, including partner universities, Alaska nonprofits and industries, and education, workforce development, and innovation programs. While the academic partners will enhance the research completed at the ERC, the other partners will ensure the ERC can maintain its community-centered focus, and connect the ERC team to schools, industry, and workforce development programs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Arctic ERC will have wide-reaching impact beyond creating new technologies for distressed communities to implement as conditions change. It will impact the way in which researchers approach problems, teaching students and faculty to put the community first and to work with researchers from other disciplines to solve problems holistically. Ultimately, this ERC will result in a workforce trained in team science, convergent research, and adaptation that is ready to respond to the needs of communities worldwide as they face changing climatic conditions.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/15/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Erin&nbsp;Whitney</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1840660/1840660_10578831_1591670360961_solar_panels--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1840660/1840660_10578831_1591670360961_solar_panels--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Solar panels in Fairbanks, Alaska\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1840660/1840660_10578831_1591670360961_solar_panels--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Solar panels in Fairbanks, Alaska\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Renewable energy is gaining a foothold in the Arctic, as communities look for more sustainable sources of energy.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Cold Climate Housing Research Center</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Erin&nbsp;Whitney</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Solar panels in Fairbanks, Alaska</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1840660/1840660_10578831_1591670126766_Point_Lay_subsidence--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1840660/1840660_10578831_1591670126766_Point_Lay_subsidence--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Subsidence in Point Lay, Alaska\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1840660/1840660_10578831_1591670126766_Point_Lay_subsidence--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Subsidence in Point Lay, Alaska\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Warming temperatures and permafrost thaw in Point Lay, Alaska have led to subsidence of ground out from underneath several buildings, including houses.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Cold Climate Housing Research Center</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Erin&nbsp;Whitney</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Subsidence in Point Lay, Alaska</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1840660/1840660_10578831_1591670275410_Partner_workshop--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1840660/1840660_10578831_1591670275410_Partner_workshop--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"ERC planning workshop\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1840660/1840660_10578831_1591670275410_Partner_workshop--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"ERC planning workshop\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Individuals from departments and programs at the University of Alaska met with representatives from universities throughout the United States to discuss a plan for a future Arctic ERC.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Cold Climate Housing Research Center</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Erin&nbsp;Whitney</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">ERC planning workshop</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1840660/1840660_10578831_1591669996168_Newtok_coastal_erosion--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1840660/1840660_10578831_1591669996168_Newtok_coastal_erosion--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Coastal erosion\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1840660/1840660_10578831_1591669996168_Newtok_coastal_erosion--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Coastal erosion\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Rising temperatures and warming soils have caused coastal erosion in Newtok, Alaska, leaving many homes in danger of falling into the Ninglick river.
