 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site: Summer Undergraduate Research in Engineering (SURE)-Robotics, at Georgia Institute of Technology, will expose participating students to interdisciplinary robotics research, and as a direct consequence, interest them in opportunities available through graduate study.  Due to the universal appeal and the compelling real-world applications that robotics has in society, this program is designed to have direct appeal in attracting minority and female undergraduate students into research. Robotics, as a discipline, is inherently interdisciplinary, combining all aspects of engineering necessary for designing and deploying integrated systems and solutions. As students are exposed to robotics, they begin to see connections among these disciplines and begin to understand how their in-class book knowledge translates into real-world systems that can assist society in positive ways. The push of robotics, as it moves from traditional industrial settings, into public spaces and homes across the world opens up extensive new research opportunities in important economic areas such as healthcare, education, and entertainment. \r\n\r\nAnnually, Georgia Tech will host eight REU students in an immersive 10-week robotics summer research experience. The program will recruit participants locally and nationwide from institutions that provide no or limited research opportunities. Since it is expected that this theme will be highly advantageous for recruiting, retaining, and motivating students who are currently underrepresented in engineering disciplines, particular emphasis will be placed on recruitment of minority and female students. Students who are paired with both a faculty advisor and a graduate student mentor, will undertake meaningful robotics research projects, visit local industrial labs, attend weekly seminars on emerging research in the robotics field, and participate in weekly academic enrichment and skill development workshops. Students will conclude the program with research presentations to their peers, faculty, and graduate student mentors. Through this immersive research experience, robotics REU students will share in meeting the challenges of this promising new robotics domain and fully reap the rewards of being trained in this interdisciplinary field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe objective of the SURE-Robotics REU program was to provide a broad set of undergraduate research experiences in the area of robotics. The field of robotics offers the potential to transform a range of important fields including manufacturing, health care, energy extraction, human performance, planetary exploration, automated logistics, and public safety. This REU program leveraged the Georgia Institute of Technology's Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines (IRIM) and the broad set of Georgia Tech robotics researchers. Many of the REU projects utilized unique Georgia Tech facilities including human performance measurement, collaborative robotic systems, and bench level drilling systems. This version of the program started in 2018 and hosted students for in-person experiences in the summers of 2018, 2019, 2021, and 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SURE-Robotics REU program supported 32 total undergraduate participants over 4 years. All participants were paired with a faculty mentor and graduate student mentor. The faculty mentors included members from Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, and Interactive Computing. These mentors hosted the participants in their labs and provided research projects. In addition to research experiences, the SURE-Robotics program supported multiple seminars each summer. These seminars introduced graduate school information, graduate fellowships, career opportunities, and research presentations.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntellectual Merit: This project achieved intellectual merit by generating innovative robotics designs, algorithms, and experiments. Specifically, this project advanced knowledge in the areas of wearable robots, robot grasping, soft robotic actuators, control of drilling systems, human-robot coordination, learning for health-care robots, and robot motion planning.\n\n\nBroader Impacts: This project achieved broad impacts in three ways: 1) Achievement of research results with the potential for societal impact, 2) Dissemination of research results to society, 3) Training of a diverse robotics population.\n  \n\nThis project helped achieve new results in human-robot teaming and wearable robotics that have the potential to impact health care.
