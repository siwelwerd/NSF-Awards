 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Antarctic marine ecosystem is highly productive and supports a diverse range of ecologically and commercially important species.  A key species in this ecosystem is Antarctic krill, which in addition to being commercially harvested, is the principle prey of a wide range of marine organisms including penguins, seals and whales.  The aim of this study is to use penguins and other krill predators as sensitive indicators of past changes in the Antarctic marine food web resulting from climate variability and the historic harvesting of seals and whales by humans. Specifically this study will recover and analyze modern (<20 year old), historic (20-200 year old) and ancient (200-10,000 year old) penguin and other krill predator tissues to track their past diets and population movements relative to shifts in climate and the availability of Antarctic krill. Understanding how krill predators were affected by these factors in the past will allow us to better understand how these predators, the krill they depend on, and the Antarctic marine ecosystem as a whole will respond to current challenges such as global climate change and an expanding commercial fishery for Antarctic krill.  The project will further the NSF goals of training new generations of scientists and of making scientific discoveries available to the general public. This project will support the cross-institutional training of undergraduate and graduate students in advanced analytical techniques in the fields of ecology and biogeochemistry.  In addition, this project includes educational outreach aimed encouraging participation in science careers by engaging K-12 students in scientific issues related to Antarctica, penguins, marine ecology, biogeochemistry, and global climate change.\r\n\r\nThis research will help place recent ecological changes in the Southern Ocean into a larger historical context by examining decadal and millennial-scale shifts in the diets and population movements of Antarctic krill predators (penguins, seals, and squid) in concert with climate variability and commercial harvesting.  This will be achieved by coupling advanced stable and radio isotope techniques, particularly compound-specific stable isotope analysis, with unprecedented access to modern, historical, and well-preserved paleo-archives of Antarctic predator tissues dating throughout the Holocene.  This approach will allow the project to empirically test if observed shifts in Antarctic predator bulk tissue stable isotope values over the past millennia were caused by climate-driven shifts at the base of the food web in addition to, or rather than, shifts in predator diets due to a competitive release following the historic harvesting of krill eating whale and seals. In addition, this project will track the large-scale abandonment and reoccupation of penguin colonies around Antarctica in response to changes in climate and sea ice conditions over the past several millennia. These integrated field studies and laboratory analyses will provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms that influenced past shifts in the diets and population movements of charismatic krill predators such as penguins. This will allow for improved projections of the ecosystem consequences of future climate change and anthropogenic harvesting scenarios in the Antarctica that are likely to affect the availability of Antarctic krill.",

These recent changes are overlain on long-term climatic variation that influences everything from ocean temperatures and sea ice extent to wind and ocean circulation. Together, these environmental, climatic, and ecological forces have had major impacts on the ecology of krill predators in the Southern Ocean. The major research goal of this collaborative project was to help place recent ecological changes in the Southern Ocean ecosystem into a larger historical context by examining decadal and millennial-scale shifts in the diet, foraging ecology, and population dynamics of Antarctic krill predators (primarily penguins). Specifically, this study recovered and analyze modern (&lt;20 year old), historic (20-200 year old), and ancient (200-10,000 year old) biological tissues from penguins and other krill predators to track how their diet, role in the Southern Ocean food web, occupation history, and distribution have changed through time in response to past shifts in climate and the availability of Antarctic krill. To do this, we coupled advanced isotope techniques, particularly compound-specific stable isotope analysis, with unprecedented access to modern, historical (museum archive), and well-preserved paleo-archives (paleontological excavations of ancient penguin breeding colonies) of Antarctic krill predator tissues dating throughout the Holocene.&nbsp;We found that krill predator response to past environmental, climatic, and ecosystem shifts varied by species and foraging strategy. Generalist predators, with flexible diets and foraging strategies (e.g., gentoo penguins), showed adaptive shifts in diet in concert with changes in Antarctic krill availability following historic exploitation of marine mammals and recent climate change. Their populations and distributions along the Antarctic Peninsula have simultaneously increased in recent years, likely as function of this dietary flexibility. In contrast, specialist species (e.g., chinstrap and Adelie penguins) maintained a consistent krill diet despite changes in krill availability through time, which likely contributes to their current population declines in the northern Antarctic Peninsula. These krill predator tissues also served as millennial scale biological archives of past shifts in ecosystem productivity and biogeochemical cycling. For instance, we documented an abrupt shift in biogeochemical cycling concurrent with Late Holocene climatic events associated with the Little Ice Age, as well as a more recent coastal productivity increase in the past century, suggesting modern observations of increasing coastal productivity are part of a longer-term trend of increasing coastal productivity in the northern Antarctic Peninsula since the early 20th century. This project also identified large-scale changes in the occupation history of penguin colonies around Antarctica in response to changes in climate and sea ice conditions over the past several millennia. These findings emphasize the importance of long-term climate variability on ecological processes in the Southern Ocean. Together, this work provides long-term ecological context to better understand how Antarctic krill predators, the krill they depend on, and the greater Antarctic marine ecosystem have responded to past changes in environment, climate, and human-environment interaction in the Southern Ocean. Understanding these past changes will provide needed scientific support to better predict future population and ecosystem changes in light of current and emerging environmental challenges in the Southern Ocean.</p>\n<p>A second major goal of this project was to support NSF?s goal of training a new generation of scientists and making scientific discoveries available and accessible to the public. As such, this project supported the cross-institutional training of undergraduate and graduate students in advanced analytical techniques in the disciplines of ecology and biogeochemistry in the classroom, the laboratory, and in the field. This project supported the research and career development of two postdoctoral scholars, one early career faculty member, four graduate students, and eight undergraduates, eleven of which identify as coming from historically minoritized communities in geosciences. In addition, this project contributed to the K-12 education of &gt;400 second graders and &gt;100 high school students via classroom visits, curriculum development, and satellite phone calls from Antarctica aimed at engaging students in scientific issues related to polar ecosystems, penguins, biogeochemistry, global climate change, and human-environment interactions. At the university level, this project developed hands on laboratory components and active learning modules for multiple courses at the University of California ? Santa Cruz, University of Rhode Island, and University of Utah, reaching 637 undergraduates and 89 graduate students. To engage the general public, this project developed presentations that reached an estimated 600 RI residents via an annual climate series seminar and University of Rhode Island public engagement events as well as 1,050 international ecotourists via Quark Expeditions cruises to Antarctica.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/06/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kelton&nbsp;Mcmahon</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1826712/1826712_10385922_1620348506866_McMahonetal.Image(1)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1826712/1826712_10385922_1620348506866_McMahonetal.Image(1)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Gentoo penguin plunge\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1826712/1826712_10385922_1620348506866_McMahonetal.Image(1)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Gentoo penguin plunge\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A gentoo penguin leaps off a floating ice block into the Southern Ocean to search for a krill meal</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kelton McMahon</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kelton&nbsp;Mcmahon</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Gentoo penguin plunge</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1826712/1826712_10385922_1620348799921_P1030870--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1826712/1826712_10385922_1620348799921_P1030870--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Studying penguin behavior\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1826712/1826712_10385922_1620348799921_P1030870--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Studying penguin behavior\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">PI McMahon documents nesting behavior in a gentoo penguin colony</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kelton McMahon</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kelton&nbsp;Mcmahon</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Studying penguin behavior</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1826712/1826712_10385922_1620348952064_P1020047--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1826712/1826712_10385922_1620348952064_P1020047--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Gentoo penguin egg\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1826712/1826712_10385922_1620348952064_P1020047--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Gentoo penguin egg\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A gentoo penguin egg shell sits on a rock, waiting to be collected.
