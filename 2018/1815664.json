 "awd_abstract_narration": "Humanity is starting a new phase of exploration of the Universe. In the past two years gravitational waves have been directly detected, but so far, the most massive binaries in the Universe---supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs)---still hide from us, although there are traces of their influence in electromagnetic signals from the material around them. A targeted survey to find them in the electromagnetic band by the Very Large Array (VLA) and Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) will be used to refine models for their gravitational wave emission.  Using the 12-15 years of data collected with NANOGrav, the world's leading pulsar timing array, combined with the models from VLA and VLBI, a systematic search will be made to either detect SMBHB systems for the first time, or to constrain their evolutionary processes in the event of a non-detection. This work will be a template for future \"multi-messenger\" searches that combine the domains of the electromagnetic and gravity to detect and study SMBHBs. Undergraduate students will take part in this research, which will give them excellent training in STEM.  An innovative approach to STEM outreach, web-based presentations based on this research, in the form of \"science advertisements\" will be made to engage the public in the dawning era of gravitational astronomy.\r\n\r\nThis research aims to detect gravitational and electromagnetic waves from binary and/or coalesced supermassive black holes (SMBHBs).  A targeted search will be made using NANOGrav, a pulsar timing array, combined with a survey with the VLA and VLBA, radio interferometers, of nearby galaxy mergers that are prime candidates for current SMBHB hosts.  The electromagnetic search component will provide added constraints on the systems and will work to raise NANOGrav's sensitivity to any resident SMBHBs. This \"multi-messenger\" search for nano-hertz frequency gravitational wave sources will make specific and unique statements about SMBHB evolution based on orbital constraints or detections obtained by the VLA, VLBI, and NANOGrav data.   This survey will allow an in-depth study of the candidate targets using these complementary electromagnetic and gravitational wave search methods and will provide strict limits on the efficiency of binary evolution in post-merger galaxy systems.  NANOGrav's sensitivity is improving and this research may lead to a detection and if not will serve as a template for future \"multi-messenger\" searches.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Supermassive black holes have been shown to reside in most, or maybe all, galaxy centers. They can form binary systems when two galaxies merge.<br /><br />Our program utilized two distinct observational techniques: one seeking binary supermassive black holes using light, and one seeking them using gravitational waves. These are distinct cosmic \"messengers\"; light comes from electromagnetic interactions, while gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of space-time.<br /><br />To improve our ability to detect gravitational waves from binary supermassive black hole systems, we worked with the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) collaboration. NANOGrav operates a pulsar-based gravitational-wave detector that is sensitive to very-low-frequency gravitational waves (as arise from binary supermassive black holes). We carried out several studies aiming to find, or improve improve our ability to find, binary supermassive black holes using gravitational waves. In this program we:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Developed a code base that allows \"targeted\" searches for gravitational waves, which use constraints from electromagnetic light to raise our sensitivity to the gravitational waves from those binaries (Arzoumanian et al. 2020, led by C. Witt).</li>\n<li>Carried out the very first PTA-based targeted search, seeking gravitational waves from binary candidate 3C66B. This demonstrated a factor of 2--5 sensitivity improvement over an untargeted search (Arzoumanian et al. 2020, led by C. Witt).</li>\n<li>Carried out an all-sky search for gravitational waves from binary supermassive black holes using the 12.5-year NANOGrav data set (Arzoumanian et al. 2023, led by C. Witt).</li>\n<li>Developed and implemented algorithms with more accurate binary parameterization, allowing efficient searches for eccentric binary systems (B. Cheeseboro thesis 2021; Agazie et al. 2024 in press, led by L. Dey and A. Susobhanan)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br /><br />Our studies in light involved carrying out large-scale radio surveys of merging galaxies. The galaxies were identified using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which is a broad optical-light survey of a large portion of the sky.&nbsp; 28 galaxies were identified as \"post-merger systems\", meaning that they had undergone a merger and had sufficient time to form a binary system (therefore are likely hosts of such objects, presuming that the binary takes around 1 Gyr to coalesce).<br /><br />We carried out low- and high-resolution radio observations of these systems using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) telescopes. We detected 18/28 galaxies in the low-resolution observations, allowed us to measuring the rate of detection of radio light in post-merger systems and to identify whether there was any indication of luminous (accreting) black hole(s) in the galaxy's center. We identified 15 galaxies associated with compact, accreting black hole systems; most of these appeared to be associated with low-power radio jets, and one system was identified as a dual AGN system (two resident black holes in the galaxy merger, however at very large ~kiloparsec separation). This work is published as Walsh &amp; Burke-Spolaor (2024) in the Astrophysical Journal.<br /><br />The VLBA has somewhat less sensitivity (and much higher resolution) than the VLA, therefore we monitored six of the brightest objects for several hundred hours total, aiming to explore the systems for any evidence of two black holes at small (parsec-scale) separation. This data collection spanned the course of several years at milliarcsecond-scale resolution, allowing interesting studies of the movement of objects' emission over time.<br /><br />Four of the six objects resulted in a detection, however only two appear to be resolved into multiple components. One of the objects is associated with a \"changing-look active galactic nucleus\", which exhibits optical emission lines that vary on several years' timescale. One of the previously published interpretations of this source had indicated it might be a binary or recoiling black hole; both interpretations should result in a proper motion of the source. While we detected a small proper motion in the object, it was of marginal significance, and far too large to be consistent with the published binary or recoiling system model (Walsh, Burke-Spolaor &amp; Lazio 2023).<br /><br />Two studies (one presenting an additional interesting source and one presenting the final outcomes of the bulk VLBI study) will be published in 2024.<br /><br />In terms of a broader scope, this project has supported significant parts of the core doctoral thesis work of four graduate students, and seven undergraduates have contributed meaningfully to the work in this program. One of these went on to win a Goldwater Scholarship. During this program, we worked to improve science communication aspects of NANOGrav's public website, and created and circulated \"science advertisements\" available to advertise and publicize science results in any place that these advertisements are posted.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 02/23/2024<br>\nModified by: Sarah&nbsp;Spolaor</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1815664/1815664_10553488_1708717979132_Screenshot_2024_02_23_at_2.45.29__8239_PM--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1815664/1815664_10553488_1708717979132_Screenshot_2024_02_23_at_2.45.29__8239_PM--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"NANOGrav science \"advertisement\".\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1815664/1815664_10553488_1708717979132_Screenshot_2024_02_23_at_2.45.29__8239_PM--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"NANOGrav science \"advertisement\".\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This is a poster created to help engage and inform the public in our science.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">S.
