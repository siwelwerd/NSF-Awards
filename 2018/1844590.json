The Cooperative Agreement to analyze variability, change and predictability in the earth System (CATALYST)represents a sustained commitment by the Department of Energy and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) to perform foundational research toward advancing a robust understanding of modes of variability and change using models, observations and process studies. Fundamental science themes maintain continuity with the previous cooperative agreements, and include assessment of externally forced changes in the earth system over multiple time and spatial scales, advancing understanding of predictability and variability, and enhancement of fundamental process understanding.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

While changes in mean and extreme precipitation have been studied intensively, precipitation variability has received less attention, despite its theoretical and practical importance. NCAR examined single- and multi-model ensembles of climate simulations as well as station records of daily precipitation observations going back to 1950.  The important outcome is that precipitation increases and precipitation variability changes are nonlinear, with implication for understanding how precipitation extremes will change in a warmer climate. \nA key outcome related to temperature extremes involved heat extremes over Australia that can be linked to stratospheric circulation anomalies, in particular sudden warmings over Antarctica.  When there is a sudden warming in the stratosphere, the Southern Hemisphere storm tracks contract poleward and pull away from Australia, leaving hot and dry conditions that make it more likely for extreme heat and increased risk of wildfires.\n\nAnother significant outcome provided by the project is comprehensive insight into the notable differences in clouds and precipitation simulated by the CESM2 compared to the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) atmosphere model version 0 (EAMv0) and version 1 (EAMv1), particularly with regards to simulation of the Madden-Julien Oscillation (MJO) and in producing high values of equilibrium climate sensitivity in both models.
