 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years there has been a growing emphasis on accountability in higher education. In response, college and university accrediting agencies have increasingly emphasized the need for performance measurements that are based on established learning goals and robust assessment processes. Most physics departments engage in a program review every five to seven years. To support such reviews, this project will create a guide for assessment, review, and improvement of undergraduate physics programs. The guide will aid physics faculty in more effectively using: (1) documented effective practices to improve their departments and programs, aligned to their local context, mission, and resources; and (2) externally imposed requirements for programmatic review and accreditation as an opportunity to develop a strategy for improving educational practice. The guide will collect relevant literature and effective practices, and that information will be distilled by experts.   This information will be valuable for faculty who wish to design or improve program components.  It will also help departments prepare for accreditation and promote the wider use of evidence-based educational practices. Over time, the expectation is that this guide will positively affect most, if not all college and university physics department in the United States.  Thus, it has the potential to provide a model for promoting program improvements in other STEM disciplines.\r\n\r\nThe project is a collaboration of two professional societies:  the American Physical Society and the American Association of Physics Teachers.  The investigators are at Millersville University of Pennsylvania, Oregon State University, the University of Maryland at College Park, and the University of Colorado at Boulder. The project team will create a guide for program assessment, review, and improvement that is compact and that offers practical advice without assuming prior expert knowledge. The guide will recognize the following principles:  effective practices depend on the goal and local context; effective practices are based on the best available information; users' goals and problems drive the structure and content; guide content is descriptive, not proscriptive.  After the guide is developed, the project will host workshops, online learning communities, and other activities to engage and support program leaders and reviewers in using the guide.  The project will develop and implement a sustainability plan to ensure that the guide is regularly updated, and that programs continue to be supported in adopting its principles.  Finally, the project will conduct and publish research studies that explore the impact of the guide and associated support mechanisms on culture and practice in physics programs.  In this way, the project can contribute to understanding how to promote institutional changes that improve undergraduate education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

However, these programs face many challenges to their continued success. Enrollments are decreasing, and in 2020, college physics graduation rates decreased for the first time since the 1990s, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Physics remains among the least diverse of all STEM disciplines. Research-based techniques that dramatically improve student learning and retention are not consistently implemented. Additionally, many undergraduate physics programs are designed to prepare students as researchers, but less than 50% of students continue to graduate school. Cumulatively, these challenges make it harder for physics programs to attract new students, faculty, and staff, and a majority of departments report facing threats, such as budget cuts, reduction in personnel, or departmental merger or closure (Fig. </span><span>1</span><span>).&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ea4de4c2-7fff-40c2-170c-1f47fc12381a\"><span>Departments have requested resources that empower them to become thriving programs (Fig. </span><span>2</span><span>) which have the capacity, resources, and skills necessary to meet the challenges they face and contribute to national needs such as workforce development. The American Physical Society (APS) and the American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT) have sought to leverage their disciplinary influence to address these needs. In 2015, they created the Task Force for Best Practices in Undergraduate Physics Programs (BPUPP), which led to this project&rsquo;s development of the Effective Practices for Physics Programs (EP3) Initiative.</span></span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-b6213f06-7fff-e5ae-5ccd-c9a862ea9113\"><span>The EP3 Initiative has produced three major outcomes. First, we developed the EP3 Guide, an interactive and comprehensive living document (ep3guide.org; Fig. </span><span>3</span><span>). The EP3 Guide includes 30+ sections on how to manage a thriving undergraduate physics program. The task force developed a thorough process of contribution, synthesis, and peer review to create Guide content (Fig. </span><span>4</span><span>). Town halls, focus groups, and interviews were conducted regularly to collect input on the framework, structure, and content of the Guide. In January 2023, the APS Committee on Education established the EP3 Editorial Board to ensure the sustainability of the EP3 Guide. Our external evaluation noted that users find the Guide valuable especially for strategic purposes, such as supporting faculty meetings and program reviews. One chair described the Guide as \"a faster way [than Google] to get a good answer - and more pertinent!\"</span></span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Second, we developed the Departmental Action Leadership Institutes (DALIs; Fig. </span><span>5</span><span>), a high-impact, year-long leadership development program to address departmental challenges. We facilitated five DALI cohorts with 22 departments, including 5 HSIs, 1 HBCU, and 12 non-doctoral institutions. Departments selected two of their members to be &ldquo;change leaders&rdquo; who participated directly in DALI activities. Within their local departments, these change leaders created &ldquo;departmental action teams&rdquo; (DATs) to carry out their change effort. The DALI curriculum guides change leaders to better understand the situations they face, engage in the steps necessary for creating sustained change, and work with their DATs to achieve their goals (Fig. </span><span>6</span><span>). Our research found that DALI enabled participants to become better change agents and to appreciate measured and intentional approaches to change work. Departments took collaborative approaches to transformational change, e.g., being deliberate and strategic, centering data, pursuing collective decision making, and formally including and centering student voices.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Third, EP3 conducted site visits to seven HBCUs and Black-Serving Institutions (BSIs) to work collaboratively to increase their enrollment and graduation rates of physics students. The visits were conducted from 2021 through 2024 and used processes adapted from the EP3 Guide. EP3 Site Visit teams consisted of an HBCU/BSI department chair, a current or former member of the APS Committee on Minorities, and a representative from EP3 leadership. Site Visit Teams reviewed departments&rsquo; self-studies, attended a 1.5-day site review, and wrote a report summarizing their observations. The visits led to lasting change: one member of a department visited stated, \"We have made a systemic change that has taken root and become the norm in the department.\"</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Further outcomes included surveys of physics department chairs in 2020, 2022, and 2023. These surveys investigated departmental cultures of assessment, threats that departments are facing, and EP3 Guide usage, creating a baseline for longitudinal assessment of physics community needs. We presented talks and posters about the EP3 Initiative&rsquo;s work and gave workshops using Guide content about topics such as recruitment and retention, leadership skills, and ethics.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The EP3 Initiative has created a strong foundation for supporting the ~800 physics departments in the U.S. that serve more than half a million students each year who enroll in physics courses. This foundation empowers change leaders to cultivate thriving physics programs that are resilient to the challenges of the changing higher education landscape, enabling these programs to advance research, academia, and teaching; contribute to workforce development in rapidly growing fields such as quantum science; and ensure national excellence and economic competitiveness in STEM.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/24/2025<br>\nModified by: Michael&nbsp;C&nbsp;Wittmann</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1821372/1821372_10574382_1737060680567_Screenshot_2025_01_16_at_11.38.46__8239_AM--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1821372/1821372_10574382_1737060680567_Screenshot_2025_01_16_at_11.38.46__8239_AM--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 4.

In January 2023, the APS Committee on Education established the EP3 Editorial Board to ensure the sustainability of the EP3 Guide. Our external evaluation noted that users find the Guide valuable especially for strategic purposes, such as supporting faculty meetings and program reviews. One chair described the Guide as \"a faster way [than Google] to get a good answer - and more pertinent!\"\r\n\n\nSecond, we developed the Departmental Action Leadership Institutes (DALIs; Fig. 5), a high-impact, year-long leadership development program to address departmental challenges. We facilitated five DALI cohorts with 22 departments, including 5 HSIs, 1 HBCU, and 12 non-doctoral institutions. Departments selected two of their members to be change leaders who participated directly in DALI activities. Within their local departments, these change leaders created departmental action teams (DATs) to carry out their change effort. The DALI curriculum guides change leaders to better understand the situations they face, engage in the steps necessary for creating sustained change, and work with their DATs to achieve their goals (Fig. 6). Our research found that DALI enabled participants to become better change agents and to appreciate measured and intentional approaches to change work. Departments took collaborative approaches to transformational change, e.g., being deliberate and strategic, centering data, pursuing collective decision making, and formally including and centering student voices.\r\n\n\nThird, EP3 conducted site visits to seven HBCUs and Black-Serving Institutions (BSIs) to work collaboratively to increase their enrollment and graduation rates of physics students. The visits were conducted from 2021 through 2024 and used processes adapted from the EP3 Guide. EP3 Site Visit teams consisted of an HBCU/BSI department chair, a current or former member of the APS Committee on Minorities, and a representative from EP3 leadership. Site Visit Teams reviewed departments self-studies, attended a 1.5-day site review, and wrote a report summarizing their observations. The visits led to lasting change: one member of a department visited stated, \"We have made a systemic change that has taken root and become the norm in the department.\"\r\n\n\nFurther outcomes included surveys of physics department chairs in 2020, 2022, and 2023. These surveys investigated departmental cultures of assessment, threats that departments are facing, and EP3 Guide usage, creating a baseline for longitudinal assessment of physics community needs. We presented talks and posters about the EP3 Initiatives work and gave workshops using Guide content about topics such as recruitment and retention, leadership skills, and ethics.\r\n\n\nThe EP3 Initiative has created a strong foundation for supporting the ~800 physics departments in the U.S. that serve more than half a million students each year who enroll in physics courses. This foundation empowers change leaders to cultivate thriving physics programs that are resilient to the challenges of the changing higher education landscape, enabling these programs to advance research, academia, and teaching; contribute to workforce development in rapidly growing fields such as quantum science; and ensure national excellence and economic competitiveness in STEM.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/24/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MichaelCWittmann\n"
