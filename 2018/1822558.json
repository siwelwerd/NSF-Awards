Since the first conference in 1981, Crypto has been held in Santa Barbara, California, and has become the flagship conference in cryptology, attracting researchers from all over the world. The scope of the work discussed and presented at the conference ranges from the theoretical foundation of cryptology to applications and the implementation of cryptographic schemes.\r\n\r\nThe funding will provide students who otherwise would not be able to attend the conference with the opportunity to discuss current research topics with world-class researchers in cryptography, and establish networks, connections, and mentoring relationships that will serve them well during their careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
