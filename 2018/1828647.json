 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) to establish microscopy infrastructure that will enhance investigator research in biomedicine, physics, neuroscience, and molecular biology. The instrument will expand research capacity at UTSA by introducing \"closed-loop\" experimentation on live cell/tissue samples. This will allow researchers to simultaneously optically acquire and manipulate precise spatiotemporal signals in real-time. In addition to research enhancement, the asset will serve student training with a program of workshops in technical mastery and cross-discipline science communication.  Students from participating laboratories will develop proficiency in lay and specialized explanations of the technology, protocols, applications, and results obtained from their research. A compilation of student produced and narrated computer presentations and training videos will be made available to the lay public, and incorporated into student-curated Wikipedia pages as part of a public-science literacy outreach initiative.\r\n\r\nThe shared goal among the diverse users of the microscope is to acquire or \"read\" the activity of cells that are embedded in a complex network while \"writing in\" stimuli in cellular or sub-cellular compartments. The microscope's revolutionary technology allows delivery of precise three-dimensional spatio-temporal patterns of light. This unique capability will allow researchers to measure input-output transfer functions of complex cellular networks and address an expansive range of scientific questions not previously possible. The equipment design will be flexible, in order to accommodate preparations from tissues, whole animals, and plants. The microscopy unit will enhance research rigor and become a nucleus for multi-disciplinary collaboration, and will transform the research and training landscape of UTSA.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The microscope, designed by Bruker (Madison, WI), allows to image live neuronal tissue via flourescence of molecules. The molecules are stimulated with a laser that scans an area. The advantage of this laser is that its wavelength can be tuned to a range that goes from 700 nm to 1300 nm. This allows to image practially all types of available fluoresenct molecules. A second laser, much more powerful, can be used simultanously. This laser goes through a holographic attachement that allows to project, in 3D, images on top of the tissue. The images projected are designed to stimulate neuron or synapses. This laser has a fixed wavelenth of 104 nm, which is ideal to liberate molecules, produce heat, or to stimulate modern genetically encoded proteins. The use of the microscope has resulted in the training of 10 graduate and undergraduate students and one postdoctoral fellow.
