 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Craig Aspinwall and his research group at the University of Arizona (UA) are developing new and selective sensors to probe complex systems.  The measurement tools being developed offer unprecedented time resolution and selectivity for analysis of a diverse set of target molecules, potentially enabling improved understanding of biological and other complex functions.  The work provides opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students from UA (a Hispanic Serving Institution) and the Arizona community college system to participate in modern, interdisciplinary chemical research, thereby helping to build a diverse science, technology, engineering and mathematics work force.\r\n\r\nThe Aspinwall group is developing novel core-shell nanomaterial sensors capable of real-time detection of low-energy radioisotopes.  Radioisotopes have been a cornerstone of biological research for nearly a century because of the ubiquitous nature of the most common radioisotopes of C, H, S, and P in chemical and biological systems, and because their incorporation is less invasive compared to fluorophores.  Common methods of detection for radioisotopes are typically incompatible with living/functional biological systems/components and as such provide little information about system dynamics.  The novel nanomaterial sensor (termed \"nanoSPA\") being developed by Dr. Aspinwall provides a water-soluble, biocompatible platform to enable real-time analysis of radioisotope-labeled compounds with high selectivity and sensitivity.  The project focuses on development and characterization of nanoSPA sensors with emphasis on key variables that affect sensor function and performance.  The work targets optimization of light output and multiplexing capabilities via integration of new scintillant materials; identification of novel biofunctionalization approaches; and performance evaluation in model biochemical systems. The project provides educational and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students at UA and Yavapai College to broaden exposure to interdisciplinary chemical research and enhance the nation's science workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The nanomaterial scintillators developed herein were shown to have a broad impact on the research work of collaborators and further served as the foundation for an additional NSF I-Corps grant to explore further commercial potential.  The Intellectual Merit is demonstrated by the discovery and validation of new nanomaterials scintillators and the corresponding application to answer new chemical and biological questions through the development of this important enabling technology.  The Broader Impacts are best demonstrated via the student and participant training, as well as the adoption by scientists in multiple different fields and the commercialization of nanomaterial scintillators demonstrated early in this project.\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/03/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Craig A Aspinwall"
