 "awd_abstract_narration": "As estimated by the World Health Organization, over 5% of the world's population (360 million individuals: 32 million children) experience disabling hearing loss. Unattended hearing loss results in feelings of isolation, loneliness, and extreme frustration. This is especially prevalent in older individuals. Not only does hearing loss severely impair communication, it often leads to delays in spoken language abilities in children. A host of strategies, with varying degrees of success, can be used to reduce the detrimental effects of hearing disability: these range from screening, protection, captioning, sign language, to assistive devices such as hearing aids and cochlear implants (CI). CI devices function by coding sound waves as electrical pulses. In turn, these pulses determine the amount of electrical charge applied to neurons in the inner ear (cochlea) thereby conveying a lost or diminished sensation of sound. Approximately 324,000 CI have been implanted worldwide enabling some individuals to perceive speech very well. However, outcomes are highly variable and unpredictable. Everyday situations, such as understanding speech in noisy settings, and appreciating music, present users with significant challenges. A major contributor is the inability of CIs to precisely control the path of electrical charge in the highly conductive intracochlear fluid. This work pursues a promising and novel alternative to direct electrical stimulation - micro-magnetic stimulation via electrically pulsed coils housed on a flexible substrate and implanted in the cochlea. An intracochlear micro-coil array can activate auditory neurons with greater specificity while also enabling longer-term safety since the micro-coils are fully encapsulated. The applicability of micro-magnetic coils can naturally be extended to overcome loss in balance, sight, as well as to improve deep brain stimulation. To further enhance the societal impact of the research, partnerships with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Fernbank Science Center will enable and promote hearing health awareness and education in Atlanta, GA.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work is a necessary first-step toward advancing an understanding of how locally induced fields may serve to excite neurons. In contrast with transcranial magnetic stimulation requiring a bulky coil and consuming considerable power, micro-coils implanted proximal to target neural tissue may engage the nervous system more effectively. To pursue this research, direct metal inkjet printing methods to build micro-coils on polymeric substrates will be developed. The devices will be fully encapsulated with a medical grade polymer and tested in solution to examine for impedance shifts and leakage current. Ex-vivo testing will also be accomplished with organotypic spiral ganglion neurons cultured on a 2D multichannel electrode array (MEA). The 2D-MEA and associated software system will enable the unprecedented possibility of non-invasive, closed-loop micro-magnetic stimulation and neural response recording. From this, neural threshold and specificity will be assessed and compared with conventional CI electrode-based stimulation. In a parallel and highly collaborative fashion, array insertion studies in human cadaver cochleae to assess insertion trauma, depth of insertion, and scalar wall distances will be pursued. More broadly, the application of novel printing and additive manufacturing, combined with flexible electronics, has the potential to transform fabrication of neural interface technologies to processes outside of the cleanroom, while enabling seamless integration with supporting drive electronics and packaging.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

For these individuals the mechanism that changes sound waves into electrical signals (hair cells) do not function correctly or have been lost. Importantly, as aging occurs this type of hearing loss increases. Fortunately, there is a solution, a cochlear implant. This is an implantable device that provides electrical signals to the inner ear which can be interpreted by the brain as sounds. While there are over 1-million cochlear implant users worldwide, there are limitations on how well implants can deliver sound information. One limitation is how well electrical signals can be applied to the human hearing apparatus in the inner ear (the cochlea). The cochlea functions similarly to a piano where keys of piano are tuned to specific frequencies. The limitation is like playing a piano with a baseball glove on where on would hit multiple keys simultaneously. The research presented here strives to improve the frequency resolution of cochlear implants by advancing the conventional electrode arrays by inducing electrical fields in the cochlea via pulsed microcoils which can focus stimulation more precisely.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit: </strong>This research demonstrates that planar microcoils designed for implantation in the cochlea can elicit focused neural activity, via magnetically induced electric fields. The innovation pursued relies upon a new device to enable selective activation of auditory neurons. The manufacturing approach is novel in that recent advances in additive manufacturing and flexible electronics are applied to rapidly write (print) conductive traces on a polymeric substrate. Since the microcoils are fully encapsulated and therefore not in direct contact with tissue, device performance is improved over traditional electrical stimulation which suffers due to current spread or intracochlear tissue response.</p>\n<p>We have developed a method to fully-encapsulate the device in a biocompatible polymer to realize proof-of-concept microcoils for bench and in-vitro testing. Over the course of this project, we developed and refined a method to aerosol jet print (AJP) coils. As a prototype, a 4-turn, 600 &micro;m diameter silver planar microcoils are printed on two substrates: 1) a flat-planar, glass slide, and 2) a curved surface made by pulling a glass pipette to the diameter of a typical cochlear electrode array (0.5mm). We&nbsp;measured an upper current limit of 100 mA, an average inductance of 3.7nH and 4.6nH (planar vs. non-planar). A total of 60 devices were tested at&nbsp;5KHz with a 50% duty cycle to model pulsatile stimulation. The importance of these results is two-fold. First, a reasonable current may be driven through narrow traces. Second, the impedance results did not change appreciably between the planar and non-planar coils.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts: </strong>The proposed research is uniquely positioned to enable customizable coils and arrays to 1) further investigate the effect of induced electrical stimulation on excitable tissue, and 2) greatly expand the ability to precisely control excitation and propagation. This work demonstrates the potential for exciting neural tissue to initiate an action potential.&nbsp;Considering other applications, microcoils can be envisioned for closed-loop brain responsive neurostimulation to reduce drug-resistant epilepsy. Other chronic applications may include cardiac pacing and vagus nerve stimulation, which currently rely on electrode-based devices, and both require focused stimulation. The PI and her research team have used this project as a substrate to demonstrate the societal impact of STEM fields with high school and middle school students through discussions and presentations. Importantly, graduate students involved with the project delivered presentations at cochlear implant meetings, biomedical engineering meetings as well as fabrication-focused meetings. In addition, students were encouraged to engage in technology translation and entrepreneurship training locally. With respect faculty-driven technology translation, the PI is a champion for innovation and entrepreneurship and mentors engineering colleagues, as well as colleagues engaged in clinical and translational science.&nbsp;Lastly, the PI was selected as part of a university teaching program to pilot a hearing-inspired undergraduate research exposure integrated in a core&nbsp;circuits&nbsp;lab. In addition, at the high school level, the PI meets with juniors and seniors fall and spring to discuss STEM careers and biomedical research.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 07/04/2024<br>\nModified by: Pamela&nbsp;Bhatti</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1809334/1809334_10564419_1720106375798_Slides_outcomes_2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1809334/1809334_10564419_1720106375798_Slides_outcomes_2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Micromagnetic stimulation overview\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1809334/1809334_10564419_1720106375798_Slides_outcomes_2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Micromagnetic stimulation overview\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Micromagnetic stimulation can overcome existing limitations in implant electrodes and can be fabricated using an additive manufacturing technology.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Shambavi Ganesh</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Pamela&nbsp;Bhatti\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Micromagnetic stimulation overview</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1809334/1809334_10564419_1720106610290_Slides_outcomes_4--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1809334/1809334_10564419_1720106610290_Slides_outcomes_4--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Testing results\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1809334/1809334_10564419_1720106610290_Slides_outcomes_4--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Testing results\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The results indicate failure occurs at about 100 millamps of current and inductance values that allow for stimulation.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Shambavi Ganesh</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Pamela&nbsp;Bhatti\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Testing results</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1809334/1809334_10564419_1720106523578_Slides_outcomes_3--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1809334/1809334_10564419_1720106523578_Slides_outcomes_3--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Aerosol Jet Printing and Fabrication Steps\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1809334/1809334_10564419_1720106523578_Slides_outcomes_3--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Aerosol Jet Printing and Fabrication Steps\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fabrication steps for making a microcoil.
