 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Andrew J. Wommack from High Point University to examine the functional and structural consequences of sulfur-sulfur or disulfide bonds in proteins.  The disulfide bond serves important roles in biology ranging from structural effects in proteins to cell signaling and control of metabolic pathways.  This sulfur-sulfur chemical bond can be found in opened or closed states under different biological conditions, such as during different physiological stresses or within unique cellular locations. To study the functional impact of the disulfide bond in a permanently closed state, one sulfur atom is replaced by a carbon atom to generate an alternative bond that is locked in place under all biologically relevant conditions. In addition to inventing new chemical methods for exploring how disulfide bond status affects biological processes, this project directly impacts the training of undergraduate research students and also facilitates development of new engaging materials for the undergraduate science curriculum.\r\n\r\nReactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) are present in cells at various concentrations, depending on cell type, subcellular location, and physiological state.  As an evolved response to the levels of ROS/RNS in oxidative metabolism, glutathione (GSH) is installed as a protected, but redox-reversible, covalent change to solvent-accessible cysteine thiols.  By replacing the internal cysteine of GSH with an alkene-containing side chain, this modified GSH is irreversibly attached to solvent-accessible cysteines with optimized methods for thiol-ene coupling (TEC) in aqueous media. Initial targets include peroxiredoxins 1 & 2 (Prx1 & Prx2) and sulfiredoxin 1 (Srx1), where glutathionylation is critically involved in ROS/RNS equilibria and signaling. Mutagenesis of existing cysteine residues, followed by TEC reaction with the alkene-containing GSH, is assessed with LC-MS analysis, gel-filtration chromatography, spectrophotometry, analytical ultracentrifugation, and x-ray crystallography to explore how glutathionylation affects protein function and structure.   With the developed TEC methodology, this project further contributes to the fundamental understanding of glutathionylation as a response to ROS/RNS.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Outcomes from this project include the optimization of a thiol-ene coupling (TEC) reaction to act as a bioisostere for native disulfide bonds and facilitating the training of 12 students for careers as professional scientists. \n\nWith this TEC process, we have implemented a redox-inert surrogate for the disulfide-bound state of peptides and proteins.  These biomolecules use these disulfide bridges to modulate structure and alter function.  The dynamic redox environment within cells requires transient alteration of the sulfur atom found in the amino acid cysteine.  The unique reactivity found in sulfur needs protection from overoxidation during essential signaling events and stresses.  A common biological strategy for this transitory oxidative protection comes from the tripeptide glutathione (GSH), whereby this small molecule covalently joins to a cysteine thiol in the protein or peptide in a reversible manner.  Elegantly coordinated enzymatic machinery within cells work to use GSH for this balance of redox status.\n\nThe TEC methodology from this project allows the targeted installation of a thioether (a carbon-to-sulfur bond) to study the GSH-protected state of these thiol-containing biomolecules. We have prepared a synthetic derivative of GSH that can irreversibly connect with the protein/peptide thiol to mimic this protective strategy.  While more research is needed to explore the numerous molecules known to undergo GSH protection, this project has established the feasibility of the TEC reaction on peptides/proteins.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/14/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew J Wommack"
