 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wastewater treatment is needed for environmental protection, but most treatment processes are very energy intensive.  A recently developed biological treatment process, called partial nitritation-anammox (PNA), can save energy.  However, it is difficult to use in most treatment processes because it requires the suppression of some bacteria commonly found in wastewater.   This research explores a new type of reactor configuration, along with the addition of the chemical hydroylamine, that may allow PNA to be effectively used for wastewater treatment.  The research involves a collaboration with SUEZ, an industrial partner.  It will train undergraduate and graduate students, as well as a post-doctoral researcher, and will include outreach to a community college with a new program in vertical farms.\r\n\r\nA collaborative study between the University of Notre Dame and SUEZ, a leader in membrane technologies, is proposed for a novel biofilm-based treatment technology that allows control of the internal physical and chemical environment in the biofilm. This method enables partial nitritation in existing wastewater treatment plants, a critical bottleneck in the energy-efficient PNA process. Furthermore, this biofilm environment control could enable other critical functions not currently possible in wastewater treatment, potentially serving as a disruptive technology.  A key part of the new treatment process is the supply of chemicals to biofilms.  In particular, this project will investigate how the supply of hydroxylamine, an intermediate of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) that can stimulate AOB growth and suppress nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) will alter the effectiveness of the PNA process. Researchers will first characterize the effects of hydroxylamine on the growth kinetics of AOB and NOB. Then the effects of hydroxylamine spikes on the structure and function of nitrifying biofilms will be explored using micro sensors, molecular tools, and imaging.  An advanced biofilm model will be used to predict the best strategies for PNA. Finally, pilot-scale studies will be carried out to determine the process effectiveness in the field and to gather data and recommendations for scale-up and potential commercialization. This is the first research to study the effects of hydroxylamine on the microbial community structure of nitrifying biofilms. By determining the kinetics of AOB and NOB during and following exposure to hydroxylamine, this work will provide insights into fundamental inhibition mechanisms. This information will also provide a foundation for predicting the behavior of biofilms intermittently exposed to hydroxylamine.  By studying mixed-culture biofilms with microsensors and molecular tools, the research could reveal potential niches for novel bacteria. The modeling and biofilm experiments will help engineer more effective water treatment processes. Workshops, lectures, and seminars at the University of Notre Dame and SUEZ will disseminate knowledge on biofilm research and process development to undergraduate, graduate, and Ivy Tech Community College students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis research explored a new type of biofilm reactor that allows performance-enhancing chemicals to be supplied directly to the interior of a biofilm. Biofilms are aggregates of bacteria enclosed in a self-produced, gel-like matrix, and many water and wastewater treatment processes are based on biofilms.  In some engineered processes, special bacteria must be \"selected for\" or enriched to obtain the desired biodegradation reactions. In others, detrimental microbial species must be suppressed. Selection and suppression can be achieved by adding chemicals that encourage or inhibit the target species.  However, large amounts of chemicals would be needed, due to dilution. Also, adding chemicals to the bulk liquid could negatively impact the effluent quality. It would be better to supply small amounts of chemicals directly to the biofilm interior, if this were possible. Smaller amounts would be needed, and they would have a smaller or possibly no effect on the effluent quality.\n\nWe proposed and studied a novel biofilm reactor based on filtration membranes.  By growing the biofilm on the membrane surface, chemicals can be supplied through the membrane directly to the base of the biofilm.  We call this the membrane filtration membrane-aerated biofilm reactor, or MF-MABR.  A proposed application is using the MF-MABR to deliver hydroxylamine (NH2OH) to nitrifying biofilms.  This could enrich ammonia-oxidizing bacterial (AOB) and suppress nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB). This would help promote nitritation, i.e., the conversion of ammonium to nitrite, which can provide more energy-efficient wastewater treatment. \n\nWe used modeling to assess the potential efficiency of supplying NH2OH to achieve nitritation.  We compared (1) NH2OH addition from the bulk liquid for a conventional biofilm, i.e., a biofilm where ammonium, O2, and NH2OH are all supplied from the bulk liquid; (2) NH2OH addition from the base of the biofilm for a conventional biofilm, i.e., a biofilm where ammonium and O2 are supplied from the bulk liquid, and NH2OH from the base.  This would be the case where a membrane is used to supply NH2OH to the base of an otherwise conventional biofilm; (3) NH2OH and ammonium supply from the bulk liquid, and O2 supply from the base of the biofilm.  This would be the case for a MABR biofilm with NH2OH supplied from the bulk, and (4) NH2OH and O2 supply from the base of the biofilm, and ammonium supply from the bulk.  This would be the case for the proposed MF-MABR biofilm. \n\nModel simulations for the above four scenarios suggested that, for in conventional biofilms, with either NH2OH addition from the bulk or the base of the biofilm, NH2OH would have a strong selective pressure for AOB over NOB and provide nitritation.  However, in MABR biofilms, NH2OH supply from the bulk would not effective.  This is because NOB in MABRs typically proliferate in the deeper biofilm, and NH2OH supplied from the bulk is consumed by AOB in the outer biofilm.  However, NH2OH supply from the base of the biofilm would be highly effective for MABRs, as it allows AOB to outcompete NOB at the base of the biofilm. \n\nWe also studied the concept in lab-scale reactors.  Since initial tests supplying NH2OH were inconclusive, we tested the MF-MABR concept with two other applications: (1) adding chlorate to a denitrifying biofilm to select for specialized perchlorate-reducing denitrifiers, and (2) adding cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protozoa, to a nitrifying biofilm to minimize predation.  The results showed that chlorate addition from a membrane to the base of a denitrifying biofilm caused a significant enrichment of putative perchlorate reducing bacteria.  In the other experiment, supply of cycloheximide resulted in increased biofilm thickness and higher nitrification rates.  Subsequent preliminary tests with NH2OH were carried out towards the end of the project. This time the results were more promising, showing enhancement of nitritation and enrichment of AOB.\n\nIn summary, the results show the MF-MABR process can be an effective means to manipulate the biofilm microbial community without adding chemicals to the bulk.  Further research is needed for the NH2OH application, for example to better quantify the stimulatory effects of NH2OH on AOB, and its inhibitory effects on NOB.  Also, a better understanding of the mode of mass transfer into the biofilm (advection vs. diffusion) and the need for continuous or intermittent supply is needed. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/27/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert Nerenberg"
