There will also be short talks by students\r\nand younger faculty members. There will be ample unscheduled time\r\nduring the weekend, allowing new research collaborations to\r\ncommence and active collaborations to be continued. Junior\r\nparticipants will establish valuable connections with more senior\r\ncolleagues, and receive guidance from them in a relaxed and informal\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\nThe tutorial speakers for the 2018 workshop will talk about \"Connections\r\nbetween Coxeter systems, permutation patterns and reduced words\", and \"Edit distance in graphs\". The website for the conference is https://www3.nd.edu/~conf/lmwcgt18/.",
