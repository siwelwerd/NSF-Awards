 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will generate new fundamental geographic understanding of the spatial extent of sociocultural influences on populations and the degree to which specific groups or individuals assume leadership in public participation.  The project will address the complex factors that influence the public participation of different segments of a population by considering the degree to which family, education, religion, social, and other networks influence activity in public participation.  Divergent sociocultural influences will be correlated with the development of beliefs and behaviors that lead to differential leadership in public participation.  This research will provide insights regarding the diversity among groups related to their public participation rather than analyzing all people as a single category.  Results from this project will have policy implications and inform national security interests regarding emerging participation patterns and the motivation for groups that are engaged in public participation.  This multilayered examination of competing influences and changing social roles will advance existing analytic frameworks for evaluating and adopting the most effective means of ensuring security and stability in communities.  A post-doctoral fellow and a graduate student will be trained as part of the project, thereby enhancing U.S. scientific resource capacity.\r\n\r\nThe research design for this project will examine the differential use of public space across a spectrum of perspectives and social positions.  Specifically, this project will focus on the complex dynamics through which women have evolved as leaders in their families and communities.  The project will seek answers to two major research questions: (1) What are the social, economic, and other influences or drivers that compel women to participate in different types of organizations? (2) How do female leaders influence public participation and ensure security within their families and communities?  The investigators will use multi-sited qualitative analysis of participation in organizations across different regional locations, ethnicities, socioeconomic class levels, educational experiences, and scales of influence.  Data-collection methods will include interviews, focus groups, and content analysis of data from printed sources and documents.  This project will focus on Afghanistan, a nation that has been of considerable interest to the United States from a national security perspective, and it will provide insights and approaches for considering public participation across different groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Familia influence is mitigated by several other influences that are geographically specific. A women?s ability to participate in educational opportunities, largely funded by international assistance, relied on the accessibility of schools in a particular location and permission from a woman?s family to access a school if available. Family permissions were influenced by several factors including safety/security, type of curriculum, belief in educating girls/women, and thoughts or pressure from family and community leaders/elders. Women?s leadership and authority also varied by scale. Women in leadership positions at the national scale were ensured through a quota system. However, women?s influence within government and the reach of their authority beyond the capital city was limited. The authority and influence of Afghan women-led and focused nongovernmental and civil society organizations (NGOs/CSOs) were largely vested in the existing networks associated with the leadership of these organizations.

The inability of international funding agencies to attend to this extensive diversity represents a foundational flaw in the scope, scale, and reach of their projects and programs.

The development of a woman?s honor and virtue includes being an obedient wife/daughter-in-law, a mother, and is further mitigated by the standing and status of her family within a given community. Women?s leadership can also be vested in her care work within the community as a respectable teacher, nurse, doctor, or midwife. Thus, women?s value remains contingent upon the gender-based roles ascribed to her and vis-?-vis her relationships with and how she is viewed by senior members of her family and community.
