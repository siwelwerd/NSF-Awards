 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research on non-human species suggests that female reproduction may come at a cost to maintaining and repairing the body, affecting both health and lifespan. Studies using historical records suggest a similar 'cost of reproduction' in human females, but are often confounded by unmeasured social and environmental factors that obscure causal relationships between reproduction and lifespan. This doctoral dissertation project will use a new measure of 'epigenetic age' to better understand these life history trade-offs in humans. By examining both reproduction and epigenetic age at several time points in a woman's life, social and environmental effects on aging can be accounted for, yielding a clearer picture of the costs of reproduction. Uncovering the molecular pathways responsible for costs of reproduction in women could inform new strategies for diagnosing and treating age-related diseases. This project will also support graduate student training and long-term research collaborations.\r\n\r\nThe investigators will analyze data for 195 women who are part of the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey to test whether those who have had more pregnancies show signs of more rapid biological aging during a 13-year period. The number of children, their sex, size, and birth spacing - as well as energy allocated to breastfeeding - will be calculated over the women's peak reproductive lives, and compared to the pace change in each woman's epigenetic age. Epigenetic age is calculated by counting chemical modifications made to DNA, and is a strong predictor of negative health outcomes and mortality across multiple populations. The researchers will also examine the relationship between reproduction and epigenetic age among 155 older women, for whom they will combine these data with a separate, comprehensive survey of age-related decline. This will be the first study to examine the effect of reproduction on epigenetic age in females, and will provide an important foundation for future studies aimed at clarifying the links between reproduction and late life outcomes in humans.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Less energy devoted to maintenance and repair could speed up the aging process. In humans and other mammals, we believe this effect will be greatest among females, because they invest energy during pregnancy and lactation. In line with this prediction, women who bear many children tend to have shorter lives and poorer health in later years. However, it is difficult to determine if reproduction actually speeds up biological aging in women because reproductive decisions are influenced by social and environmental factors that can have separate effects on health and aging. These include things like their genes, their socioeconomic status, if they live in a city or in the country, and whether or not they smoke. Women are exposed to more of these social and environmental the longer they age, making it harder to distinguish between the effect of these social and environmental factors and the effect of reproduction itself when focusing only on women at older ages. What is needed are: (a) studies of the effect of reproduction on aging that can take account for some of the genetic, social, and environmental variation, (b) studies of young women, earlier in life before chronic disease and mortality are clinically established, and (c) studies that follow women over time to see how changes in their reproductive behaviors affect changes in their pace of aging.</p>\n<p>Until recently, such a study has been difficult to design due to poor measures of biological aging for young people that can provide an early indication of health and mortality, before they are clinically detectable. Furthermore, many studies to examine the effect of reproduction have done so in populations where fertility is markedly lower than that of our recent and distant evolutionary past. In this project, we used tools called &lsquo;epigenetic clocks&rsquo; to quantify biological aging in young women in the Philippines, and to study how changes in reproductive effort track changes in biological age. Epigenetic clocks are tools derived from DNA methylation, chemical marks on the DNA that change as we age, and that are associated with lifespan and disease. Epigenetic clocks are developed using a statistical method called machine learning, and allow researchers to predict biological aging using a drop of blood. Our long-term study in the Philippines, called the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey, provides us with a large sample (825 women) where fertility is typically high and rich information on the social and physical environment, as well as other factors like underlying genetics, are available. We also used DNA methylation to study changes in the immune system that might partly explain biological aging in response to reproduction.</p>\n<p>We found that women who had been pregnant by early adulthood (20-22y) were biologically older than women who had never been pregnant using all six epigenetic clocks. Furthermore, women who had had more pregnancies were biologically older for all six epigenetic clocks than women who had had fewer pregnancies by early adulthood. When following the same women between early adulthood (20-22y) and middle-adulthood (25-31y), we found that women who had been pregnant more often aged faster using two different epigenetic clocks. These effects were unaffected by including a range of social and environmental factors, genetic factors, smoking, or measures of immune function that may be linked to reproductive history.</p>\n<p>This is the first large-scale study to examine the relationship between aging in a high-fertility context using a battery of epigenetic clocks, and the first to our knowledge to do so longitudinally. Our findings suggest that pregnancy can speed up the aging process in young women, above and beyond the other genetic, social, and environmental factors that often accompany high fertility. We also show that this effect is not strictly tied to changes in the immune system, as some researchers have proposed. These findings help us understand the aging process more broadly, and may help identify women who are at particularly high-risk of aging faster, including the risks for certain diseases.</p>\n<p>The data generated from this study were used as part of Co-PIs PhD training and were also used in the training of a summer undergraduate research assistant, resulting in a publication aimed at understanding how accelerated epigenetic aging relates to birth outcomes among pregnant women (Ryan, C. P. et al. Clin Epigenet 14, 78 (2022)). Additional findings have been reported at both regional and international conferences and are in preparation for publication in a top-tier scientific journal aimed at a broad scientific audience. Beyond the proposed study goals, these data will provide a foundation for future studies of longitudinal change in DNAm and epigenetic clocks, which is currently lacking in the study of epigenetic aging.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/19/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Calen&nbsp;P&nbsp;Ryan</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1751912/1751912_10532579_1666200470765_Gravidity_By_Epigenetic_Age--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1751912/1751912_10532579_1666200470765_Gravidity_By_Epigenetic_Age--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1 from Ryan, C.P. et al.
