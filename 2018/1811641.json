 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2018, Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. This research examines how temperature change affects bacteria that live within the gut of a desert ant. Many animal guts contain bacteria that aid in digestion, but the bacteria within Cephalotes rohweri (the Arizona turtle ant) are unusual in two important ways 1) the bacteria help the ant acquire Nitrogen, a key nutrient in growth and development, and 2) the bacteria survive extremely hot temperatures. The fellow will perform several experiments to determine if this bacterial community provides benefits to its ant host despite extreme heat exposure. The research improves scientific understanding of how animals can cope with a changing environment through shifts in their bacterial partners. The research broadly informs current industrial and commercial efforts to manipulate bacteria associated with animals and plants to improve food production. As a part of this research the fellow will develop a set of software tools to enable visually impaired scientists to interact with data through the sense of touch. \r\n\r\nThe fellow will 1) observe variation in gut bacterial composition between turtle ant colonies along a natural temperature gradient using 16s sequencing, 2) perform a growth chamber experiment; manipulating nest temperature and measuring response variables of gut bacterial composition and nitrogen acquisition from heavy isotope labeled urea, and 3) transplant gut bacteria into temperature naive ants; isolating the effect of microbe-based phenotypic plasticity in response to temperature.  This research will test the hypothesis that shifts in bacterial symbionts facilitate acclimation to novel temperature conditions in this desert ant species. This particular mechanism of phenotypic plasticity is poorly understood, but given the ubiquity of bacterial symbioses across plants and animals, shifts in symbiont composition may be important in determining the outcome of environmental change in a wide array of species. The project broadens participation of people with vision impairments by extending the functionality of a common scientific data analysis platform, R, to interface with 3-D printers, braille printers, and several commercially developed assistive technologies. The fellow will benefit from training in genetic data analysis and software development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
