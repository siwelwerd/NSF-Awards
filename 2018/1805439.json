 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project concerns the use of geometric ideas to study problems in algebra.  Algebra and geometry are generally regarded as separate areas of mathematics.  Nevertheless, it can be very fruitful to use them in combination, as observed by Descartes through the use of graphs.  In geometry, one can often study global properties of spaces by examining the local behavior of the spaces.  Using the connection between algebra and geometry, it is sometimes possible to study problems in algebra as well, by reducing global questions to ones that are viewed as more local.  The goals of the project involve generalizing this approach to new situations, including higher dimensional spaces, in order to solve open problems that arise in several areas of algebra.\r\n\r\nThe first goal is to generalize to higher dimensions the method of field patching that has so far been developed only in the context of varieties of dimension one, over a complete discretely valued field.  The second goal is to use this generalization to obtain local-global principles for algebraic structures over higher dimensional function fields.  Such structures include central simple algebras, torsors under linear algebraic groups, and quadratic forms.  These local-global principles in turn are expected to lead to results on numerical field invariants such as the period-index bound and the u-invariant.  The activities of the proposal will also have broader impacts in terms of mentoring, enhancing the research infrastructure, and communicating mathematics outside of academia.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe research funded in this grant concerns the study of algebraic \nstructures by means of geometric methods.  By using a geometric \napproach, the research aimed to go further than would be possible by \nworking just algebraically.  The algebraic structures we considered \narise in the context of a field of functions on a curve or a higher \ndimensional space.  A key strategy was to obtain a global understanding \nof these algebraic objects by examining the spaces locally, through what \nare known as local-global principles.\n\nIn this grant, we focused especially on objects known as torsors, which \ncorrespond to a wide variety of algebraic structures such as quadratic \nforms and central simple algebras.  By drawing on a number of methods, \nwe examined whether local-global principles hold for torsors that are \ndefined over semi-global fields, which include function fields of curves \nover local fields.  In the case of torsors under tori, and more \ngenerally under reductive groups, we obtained explicit computations of \nthe obstruction to a local-global principle holding.  In particular, we \nwere able to show in many cases that this principle holds, while in \nother cases we measured the extent to which the \nprinciple does not hold.\n\nAnother research direction in this grant concerned differential \nequations, which play important roles in physics and engineering.  To a \nlinear differential equation one can associate an object known as its \ndifferential Galois group, and the structure of this group determines \nwhether the equation can be solved explicitly.  It was conjectured that \nthe absolute differential Galois group is free over the complex numbers. \n  Using our patching methods, we proved that this is the case, and more \ngenerally did so over any algebraically closed field of infinite \ntranscendence degree over the rational numbers.\n\nThe research on this grant also included work on extending our patching \nmethods to higher dimensional spaces, in order to be able to obtain \nlocal-global principles and information on the behavior of algebraic \nstructures in those contexts.  We achieved this in the affine case, with \nprogress toward doing the same in the projective case.\n\nBeyond the research results obtained, this grant helped train and \nprovide professional development for students and postdocs.  This \nincluded supervision and guidance of both graduate students and \nundergraduates on research projects, as well as research done in \nconjunction with postdoctoral fellows whom we were training.  In \naddition, the PI organized a workshop for female undergrads who were \ninterested in pursuing graduate studies in mathematics, and another such \nworkshop for undergraduates from various underrepresented groups.  We \nalso participated in our department's Bridge program for students\nwho are from underrepresented groups; on panels aimed at preparing \nundergraduates to apply to Ph.D. programs; and in discussion sessions on \nequitable teaching practices.  In addition, the investigators gave \nin-person and remote talks about the research conducted on this grant in \norder to disseminate the results; had meetings with research \ncollaborators; and posted and submitted research manuscripts on the \nresults of this grant, which have since been accepted for publication.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/27/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Julia Hartmann"
