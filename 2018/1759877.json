The conference website is http://dd25.math.mun.ca/index.html . The conference will be comprised of mini-symposia and contributed talks, along with thirteen invited talks.\r\n\r\nDomain decomposition methods are fundamental to large scale high performance computing in the sciences and engineering. The International Domain Decomposition Conference, which has been held approximately every eighteen months since 1987, is the preeminent conference in domain decomposition methods that brings together mathematicians, engineers, and scientists to exchange information and ideas on the latest cutting-edge developments in the field. This funding will provide travel costs for young US participants, graduate students, and recent Ph.D. recipients, to learn about recent developments in domain decomposition and to interact with renowned international experts in computational engineering and computational sciences.",
