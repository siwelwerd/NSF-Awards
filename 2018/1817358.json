 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research project is to define the functions of two lysine deacetylase enzymes from human cells that modify the chemical structure of other proteins.  These changes in chemical structure alter cellular functions; therefore, lysine deacetylases impact many biological processes.  However, it is not known which lysine deacetylase controls which cellular function and how,  because the specific interactions with each protein within cells have not yet been determined.  Better knowledge of the workings of lysine deacetylases will enhance our understanding of how important biological processes such as cellular growth and development are regulated.  The project will also strengthen the research environment at Xavier University of Louisiana, a Historically Black College or University, by enabling the participation of undergraduate students in hypothesis-driven, high impact research.  Participants will receive training relevant for progression into graduate programs and the scientific workforce.  Additionally, the research infrastructure and results will be used to support training of undergraduate students in advanced laboratory courses.\r\n\r\nLysine deacetylases (KDACs) have both enzymatic roles (deacetylation of proteins) and non-enzymatic roles (association into complexes that regulate gene expression and protein function).  Despite the widespread acetylation of proteins in human cells, few specific substrates or indirect targets of KDACs have been identified.  The project will clarify the specific functions of two KDACs and whether those functions involve catalysis in vivo.  The target proteins of the two KDACs will be identified; these targets could be directly deacetylated and/or these targets maybe affected via other regulatory functions.  Cell lines containing genomically encoded catalytically inactive KDACs will be used to evaluate the acetylation of intracellular substrate proteins, and these will be validated to verify direct deacetylation, evaluate selectivity, and correlate in vitro reaction rates with in vivo data.  The project will also determine the intracellular specificity of KDAC inhibitors believed to target a single KDAC.  Overall, this project will greatly expand understanding of how KDACs function in vivo and provide insight into the different mechanisms and pathways through which KDACs exert their effects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe overall goal of this project was to improve understanding of lysine deacetylases (KDACs). KDACs are enzymes that chemically modify other proteins by catalysis, resulting in a change of activity of the modified enzyme and therefore of cellular processes. KDACs can also regulate cell behavior through binding to other biological molecules without performing catalysis. This project focused on KDAC6 and KDAC8, which have highly similar structures. Previous work has suggested a variety of functions for these enzymes, in many cases overlapping. To resolve which enzyme was responsible for particular functions and whether catalysis was involved in the function, we created human-derived cells with genomic mutations that result in inactivating one of the KDACs. In contrast to prior methods used to study these enzymes, the cells continued to produce the protein at concentrations similar to unmodified cells. This feature allows for non-catalytic functions of the cells to continue to be regulated in the modified cells, while the mutation blocks catalysis-dependent functions. Comparison of the biochemical environment of these cells to the unmodified cells revealed processes that require catalysis by one of the KDACs. Further comparisons to cells that lack one of the proteins entirely, which blocks all of functions of the KDAC, established links to functions that require the KDAC but not catalysis. Together, these results reveal the functional pathways in human cells that are regulated by each KDAC and therefore the importance of each enzyme in cell biology and medicine. Furthermore, we demonstrated that commonly used small molecule inhibitors, which are thought to selectively block catalysis of one KDAC, in fact have many more effects on cells than simply disabling the expected KDAC. These results have implications for development of drugs targeting the KDACs for treatment of diseases. Thirteen undergraduate students and recent graduates, all from underrepresented groups and primarily women, gained research experience and mentoring during this project as well as contributing to the scientific outcomes. All of these trainees have used their experience to gain entry to advanced degree programs and/or the scientific and public service work force.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/17/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: TerryWatt\n"
