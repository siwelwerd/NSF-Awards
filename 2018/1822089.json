 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funding to assist 12 US-based graduate students for attending the 36-th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium with the intention of exposing them to the discipline and to encourage them to pursue careers in microelectronics. Participation in this symposium is considered an important part of the graduate school experience of students in the field of VLSI design, providing the opportunity to interact with senior researchers and to be exposed to leading edge work in the field. The support will enable dissemination of scientific knowledge to students who would otherwise not have the experience. This student travel support will also facilitate the development of promising graduate students, and will thus indirectly also help train the workforce of the future in the important area of microelectronics. Women and underrepresented groups will be given due consideration for receiving support through this grant. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (VTS) for the past 34 years has been the premier academic forum where emerging trends and novel concepts in testing, debug and repair of microelectronic circuits and systems are explored. The 36-th edition of this symposium will addresses key trends and challenges in the semiconductor design and manufacturing industries through a program that includes Keynote and Plenary Talks, Technical Paper Sessions, Embedded Tutorials, Panels, Hot Topic Sessions, Half-day Tutorials, and the Innovative Practices Track. The conference committee has set up an adequate evaluation criteria to select the qualified students from a pool of applicants formed via open advertisement. The committee also plans to consider a small number of undergraduate applicants in order to better reach a diverse population of potential researchers in this field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
