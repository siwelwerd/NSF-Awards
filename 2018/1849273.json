Undergraduate and graduate students in data science, geoscience and engineering will be able to take an active role in understanding the interdisciplinary problems and potential solutions.\r\n\r\nThe forum includes an opportunity for hands-on interaction with the latest data and sensing capabilities.  Dr. Priyank Jaiswal recently received a Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Innovation (CSSI) award (#1835371): Oklahoma State University and UCSD are collaborating on the comparative characteristics of earthquakes induced by wastewater injection.  The project demonstrates an approach using multi-sensor geoscience and engineering datasets recorded on structures on the Oklahoma State University campus and in the field near the location of the September 2016 Pawnee earthquake.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
