 "awd_abstract_narration": "The exciting observations by the LIGO and Virgo detectors of merging neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes over the past several years have opened up the era of gravitational wave astronomy.  These events have revealed new astrophysics, including confirming the process through which heavy elements are created and discovering a new class of heavy stellar-mass black holes, and are providing novel tests of general relativity theory.  They also herald eventual gravitational wave observations of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), where a stellar-mass black hole or neutron star spirals into a supermassive black hole, such as those now known to exist in the center of virtually all large galaxies.  Surrounded by dense star clusters, these supermassive black holes will frequently capture compact stars (e.g., neutrons stars or stellar mass black holes) into highly eccentric orbits.  As these compact stars orbit, they radiate gravitational waves, causing the orbit to decay and the compact object to eventually be swallowed by the supermassive black hole. The emitted gravitational radiation is potentially observable with LISA, the future space-based gravitational wave detector.  The theoretical work funded by this award will provide improved predictions of the expected signals from highly-eccentric compact merging binaries.  Detection of gravitational waves from such EMRIs will provide unique strong field tests of gravity and probe the nature of black holes.\r\n\r\nTo pursue this effort, development of new techniques in black hole perturbation theory and gravitational self-force methods will be made, along with writing associated advanced computer codes.  High precision results from perturbation theory and self-force calculations will be studied to uncover high-order terms in the post-Newtonian expansion of eccentric binary motion and associated gravitational wave emission.  Perturbation theory and self-force findings in the extreme-mass-ratio, post-Newtonian overlap region support and reinforce broader efforts to advance post-Newtonian theory to higher orders and provide calibrations for effective-one-body models of merging binaries.  The PI's group is extending self-force calculations to generic motion on Kerr backgrounds, using a scalar field model initially, with primary focus to make these computations more efficient.  New self-force techniques will be combined with osculating elements codes to build long-term inspiral models for eccentric EMRIs.  Some parts of this work will be conducted in external collaboration with several former students and with colleagues at University College Dublin.  Numerical and analytic results, as well as some computer codes, will be made available online.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award funded research that explored several areas of gravitational physics theory, including post-Newtonian (PN) expansion of the first order self-force in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), the scalar self-force in Kerr EMRIs, and development of numerical relativity techniques.  \n\nIntellectual merit:  The primary intellectual focus was on using black hole perturbation theory and self-force calculations to understand EMRIs, binaries where one black hole is much more massive than its companion.  EMRIs are expected to be a prime source of gravitational waves that will be observable by LISA, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.  This project focused on EMRIs with eccentric orbits, motivated by current astrophysical expectations for how EMRIs form in the centers of distant galaxies.  A major outcome of the project was development and use of a set of Mathematica codes.  The first is an arbitrary precision code for making black hole perturbation calculations for eccentric Schwarzschild EMRIs.  The second is a fully symbolic Mathematica code that expands the master functions, metric, and self-force directly as PN series.  These two codes made novel use of Mathematica on a supercomputer, calculating hundreds of Fourier-harmonic modes simultaneously.  We used these codes to explore the analytic eccentricity dependence of gravitational wave fluxes, both energy and angular momentum, to between 9PN and 19PN relative order.  These results were used by others to make accurate long-term evolutions of eccentric EMRIs.  Patterns were discovered in the flux terms that led us to write two additional papers that used PN theory itself to derive the structure of a set of PN sequences (leading log terms and 1PN-, 3PN-, and 4PN-corrections of leading logs) in the fluxes to arbitrarily high PN order.  The third code computes the scalar self-force on generic orbits about a Kerr primary.  We discovered the presence of quasinormal bursts in the waveform from highly eccentric EMRIs with rapidly rotating Kerr primaries.  A fourth project developed an initial data module for use with the Einstein Toolkit numerical relativity package to model highly boosted black holes with spacelike slices exhibiting trumpet geometry.\n\nBroader impacts:  This project had several different broader impacts.  The theoretical work on black hole binaries contributes in an indirect way to experimental efforts by providing waveform expectations while LISA is in the development phase.  Secondly, the development under this award of high numerical precision and fully symbolic Mathematica codes for doing perturbation theory may find broader uses beyond gravitational physics theory.  Thirdly, in disseminating results, we continue to use the Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit (BHPTK) website (https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit) that we helped found and develop.  Finally, funding served to train and educate five graduate students, three of whom have finished their PhD and obtained postdoctoral or permanent positions.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/31/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Charles R Evans"
