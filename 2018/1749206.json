 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microorganisms are important components of every ecosystem.  They virtually never live in isolation in nature; only as part of communities with other microbes. Soil microbial communities are major actors in the Earth's elemental cycles, and their response to environmental change can determine whether microbes help soil to retain more of compounds such as carbon, or whether it will be emitted in gaseous forms. As Earth's environment changes, so does the ability for soil to effectively store carbon, reducing the beneficial ecosystem services that soils provide, and releasing stored carbon gas into the atmosphere. In a 25-year long field experiment ongoing in a temperate forest in central Massachusetts, increases in temperature have resulted in a large loss of soil carbon as carbon dioxide gas. The loss is mostly due to microbes, with periods of soil carbon decay punctuated by changes in microbial community composition. This cyclic nature of soil carbon loss over decades suggests the existence of long-term microbial control over carbon in soil. In this experiment, increases in temperature have negatively affected soil fungi but not bacteria, suggesting that bacteria are adapting to these new environmental conditions, and that further adaptations to long-term environmental stress are possible.  Over time, the quality of carbon compounds has been degraded, and examination of hundreds of bacterial isolates showed that the bacteria from chronically heated soils have an increased ability to metabolize degraded forms of carbon.  Going forward, in this NSF CAREER project, research will examine the ecology and evolution of soil bacteria from the long-term warming experiment, in an effort to better predict the effect of environmental stress on terrestrial ecosystems. By doing much of the research in the classroom setting, this project will also help train the next generation of students in environmental microbiology. \r\n\r\nThis research is designed to evaluate the central hypothesis that soil bacteria have acquired traits associated with adaptation to decades of chronic increases to soil temperature. The first aim is to directly measure the plasticity of in situ microbial community traits associated with declining soil organic matter quality and quantity over decades of chronic temperature stress. A laboratory incubation experiment will use stable isotope probing to measure temperature sensitivity of microbes associated with soils collected from a long-term warming experiment. The field experiment is an analysis of soils collected from before, during and after the heat is turned off for three months in the long-term study. Measures of different components of biomass and microbial products like enzymes and exopolysaccharides will be made and evaluated for changes due to long-term temperature increases. The second aim is to understand evolutionary adaptation of individual bacteria to long-term warming. Isolates will be screened for traits associated with oligotrophy (adaptation to low quantity substrate) and traits associated with degradation of complex carbon (adaptation to low quality substrate, including lignin analogs). The genomes of a subset of species with ecophysiology data will be sequenced for a study of trait evolution associated with oligotrophy or ability to degrade complex substrates. These organisms will also be part of a common garden experiment in an effort to link genomic features associated with long-term temperature stress to changes in fitness in soils. Altogether, these data will be used to estimate a rate of evolutionary adaptation for microbial parameters important to soil carbon modeling. This project will provide graduate student training in research and teaching, as well as undergraduate and high school student training in microbial physiology, ecology and genomics. Understanding bacterial adaptation might help to explain the non-linear pattern of soil C loss over decades of chronic temperature increase, and would define how environmental controls over the carbon cycle may act in a non-linear over longer time scales.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
