Research collaborations that cross international boarders allows the best ideas to emerge from wherever they exist.  The US-Serbia and West Balkan Data Science Workshop, co-funded by the National Science Foundation and partners in West Balkans region, brings together the best minds in data science.  The workshop focuses on four timely areas of research:  mathematical foundations, big data processing including security and privacy, data science in biomedical informatics, and data science in computational archaeology.\r\n\r\nThe US-Serbia and West Balkan Data Science Workshop is structured in such a way as to have a lasting impact on data science collaboration between the US and the West Balkans region through facilitated interaction and follow through on high impact research topics in data science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
