 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: Polarized growth of individual cells is a complex process integrating cellular metabolism events and the extracellular environment. Extension and shape changes are frequently accompanied with deposition of material into their extracellular environments. In plants, cells also build a network of carbohydrate polymers that act as a rigid barrier, known as the cell wall. Plant cells grow by building new cell wall material and plant cell shape is intimately linked with how this material is deposited on the outside of the cell. This project will work to elucidate the link between delivery of cell wall material and the cell's internal network of dynamic filaments known as the cytoskeleton. In particular the PI will use sophisticated light microscope imaging methods to test the hypothesis that formin proteins are critical for targeting actin assembly processes that initiate cell wall material exocytosis. Although it is known that cell growth and the cytoskeleton are intimately connected, a detailed mechanistic understanding of this coupling remains to be elucidated. This project will take advantage of moss, a simple, genetically tractable plant model system, to address this fundamental cell biological question.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The investigator will broaden the impacts of the proposed research by providing resources and expertise to the plant research community, training of undergraduates and underrepresented minorities, and incorporating aspects of the project in undergraduate education. The moss model system is ideally suited for undergraduate laboratory experiences. Therefore, the investigator will also develop a project-based laboratory course wherein students perform RNA-induced silencing experiments to analyze the function of individual genes and their roles in cell growth. Additionally, a summer laboratory module offered through the STEM Diversity Institute at U. Mass will aim to increase participation and recruitment of underrepresented minorities. Course materials from the summer module will be distributed to underrepresented faculty at partner institutions to facilitate implementation of similar courses. Incorporating faculty and students in this endeavor will contribute to increasing diversity in the sciences.",
