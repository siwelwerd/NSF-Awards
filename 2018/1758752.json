 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project centers around further development on the world's smallest 2-way communications satellites and associated ground hardware. Key contributions of this project include system and networking optimization and validation of the technology through end to end demonstrations. The system optimization component will involve the development of system-level models that capture the complex interaction of all elements, including dynamics, constraints, and objectives. The network optimization component will focus on the development of algorithms that enable seamless communications scheduling as the network scales to several thousand devices on the ground.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project spans commercial, scientific and humanitarian applications by extending IoT (Internet of Things) connectivity to remote regions without cell coverage and where satellite data is prohibitively expensive for vital applications including agriculture, energy, shipping, and weather. The satellites and ground hardware being developed in this SBIR Phase II project have been driven towards miniaturization and power reduction to enable a broader range of customers to take advantage of the network by allowing easy integration into their devices and easy-to-install autonomous ground solutions.  The unique launch economics afforded by the miniaturized satellites enable IoT (Internet of Things) sensing and data return at a cost 1/10th to 1/100th that of incumbent satellite data providers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\nSwarm Technologies Inc. is a satellite network-as-a-service company that provides customers access to a global, affordable communications network, ground hardware, and platform solution for managing, collecting and retrieving sensor and personal data from remote regions without existing terrestrial connectivity.\n\n\n\n\nThe broader commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase IIB project is to support advanced simulation and optimization efforts of the Swarm network. Swarm was extremely successful in accomplishing all Phase IIB goals, with the grant award supporting a variety of efforts including network optimization, product development, and commercial go-to-market.\n\n\n\n\nSwarm made significant progress during Phase II to improve the efficiency and fidelity of the satellite orbital and network simulation models. Phase IIB was focused on remaining questions regarding the maximum throughput of the network, density of devices within deployment areas, data volume, as well as optimizing geographic distribution of customer devices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough Phase IIB, Swarm also completed the hardware design and prototype builds for the Link/Tracker. A series of rigorous lab and field-based tests to evaluate performance with operational commercial satellites was done, which allowed us to make necessary modifications to complete certifications of the product for U.S. and international use. Building off of the technology and development of the Tracker and the Tile modem, we also developed, tested, and brought to market the Asset Tracker, an out of the box asset for tracking remote assets and the M138, an embedded modem designed to be integrated directly into IoT devices to provide low-cost satellite data services. The M138 modem became one of our leading products for providing satellite connectivity to our customers and supporting use cases with significant humanitarian, scientific, and humanitarian impact.\n\n\n\n\nWe performed pilot campaigns with customers in target verticals to demonstrate performance in the field for the Link/Tracker, Asset Tracker, and M138 modem and demonstrated the impact of Swarms technology with pilot customers before scaling our commercial service. These pilots provided critical product and network validation, enabling us to commercially launch both products, selling and shipping thousands of devices across 23 countries with significant humanitarian, scientific, and commercial impact.\n\nSwarms mission is to connect people and devices anywhere, at all times, at the lowest cost. With our uniquely low launch economics and low mass, low power, low-cost devices we yielded significant impact and results during Phase II of the project. The grants and support from the NSF have continuously supported Swarms efforts in delivering a VHF service that makes a positive impact on the world, furthering our goal of making satellite data accessible to anyone, anywhere on Earth.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/29/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: SaraSpangelo\n"
