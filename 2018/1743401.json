 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project includes measurements and modeling to improve understanding of the key processes and atmospheric emissions that result in regional ozone formation in the North China Plain (NCP), and the transport of pollution out of China with resulting implications for air quality in the United States.  The project includes a collaboration with Chinese scientists and with a German aircraft campaign (EMeRGe-Asia) that will track pollution outflow from the region.\r\n\r\nUS Scientists will participate in the Ozone Photochemistry and Export from China Experiment (OPECE), that includes in-situ observations at Tuoji Island downwind from the polluted North China Plain (NCP) region. Measurements at Mount Tai in the NCP and at an urban site in Shanghai will be made by collaborators in China. The specific research objectives of the project are as follows: (1) Extend the EMeRGe-Asia aircraft dataset with in-situ observations in the outflow pathway at Tuoji Island, on Mount Tai, and at an urban site in Shanghai. Assess the 3-D modeling capability using in-situ and satellite observations; (2) Examine radical and ozone photochemistry in China using CAREBEIJNG 2014 (Wangdu), OPECE, and EMeRGe-Asia observations; (3) Improve the emission inventories of NOx, aromatics, and other VOCs, and quantify the effects of key photochemical processes and precursor emissions on regional ozone formation and export; and (4) Understand the export processes in the boundary layer and free troposphere during spring and investigate large-scale atmospheric systems affecting springtime pollution export from China.",

Selected highlights include: (1) oxygenated volatile organic compound (OVOC) photolysis generates free radicals, accelerating ozone production, especially in regions with high NOx (NO+NO<sub>2</sub>) and volatile organic compound (VOC) concentrations, with important implications for ozone control strategies. (2) Investigation of HONO production mechanisms reveals implications for ozone sensitivity to NOx changes and regional ozone production variability in polluted regions such as eastern China. (3) Despite decreased NOx emissions, nighttime nitrate radical production shows no increase in China, with implications for nocturnal aerosol formation and climate effects. (4) Factors like heat waves, land cover change, and urbanization significantly contribute to extreme ozone episodes in the North China Plain, with implications for future ozone pollution control strategies under global warming. (5) Discrepancies in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models' representation of boundary layer height over China underscore the importance of accurately simulating meteorological parameters and surface energy for predicting future changes in air pollutants. (6) Assessment of satellite NO<sub>2</sub> and HCHO data using ground-based measurements highlights discrepancies and emphasizes the importance of accurate observations for studying atmospheric photochemistry.
