 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is co-funded by OISE and EPSCoR.\r\n\r\nFungal infection of plants is an ongoing major threat to human agriculture, thus stressing the importance of the research proposed in this project. The fungal pathogens studied in the US lab of the PI and the two labs in Germany, serve as models for understanding basic mechanisms of infections, but also for understanding host specificity and emerging infectious disease through host shifts. It is expected to gain alternative perspectives to address these research themes by the collaborative approaches. This IRES project provides an opportunity to 7 students each year to participate in the exchange. Although all three labs work with fungi, each has its own areas of expertise and each provides different approaches for conducting research. Each summer, a joint meeting will take place with all participants and PIs to discuss and present the ongoing projects in a unified group setting, alternating each year in Bochum or in Aachen, Germany.  This project is of particular importance because it may lead to the development of new methods for protecting agricultural crop plants from fungal diseases. Also, this project will allow active participation by students and help them develop skills in experimental design, and broaden participation in basic science by underrepresented groups (especially, African-Americans, women, and Appalachian students).\r\n\r\nThe unifying research theme for this proposal is host/pathogen interaction, including components of virulence and overall fitness of the pathogen. This project requires, and will benefit from, training in the two German labs, rather than having all students work in the same lab. First, the collaboration with two labs spreads the responsibility of the host labs and allows for more students (i.e., up to 7) to participate each year in the exchange. It is expected that the strong impact of these collaborative research/training exchanges will be in the longer-term appreciation of cultural differences and alternative approaches to research questions. The broader investigation of fungal/host interactions will benefit from this varied, collaborative approach by streamlining exchange of ideas and expertise. The proposed effector and protein interaction studies will be used by a wide community of scientists interested in basic fungal biology, host-parasite interactions, fungal evolution, and the development of new methods for protecting agricultural crop plants from fungal diseases and could lead to a better understanding of the basic infection mechanisms and disease process of obligate plant-parasitic fungi. Educational opportunities for students will be provided to actively participate in fungal genetics, transcriptomics and bio-informatics research, to learn fluorescence and electron microscopy techniques, to develop skills in experimental design, and will broaden the participation in basic science by underrepresented groups (specifically, African-Americans, women, and Appalachian students).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These fungi share the ability to manipulate their host plants in order  to benefit the fungal lifecycle, including dissemination to new host  plants. As part of these studies, fungal proteins were identified and investigated for their potential roles in targeting host plant functions and manipulating host plant behavior. Additionally, a fundamental question in biology was explored using these fungi as models. Specifically, the question of mitochondrial function and also control of mitochondrial inhericance were explored. Mitochondria are essential parts of most cells known (except in bacteria). They are thought to be the \"powerhouse\" of the cell, providing energy, but also involved in a process, know as \"Programmed Cell Death\" where cells with a certain age or with a certain level of damage, self-destruct to protect the organism overall. The students in the project investigated these questions, under the concerted guidance of the US PI and the host PIs in Germany. These efforts have, so far, resulted in 5 peer-reviewed publication in prestigious scientific journals, including one with an image chosen for the cover of that journal issue (see attached images). Moreover, student presentations were made at International Scientific Conferences (e.g., International Smut Pow Wow 2019, Bochum, Germany; Fungal Genetics Meetings, Asilomar, California, March 2022). Another publication is currently in revision for Frontiers in Physioogy and further publications are anticipated.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong></p>\n<p>A  total of 17 students from the University of Louisville were given  research and cultural opportunities through this grant over the total  period of the grant. Students that travelled to Germany over&nbsp; the period of this grant received extensive training in the use of Fluorescence, Confocal, and Scanning Electron Microscopy. Further, in additional to training in experimental design and statistical analyses, perticipants learned how to conduct large-scale plant infections in greenhouses, genetic mainpulation of fungi, and the associated challenges of these methods, many of which were unavaible at the US PI's institution at the commencement of this project. This included 12 students who were able to travel  to Germany to work in the 2 host labs in Germany (Bochum, Prof. Dr. D.  Begerow; Jena, Prof. Dr. J. Schirawski). This group of students included  5 doctoral students (i.e., pursuing PhDs) and 7 undergrads, of which 6  were female, 2 African-American, 2 Asian-American and 1 Latinx. During  the height of the COVID Pandemic (2020 and 2021) travel restricitions  prevented US students from visiting Germany. Nevertheless, additional  students continued to be trained in the lab of the PI, Dr. Perlin,  related to this grant, Thus, 5 students received research training,  including consultatiion with the German host labs remotely and  associated cultural interactions. These additional students included 1  doctoral student; in this way,&nbsp; 3 female and 1 Latinx students were  included in the project. All students received professional and cultural  development either in person, in Germany, and at the in-person  International Smut Pow Wow 2019, or remotely, via Zoom joint lab  meetings implemented periodically to overcome the inability to travel  during much of the period of the grant. This provided the unique  opportunity for all participants to observe differences in cultural  practices in different lab settings. Moreover, various tours of historic  and cultural sites were provided, both in the host cities in Germany  and in additional outings, e.g., a mustard factory in Western Germany,  as well as excursions into other countries in the EU (France, Czech  Republic). One student improved his fluency in German by volunteering with a local community group rehabilitating a former mine shaft to make it accessible for tours to visitors to the city and by jogging around the city during his extended stay there. Finally, an important outcome of this project was the  strengthening of research ties between the 3 participating labs and  continued efforts to conduct research and publish research&nbsp; findings  jointly. Moreover, some fundamental findings have been uncovered and  disseminated so far, with more anticiated in the near future. These  include characterization of fungal proteins responsible for manipulation  of host plant behavior, and increasing understanding of mitochiondrial  function and inheritance in these and related fungi.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/03/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michael&nbsp;H&nbsp;Perlin</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1824851/1824851_10568121_1694976005964_1SmutMeetingGroupPhoto-1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1824851/1824851_10568121_1694976005964_1SmutMeetingGroupPhoto-1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"International Smut Pow Wow 2019 Bochum, Germany\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1824851/1824851_10568121_1694976005964_1SmutMeetingGroupPhoto-1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"International Smut Pow Wow 2019 Bochum, Germany\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Group photo from the International Smut Pow Wow in at the University of Bochum.
