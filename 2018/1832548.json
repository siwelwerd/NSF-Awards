 "awd_abstract_narration": "The propagation of unstable flames is at the center of numerous natural phenomena and engineering applications. Understanding and modeling these unstable flames and how they interact with turbulent flows are of critical importance to designing efficient and clean energy conversion devices, mitigating the risks of accidental explosions, and understanding astrophysical phenomena.  This work is to conduct a computational study to reveal a complete picture of the geometry of the near-limit premixed flame front. While the primary focus is on thermo-diffusively unstable flames, the results are expected to shed light onto numerous additional scientific problems. This work will lead to the development of high-fidelity computational models, which will be used for designing and optimizing high-performance combustion systems for propulsion application.\r\n\r\nExperimental observations and theoretical studies have long pointed out the differences between laminar stable flames and thermo-diffusively unstable flames. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art techniques currently used to simulate large-scale turbulent flames fail to adequately predict the flow field of reacting mixtures that are intrinsically unstable. This work is to quantify the fundamental characteristics that make unstable flames different from their stable counterparts: the size of the cellular structure and the acceleration of the flame front propagation. These two features form the foundation onto which any Large Eddy Simulation (LES) models will be built: they determine the size of the LES filter and control the closure of the chemical source terms. The strength of the proposal relies on considering an extensive range of conditions from 1D spherical flames, to 2D stationary tubular flames, to 3D unstable laminar and turbulent flames. Throughout the analysis, no shortcut of accuracy will be taken, and previously neglected effects (such as Soret/Dufour) will be revisited and included (if necessary). The outcome will be a complete picture of the geometry of the reaction zone, and the proposed work will have important impacts on many natural phenomena and engineering applications: from energy generation to safety to astrophysics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe propagation of thermo-diffusively unstable flames, their strong acceleration, interactions with turbulence, and role played in the transition to detonations are at the center of numerous natural phenomena and engineering applications.  Understanding and modeling these unstable flames is of critical importance to designing more efficient and cleaner energy conversion devices, mitigating the risks of accidental explosions, and understanding astrophysical phenomena (to name but a few applications).\n\nTo address these goals, we started with high fidelity direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the reacting flow fields encountered when burning a lean mixture of hydrogen and air.  We considered both laminar and turbulent flames covering a wide range of flow conditions.  No shortcuts in accuracy were taken as we used finite-rate detailed chemistry and accounted for all sources of differential diffusion including thermo-diffusion (i.e. Soret effect).\n\nFrom this large amount of data, we developed a reduced order chemical model relying on two independent variables instead of nine chemical species.  After an extensive validation process, the reduced model was found to reproduce all key combustion properties of the full model (such as the flame speed, flame shape, and local chemical composition) at a fraction of the computational cost.\n\nIn the final step, this reduced order model was extended to the large eddy simulation (LES) framework and used in the numerical simulation of a low swirl burner.  Two cases, one burning natural gas and one burning hydrogen fuel, were selected to highlight the specific burning characteristics of hydrogen and the benefits of using the reduced order chemical model.  To our knowledge, this represents the first accurate prediction of the combustion characteristics of hydrogen in low swirl burners.\n\nDuring the project, improvements of the numerical implementation of the computational solver were found necessary.  This included the time-integration of the chemistry, treatment of differential diffusion, and accounting of arbitrary geometry.\n\nThe work was disseminated to the scientific community via the publication of four peer-reviewed journal articles and the presentations at local, national, and international conferences and workshops.\n\nThe project was carried out by two full-time graduate students and led to the training of four undergraduate students.  The undergraduate students were included in the research group and gained a deep knowledge of the research field.  They wrote a proposal, asked for recommendation letters, performed research, met regularly with the PI and co-supervising graduate student, wrote interim project reports, submitted abstracts for combustion meetings, and gave presentations.  One of the undergraduate students attended a local conference.  In co-supervising the undergraduate students, the graduate students gained a more complete picture of what it means to teach, educate, and guide a student.  This is invaluable training that one does not get from traditional coursework.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/22/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Guillaume Blanquart"
