 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide support for US students to participate in the primary annual international conference on accelerator science and its applications, the 9th International Particle Accelerator Conference (IPAC`18) to be held in Vancouver, Canada on April 29 - May 4, 2018. The IPACs are an annual series of conferences that rotate between the Americas, Europe, and Asia to highlight the science and engineering of major accelerator facilities, provide scientists with a forum for presenting results from research conducted using accelerators, and serve as a venue for describing new applications of accelerators.  Accelerators and accelerator-driven light sources are burgeoning worldwide, offering new prospects not only for fundamental discovery science, but for medicine, biology, energy, environment, national security, and industry.  This award will give many students the first opportunity of their scientific careers to be exposed to the breadth of this growing field of basic and applied research.\r\n\r\nThe award will be used to provide partial travel support for US students to attend the conference. The recipients of the travel support will be making presentations at the conference and will assist in conducting the conference. Attendance of 10 US students will be facilitated by the funds provided by this award. The conference will be an excellent opportunity for early career scientists to interact with more experienced researchers and their colleagues in the broader international scientific community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
