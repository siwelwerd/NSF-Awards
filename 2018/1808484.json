 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are two broad categories of synthetic polymers familiar to everyday use.  Thermoplastics (typically abbreviated simply as \"plastics\") are versatile and can be melted, dissolved, remolded and recycled.  In contrast, thermosets are typically harder materials that are solvent and heat resistant and but cannot generally be reprocessed or recycled after their initial formation.  Prof. Christopher Bowman at the University of Colorado is exploring the use of dynamic covalent chemistry approaches to transition between these two states of matter.  In dynamic covalent chemistry as implemented here, upon application of a desired stimulus such as exposure to light or heat, chemical bond structures become activated - repeatedly breaking and reforming the bonds within the polymer structure in a manner that converts one type of polymer to the other. This project investigates the fundamental relationships between the polymer structure and the inherent aspects of the dynamic covalent chemistry including the reactive chemical functional group, the catalysts used to facilitate the reaction, the kinetics of the reaction, and the concentration of the dynamic covalent bond. This project investigates fundamental phenomena of synthetic and polymer chemistry as well as demonstrable advancement of applied science all while providing profound educational experiences for graduate and undergraduate students alike.  Further, the project trains diverse personnel, comprising a large number of undergraduate and graduate students, in a unique combination of chemical synthesis, materials science, and polymer chemistry.\r\n\r\nSupported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the NSF Chemistry Division, the Bowman research team aims to implement the thiol-thioester exchange reaction as a photoactivatable and photodeactivatable dynamic covalent chemistry in crosslinked polymer networks.  The project focuses on understanding chemical structure-property relationships that arise with changes to the thioester, catalyst and polymer molecular structures and their impact on the covalent bond exchange rate. Fundamental understanding of the thiol-thioester exchange reaction and the kinetics of its catalysis in a non-polar, relatively immobile environment allows researchers to fine-tune the desired bond exchange process and the corresponding dynamic polymer properties. Combinations of various exogenously delivered stimuli (i.e., different wavelengths of light, addition or removal of heat) are used to control the activation of compounds within the network that catalyze the dynamic covalent chemistry between pendant thiol groups and thioester crosslinks and to arrest the exchange reaction with orthogonal stimuli. Specifically, dual handles of light and heat-based stimuli for starting and stopping the dynamic covalent chemistry are developed. Taking advantage of the thiol/thioester exchange reaction the Bowman research team aims to create covalently crosslinked polymers that are capable of user-directed, reversible transitions from rigid thermoset to malleable thermoplastic that has applications in optical materials, additive manufacturing, and adhesives.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The similarities and differences associated with the use of both nucleophilic and basic catalysts were examined to identify optimal conditions both for maximizing the exchange rate and for turning the dynamic reaction on and off simply by exposure to light. This approach led to light-switchable bistable behavior in which a relatively short exposure to light (e.g., to generate an acid) was used to turn the exchange reaction off by consuming the necessary basic catalyst. Other work using light to generate a base was used to turn the reaction on  providing a simple switch for the dynamic chemistry. This work also focused on understanding and controlling the effects of thiol substitution on the rates of the exchange reaction showing slower kinetics for secondary and tertiary thiols as compared to primary thiols. Additionally, the thioester exchange was examined in additional molecular contexts. Thioesters generated from the reaction of thiols with cyclic anhydrides may either undergo exchange with a free thiol or revert to the original thiol and anhydride. The extent and conditions under which each of these paths occur was determined by molecular analysis at varying temperature and catalyst concentration and type.\n\n\nThe understanding of the thiol-thioester exchange reaction chemistry was demonstrated in several applications, demonstrating the utility of this dynamic reaction in the broader chemistry community. In particular, understanding the differences in the reaction behavior between small molecules and polymer networks facilitated the implementation of the thiol-thioester exchange reaction in covalent adaptable networks (CANs).

These polymers were able to bind and precipitate native mRNA, and subsequently release the captured nucleic acid via immolation of the thioester backbone, making it an exciting platform for isolation of this therapeutically relevant biomacromolecule. Better understanding of the parameters and conditions that affect the thiol-thioester exchange as achieved here will allow researchers to more effectively realize the potential of this versatile chemistry.\n\n\nThis approach also simultaneously had significant impacts on human resource. The PI led the development of a new bootcamp in the nascent PhD degree program in Materials Science and Engineering with the express goal of enhancing training of students from diverse backgrounds that would not otherwise consider or be able to enter a PhD program in materials science. Further, the PI recruited and trained diverse personnel at multiple levels including undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral associates in a unique combination of chemical synthesis, biology, and polymer science. This project has allowed a number of six graduate and numerous undergraduate students along with one postdoctoral associate to develop skills in research conduct and laboratory skills.
