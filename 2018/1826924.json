 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will enable the restoration of the atmospheric measurement program at the Pico Este Cloud Station.  The Pico Este Cloud Station is located in a tropical montane cloud forest, one of the most sensitive and vulnerable of the world's ecosystems to climate change. The station is frequently above cloud base, thus facilitating the study of clouds without the need for aircraft and the related complexity and costs.  The station was lost in its totality due to Hurricane Maria, a category four hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson wind scale.  This hurricane passed across Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017 and greatly affected the island and its residents.\r\n\r\nThe measurements carried out at Pico Este and its companion Cabezas de San Juan Atmospheric Observatory since 2004 are a cornerstone of cloud-based research in Puerto Rico because they have been continuous and long-term, enabling the evaluation of trends in aerosol and cloud properties, and providing a context for process-oriented short-term field campaigns. These two sites are unique in the world, as they have been the only locations that provided long-term measurements of dust aerosols in the marine boundary layer that can be linked to chemical and microphysical properties of clouds above and downwind of the sites. Research activities at Pico Este are focused on aerosol, cloud, and precipitation studies, with a particular emphasis on aerosol and cloud interactions and composition.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The PDE is a particularly relevant site for climate change research as it is often within clouds or below cloud base and influenced by both local and long range transported aerosol from urban, marine and African continent sources.&nbsp; With the RAPID funds we built a storm-proof container (Figure 2a), capable of harbouring multiple instruments, and to perform a broad range of measurements under the influence of hurricane (&gt; Cat 3) conditions. We also purchased a rain sampler, weather station, high-volume aerosol sampler, &nbsp;dehumidifier, computers, and other materials needed to resume operations. With other NSF funds we have placed at the station two additional storm-proof containers (Figure 2b), one for a dual purpose lab and office and another for the Aerosol and Cloud Analysis System (ACAS). With a robust aerosol/clouds/precipitation measurement setup in place at PDE we will soon begin operations to benefit the scientific community with extended measurements of aerosol and cloud properties. These measurements, when analyzed with respect to meteorological patterns and particle sources (e.g., African dust, volcanic ash, ocean, biomass burning) will help researcher better understand how clouds form and evolve to produce precipitation and impact climate. Recent large-scale intrusions of African dust in the Caribbean and east coasts of the Americas highlight the importance of having a well-instrumented research station in the region of highest impact.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>This project is already enhancing the research and educational infrastructure of the PDE station.

At the same time, promoting training and teaching of graduate and undergraduate students in a unique environment will remain at the forefront of all research activities.&nbsp; While the regional capacity to do basic, environmental research will be strengthened, this project will broaden participation by underrepresented student groups, as our institution is a Hispanic Serving Institution.&nbsp; It will also broaden dissemination of scientific finding through presentations at national/international scientific symposia, courses, peer-reviewed publications, theses, and multiple databases accessible through agencies such as NOAA, WMO, and NASA?s websites, and by presenting results of research and education projects in formats useful to students (K-12, undergraduates and graduates) as well as to teachers (grade school, high school and college), state and municipal governments, and to the community at large.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>The most significant setbacks for this project have been: 1) the lack of power at the site and the acquisition of permits by the USFS El Yunque National Forest for the placement of the 30-kW generator on site, 2) a series of seismic activities that started in December 2020 and have not finished yet, and 3) the COVID-19 pandemic this year. The COVID-19 pandemic led to a complete lockdown imposed by the government from mid-March to the present time of this report. The university campus remains closed, and the administrative service is not fully operational. Because of this, activities related to the development of the project face delays on several fronts. The PDE site is partially accessible but devoid of the regular maintenance service. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was working on a project to supply grid power to the site.
