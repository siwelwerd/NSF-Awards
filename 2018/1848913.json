 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the use of autonomous robotic systems to save lives across multiple disaster levels by multiplying human efforts in areas such as disaster response, extending to reduced response times and improved rescue efforts during disaster relief. Using autonomous systems, such as drones, that run software which allows for the use of biosensors and on-board machine learning, natural disaster responders can find survivors faster and reduce casualties. The technology understands mission objectives (intent-driven), coordinates with others (collaborative autonomy) and is voice enabled (natural language conversational interface), allowing it to work well with both humans and machines. These and other features lend this technology to broad commercial applications, offering the best strategy to mitigate multiple disaster levels - at the district or provincial level by assessing strengths and vulnerabilities to various hazards; at the community level like search and rescue during a flood or fire; and at the household level like ambulatory drone service care for the aging.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project will be focused on translating scientific research to commercialization through lessons on the business model canvas and extensive customer discovery. Our research has involved hands-on technical experimentation using deep/machine learning software for prototype development and literature reviews on a variety of software capabilities. Using a camera with machine learning, we were able to identify a human with most of the body obscured. Hardware acts as transport for the optical and acoustical biosensor package which can take action autonomously by utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) technologies extending to: realtime onboard object detection capable of identifying a person in rubble, even when the person is partially obscured (Machine/Deep Learning/edge), offline cloud-enriched datasets for cloud-sourced analysis, voice recognition/conversational natural language processing/speech synthesis. Blockchain enabled autonomous swarm management technology on multiple robotic devices will enable multiple machine collaboration. All sensor data is time-stamped and stored in the cloud where the AI technologies are used to enrich the data. Enriched data is made available offline via the internet to thousands of volunteers for human review. Results from our research show that the technological capability exists, the software and hardware components combined meet a need established through our initial customer discovery.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

At the same time, in-person interviews were done as the ground for testing multiple potential business model canvases for Eagle-i. The team engaged in the process of customer discovery over the course of the first seven weeks and beyond.&nbsp;<br /><br />After completing the course, with a more complete understanding of the business model canvas and our first customer, further exploration into the first responder field and the emergency management sector was done through additional customer discovery interviews. Following the interviews done during the first seven weeks at the International Association of Emergency Management conference and at the nationally-declared disaster of the Southern California fires, modifications and iterations were made to the business model canvas. A network of potential customers was established and expanded by asking the question: \"is there anyone else you recommend I talk to?\" after every interview.&nbsp;<br /><br />As a result of the contacts made and for deeper understanding of the disaster response field, the EL engaged in a three-month training program by Queensborough Community College and Northwell University Hospital to become a first responder. The program included medical training as well as first response training which resulted in the EL receiving the New York State Department of Health's Emergency Medical Technician-Basic certification in September 2019. Since then, The EL has joined a local volunteer ambulance company and has gained copious insider information about the every day workings of first response in a suburban area. EL continues working with this agency that is also tied in with county and state-level first response agencies such as Fire Department of New York, New York Police Department, Suffolk County Police Department and New York State Troopers. EL has most recently begun a medical career with Northwell University Hospital as an Advanced Clinical Associate and has been active during the Coronavirus Pandemic on the front lines as a medical worker. This has given the team valuable insight into emergency response, technology integration and acquisition.&nbsp;<br /><br />We conducted 150 customer discovery interviews at locations experiencing emergencies/disasters in New York, Baltimore, Los Angeles, as well as at conferences in other states. We discovered that emergency managers across the lower 48 states may be regionally divided by these categories: urban vs rural, where budget size and total number of calls/disasters they attend to per year vary greatly.<br />Significant insight into the dynamics of the emergency responders included interviewing existing vendors, seeing existing product lines, studying the various tiers in local, regional, national and international as well as private and public emergency management agencies. We found the common protocols such as the federal Incident Command System and tools like FirstNet that are in use today.<br /><br />Another set of customer discovery interviews followed during the extension of the reporting period including interviews of potential partners, CEOs of Tactivate, iRobot and of security companies, about their entry to market and about the different products they carry; such as Elide Fire, which is a company based in Europe that has just entered the market in the USA. We also spoke to different fire chiefs at live trade shows and during webinars where we learned about the companies they are interacting with, how they interact, and how they acquire new technology.<br /><br />The most recent activity has included participation in the Montreal General Hospital Foundation &amp; the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC) global innovation challenge where we engaged in social business development of a low cost ventilator as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
