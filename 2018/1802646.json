 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the Chemical Synthesis program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Joshua S. Figueroa and his research team at the University of California, San Diego are developing new chemical transformations by focusing on the design, synthesis and study of novel metal compounds. It has been long recognized that the key to developing next-generation chemical processes is the discovery of new chemical compounds with high reactivity. For many processes of industrial, agro-chemical and fine-chemical importance, metal compounds lie at the forefront of productive, selective and energy efficient chemical transformations. In order to ensure an advancing synthetic chemistry enterprise, metal compounds capable of new reactivity are required. A key design feature of the compounds under investigation in this award are the molecular supporting groups, also known as ligands, that are used to stabilize the metal. These ligands allow for precise control of molecular geometry, while dictating selectivity in ensuing chemical transformations. In addition, the ligands allow for facile product analysis due to the presence of several convenient analytical markers. This research is emphasizing new transformations of nitrous oxide (N2O), which is a potent greenhouse gas and environmental pollutant, yet is a largely untapped for organic reactions. Also under investigation are more fundamental aspects of structure and bonding in metal complexes, with a specific focus on the synthesis and properties of compounds that contain multiple bonds between metals and elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. The scientific work of this award is accompanied by outreach efforts to local San Diego area high school students. Professor Figueroa and his team are engaging young persons in Make & Measure enrichment activities. The goal of these efforts is to stimulate greater participation of young persons in STEM-related fields. \r\n\r\nProfessor Figueroa is exploring the synthesis and reactivity of coordinatively and electronically unsaturated metal isocyanide complexes. The sterically encumbering m-terphenyl isocyanide ligand class is being used specifically to control the molecular geometries and electronic structures of transition metal centers, such that they are primed for selective reactions with specific small molecule substrates. In addition, molecular architectures are being targeted that can successfully support late transition-metal multiple bonding to carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. A significant emphasis is placed on the binding and activation of nitrous oxide (N2O) by cobalt-based m-terphenyl isocyanide complexes. A series of unique N2O-adducts of cobalt have been isolated, and the research is focused on delineating the reactivity available to these complexes, with specific attention being placed on the development of mild oxygen-atom transfer reactions to organic substrates. An additional focus is the synthesis and reactivity of late, 3d transition-metal carbyne complexes, with the goal of developing metathesis-based transformations. The synthetic and experimental research is accompanied by significant outreach efforts to San Diego area high school students. Professor Figueroa and his team have partnered with local high schools to engage young students in Make & Measure extracurricular enrichment activities. These activities focus on exposing students to advanced transition metal chemistry, but their overarching goal is to engage young persons in STEM-centered fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNSF Award CHE-1802646 focused on the synthesis and reactivity of molecular transition-metal complexes supported by encumbering m-terphenyl isocyanides.  This work represents the Figueroa Group's long-standing interest in generating structural, electronic and functional mimics of the unsaturated binary metal carbonyls. These unstable carbonyl species have long been studied in cryogenic matrices or by advanced spectroscopic techniques for their intrinsic structure and bonding properties, and as reactive intermediates in many catalytic transformations mediated by metal-carbonyl compounds. By exploiting the isolobal analogy between carbon monoxide (CO) and organic isocyanides (CNR),  as well as the encumbering steric properties of the m-terphenyl group, we have aimed to prepare isocyanide analogues to kinetically-unstable metal carbonyl species that can be isolated under ambient conditions, and that are amenable to characterization by a complement of spectroscopic and analytical techniques. However, as we have shown over the past several years, the structure and reactivity patterns of unsaturated metal isocyanide complexes often differ significantly from those of their carbonyl counterparts. This is a consequence of the stronger s-donor and weaker p-accepting properties of isocyanides relative to CO. Accordingly, when coupled with the kinetically stabilizing steric environment provided by the m-terphenyl group, this divergence has led to the discovery of new small-molecule activations, mechanistic paradigms and structural types for organometallic complexes. NSF Award CHE-1802646 centered on further understanding these comparisons and contrasts, while generating new information on structure and reactivity of low-valent metal centers in constrained steric environments.
