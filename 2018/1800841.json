 "awd_abstract_narration": "At the most basic level Black Holes are  nothing  but  special, explicit,  solutions  of the  Einstein equations of General Relativity.  To have  physical reality  they have to possess  properties  which  make them detectable to observations. Chief among them is stability to perturbations. This translates to a very difficult, deep and beautiful mathematical conjecture which is the main  focus of the proposed   research.  The goal is to show that any  small perturbation, at a given time, of a given black hole solution remains small for all later  times. Thus all the important features of a unperturbed black hole are preserved by the perturbations.\r\n\r\nTo solve the problem of stability of black holes one has to overcome a large range of difficult issues. The high non-linearity of the Einstein  equations makes it hard to separate them; they are all interconnected.  At the heart of all these difficulties is the issue of gauge. That means, roughly,  that one cannot solve the stability problem without finding a specific coordinate system  in which  one can  establish decay of the perturbations, i.e. to show that the perturbations converge to zero for large times. In collaboration with J. Szeftel in France the PI had proposed a new method to construct these coordinates  based on the full covariance properties of the  Einstein equations. The main methodology of the PI is to combine this new method, called Generally Covariant Modulation theory, with the the so called vector-field method.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This   resolves  a long standing  problem in  General Relativity  which goes back to the revolutionary discovery  of  black holes, first by Schwarzschild  in 1916- a few month after Einstein's formulation of General Relativity in November 1915,  and then by Kerr in 1963.

The discovery of these solutions  led to an enormous  interest in the question of their stability, that is the question of their  stability relative to arbitrary small perturbations.  It goes  without saying that this is a fundamental problem for, if black holes  where unstable, they would be merely mathematical artifacts  devoid of phsyical meaning. The problem, which  has  drawn  the attention of both  theoretical physicists  and mathematicians,  has  required  the development of new mathematical  ideas  and techniques which are expected to be important in other problems of mathematical physics.\n\n \n\nA first important   step was the proof of the nonlinear stability of the Minkowsky space established  by Christodoulou and Klainerman  more that 30 years ago.
