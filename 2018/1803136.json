Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to  Chris Gerig is \" Embedded Contact Homology, Near-Symplectic Geometry, and 4-Manifold invariants\" The host institution for the fellowship is Harvard University, and the sponsoring scientist is Peter Kronheimer.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
