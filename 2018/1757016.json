 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Georgia Southern University (GSU), located in Statesboro, GA, will support the training of 8 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2018-2020. It is supported by the Divisions of Chemistry and Materials Research of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate. Hosted by the Chemistry and Biochemistry Department at GSU, this program focuses on collaborative and multidisciplinary research projects that span the fields of analytical, materials, organic, biochemical, and computational chemistry. Participants work directly with faculty mentors on their respective research projects, gain the knowledge and tools for progression in STEM, build a community of professionals with peers and faculty, and grow in their perspective on the role of STEM in society. In addition to ten weeks of intensive research, students take part in educational, social, and professional development activities that support their sustained growth as scientists, including training in scientific communication and workshops on career preparation, leadership, and ethics.\r\n\r\nResearch projects entail the design and characterization of magnetic materials; catalyst development; quantum chemical analyses for the detection of extrasolar planets; synthesis and investigation of novel organic sensors and molecular switches; development of analytical and biochemical techniques for toxicological assessment of common cosmetic ingredients; and novel approaches to cancer therapy. Research experiences are complemented by professional development activities that foster students' ability to effectively convey science to a variety of audiences, and provide the exposure, knowledge and tools to successfully navigate different stages of a STEM career. This includes hands-on training with instrumentation and resources commonly used by STEM professionals. Emphasis is placed on recruiting students from institutions with limited research opportunities, particularly women, minorities, and students from rural and underserved areas of the southeastern United States.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Across both grants CEMITURE has engaged 51 scholars.\n\n\nThe focus of this outcome report is the most recent grant (# 1757016) which funded 8 scholars each summer in 2019, 2021 and 2022, a total of 24 student-researchers. The program was canceled in 2020 because of the COVID pandemic and the final grant year, a no-cost extension, covered conference attendance for 2022 scholars who presented at national and regional venues in the fall and spring following the CEMITURE experience.\n\n\nThe CEMITURE home department is the Georgia Southern (GS) University Biochemistry, Chemistry and Physics Department(formerlythe GS Chemistry and Biochemistry Department).\n\n\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT\n\n\nCEMITURE scholars engaged in intensive research and professional development experiences to bolster their preparation and competitiveness for long-term careers in STEM.\n\n\nIn research, participants worked directly with their GS faculty-mentors and side-by-side with their research group members. They developed and/or fine-tuned skills in analytical techniques, small molecule and materials synthesis, studies with cell and other types of biological samples, chemical education investigations, and more.

Thus far, under the direction of their CEMITUREfaculty mentors, scholars have produced6 peer-reviewed publications and25 conference poster presentations, and haveearned 5 awards fortheir conference presentations and abstracts. Conferences included the national/regional meetings for the National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers (NOBCChE),the Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minoritized Scientists (ABRCMS), the American Chemical Society (ACS), and the Southeastern Regional Meeting for the American Chemical Society (SERMACS).\n\n\nThe professional development element of the program targeted technical skills development, career preparation, and enhancing a sense of belonging in the program and in STEM. Notably, the lead team for the professional development programming was recognized with the inaugural GS College of Science and Mathematics Award for Excellence in Collaboration in 2022.\n\n\nTo run various sessions, the professional development team liaised with GS faculty- and staff-experts from units such as the offices of Research Integrity, Title IX, Inclusive Excellence (IE), Interdisciplinary STEM and Career Services, the Counseling Center, and the GS Libraries.

Picnics/social outings were also embedded into professional development schedules to reinforce a sense of community with fellow student-researchers and the faculty.In 2021 (all) and 2022 (one) participants engaged in outreach events for elementary and middle school students, and each of the three summers ended with a joint poster symposium with the GS Biology REU.\n\n\nDue to COVID-19 related safety concerns, tours/outings were not included in 2021.\n\n\nBROADER IMPACT\n\n\nAmong the 24 scholars 79% were from 2-/4-year primarily undergraduate institutions (PUI); 71% were first- and second-year students at the time of acceptance to the program; 75% were from rural and urban cluster areas; more than 50%are underrepresented genders including women; and 38% are underrepresented racial/ethnic minorities (URM). Since participating in CEMITURE, 17 out of the 24 scholars have completed their Bachelors degrees and 7 are continuing undergraduate students. At this time, 82% of those who have completed Bachelors degrees remained in STEM (14 out of 17), 11 earned places in PhD programs and 3 secured STEM jobs.Post-CEMITURE achievements also include two Barry Goldwater Scholars, an ACS Scholar, a McNair Scholar appointment at the home institution of the scholar, and a National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Scholars Connect Program (NSCP) Fellow.\n\n\nMany of the professional development initiatives were run in collaboration with other GS summer research programs.
