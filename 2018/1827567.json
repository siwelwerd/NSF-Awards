 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent technological advances in DNA sequencing have fueled important new discoveries in many fields of biology.  The \"genomic revolution\" has provided a wealth of data to unravel the mysteries of how diverse organisms evolve, interact, and respond to their environments.  However, a major hurdle has been that the vast majority of studies are correlative.  Tools allowing researchers to pinpoint causal associations between genes and traits are limited. This research will apply the latest technology to study gene function in an emerging model for organismal biology, Polistes wasps. These insects, commonly known as paper wasps, are well-studied, cosmopolitan, social insects.  Because of their abundance in human environments, ease of experimental manipulation, and rapidly developing genomic resources, they are poised to address many integrative organismal biology questions (including speciation, behavior, development, and neuroscience). The project will employ two cutting edge technologies for gene manipulation along with focused efforts to breed and maintain colonies in the laboratory, in order to test causality for several genes associated with traits such as coloration, learning, aggression, and development. This work can have a catalytic impact on a growing community of researchers interested in using social insects to address a wide variety of questions in organismal biology, applied entomology and agriculture. Training and mentoring in the latest methodologies will be provided to one postdoctoral researcher, one graduate student, one research technician, and numerous undergraduates.  Results, resources and methods will be disseminated widely to the research community through symposia, lab exchanges, and workshops.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop resources for functional genomics in Polistes fuscatus wasps using a three-pronged approach. First, the researchers will use RNA-interference (RNAi) for ecologically relevant tests of candidate gene function. Functional genomic tests can be performed in the wild, allowing for assessment of gene function in an ecologically relevant context.  The project will improve RNAi efficiency through experimenting with technical parameters and biological conditions and test candidate genes for roles in phenotypes such as caste development and cognition. Second, the researchers will establish methods for controlled mating in the laboratory, and continuous rearing, aiming to contract the colony cycle, induce nest founding, and induce egg laying to provide continuous availability of insects for research. These developments will establish Polistes as a tractable model for rearing stable lines for functional genomics. Third, using gene editing with CRISPR/Cas9, the team will produce first generation (G0) wasps by injecting embryos and targeting the pigmentation gene yellow, with the goal of producing transgenic mosaics with non-lethal but readily observable phenotypic effects. Successful mutant G0s will be used to produce stable transgenic lines in the lab for yellow and then move on to other target genes of interest. This work may transform Polistes wasps into a functional genomic model system for numerous areas of organismal biology. The work is also unique in that it will allow for tests of gene function under controlled conditions in the laboratory as well as in the field, providing the major advantage of addressing how gene function depends on environmental context.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
