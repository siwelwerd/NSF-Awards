 "awd_abstract_narration": "A convergence of technologies has given rise to cyber-physical systems known as the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT applications incorporate networks of advanced sensors and actuators, embedded intelligence, and networking technologies to provide control that were not previously possible. IoT technology has the potential to affect nearly every aspect of human endeavor and commerce by increasing system efficiency and reducing energy consumption. It also can provide real-time monitoring of the nation's infrastructure and environment and has the potential to improve public health, safety, and national security. This project has four objectives. First, it will create and test interdisciplinary IoT learning material in electronics, computing, and networking. Second, it will broadly disseminate the materials through established networks such as the Advanced Technological Education Centers. Third, the project will develop teacher and faculty expertise in IoT and active-learner technologies. Fourth, it will interest under-represented groups in STEM fields by recruiting K-12 students into summer workshops. It is vitally important that the United States be at the forefront of the development of this technology and has a workforce that can install, maintain, and update this emerging technology. This project has the potential to provide the necessary curricula and training to teachers, who can educate the IoT technicians needed to work in this critical and evolving area. \r\n\r\nThis multi-interdisciplinary project aims to improve STEM-related undergraduate education in electronics, computing, and networking technology areas. It also aims to improve education in non-electronics-based technologies that use cyber-physical systems to provide advanced automation and control functions and enhance system efficiency, safety, and security. The project will develop courses, modules, labs, and simulations. These teaching resources will focus on advanced manufacturing or Industrial IoT, IoT cybersecurity, e-healthcare IoT applications, and IoT based advanced automotive technologies. The project will create an IoT Systems Field Technician option or certificate under existing electronics, computing, and networking programs. The certificate has the potential to benefit incumbent workers and is expected to be of greater benefit to students pursuing degrees in areas such as Biomedical Equipment Repair or Mechanical Engineering Technology than a standalone IoT degree. Broad dissemination of the results and an emphasis on cultivating high school teacher and college faculty expertise will support broad impact. The project impact is broadened further by recruitment of diverse K-12 students to participate in summer workshops. These workshops will expose K-12 students to coding, sensors, data acquisition, interactive virtual labs, simulations, and low-cost computing platforms.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
