Expected topics include: the model theory of pseudofinite groups especially as it relates to approximate subgroups and model theoretic tameness, interactions between computational learning theory and model theory in the area of VC-dimension,  the subject of asymptotic classes and measurable structures, and the theory of Jordan permutation groups.  \r\n \r\nDetails about the conference may be found at http://www.icms.org.uk/permutationgroups.php .\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
