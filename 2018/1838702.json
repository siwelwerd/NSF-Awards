 "awd_abstract_narration": "Transformation in health and medicine calls for innovation and integration of information science and engineering approaches to revolutionize healthcare delivery systems, including high-performance wireless communication and sensing technologies. Radio-frequency (RF) wireless technologies can interfere with sensitive medical equipment, hence are not universally accepted in hospitals. This research will develop and apply a visible light communication platform technology, overlaying the existing lighting infrastructure using emerging greener solid-state light-emission diode bulbs, for live tracking and efficient networking to enable smart, connected and efficient hospitals. The scope of work and contributions include developing a novel radio-frequency-free harmless light-emission diode based visible light communication platform technology to enable two-way real-time light-based tracking and networking for smart and connected hospitals, a dynamic event-based behavioral model to simulate building-user interactions in hospital settings, and an artificial intelligence enhanced algorithm to facilitate people-data-system-connected intelligent healthcare ecosystems. Success of the proposed research will transform the field of medicine and health, and achieve affordable and efficient healthcare delivery. The research outcomes will have tremendous societal and economic impacts to the nation and humanity.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this four-year project is to develop and apply a transformative tracking, networking and operation technologies, using visible light communication (VLC) technology, to enable smart, connected and efficient hospitals. The technical approach will be to overlay the innovative light emission diode (LED) based VLC platform technology on the existing LED lighting infrastructure in a hospital to provide a wireless network for real-time visible light tracking and communications without using radio-frequency (RF) signals, which can interfere with sensitive medical equipment. The technical contributions include novel RF-free LED-based VLC platform technologies and system-on-a-chip solutions to enable two-way real-time visible light tracking and networking for smart and connected hospitals, new dynamic event-based behavioral models to simulate building-user interactions in hospital settings, and innovative artificial intelligence enhanced algorithms to facilitate people-data-system-connected intelligent healthcare delivery ecosystems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This four-year collaborative research project aims to develop and apply disruptive optical wireless tracking, networking and management technologies to enable smart, connected and greener future hospitals. The main goal is to develop a revolutionary energy-efficient light-emitting diode (LED) based visible light communication (VLC) technology platform and systems-on-chip (SoC) solutions to enable smart and connected hospital operations. The key novelties include converting the existing LED lighting infrastructure in hospitals into a wireless optical network for real-time tracking and communications in healthcare settings and developing artificial intelligent enhanced human-hospital interactive model supporting smart hospital operations. This research was carried out through collaboration of researchers in Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and School of Medicine at University of California, Riverside, and Department of Architecture at University of California, Berkeley.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">The followings are the main project outcomes. Real-world hospital operations data were collected and analyzed at the partner hospital, the St. Bernardine Medical Center (SBMC) in Southern California. User-hospital behavior models were developed using the hospital routine data observed and collected at SBMC. A new simulation methodology was developed for analyzing and optimizing hospital operations. Innovative artificial intelligence enhanced algorithms were developed to enable people-data-system-connected smart hospital operations in combination with the new LED-based VLC technology and real-time position tracking and management system (PTMS). The new user-hospital behavior models and people-in-the-loop smart hospital management algorithms were validated by a simulation testbed designed to analyze regular hospital procedures that shows how to improve hospital operations efficiency by simultaneously considering three different points of view: spatial, social and operational, which is benchmarked with the hospital actors? satisfaction, space utilization and operational efficiency. The new methodology can relate the expected performance of a hospital and its actual usage, using quick decision-making cycles empowered by the new LED-based VLC tracking system. The new hospital operations models and simulation algorithms were validated by studying the daily medical procedure routines at the Cardiac Catheterization Lab at the SBMC hospital. A new physical LED-based VLC wireless tracking and communication system was developed. Figure 1 depicts simplified system architecture of the new PTMS system, which consists of regular LED lighting bulbs that can emit modulated visible light by modified LED driver circuits for optical communication (VLC) and positioning (VLP) to realize real-time wireless optical tracking functions. An LED VLC/VLP PTMS testbed was developed and implemented in lab. Figure 2 shows the demo three-LED VLC PTMS testbed, showing the three LED lighting fixtures that were converted into the host VLC tracking units, which are networked through the power line communication (PLC) backbone for center control. A triangulation algorithm was developed to accurately locate the moving user units (human and equipment subjects) that contain LED and photodetector (PD) devices. This demo testbed validated the proposed real-time LED VLC tracking functions, achieving a spatial resolution down to 1cm. An integrated circuit (IC) chip was designed for the demo LED VLC tracking system. The IC was designed and implemented in a foundry silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology. Figure 3 depicts the VLC transceiver (Tx) IC architecture and Figure 4 shows sample signal waveforms of the trans-impedance amplifier (TIA), bandpass filter, rectifier and receiver (Rx) circuit blocks, confirming the VLC system functions. The proposed LED-based VLC tracking technology and system were validated successfully in the lab (Figure 5). This project involved four PhD students (including two female students), sixteen undergraduate students (five female and three underrepresented minority (URM) students), and two postdocs. The research resulted in eleven peer-reviewed papers and four undergraduate student papers published. Figure 6 shows undergraduate students working in the lab constructing the LED VLC demo system. <strong>Broader impacts:</strong> This research successfully demonstrated a novel LED-based VLC wireless optical tracking and networking technology and system that support energy-efficient smart hospital operations, which can potentially improve the humanity by revolutionizing the healthcare systems, making the future hospitals smarter, better connected, more affordable and greener. Undergraduate and graduate students, about 50% female and URM, were trained for engineering, architecture and medicine research experiences.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified:
