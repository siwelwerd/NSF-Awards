 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will fund early-career US participants to attend a conference on \"Microlocal Analysis and Applications\" to be held at Fudan University in Shanghai in June 2019.  This conference, the first ever in the field to take place in China, will focus on the theory and uses of microlocal analysis, a field of mathematics which studies how solutions to many equations arising in physics and geometry may be analyzed in phase space, where one keeps track of momentum as well as position.  The project will enhance training in this important field of mathematics and will facilitate international collaborations.\r\n\r\nThe project will fund junior US researchers, primarily postdocs and advanced graduate students, but possibly also tenure-track researchers from non-R1 institutions, to attend a meeting on the theory and applications of microlocal analysis at Fudan University in Shanghai in June 2019.  Microlocal analysis, which is analysis of partial differential equations by phase space methods, has roots in the development of pseudodifferential and Fourier integral operators in the 1960s, but has of late been experiencing a renaissance in the breadth of its applications across pure and applied mathematics.  The meeting will explore advances in fundamental techniques as well as recent applications in areas as diverse as inverse problems, general relativity, classical dynamics, and quantum chaos.  The grant will enhance US doctoral and postdoctoral training in microlocal analysis as well as encouraging international collaborations in this and related fields.\r\n\r\nhttp://sites.math.northwestern.edu/fudan-microlocal/index.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
