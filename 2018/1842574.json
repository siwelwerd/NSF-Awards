The PI meeting will bring together the community of active NRI participants to provide cross-project coordination of intellectual challenges and best practices in education, technology transfer and general outreach.  This activity will also establish a repository illustrating the research ideas explored and milestones achieved by the NRI projects. \r\n\r\nThe meeting is planned for two days in October 2018 in the vicinity of Washington DC. The format will include presentations by the attending PIs of projects in their final year, a poster session with all other projects, keynote speeches, and panel discussions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
