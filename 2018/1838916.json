 "awd_abstract_narration": "At its core, the National Science Foundation's CSforAll initiative has the goal of creating the\r\ninfrastructure, pathways, and incentives that develop ecosystems for supporting and motivating all youth\r\nto become computationally literate and pursue computer science-related degrees and careers. This\r\nproposal makes a case for the extension of the CSforAll infrastructure to include the integration of out-of-school time (OST) learning projects into existing CSforAll funded grants by asking two questions: How\r\ncan we foster a community learning environment that recognizes, supports, and promotes computational\r\nliteracies as a desirable and accessible form of social capital by mentors, youth, and families? And how\r\ndo these community-level connections impact youth computational making learning opportunities,\r\nparticipation, social networks, knowledge, and understanding? In Evanston, a partnership between\r\nNorthwestern University, the district, and the Evanston YMCA will work together to understand and answer these\r\nquestions by designing and operating a community-based computational making OST hub that provides\r\nthe learning activities and peer community needed to create an inviting and relevant environment for\r\nstudents, caring adults, and educators to reorient their perception towards computer science-related\r\ncareers as desirable and achievable for youth in the community.\r\n\r\nThis proposal seeks to take advantage of a unique opportunity - the launch of a 1:1 middle grades tablet\r\ninitiative in a racially and socioeconomically diverse community actively engaged in addressing their\r\nexpanding achievement gap - to implement a community-based computational making OST hub and\r\nreimagine how a community-embedded approach to OST designed to support youth and caring adults\r\n(parents and mentors) can ignite youths' computational making participation. Specifically, this proposal\r\nseeks to create a learning community that uses the computational thinking guided design process to\r\nmotivate and support students in the systemic creation of interactive objects that require the\r\nintegration of coding, digital fabrication, and visual design literacies to produce aesthetically powerful\r\nand socially conscious solutions to student and community defined design challenges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n At the core, this grant was focused on working with an established Evanston community partner, McGaw YMCA to expand access to STEAM learning opportunities within the historic African American Fifth Ward, a community that bore the brunt of the city's school and community desegregation strategies as both the local school and YMCA were closed within 3 years of 1967, creating the present-day integrated school system that many Evanston residents seek.  Though several significance results and developments in the arcs of the work are named above, a few are worth elaborating here. \n \nFirst, we successfully collaborated with our partner to open  a second location of their middle school oriented maker space, MetaMedia., in the Fifth Ward open Monday thru Saturday staffed with a full time  trained STEAM informal educator workforce.  This new location served as a hub of collaboration between several Northwestern learning science faculty and community STEAM educators and organizations.\n \nSecond, our careful documentation of professional development processes has led to a line of research on teacher/educator learning in STEAM rich maker spaces that is poised to contribute key insights to the field through a recent Lucas foundation grant  that will support PI Shirin Vossoughi  in pursuing key questions around educator and teacher learning. \n \nThird,  we developed a unique collaboration between researchers, out-of-school educators and local artists to develop and share the results of our research in the form of pedagogical zines. These zines are available at: https://www.bluedandelion.org/zines and have been widely disseminated to maker-space and other educator and researcher networks.

A number of scholars and educational organizations have reached out to us and expressed interest in developing their own zines, which we hope Blue Dandelion can serve as a platform for supporting and disseminating. \n \nFourth it is important to underscore the deepening of our partnership with the MetaMedia and YMCA educators and directors throughout the timeline of our work.
