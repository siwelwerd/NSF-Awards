 "awd_abstract_narration": "The variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometer (VASE) to be acquired will provide unparalleled thin film characterization capabilities for a host of research projects in the Rochester, NY region. Examples of research projects include the fundamental study of thermophysical properties of polymer thin films deposited by a unique chemical vapor deposition technique, in situ characterization of responsive coatings in biomedical devices, comprehensive characterization of two-dimensional materials for photonic devices, and the study of laser-induced damage in optical coating materials for high power laser applications. Twelve research groups from the University of Rochester, Rochester Institute of Technology, and the Laboratory for Laser Energetics have been identified as users of the VASE tool. To further promote effective utilization of the VASE tool and make it widely accessible resource, it will be installed in a general user facility on the University of Rochester campus. Another key function of the VASE tool is to support student education to prepare them for potential careers in optics, semiconductors and photonics.\r\n\r\nThe proposed spectroscopic ellipsometry will be utilized for thin film materials of varied optical properties. Mueller-matrix ellipsometry measures all 16 elements of the Mueller matrix, which is the most complete description of a medium's response to polarized light. This enables quantitative analysis of samples with complex structure, such as optically anisotropic and depolarizing samples, while retaining standard ellipsometry capabilities, which are sufficient for isotopic, non-depolarizing samples. The specific instrument to be acquired is the RC2 ellipsometer, with additional enhancements to maximize its versatility and to enable multidisciplinary research efforts. They include an auto-translating stage for mapping of patterned surfaces and/or to assess film uniformity, rotational stage to measure anisotropic samples at several angles relative to the incident polarization, liquid cell for dynamic measurements of hydrated (solvated) films, thermal stage to characterize film properties as a function of temperature, environmental cell to measure films in controlled vapor atmospheres, and an electrochemical cell for coupled in situ electrochemical device characterization. The large sample stage and flexible physical configuration of the RC2 ellipsometer will allow future development of custom in situ characterization capabilities, ensuring the broad utility of this instrument in research projects for many years to come.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
