 "awd_abstract_narration": "From the human brain to the electric power grid, scientists and engineers increasingly depend on large-scale computer models to understand, predict, and even control complex dynamical systems. However, these models often reflect the complexity of the systems they represent, and require supercomputers or large computing clusters to run. For many tasks of modern scientific computing, this can represent an impediment. For example, when estimating the values of model parameters based on physical measurements (a critical step in using a model to make predictions), it is necessary to run a model many times. Even with ever-increasing computational power, this may be time-consuming. This project studies computational and mathematical techniques for constructing simpler models that nevertheless capture key features of more complex models, so that tasks like parameter estimation can be done more efficiently. The algorithms resulting from this research are expected to be applicable to a wide range of scientific and engineering problems. This research project is also expected to be a good training vehicle for young scientists in interdisciplinary research.\r\n\r\nIn more detail, this project concerns a discrete-time approach to model reduction for high-dimensional chaotic / noisy dynamical systems. The primary aims are (i) to develop a general mathematical framework for discrete-time model reduction, focusing on enabling both short- to medium-range forecasting as well as reproducing selected long-time statistics; (ii) adapting the general methods to handle specific types of dynamical systems that arise in practice, e.g., chaotic, noisy, etc.; (iii) apply the methodology to model reduction and data-driven modeling problems in specific biological and physical applications. As many dynamical systems of interest in contemporary science and engineering consist of a large number of degrees of freedom interacting across spatial and temporal scales, detailed first-principles models may not provide a practical basis for tasks like uncertainty quantification, parameter / state estimation, and optimization. Moreover, for many such systems, our knowledge of pertinent facts and principles are incomplete. Reduced models that capture the essential dynamics without resolving all degrees of freedom are thus of practical utility. They are also of great interest in their own right, as good reduced models leave out irrelevant details and often contain useful insights into the phenomenon at hand. This project draws on diverse ideas from applied probability, dynamical systems, and statistical physics, and provide ample opportunities for training mathematical scientists for the mastery of these tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nComputational and mathematical models are useful for predicting, understanding, and sometimes even controlling complex systems. For example, computational models of neurons and networks of neurons have shed light on the neurobiological basis of cognition, leading to better understanding of the nervous system in health and in disease. However, computational models often reflect the complexity of their counterpart in the real world, and this complexity means the models can be challenging to develop, maintain, and use. Again turning to neurobiology as an example, even simulating a small patch of the cerebral cortex for seconds to minutes can require hours of computer time on modern workstations. Such examples abound in computational science and engineering, and the complexity and expense of computational models can severely limit their scope and impact.\n\nA measure of the complexity of a model is the number of degrees of freedom it has, i.e., the number of independent dynamical variables required to describe the state of the system. For neurobiological models of interest, this number ranges from hundreds of thousands to millions (or more), whereas for atmospheric modeling the number can be in the millions. The projects supported by this grant concern a class of mathematical and computational techniques aimed at reducing the number of degrees of freedom of computational models while retaining predictive power. The main idea is to construct models that only use those dynamical variables that are directly relevant for the application at hand. For example, in neuroscience applications, one could construct models using only the average activity of groups of cells, rather than try to track the detailed activity of individual neurons.\n\nWhile seemingly straightforward, the dynamics of these relevant variables may depend on variables that are not directly observed. For example, in neuroscience the activity of the brain region of interest (e.g., the visual cortex) may depend on interactions with downstream brain areas that we cannot observe or measure. To construct models using relevant variables alone, the proposed project exploits data from expensive, large-scale simulations to find the optimal predictor of the dynamics of the relevant variables using only the relevant variables and simple mathematical functions thereof. In applications where a scientist or engineer may need to query a model many times, such simplified or \"reduced\" models can be quite useful despite requiring data from a more complex model.\n\nWork supported by the grant has led to a deeper understanding of the advantages and limitations standard and novel algorithms for constructing reduced models. The results have been presented in refereed journals and at scientific meetings. The latter included both specialized meetings in applied & computational mathematics as well as meetings focused on application areas like neuroscience. Directly and indirectly, this grant has also supported the training of 3 PhD students at the University of Arizona.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/14/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: KevinKLin\n"
