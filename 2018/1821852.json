 "awd_abstract_narration": "Direct observation of professionals and communication with them in real-life environments is a beneficial experience for students in engineering fields ranging from aeronautical to chemical and construction engineering. Although in-person site visits can be arranged to achieve this objective, the visits present significant logistical and safety challenges. In addition, financial, legal, and time constraints are inherent in organizing site visits, especially for educational institutions and faculty. One alternative is to use virtual reality to provide students with immersive digital learning experiences that are close to real life, but that do not have the expense and constraints of in-person field trips. In this project, the University of Florida will explore this novel paradigm in construction engineering instruction.  The goal of the project is to teach construction engineering using an immersive digital environment called iVisit, which features virtual human professionals working collaboratively with students on virtual construction sites. \r\n\r\nThis project will provide engineering students with the opportunity to navigate the complex, data-rich environment of a construction site at which they can interact with virtual human professionals, engineering structures, and equipment. Students will observe design challenges and communicate with virtual human professionals to better understand and resolve those challenges. A quasi-experimental and qualitative educational research design will compare the impact of virtual site visits to in-person site visits.  These results are anticipated to generate knowledge about the impact of this immersive virtual environment on student learning, communication, and spatio-temporal skills.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These visits are widely utilized in many STEM fields as they provide a robust method to connect classroom learning to real-world situations and enable student interaction with experts and professionals on the site. Nevertheless, STEM site visits present major logistical and accessibility challenges for educational institutions and instructors, reducing the number of students accessing the benefits of such a technique. Safety concerns, large class sizes, tight class timetables, unavailability of appropriate sites, time and resource limitations, and the support-intensive nature of site visits are some of such challenges. These limitations for site visits further broaden as students regularly need to be transported to impossible spatiotemporal locations. These spatiotemporal issues arise from site visits where it is impossible to place learners in expensive or dangerous learning situations. The limitations for site visits have further broadened recently, as the reality of the COVID-19 public health concerns has forced educators to move to online course delivery quickly, and the majority of site visits have been canceled.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><em>iVisit</em> presents a unique opportunity to transform STEM education by eliminating the critical barriers of site visits. <em>iVisit</em> is a 360-degree immersive digital environment powered by virtual humans to provide an in-depth problem-solving experience and enhance the communication skills of students. In such immersive learning environments, students can easily and repeatedly experience spatiotemporal occasions previously impossible, dangerous, or expensive to visit. The construction domain was used as the <em>iVisit</em> test bed due to its intrinsic spatiotemporal features, multidisciplinary characteristics, and current challenges and limitations.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>iVisit</em> provides collaborative problem-solving in multiuser 360-degree panoramic site visits. </strong>Collaborative problem-solving skills are required from learners in STEM disciplines. However, students in construction disciplines face particular challenges associated with spatial and temporal contexts of the jobsites locations that reduce the opportunities for students to practice these skills. This phase of the project focused on using 360-degree panoramic virtual environments enhanced with virtual humans to produce realistic site visits for practicing collaborative problem-solving opportunities (<em>iVisit-Collaborate,</em>&nbsp;Figure 1). A phenomenological research study was completed to understand the collaborative problem-solving process of student dyads within iVisit-Collaborate. The findings suggest that student collaborative behaviors did not directly result in successful problem-solving. A hierarchical relationship between student problem-solving and collaborative behaviors was observed, indicating that problem-solving behaviors must occur to enable collaborative behaviors. Moreover, it was also observed that instructor scaffolding helped reduce the degrees of freedom in complex problem-solving activities. Finally, it was observed that student discussion engagement supported the creation and maintenance of shared mental models<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>iVisit</em> provides the students with a learning environment where they can practice problem-solving in 360-degree panoramic site visits led by virtual humans. </strong>Construction professionals require to use problem-solving skills to resolve issues on projects.

This phase of the project explored using <em>iVisit,</em>&nbsp;360-degree panoramic site visits supported by virtual humans for learning problem-solving skills within difficult-to-reach construction locations (Figure 2). The effects of <em>iVisit</em> on student problem-solving skills learning were assessed using a comparative evaluation that contrasted paper-based and <em>iVisit</em>-based interventions. Study findings indicate that iVisit effectiveness varied depending on the methodological requirements of each situated activity. <em>iVisit</em> was found to significantly increase the student development of problem-solving skills during activities that require direct observation of site material properties and their spatial relationships. However, no significant differences were detected in enhancing student understanding of abstract knowledge and its relationship with site assemblies. It was also found that students with higher spatial visualization abilities performed better in problem-solving activities.</p>\n<p><strong><em>iVisit </em>provides<em> a</em></strong><strong> virtual field trip experience augmented with conversational virtual humans to produce realistic field trips for students to practice their communication skills </strong>(Figure 3). The conversation scenario supports a two-way communication that simulates interactive conversations between students and professionals on the jobsite. Students can use the knowledge gained from the previous guided scenario to discuss and solve a real-world task through conversations. The results of this phase of the project showed that <em>iVisit-Communicate</em> facilitated communication by allowing students to practice (1) planning a well-crafted message, (2) staying focused on their needs while expressing themselves, and (3) expressing their views in a way that would improve the likelihood of getting their desired outcome. As an indirect indicator of the communication practices, the task performance was significantly improved in terms of accuracy and time by the two-way communication, suggesting that <em>iVisit-Communicate</em> successfully facilitated students' communication practices. Students also provided positive feedback on this system and found <em>iVisit-Communicate</em> field trip a \"challenging, impressive and fun\" learning experience.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/14/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Masoud&nbsp;Gheisari</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1821852/1821852_10574890_1676401143646_iVIsit_Collaborate_Figure--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1821852/1821852_10574890_1676401143646_iVIsit_Collaborate_Figure--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1: iVisit-Collaborate\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1821852/1821852_10574890_1676401143646_iVIsit_Collaborate_Figure--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1: iVisit-Collaborate\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">iVisit-Collaborate uses 360-degree panoramic virtual environments enhanced with virtual humans to produce realistic site visits for practicing collaborative problem-solving opportunities</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ricardo Eiris</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Masoud&nbsp;Gheisari</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1: iVisit-Collaborate</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1821852/1821852_10574890_1676402342316_iVisit_Problem_Solving_Figure--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1821852/1821852_10574890_1676402342316_iVisit_Problem_Solving_Figure--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2: iVisit for problem-solving\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1821852/1821852_10574890_1676402342316_iVisit_Problem_Solving_Figure--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2: iVisit for problem-solving\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">iVisit provides 360-degree panoramic site visits supported by virtual humans for learning problem-solving skills within difficult-to-reach construction locations</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ricardo Eiris</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Masoud&nbsp;Gheisari</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2: iVisit for problem-solving</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1821852/1821852_10574890_1676402390124_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1821852/1821852_10574890_1676402390124_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3: iVisit-Communicate\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1821852/1821852_10574890_1676402390124_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3: iVisit-Communicate\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">iVisit provides a virtual field trip experience augmented with conversational virtual humans to produce realistic field trips for students to practice their communication skills</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jing Wen</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Masoud&nbsp;Gheisari</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3: iVisit-Communicate</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
