 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal provides travel support for students from educational institutions in the United States to attend the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Week 2018 in Porto, Portugal, from 10-13 April 2018. CPS Week is an annual international multi-conference event for the cyber-physical systems researchers. It is the premier event for the global CPS research community where the latest advances in theory and applications are discussed. This year the week-long event hosts four major multi-day conferences, twelve one-day workshops, five one-day tutorials, and three CPS competitions. \r\n\r\nCPS is an active and dynamic research area that is rapidly growing. This proposal provides travel for U.S. students to attend CPS Week, which provides a unique opportunity for the students to learn about the state of the science and technology in CPS research.  They have the opportunity to attend keynote lectures and presentations, discuss posters with the authors, see demonstrations of advanced CPS technologies and, generally, engage with CPS researcher leaders in academia, industry and government.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
