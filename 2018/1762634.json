 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cells move in a complex three-dimensional environment composed of fibrous proteins.  A first step for a cell in choosing a direction to move is to sense its environment by tugging at the fibers.  This starts what is called 'cell contractility.'  How contractility is achieved on fibers of varying diameters distributed randomly or in specific patterns, in normal or diseased tissues, is mostly unknown. Understanding the first sensory interactions between a cell and a contacted fiber is important to how cells invade a fibrous tissue, such as when cancer cells leave a tumor, or in directed migration of cells on fibers towards a wound site. Most of what we know about cell migration stems from classical studies conducted on 2D flat substrates or, more recently, using complex gels.  Neither approach allows the studying of cell-fiber interactions.  This research will address the need to quantify cell-fiber interactions to understand cell migration during wound healing and disease. In this collaborative research, by combining state-of-art technologies in nanofiber manufacturing, cell signaling biosensors, and cell mechanics, we will be able to see inside the cell and determine the decision mechanisms that help cells migrate along fibers.   The PI will work with faculty at a local community college to train them in the laboratory so that they can develop educational materials.  This will create research opportunities for community college students.\r\n\r\nThis project will define the mechanobiological state of a cell as it interacts with fibers. Specifically, we will reveal RhoGTPase signaling (RhoA, Rac1, and CdC42) as cells form protrusions and migrate on fibers. The interplay, localization, and summation of these molecules at specific regions of the cell define the mode of migration, which has been shown to be different in 2 and 3D. To determine the activity maps of these proteins in cells on fibers, we will design fiber networks of varying diameters (nanometers-microns) distributed in aligned and random configurations signifying pro- and anti-invasive conditions. In doing so, we will be able to pinpoint spatial and temporal activation maps of RhoGTPase's as cells tug and exert forces on fibers. The mechanobiological force quantitation-biosensor activation will develop new knowledge in the plasticity of cell migration to changing fibrous environments, as would be encountered in vivo. Linking adhesion receptor-based signaling spanning a wide range of spatial (nanometers-microns) and temporal (seconds-hours) scales with migration and force modulation will provide new knowledge in invasion-driven cell migration, thus opening new directions in drug discovery and development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Interestingly we found that the&nbsp;<em>coiling width&nbsp;</em>and the length of protrusions increased with cancer cell invasiveness (<em>Molecular Biology of Cell, 2022</em>). Since protrusions are precursors to migration and their size and shape depend upon fiber diameter, we discovered that the rules of contact inhibition of locomotion were different from those observed on flat 2D (<em>Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences, 2021</em>). We then investigated how cells used protrusions to spread on fibers of varying diameters. In doing so, we established that the length of focal adhesion clusters by which cells adhered to fibers increased with fiber diameter, concomitant with an increase in the tension-bearing actin stress fibers inside the cell body. Thus, as cells spread, we found that they exerted forces, which increased with the fiber diameter, causing a higher compression on the nucleus. Interestingly, we discovered that the sites of cell-fiber contact caused deep invaginations in the nucleus that were enriched with heterochromatin (<em>Advanced Science, 2022</em>). In parallel, we found that cells spread on fibers had a high degree of heterochromatin clustering at the edges (<em>ACS Nano, 2022</em>). Since cells were forming protrusions and stretching on fibers, we inquired about the underlying bioenergetics required to drive these processes. Unexpectedly, we found that cell migration depended upon glycolic ATP, while cell forces did not change upon the reduction of ATP (<em>American Journal of Physiology, 2019</em>). While protrusions are studied in the direction of cell migration, we discovered a new class of force-exerting lateral protrusions termed ?perpendicular lateral protrusions (PLPs).? We observed that cells formed the force exerting protrusions in aligned fiber configurations and contributed to the remodeling of the ECM networks (<em>Communications Biology, 2020</em>). Inspired by the formation of long protrusions, we inquired about the stability of protrusions on fibers of varying architectures. We found that cytoplasmic protrusions enriched in focal adhesions and cytoskeleton elements were cleaved and deposited on fibers by migrating cells. Interestingly, the fragments were motile with oscillatory behavior (<em>Advanced Biology 2021</em>). Since cells were forming long filamentous protrusions, we inquired if neighboring cells formed physical connections between themselves. We identified tunneling nanotube structures and observed cargo transfer between two adjacent cells (<em>Cancers, 2022</em>). Building on our knowledge of how protrusions were formed on various fiber networks, we inquired about the molecular underpinning of protrusion formation by interrogating the role of curvature sensing IRSp53 protein. We found that removing IRSp53 caused a reduction in actin retrograde flow, which led to a loss of protrusion formation and&nbsp;<em>coiling,&nbsp;</em>ultimately leading to a loss of cell contractility and altered 1D migration (<em>Advanced Science, 2023</em>).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Developing the knowledge of how cells interacted with fibers, we extended the studies to interrogate how cells are held in place from the adhesion sites.

We reported the first-ever measurement of forces as cells underwent electroporation and correlated the forces with changes in the actin-cytoskeleton.
