 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Planning Grants for Engineering Research Centers competition was run as a pilot solicitation within the ERC program.  Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research.\r\n\r\nThe overarching vision of the WiPOWER ERC is to create a \"Cordless World\" by providing static and dynamic power charging technologies for transportation vehicles, devices in homes and hospitals, and devices on/in the human body. Research thrusts within the center will investigate foundational technologies required for wireless, tether-free power for daily use devices. Recent advances accomplished in tunable electronic design offer the opportunity to develop wireless power transfer (WPT) topologies with the potential to meet the necessary efficiency, power, function and distance requirements for widespread implementation. These advances include tunable passive elements (e.g., capacitors, transformers, and inductors), metamaterial based enhanced coupling and routing of wireless power, broad bandwidth current sensors and circuit architectures that exploit tunability, as well as high-efficiency active components (switches, filters). Utilizing these tunable electronics based topologies, wearable devices and sensors (such as a blood glucose monitor and an insulin pump) can be powered through RF wireless power transmission when the wearer is inside a house/hospital or in its vicinity. The team will investigate approaches such as a phase array to direct the power-carrying RF beam toward one or multiple wearable devices/sensors. Common electronic devices in the home and offices will be able to operate without cords and plugs. The proposed wireless power infrastructure will also enable the coming electric and autonomous vehicle revolution by providing parked charging and dynamic moving charging technology that meet the high efficiency, safety and reliability requirements. The workshops organized during the planning phase will consider how to best coordinate with the industrial, educational and entrepreneurial community on integrating WPT technology to serve the community at large. The WiPOWER ERC planning team will engage with broader impacts stakeholders during the workshops to develop diversity and inclusion plan, technology roadmaps and workforce development for the center.  Planning phase will leverage that experience by including representatives from the participating institutions broader impacts community and beyond. The workshops organized during the planning phase will consider how to best coordinate with the industrial, educational and entrepreneurial community on integrating WPT technology to serve the community at large. The WiPOWER ERC planning team will engage with broader impacts stakeholders during the workshops to develop strategic objectives and milestones for the center.\r\n\r\nCombination of active and passive components operating at different power levels are required in order to implement WPT systems. Each component has its own set of performance metrics, operational guidelines, testing standard and pricing strategy. Complete understanding of these variables for all the components needed for WPT systems is an essential part of the investigations to be conducted during the planning phase. Reliability and accelerated lifetime testing protocols will be established to ensure robust deployment in dynamic charging conditions. During the planning phase, the goal will be to utilize workshops, industrial visits, conference calls, and exchange programs to develop a consistent summary of the current technology status, technology barriers, intellectual property, industrial roadmaps, regulations and standards, and commercialization partners. One of the emphasis areas in this investigation will be passive components with added-tunability that have adaptability to different circuit operating conditions. Tunable capacitors and inductors will help a critical challenge in WPT - the loss of received power as the gap between transmitting and receiving coils/plates increases or the coils/plates are misaligned. In addition to low-loss tunable passive components, state-of-the-art in the area of high-efficiency power transmitter and receiver active components will be investigated to achieve cost-effective high-efficiency WPT. Advanced circuit designs using wide bandgap semiconductors, such as GaN and SiC, will be identified through extensive interactions with industry partners. Commercialization pathways for ultra-low power applications requiring specialized low-power IC designs in SOI and in CMOS will be identified and incorporated in the targeted testbeds. High power, efficient, and long-life battery systems integrated with WPT will be identified to provide opportunities to bridge the gaps between charging events. Together these investigations will advance an ERC designed to support the foundational requirements around research, engineering workforce development, diversity and a culture of inclusion, and an innovation ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Over the course of the program, the team pivoted from mobility related challenges towards addressing impactful societal issues and ongoing challenges, while ensuring convergence research that seamlessly integrates experts from wide range of disciplines.

Through hybrid workshops, site visits, and extensive discussions with stakeholders from academia, industry, and government, it became clear to us that in the next decade human &ndash; robot relationship will continue to evolve and become more integrated in our daily lives. As an example, the society has become used to autonomous vehicles, robotic vacuum cleaners, robotic kitchenware&rsquo;s, automated lawn mowers, robotic tools in hospitals, etc. However, this is still at the very basic level of human - robot relationship. The participants in the discussion indicated that automation and robotics would continue to merge in our lives becoming our companions. During COVID, it became obvious that there is significant need for robots in taking care of elderly persons and people with disabilities. Robots could also serve as interactive educational tools in the classrooms. A hybrid workshop was held in Arlington, VA, on July 13 -14, 2022, to discuss these ideas. The goal of the workshop was to understand the progress made in design and development of human-like robots and identify the research challenges that remain to be addressed. The workshop addressed topics such as power sources for the robots, wireless power transfer methods, sensors, intelligent sensitive skin materials, human body forming and manufacturing techniques, muscle-quality actuators, human-like fluidic motions, neuromorphic computing architectures, imitation learning and adaptation techniques, emotion and affect, and interaction paradigms for suspension of disbelief. Electrical power for the robot was a focus area during the discussions as this could become limiting factor in their deployment in outdoor conditions. For example, a robot assisting an elderly person in crossing the street. Following the workshop, the team assembled the center concept that will build the research program and parallel ecosystem to realize labor-augmenting robots that will assist with the predictable, and repeatable jobs in cooperation with skilled healthcare workers. This new generation of robot helpers will consider pain and emotional state while they take on such tasks as lifting and transferring a patient from a bed to a stretcher or chair. These robotic assistants can provide transformative impact in lives of elderly persons and people with disabilities. Further, the robotic tutors can have big impact on the learning abilities of children that do not have access to the best infrastructure.

Working with the educational partners and industry boards, the center will design demonstrations that can be used to attract young students for pursing higher education in STEM related fields and to apply their skills to societal benefits.
