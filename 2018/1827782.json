 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this PFI project includes advancing the knowledge of utilizing antifreeze polypeptide (AFP)-based systems (AFPs and enhancers) in organ preservation, expediting the technology translation process leading to the commercial application of AFP-based systems in organ preservation, and extending the viability of postharvest tissues and organs during organ/tissue transplantation. The broader impacts also include expanding participation of individuals from underrepresented groups in STEM and preparing students for entrepreneurship. Organs are scarce resources because of the gap between the organs needed and those available. Additionally, the short time span of the available organs in current organ preservation solutions limits the number of organs can be transported and transplanted into patients and which people can be considered for the organs further aggravating organ shortage and lowering organ transplantation success rates. The composition of the preservation solutions is crucial for the lifespan of the preserved organs. AFP-based systems have the potential to preserve cells, tissues, organs for a longer period outside the body and thus could provide valuable data and reduce the costs in various areas including organ/tissue transplantation, biomedical research and drug discovery. This project focuses on translating AFP-based systems for organ preservation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed project addresses the key technology and knowledge gaps as it translates from research discovery towards commercial application. Based on the characteristics of AFP-based systems including highly effectiveness, compatibility to existing solutions, and multifunction, AFP-based systems could be a potential advanced technology for cells, tissues, and organs preservation. However, significant technology and knowledge gaps hinder the technology translation. In this PFI project, a multidisciplinary team will validate the proposed technology and fill the knowledge gaps of highly active AFPs in the AFP-based systems towards the technology translation and commercialization. In particular, the potency of AFP-based systems in cold preservation will be systematically validated for pancreatic cells, tissues, and organs. Moreover, toxicity profiles of the key ingredients in AFP-based systems, that is highly active AFPs, will be established on representative mammalian cell lines. Furthermore, a scalable approach for preparing the potent AFPs will be developed. In addition, the students (esp. women and individuals from underrepresented groups) will receive training on innovation, entrepreneurship, and the process of research translation, technology development and commercialization as well as guidance for advancing the commercial potential of research through advising and participating innovation and entrepreneurship workshops/seminars.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
