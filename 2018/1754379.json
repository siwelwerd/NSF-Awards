 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is great concern about changing conditions in the Arctic due to environmental transformations that are impacting tundra and its underlying permafrost. At the same time there are major gaps in our understanding of tundra/permafrost microbiology and elemental cycling. Filling these knowledge gaps will enable a better overall understanding of the tundra, and can provide crucial information about how this globally important, but fragile ecosystem will respond to change. The particular knowledge gap this research will fill centers around iron and the bacteria that control its availability. Iron is an essential micro-nutrient for animals, plants, and microbes. It also serves as a growth substrate for certain groups of bacteria, many of which fix carbon dioxide to grow. Some of these bacteria directly compete with other groups of microbes that produce or consume methane, the atmospheric concentration of which is continuing to increase. It is particularly important to understand the dynamics of carbon dioxide and methane in the Arctic because there is a large amount of organic carbon stored in permafrost that could be converted into these two gases. The research team consists of a microbial ecologist with considerable experience in iron cycling bacteria; a mathematical modeler who will quantify the relative impacts of different microbial processes, and a tundra ecologist with extensive experience in elemental cycling in permafrost environments.  This project will, for the first time, systematically characterize and quantify microbial communities responsible for iron cycling in the tundra/permafrost of Alaska?s North Slope, and increase our understanding of how these microbes interact with the carbon cycle by suppressing methane production. \r\n\r\nThe basic supposition of this research is that conditions in the Arctic are beneficial to an active iron cycle because the shallow depth permafrost prevents ferrous iron-laden waters from percolating into deep aquifers (a common route for iron removal from temperate ecosystems). Furthermore, cool water temperatures slow the chemical oxidation of iron, and a short, but intense growing season provides a source of labile carbon that helps fuel iron reduction. These ideas will be tested by conducting field and laboratory studies at the Toolik Field Station on the North Slope of Alaska. Previous work has revealed there are extensive populations of iron-oxidizing and iron-reducing bacteria associated with microbial iron mats in this region, but in general, little is known about their diversity or function. This work will utilize cultivation-independent, amplicon-based community analysis and metagenomics to further characterize community diversity and function among these chemosynthetic communities. The team will measure methane production at tundra sites with high rates of iron cycling and compare these to sites that are similar in terms of hydrology and landform, but have lower rates of iron-cycling to assess the direct impact of the iron cycle on methane production and consumption. The microbiomes of these sites will also be compared using molecular analysis. In addition to these field measurements, the researchers will construct a laboratory microcosm that can be seeded with soils and microbial iron mats collected from Toolik. This will allow controlled conditions to simulate interactions of the iron and methane cycles under conditions where key parameters such as iron and oxygen concentrations can be controlled. From both field and laboratory data a reaction-based model will be developed using a series of kinetic equations. These will form the basis for a predictive model that can estimate the suppressive effects of iron cycling on methane production. In terms of broader impacts, the work will provide unique opportunities for training undergraduate, and graduate students, as well as a postdoctoral researcher, in combining field, laboratory, and modelling based science to fill an important gap in our knowledge of the tundra ecosystem. To broaden public outreach two artists will be engaged to create a unique art-science dialog that will broaden the interpretation of the project results, and provide museum quality creative work that can be displayed in either science or art exhibits.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We assumed that the low concentration of phosphorus in these streams was caused by strong coupling of phosphorus production in tundra soils with high demand for phosphorus by tundra vegetation, so that little phosphorus was available to migrate to streams. However, it is not clear that tundra vegetation uses all the soil phosphorus available to it. We demonstrate that abundant concentrations of iron and aluminum create a substantial biogeochemical sink for phosphorus that sequesters P in forms that limit migration from the tundra to adjacent water bodies. We used two recently published pan-Arctic databases to infer that similar conditions may prevail in many other parts of the Arctic. We conclude that this biogeochemical control of phosphorus migration to headwater streams could be an important factor limiting primary production and therefore carbon processing in headwater streams in much of the Arctic, a finding that should be considered in regional and global models.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Background</span></p>\r\n<p>The role of iron as a potential control on the mobility of phosphate (SRP) is well known in limnology, where the interaction between these two solutes in surficial sediments has been a subject of research on the vertical migration of phosphate from sediments to overlying water, for nearly 100 years.&nbsp; However, until recently, there has been relatively little attention to how these same interactions might influence the lateral migration of phosphate from tundra to headwater streams and rivers in the Arctic.&nbsp; This is important because we have previously established the low levels of phosphorus are likely to be the most important control (the limiting nutrient) on primary production in the Kuparuk River on the North Slope of Alaska. At the beginning of the Kuparuk River Long-Term experiment in the early 1980?s we hypothesized that as climate change warmed the Arctic region, thawing permafrost would release quantities of phosphorus that would exceed plant demand, and that the excess would migrate laterally to streams where it would significantly alter the food webs and trophic dynamics of Arctic stream ecosystems. Indeed, the Kuparuk River Long-Term phosphorus enrichment experiment was designed to study the effects of elevated phosphate levels in this river. Publications from this experiment have summarized results that show conclusively how an imposed release from phosphorus limitation significantly increases primary production and alters the community composition of primary producers and secondary consumers.&nbsp; However, more recently we published data to show that while some nutrients (specifically nitrate and ammonium) have increased as the permafrost has thawed, phosphate has not and remains at near detection limits while total dissolved phosphorus concentrations have significantly declined. It has long been known that iron is abundant in tundra soils, constrained from migrating to deeper groundwater by the barrier imposed by permafrost. In this study, we showed that geochemical sequestration of phosphate by iron oxides supplements vegetation demand for this nutrient to effectively block lateral migration of phosphate to the Kuparuk River. While future thawing of permafrost will release more phosphate, it will also release more iron and aluminum, which will continue to interact with and sequester phosphate in this watershed. We then used a recent, public database of Arctic soil properties to show that these conditions may be widespread in the pan-Arctic region. This is a fundamentally different view of the likely impacts of permafrost thaw on Arctic streams and rivers and their role in nutrient and carbon transport and transformation. If control of phosphate migration to streams in rivers by geochemical sorption in the tundra is widespread in the Arctic, then it may affect approaches to research in Arctic stream ecology, estimates of riverine transport of solutes to the Arctic Ocean, and regional to global system modeling.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Key Points</span></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Tundra      soils in our study area have a high capacity to biogeochemically sequester      and limit lateral migration of phosphorus.</li>\r\n<li>This      biogeochemical sequestration likely explains low phosphorus concentrations      in adjacent streams, which limits stream primary production.</li>\r\n<li>Using      published data, we show that similar interactions may occur widely in the      Arctic and may persist as permafrost continues to thaw.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Take home message</span></p>\r\n<p>This project sheds light on an important interaction in the Arctic that has been overlooked and that could be important in projecting the effects of future climate warming on permafrost-dominated aquatic ecosystems.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 02/28/2025<br>\nModified by: William&nbsp;Breck&nbsp;Bowden</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1754379/1754379_10569947_1740758577663_Slide1--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1754379/1754379_10569947_1740758577663_Slide1--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Iron-Phosphorus Interactions\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1754379/1754379_10569947_1740758577663_Slide1--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Iron-Phosphorus Interactions\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Recent studies have shown that reactive iron secondary minerals may play an important role in regulating the availability of P.
