 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the direct detection of Gravitational Waves (GWs) in Advanced LIGO's first and second observing runs, the era of Gravitational Wave Astronomy is upon us.  Gravitational waves, distortions of the geometry and space and time predicted by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, provide a new window on the universe, allowing us to supplement the range of information available from different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum and from cosmic ray and neutrino observations. The GW signals observed so far have been short-lived, and from the final stages of black holes and neutron stats orbiting into one another.  This project is aimed at detection of long-lived GWs from rapidly spinning neutron stars, extremely dense objects more massive than the Sun and the size of a city, spinning tens to hundreds of times every second.  The main targets for this search are neutron stars in binary orbits with lower-mass stars.  The neutron stars attract material from their companions, which powers their rotation and emits X-rays, allowing a multimessenger analysis.\r\n\r\nThis project will involve faculty and students of the Rochester Institute of Technology, who will broaden the multimessenger effort to search for GWs from low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) in several ways: 1) ensuring the search for Scorpius X-1, the brightest LMXB, is as sensitive as possible with algorithmic improvements and mock data validation, 2) expanding the search to other LMXBs, and 3) implementing a hierarchical followup to existing searches for unknown neutron stars in binary systems.  The group will also enhance the sensitivity of a variety of continuous-wave searches by incorporating an improved detection statistic into the LSC algorithm library.  The search for the Sco X-1, as well as accreting binaries J1751-305, Cygnus X-3, and 4U 1636-536, is considered a highest priority by the LIGO scientific collaboration, and this award will be instrumental in maximizing its success.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goals of this project were to improve and apply methods to search for gravitational waves (GWs, distortions of spacetime, travelling at the speed of light, which are predicted by Einstein's General Relativity) with advanced gravitational wave detectors.  The third observing run (O3) of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors was conducted from April 2019 to March 2020, and led to numerous observational results from searches for a variety of astrophysical sources.\n\nImportant outcomes of the award:\n\nA major objective of the project was the search for gravitational waves from a spinning neutron star in a low-mass X-ray binary system, specifically Scorpius X-1.  (The gravitational waves in this case come not from the orbit of the neutron star, but from the fact that it's deformed and spinning.)  This is one of the most promising continuous GW sources, with a predicted signal strength that may be within the reach of advanced detectors.\n\nGraduate student Jared Wofford and PI John Whelan led a search for GWs from Sco X-1 in LIGO O3 data.  The sensitivity of this search for the first time reached the important benchmark of the inclination-averaged torque balance model.  The upper limits set by the search begin to constrain possible models of the accretion of matter onto the neutron star in Sco X-1.\n\nIn order to carry out the search efficiently, graduate student Katelyn Wagner, together with Whelan, Wofford and a collaborator in Australia, implemented an improved template placement scheme.  This more efficiently chose sets of values for the unknown parameters of the binary system (especially orbital period and phase), and allowed a sensitive search to be done with fewer computing resources than the older method.  This work was begun under PI Whelan's supervision as part of a Research Experience for Undergraduates program in Multi-Messenger Astrophysics, and continued as Wagner's Master's project.\n\nIn addition, a paper was brought to publication in the first year of the project which demonstrated an effective approximation for a detection statistic for continuous waves.  This work was carried out by prior master's student John J. Bero under the supervision of PI Whelan.\n\nBroader impacts of the award included career development for graduate students Wofford (who visited Goethe University Frankfurt along with PI Whelan) and Wagner.  Gravitational wave science was also disseminated both at institutions beyond the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and at international conferences.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/28/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John T Whelan"
