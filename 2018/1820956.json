 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop a 5-year strategic plan for the use of the William C. Webb Coastal Research Station, a newly-established biological field station operated by the University of North Florida (UNF) in Jacksonville, FL. The Webb Station is a 1,050-acre parcel of undeveloped salt marsh habitat located on the eastern side of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway between Jacksonville and St. Augustine, FL. As much of the world observed while watching cable news footage of Hurricane Irma in September 2017, Jacksonville, like many U.S. coastal cities, faces significant threats from coastal flooding due to the combined effects of extreme weather events, sea level rise, and other coastal stressors. The intended purpose of the Webb Center is to use this \"living laboratory\" as a location for testing new approaches for reducing coastal flooding and making shoreline communities more \"resilient\" to its effects. This will be accomplished by teaming UNF Coastal and Marine Biologists with Coastal Engineers from the University's Taylor Engineering Research Institute to establish a world-class research program in newly-growing field of Coastal Resilience. In addition to spearheading new efforts to reduce coastal flooding, the Webb Center will also be heavily involved in educating students at all grade levels and members of the general public about its risks which, based on an April 2017 report by the U.S. Geological Survey, are believed to threaten the survival of nearly a quarter of the world?s population.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this FSML planning grant is to support the development of a 5-year strategic plan for the research and educational use of the station. To accomplish the goal of this project, the University proposes to: conduct faculty site visits to 4 currently operating coastal research stations to identify potential desirable features for the Webb station and learn about \"best practices\" for the operation of a successful biological field station; host survey visits by 4 external scientists experienced in the management of biological field stations to obtain their expert assistance in identifying infrastructure needs and operational/management requirements, potential research and educational programs, and unique features of the Webb Station that could potentially set it apart from other coastal research stations; and establish an Advisory Board consisting of UNF faculty and administrators and representatives from other regional colleges and universities, local informal science education facilities, community groups, K-12 schools, city/state/federal policymakers, and other agencies involved in coastal research, engineering, and conservation to guide the development of a 5-year strategic plan, making use of information obtained from faculty site visits and visiting expert recommendations. Proposed activities for the Webb Station will advance understanding and discovery in the field of coastal biology and engineering while promoting the education and career development of future coastal science professionals and the development of a more Ocean-literate community. More about UNF Coastal and Marine Biology Flagship Program, which oversees the development of the Webb Center, can be viewed at: https://www.unf.edu/coas/biology/coastal_biology/about.aspx\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The Station comprises 1,050 acres of largely undeveloped salt marsh wetlands situated on the eastern bank of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, located approximately 5 miles from the University?s main campus in Jacksonville, FL. To accomplish the goals of this project, UNF faculty conducted site visits to four southeast U.S. field stations involved in marine science research and education: Coastal Carolina University?s Anne Tilghman Boyce Coastal Reserve (Waties Island, SC), the University of South Carolina?s Belle W. Baruch Institute for Marine and Coastal Sciences (Georgetown, SC), the University of Georgia?s Marine Institute on Sapelo Island (Sapelo Island, GA), and the University of Florida?s Nature Coast Biological Field Station (Cedar Key, FL). The purpose of these visits was to learn about ?best practices? for developing an effective field station and based on these findings, generate a plan for the short-term and long-term use of the Webb Research Station. A general assessment of the attributes of the station led the department to conclude that it was best suited to host research and educational activities focused on the natural and anthropogenic stressors leading to shoreline loss and coastal flooding with the intent of helping local communities learn to become more resilient to these changes. The UNF Coastal and Marine Biology Program conducted a self-assessment of the program?s ability to develop a meaningful program in this field using a traditional SWOT approach, which identifies an institution?s <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">S</span>trengths, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">W</span>eaknesses, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">O</span>pportunities, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">T</span>hreats that may influence its ability to achieve a particular set of goals. It was concluded that while the station is well suited for use in coastal resilience research and education and the University has clear strengths in coastal biology and engineering, that additional faculty that work more directly in the field of costal resilience are needed to spearhead expanded use of the station. Furthermore, it was concluded that while the proximity of the site to UNF is convenient, that additional resources are needed to improve access to the site and promote more active use in research and education. Last, the establishment of stronger ties to regional and statewide agencies involved in coastal resilience, as well as community partners in K-12 education, was recommended. Based on these findings, the University set a series of achievable short-term goals for establishing a burgeoning program in coastal resilience, including semi-targeted searches for new faculty with expertise in coastal resilience and the purchase of large-capacity research vessels that can be berthed at sites with quick access to the station. Some of these short-term goals have already been addressed and will contribute significantly to our long-term goal; that is, to develop a well-supported, productive, and well-respected program in coastal resilience at the station.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/29/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: James&nbsp;J&nbsp;Gelsleichter</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
