 "awd_abstract_narration": "This astronomy project will produce a \"3-dimensional\" map of the center of the Milky Way Galaxy. The team will develop a catalogue of gas and dust clouds for use by other scientists.  Infrared data from the Herschel space telescope will be combined with radio observations from the APEX telescope in Chile and the MOPRA telescope in Australia. By observing radiation from warm dust and from molecules like formaldehyde, methanol, and silicon monoxide, the team will reveal the 3-D shapes, sizes, and distances of the clouds.  The data will be compared to models of star formation to investigate how stars are born near the center of our Milky Way galaxy. The center of the Milky Way, known as the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), is complicated and difficult to observe.  The telescopes being used, which operate at infrared and radio wavelengths, are very well suited to this project.  By comparison, optical telescopes struggle to see through the gas and dust that blocks our view of the CMZ.  The CMZ includes the supermassive black hole at the heart of our galaxy, and intriguing objects like \"the brick\", a dense cloud that has yet to create any stars, and \"the three little pigs\", a row of three clumps on the verge of star birth. Understanding the CMZ is of great importance to models of the galaxy, and to theories of star birth in dense clouds.\r\n\r\nA postdoctoral researcher will be involved in this important and exciting project.  The catalogue of clouds in the CMZ will be posted on an easy-to-use website. The team will also produce a custom lesson plan on the CMZ and a \"WorldWide Telescope\" (WWT) tour of our Galaxy's center. The lesson plan will be developed as part of the \"BiteScis\" program, which is led by this project's Principle Investigator (PI) and by a Boston Science Teacher. The lessons are designed to relate to curriculum standards, are tested in a local K-12 classroom, and are shared with other teachers through the BiteScis website. The WWT, a project hosted by the American Astronomical Society, will extend the reach of the CMZ survey beyond the K-12 classroom. The PI has served as an ambassador to the WWT for a number of years and is committed to including her survey data in the WWT.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The center of our Galaxy (known as the Central Molecular Zone, CMZ) is a hub of activity, where gas flows, star formation, and a supermassive black hole intersect. Mapping this region has presented particular observational and theoretical challenges. By combining data across the electromagnetic spectrum with cutting-edge numerical simulations, researchers at the University of Connecticut (supported by NSF Grant 1816715) have produced the first, comprehensive 3-D map of our Galaxy&rsquo;s Center, the CMZ.</p>\n<p>While astronomers have spent years mapping the far reaches of the cosmos, the true 3-D structure of our closest Galactic nucleus, the CMZ, has remained elusive. This is largely due to our position within the Galactic disk, where the CMZ is heavily obscured by dust extinction with complex kinematics. While simulations suggested three possible 3-D models for the CMZ, previous work was not able to &ldquo;see the forest for the trees&rdquo; and uncover its true 3-D structure. By combining long-wavelength data which pierces through the cosmic dust, kinematic surveys, and measures of dust extinction, researchers at the University of Connecticut cataloged CMZ clouds and assigned a likelihood that each was on in front of the CMZ (from our perspective) or behind it. Researchers compared their 3-D (position-position-velocity) likelihood map with the three prevailing theoretical models and one model newly developed by the researchers. Two existing models are ruled out. While the other existing models is a plausible fit to the data, the new model developed by the researchers is simpler, more accurate, and agrees with the cutting-edge numerical simulations, and is now our current best 3-D model of our Galaxy&rsquo;s Center.</p>\n<p>The 3-D CMZ map is expected to have broad and important ramifications in a number of areas of astrophysics. This map is relevant for studies of extreme star formation, x-ray studies of previous flaring events from our central supermassive black hole, and for physicists studying dark matter annihilation in the Galactic Center.
