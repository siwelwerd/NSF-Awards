 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is about the evolution of cell division and will have broader significance in several ways.  First, it will help to counter the excessive focus of research in cell and molecular biology on the animals, fungi, and land plants.  There is an enormous amount to be learned about the huge diversity of other interesting cell types, many of which are also ecologically and/or economically important.  Second, it will provide Chlamydomonas researchers not only with new biological insights but also with valuable research tools, such as improved methods for regulated transgene expression and synchronization of cell division.  These tools should be of value not only for basic research but also for biotechnology, particularly in the biofuels industry, which in turn could have benefits for fuel supplies and environmental conservation.  Third, it will support the research career of a very talented young scientist and help him to progress into an independent academic position.  Finally, it will help to support the involvement of undergraduates, high-school students, and public-school teachers in research, with special emphasis on the teachers because of the large numbers of students that they themselves then go on to teach.  Nearly all previously hosted students (including many from underrepresented groups) have gone on in STEM fields, and the teachers have all carried ideas and materials from the laboratory back to their classrooms.  These patterns should continue under the current project.\r\n\r\nThis project will exploit the evolutionary position and experimental advantages of the green alga Chlamydomonas to elucidate the still-obscure core mechanisms of cytokinesis, the final step in cell division.  The focus is on how cells can form division furrows in the absence of a \"contractile actomyosin ring\" (CAR).  The CAR is found in animals and fungi and is composed of actin filaments, type II myosin, and other proteins.  It has long been thought to provide the force for furrow ingression via an actin-myosin interaction like that in muscle.  However, many cells that normally have a CAR can divide without it, as can the vast number of cell types (such as Chlamydomonas) that form furrows but have no type II myosin; thus, there must be another driver(s) of furrowing.  To elucidate these mechanisms, several related aims will be pursued.  First, a combination of microscopic, biochemical, pharmacological, and genetic methods will be used to analyze the possible roles of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons.  Second, a similar combination of methods will be used to explore the possibility that the primary driver of furrow formation is localized growth of the plasma membrane and extracellular matrix.  Third, unbiased and targeted genetic screens will seek mutants with specific defects in cytokinesis; characterization of these mutants should help to reveal the underlying mechanisms that drive furrow formation.  These studies should help to elucidate both the shared mechanisms underlying the seemingly diverse modes of cytokinesis in modern organisms and the evolution of these modern mechanisms from those of ancestral cells.  Several lines of evidence suggest that the ancestral and still-core mechanism of cytokinesis is the localized deposition of new cell membrane and extracellular matrix, and that the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons play auxiliary roles in this process.  Chlamydomonas is an attractive system in which to investigate these issues.  It is evolutionarily distant from the organisms on which cytokinesis studies have previously focused; divides by furrow formation but does not have a type II myosin; has one conventional actin, one unconventional actin, and a well developed microtubule cytoskeleton; displays an enrichment of both actin and microtubules around the cleavage furrow; and has many genetic tools already available.  Its mechanisms of cytokinesis have hardly been studied, and elucidating them should contribute to a needed paradigm shift in the cytokinesis field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
