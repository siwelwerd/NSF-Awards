 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support early career researcher attendance at the 19th conference on Ciliate Molecular Biology, which will be at the American University campus in Washington D.C. on July 17-22 of 2018. The format of the meeting is a combination of talks and posters, which will promote scientific exchange in both formal and informal settings.  One session is devoted to undergraduate research talks and another session is devoted to the integration of ciliate research and teaching.  A workshop between sessions focuses on the professional development and mentoring of early career scientists.  There will be ample opportunity for sharing the latest research results and for networking.\r\n\r\nThe conference participants use ciliates as models to investigate diverse questions in cell biology, molecular evolution, structural biology and nucleic acid biochemistry.  The structure of the meeting provides both breadth and depth to the scientific communications. The objectives of the conference are the following: (1) support and mentor early career scientist; (2) encourage interdisciplinary research; (3) integrate research and education focused science; (4) develop and share technical innovations; (5) develop community resources.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
