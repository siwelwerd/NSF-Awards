 "awd_abstract_narration": "Paleoceanographic records provide a unique opportunity to understand how ecosystems have responded to rapid environmental change in the past, a topic of significant societal and scientific interest.  This project will document ecological changes in nearshore environments over the past several thousand years in Southern California, including investigation of impacts of both past and modern climate change. This work is of particular importance because these coastal ecosystems play critical roles in carbon sequestration, marine fisheries, coastal economies, and cycling of nutrients. As part of an integrated effort, the California Academy of Sciences (CAS) will catalog, digitize and identify fossil samples collected along the California margin. These materials will be combined with samples from available sediment cores to develop a public online digital database through which the research community may access project data and results. Two graduate students per year from the University of California Davis (UCD) will work closely with CAS staff to receive training in core curation and database development. In addition, this project supports the training of two Ph.D. students, and undergraduate research interns at UC Davis and UC Santa Barbara. The project also supports intensive field and laboratory based coursework and mentored research at Bodega Marine Laboratory for two undergraduates per year who are pursuing careers in K-12 STEM teaching. A research blog will be generated to develop scientific communication and writing skills in undergraduate, graduate students and technicians involved in this project. \r\n\r\nTo complete this research, the research team will use sediment records from along the California margin to address two key questions:  1) How did the development of the modern oxygen minimum zone during the Holocene influence marine ecosystems, including multiple stages of perturbation and recovery? 2) Can we identify the marine ecological impacts of the Anthropocene, against a background of decadal-centennial scale variability? The team will utilize recent marine sediments to reconstruct marine microfossil response to both natural and anthropogenic environmental perturbation. This research will utilize a suite of available sedimentary archives (over 20 piston, box and multi cores), with moderately high sedimentation rates and available geochemical records, to identify and interpret metazoan and protistan assemblages. Microfossil assemblages will provide a framework to understand past, modern and future climate and oceanographic processes along the California margin. These results can be directly compared to modern instrumental records, and utilized to better predict future impacts of environmental change in this region.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These records provide insight into future regional and global response to anthropogenic climate changes. Previous studies off the coast of California showed that past ecosystems there responded strongly to climate change, switching between multiple ecosystems, and taking long times to recover from disturbance. In this project we used fossil-bearing sediments from that region to address two key features of the modern ecosystem. First, we examined the development of the \"Oxygen Minimum Zone\" (OMZ) over the past 10,000 years, and its influence on the ecosystem. The OMZ is a depth in the ocean where the concentration of oxygen reaches a minimum, and is influenced heavily by climate and biological factors such as nutrient concentration. The depth of the OMZ can have a significant effect on ocean ecosystems, influencing the types of organisms that can inhabit particular depths. Second, our project searched for signs of the onset of the Anthropocene in the fossil record, as local ecosystems responded to human-driven changes of climate.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The project required the examination of fossils from multiple sites.
