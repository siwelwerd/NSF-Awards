 "awd_abstract_narration": "State science standards increasingly emphasize the importance of engaging K-12 students directly in natural phenomena and providing opportunities to construct explanations grounded in evidence. Moreover, these state science standards introduce earth and space science content in the early elementary grades. This creates a critical need for new pedagogies, materials, and resources for science teachers in all grades, but the need is particularly urgent in grades K-3 where teachers have had little preparation to teach science, let alone astronomy. There is also growing consensus that when learning opportunities in formal and informal settings are closely aligned, children's science literacy is developed in ways greater than either setting can achieve alone. The investigators will study if, how, and under what circumstances an integration of literacy strategies, hands-on inquiry-based investigations, and planetarium experiences supports the development of science practices (noticing, recognizing change, making predictions, and constructing explanations) in early elementary level students. This project will generate knowledge about how astronomy-focused storybooks, hands-on investigations, and planetarium experiences can be integrated to develop age-appropriate science practices in very young children (noticing, recognizing change, making predictions, and constructing explanations). This project is funded by the Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12), which seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of STEM by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.\r\n\r\nEmergent research on the development of children's science thinking indicates that when young children are engaged with science-focused storybooks and activities that each highlight the same phenomenon, children notice and gather evidence, make predictions and claims based on evidence, and provide explanations grounded in the experiences provided to them. This project has two phases. In Phase 1, first and third grade teachers will be recruited. They will help identify specific learner needs as these relate to the earth and space science standards in their grade band, assist in the development and pilot testing of a prototype instructional sequence and supporting activities taking place within their classrooms and at a local planetarium. In Phase 2, the revised learning sequence and research protocol will be implemented with the same teachers and a new cohort of children. The mixed method research design includes video observations, teacher interviews, and teacher and student surveys. Data analysis will focus on science practices, connections across contexts (e.g., school and planetarium), and instructional adaptations. The project involves a research-practice collaboration between the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, Rockman & Associates, the Lawrence Hall of Science [University of California, Berkeley], and West Chester University.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Existing   research in informal settings demonstrates when young children engage with   science-focused storybooks and activities mirroring phenomena in the books,   they notice, gather evidence, make evidence-based predictions, and offer   explanations grounded in experiences provided to them. This project extends   this research to formal learning environments for early elementary children in   grades 1 and 3. The Astronomical   Society of the Pacific, Rockman et al Cooperative, Lawrence Hall of Science   (University of California, Berkeley), and West Chester University conduct the   work.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>State instructional standards increasingly stress the   development of science practices starting in early elementary grades, which   creates a need for new pedagogical approaches, materials, and resources for   teachers. Project PLANET?s intellectual merit lies in its exploration of an   innovative instructional approach designed to develop scientific practices&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in first and third grade   students. Specifically, the project explores if and how a lesson sequence   consisting of an astronomy-focused storybook, classroom activities, and an   interactive planetarium experience engages children in noticing, gathering   evidence, and making predictions. The project?s broadest societal impact is   in the knowledge generated about how to foster&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; science practices in   children who eventually will become scientifically literate adults who use   evidence-based reasoning in their everyday lives. Moreover, because the   project involves students in underserved communities and explores the impact   of culturally responsive teaching practices on children?s science interest   and engagement, findings will help broaden STEM participation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Project PLANET instructional sequence begins with   the teacher reading a storybook aloud. In first-grade, children were read   Moonbear?s Shadow by Frank Asch. A bear tries to escape its shadow that is   scaring fish it tries to catch. Next, children explore how to change the   direction and length of a shadow using a flashlight, a figure of a bear, a   model tree, and a fabric pond with a fish.&nbsp;   A second reading of the book follows, along with in-class shadow   drawing activities that prepare children for a planetarium field trip. In the   planetarium, children engage in kinesthetic activities and create shadows on   the dome. They also see a figure of a bear casting shadows of differing   orientations and lengths depending on the Sun?s position. The planetarium   lets students observe changes over the course of a day within minutes,   allowing them to notice and predict the pattern of shadows over time without   having to wait for the actual Sun to move. The student?s post-planetarium   activities include more in-class shadow drawing activities (including drawing   shadows cast by the students outside) and the creation of their own shadow   stories. The third-grade sequence followed much the same pattern, with   reading from the book Breakfast Moon, by Meg Gower. This story follows Mae   and Arthur, siblings who observe the Moon on different days, noticing its   change in shape and location in the sky.&nbsp;   Mae and Arthur keep a journal of their observation and notice patterns.&nbsp; Each morning, they choose a breakfast food   to match the shape of the Moon they observe. In-class and planetarium   activities explore the sequence of lunar phases, with the planetarium   experience cycling through a month of moon phases in just a few minutes.   Students predict the location and phase of the Moon even when clouds obstruct   the view.&nbsp; As in the book, third   graders keep a journal and draw their observations of the actual Moon.</p>\n<p>Project  PLANET research investigates if and under what conditions (1) the sequences  successfully encourage children to notice, recognize change, make predictions,  and construct evidence-based explanations, (2) teachers and children connect  the learning experiences across the curriculum components, (3) teachers make  adaptations to the lessons, and why, and (4) inclusion of culturally  responsive teaching practices increases student interest and engagement. Key  findings from the project include the following: (1) both first and third  grade sequences successfully encouraged children to engage in age-appropriate  scientific practices, (2) multiple readings of the storybooks are especially  helpful in encouraging children to identify patterns and make connections  across the learning sequence they had not noticed before, (3) both formal and  informal educators have a critical role in helping children make connections  between the elements of the lesson sequences - as well as to children?s  cultural and personal experiences - as students do not readily make these  connections on their own, and (4) combining formal and informal learning  experiences that closely follow the science explorations of a compelling  character in a storybook appears to have an impact on developing scientific  thinking skills in very young children.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/28/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Linda&nbsp;S&nbsp;Shore</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1813189/1813189_10577896_1619648280797_ProjectPLANETimage--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1813189/1813189_10577896_1619648280797_ProjectPLANETimage--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Making Shadows\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1813189/1813189_10577896_1619648280797_ProjectPLANETimage--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Making Shadows\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">1st grade students made shadows during a kinesthetic activity in the planetarium at the Lawrence Hall of Science.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Brian Kruse / ASP</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Linda&nbsp;S&nbsp;Shore</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Making Shadows</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1813189/1813189_10577896_1619648522719_BRK-201905171053--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1813189/1813189_10577896_1619648522719_BRK-201905171053--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Bear Casts a Shadow\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1813189/1813189_10577896_1619648522719_BRK-201905171053--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Bear Casts a Shadow\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A virtual bear casts its shadow on the dome of the planetarium in different directions depending on the position of the Sun.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Brian Kruse / ASP</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Linda&nbsp;S&nbsp;Shore</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Bear Casts a Shadow</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1813189/1813189_10577896_1619648865738_storybooks--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1813189/1813189_10577896_1619648865738_storybooks--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Project PLANET Storybooks\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1813189/1813189_10577896_1619648865738_storybooks--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Project PLANET Storybooks\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Project PLANET used storybooks featuring astronomical phenomena students can relate to and investigate.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">ASP</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Linda&nbsp;S&nbsp;Shore</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Project PLANET Storybooks</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
