This workshop will address the science and engineering research questions motivated by designing and operating buildings for both energy efficiency as well as for the health of the occupants. A diversity of researchers from both the buildings and the public health R&D communities will be brought together to determine optimal approaches for integrating health and energy efficiency to promote the development of new human-centered design paradigms and building technologies.

The workshop will be hosted by NIH at the Natcher Conference Center in Bethesda, MD, in July, 2018. \r\n\r\nThe U.S. population spends perhaps 87% of their time inside buildings, and consequently it is reasonable to assume that building environments have a correspondingly large impact on occupant health. At the same time, the construction and operation of buildings has a large environmental impact: globally, buildings are responsible for approximately one third of primary energy consumption, and one third of greenhouse gas emissions. In the USA, building energy costs in 2016 were ~$408B annually, while annual healthcare costs were ~$3.2T in 2015. Additionally, potential worker productivity gains from improved indoor environments have been estimated at up to ~$230B (in 2016 dollars). Clearly, improving building sustainability while at the same time improving health outcomes would have significant economic impacts. Furthermore, by bringing together researchers from the typically separate fields of sustainable buildings and public health, the organizers are targeting to influence the education of future researchers by broadening their perspectives to consider these diverse but interrelated fields.",

Its objective was to address the science and engineering research questions motivated by designing and operating buildings for both energy efficiency as well as for the health of the occupants. We bruoght together a variety of researchers from both the buildings and the public health R&amp;D communities to determine optimal approaches for integrating health and energy efficiency to promote the development of new human-centered design paradigms and building technologies.
