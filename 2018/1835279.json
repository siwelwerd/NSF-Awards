 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project brings together theories of brain functions and principles of robotic swarm control to develop smarter swarms and to better understand the neural processes underlying spatial representations, navigation, and planning. Our world is constantly changing, and mammals have evolved the cognitive ability to plan new paths or new strategies as needed. By contrast, autonomous robots are less robust, and often have difficulty operating in complex, changing environments. This research project is grounded in the idea that individual robots in a group can be thought of analogously to neurons in an animal's brain, which interact with one another to form dynamic patterns that collectively signal locations in space and time relative to brain rhythms. This distribution of information across space and time will enable a new paradigm of swarm control, in which swarms automatically adapt to changes in the world in the same way that a rat knows which detour to take around an unexpected obstacle. Unmanned robots are rapidly becoming a crucial technology for commercial, military, and scientific endeavors throughout the nation and across the globe. Critical future applications such as disaster relief and search & rescue will require intelligent spatial coordination among many robots spread over large geographical areas. This project will advance neural swarming as a control paradigm for this next generation of technological development. Additionally, this project will drive an extensive science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education program to bring the concepts of spatial intelligence, hippocampal information processing, and swarm control to high school students to improve literacy in neuroscience and robotics.\r\n\r\nThe project's goal is to build a unified framework for self-organized, bottom-up control of spatial task planning that synergistically advances theoretical neuroscience and swarm control paradigms. In the project's brain-to-swarm metaphor, neurons are autonomous agents, spikes are agent-based phase signals, and emergent circuit activity is emergent swarm behavior. The approach targets neural computations in hippocampal circuits and related systems that may contribute to online dynamic replanning. The research thrusts comprise data-driven dynamical network and point-process models of neural activity sequences, mathematical analysis of swarming dynamics using matrix manifolds, and autonomous systems simulations in realistic virtual environments. The project will advance understanding of emergent hippocampal dynamics and autonomous methods for dynamic replanning, motivating new research in distributed control. The project's framework may enable mass-scalability for large, agile swarms of simple robotic agents.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

To advance our understanding of how brain solves these spatial problems, we investigated models of spatial learning dynamics in neural circuit by translating theoretical mechanisms in the mammalian hippocampus and adjacent structures to the domain of autonomous multiagent swarms. We developed a brain-inspired framework for swarming models, called 'NeuroSwarms', based on properties of rhythmic neural coding that we discovered in analyses of electrophysiological single-unit recordings from the lateral septum in foraging rats. We characterized a novel class of neurons, which we called 'phaser cells', each with a distinct phase, or temporal offset with respect to a shared ongoing oscillation known as the hippocampal theta rhythm. Our models of phaser cells demonstrated a robust collective code for spatial trajectories of simulated rodent foraging. In the NeuroSwarms framework, we found that complex collective spatial behaviors emerged when we introduced an analogous coding scheme to the agent controller models. Specifically, we assigned a periodic phase variable to each agent that was governed by inputs from the environment and nearby agents. By comparing these phase-states between pairs of agents, the controller modulates the degree of attraction or repulsion between them, leading to complex, spontaneous behaviors that proved capable of solving a variety of spatially distributed tasks including navigation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>NeuroSwarms behaviors included swarming, milling, patroling, aggegation, spatial coverage, multireward navigation, and cue-driven clustering. Moreover, swarming behaviors were autonomously flexible and reconfigurable across spatial and temporal scales with respect to the geometric boundaries of complex environments. Our NeuroSwarms framework demonstrated that our analogy of neurons-as-agents and networks-as-groups enabled well-known learning rules from neuroscience to efficiently control high-level spatial and navigational behaviors in simulated agent groups. A key insight of NeuroSwarms' navigational capacities was that generalization to new environments was achieved by simple adaptation of dynamical parameters, without the need for large amounts of training data or calculating credit-assignment updates, as typically required by deep learning-based methods. The motion of NeuroSwarms is determined by a fast, flexible, and 'online' learning process.
