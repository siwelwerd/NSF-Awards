 "awd_abstract_narration": "Global and local changes in environmental, social, and climatic conditions increasingly stress, alter, or degrade ecosystems and human quality of life despite continued efforts to develop integrated natural and human models that help support effective decision-making. In response, organizations must focus on managing for resilient human-natural systems - those that are able to respond and adapt to the effects of rapid change. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of Maine will create a new graduate education model that integrates faculty and students from the social and biophysical sciences in order to prepare the next generation of conservation leaders to address these challenges. The project anticipates training twenty-five (25) MS and PhD trainees, including twenty (20) funded trainees from forest resources, wildlife conservation, communications, and environmental sciences. An additional twenty (20) graduate students will participate in one or more of the traineeship program components. Trainees will develop interdisciplinary communication, collaboration, and professional skills to address emergent conservation issues. \r\n \r\nThe project will develop an interdisciplinary curriculum based on active learning models, professional development, and collaborative research that integrates biophysical and social sciences. The program will develop new master's and doctoral concentrations that can be transferred to other settings in the U.S. and abroad, and that promote the diversification of the STEM workforce. The curriculum consists of four diverse learning experiences: (1) integrated courses that provide theoretical and research foundations in socio-ecological resilience and science communication; (2) an internship with a conservation management, policy or science organization to master STEM professional skills; (3) an interdisciplinary research project; and (4) a mentoring program to ensure trainee success. Training will include close interactions with key conservation partners from state and local agencies, the National Park Service, non-governmental organizations, and community partners. Interdisciplinary courses and research will address governance frameworks, biodiversity conservation, sustainable rural livelihoods and resource-dependent economies, stewardship values, citizen science and participation, and spatial sciences. NRT Trainees will learn to promote a systems approach to conservation through a wide range of biophysical and social science models and methods. \r\n\r\nThe NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The project included 14 partner organizations (Federal government, Tribal Nations, state government, non-profit, and private) that supported professional development, research, teaching, and outreach strategies. A total of 48 faculty members were involved in the effort, including 13 who served as part of the leadership team.</p>\r\n<p>As part of the project, the team developed and offered five courses on team science, science communication and community engagement, resilience, and internship. Over 70 graduate students benefited from the program (Figures 1); 18 undergraduate students and nine postdoctoral associates participated in professional development workshops and training sessions organized by the project team.</p>\r\n<p>The collaboration among faculty, graduate students (NRT trainees), partners resulted in 128 publications, of which 63% (81) were in the form of refereed journal articles (Figure 2). NRT trainees co-authored 36% of the publications; multiple publications were led by trainees, demonstrating the strong research, collaborative, and leadership training obtained through the program.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, as shown on figure 3, faculty and students gave 210 presentations at international and national conferences (104), invited presentations (67), and guest lectures in courses (39). Of the total number of presentations, trainees served as co-presenters on 43% of the conference presentations, significantly demonstrating the strong training, science communication, and leadership skills gained through the program.</p>\r\n<p>As trainees progressed through the program, their contributions to products increased. In the program&rsquo;s final year, trainees co-authored 81% of conference presentations, and 82% of publications (Figure 4). This includes a reflective essay on transdisciplinary research authored by 5 trainee alumni.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, the collaboration led to securing over $51 million in external and internal grants (54 funded projects over the life of the grant) to support research, outreach, education, and economic development strategies. Trainees contributed to securing additional funding. Over the course of the program, there were eight grants with trainees as Co-PIs, totaling &gt;$700k. This number includes a collaborative project co-developed by 6 trainees and Penobscot Nation partners that was awarded a Maine Outdoor Heritage Fund grant.</p>\r\n<p>The project also led to significant research collaborations via a transdisciplinary approach. Teams were formed to research an array of topics related to climate change adaptation, community resilience, community engagement and participation conservation, outdoor recreation and underrepresented minorities, ecosystem health and conservation, adaptation to economic and health shocks, among others. Transdisciplinary collaborations between faculty, trainees, and partners from social, economic and biophysical sciences were created and strengthened.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, the project implemented multiple strategies to attract and support trainees from diverse backgrounds.&nbsp;Of the 28 trainees recruited through the program (Figure 5), 96% identified with at least one underrepresented minority group: 86% identified as female or non-binary, 16% identified with an ethnic or racial minority groups, 11% reported being non-traditional students, and 32% were 1st generation college
