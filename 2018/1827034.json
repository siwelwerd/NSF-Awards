 "awd_abstract_narration": "IRES: Cooperative for Advanced Materials in Energy-Related Applications (CAMERA)\r\nThe overarching goal of this project is to involve and train undergraduate and graduate student researchers from UCSB and other institutions in different scientific, academic, and international venues to develop a highly skilled, diverse and globally engaged workforce who can address energy challenges of today and the future. Three undergraduate students and four graduate students will travel to Chalmers University of Technology (Gothenburg, Sweden) each year for 8-10 week long research experiences. UCSB graduate students taking part in the research experiences at Chalmers will be recruited based on collaborative research topics, working broadly in the area of materials chemistry for energy conversion and storage. Undergraduate students will be recruited from US colleges and universities to participate in the summer undergraduate IRES program, with particular focus on recruiting participation by women and underrepresented minorities. The international component of the research and program will provide students with cultural perspectives and the opportunity to develop a global network in science.\r\nThe scientific challenge of this IRES project is to design, create, and understand novel materials and materials systems that can capture, convert, and store energy. This will be accomplished through synergistic and complementary coupling of resources and expertise in state-of-the-art synthesis, simulation, characterization, and testing at UCSB, Chalmers University of Technology, and multi-user x-ray and neutron facilities in Sweden. IRES students will participate in collaborative research between UCSB and Chalmers University through international research visits focused on battery materials; magnetocalorics, thermoelectrics, and dynamic polymers for energy capture; and carbon and oxide-based materials for electrocatalysis and electrochemical energy storage.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
