 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for a  conference which will survey the state of the art in one of the dominant paradigms in mathematics -- the Langlands program. These conjectures and partial results began as a set of elegant relationships between number theory and harmonic analysis, and have driven progress on many stunning results across a wide range of mathematics over the last half century. The conference will be held on November  14-16, 2018, at the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) at the University  of Minnesota. Detailed program information can be found at the conference website:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.ima.umn.edu/2018-2019/SW11.14-16.18\r\n\r\nThemes for the lectures include recent advances in the trace formula; Eisenstein series and L-functions; local, geometric, and p-adic versions of the Langlands program; Shimura varieties; and endoscopy and beyond. The speaker list is comprised of many of the world experts in aspects of the Langlands program, and was determined by the scientific organizing  committee of James Arthur, William Casselman, Geir Ellingsrud, and Freydoon Shahidi. The event presents a unique opportunity for the next generation of mathematical researchers to learn modes of possible progress on this fundamental collection of conjectures.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The conference was held November 14-16, 2018, and organized by James Arthur (University of Toronto), William Casselman (University of British Columbia), Geir Ellingsrud (Oslo University), and Freydoon Shahidi (Purdue University). The conference was timed in accordance with the 2018 Abel prize presented to Robert Langlands, professor emeritus at theInstitute for Advanced Study. The Langlands program is a dominant paradigm in number theory with important connections to representation theory and geometry. Hard won progress continues to be made on multiple fronts. Coupled with the additional enthusiasm of the prize year, the conference drew intense interest from the mathematical community and was a rare opportunity for young scientists to witness masters of the subject presenting the latest findings and their historical antecedents. The conference featured lectures by such world experts as Ngo (Chicago), Frenkel (UC Berkeley), Emerton (Chicago), Morel (Princeton), Harris (Columbia), and the honoree Langlands himself. The grant supported the visitor costs of young scientists -- non-tenured faculty, postdocs, and graduate students. A large portion of each lecture was aimed at a broad audience, so as to be accessible to these participants.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/19/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Daniel&nbsp;P&nbsp;Spirn</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1841211/1841211_10569839_1576784178078_18AbelPoster--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1841211/1841211_10569839_1576784178078_18AbelPoster--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Abel Conference Poster\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1841211/1841211_10569839_1576784178078_18AbelPoster--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Abel Conference Poster\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Sixth Abel Conference Poster</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dawn Mathers</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Daniel&nbsp;P&nbsp;Spirn</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Abel Conference Poster</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1841211/1841211_10569839_1576784436713_AbelParticipants--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1841211/1841211_10569839_1576784436713_AbelParticipants--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Abel Conference Participants\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1841211/1841211_10569839_1576784436713_AbelParticipants--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Abel Conference Participants\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2018 Abel Conference Participants</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Katherine Dowd</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Daniel&nbsp;P&nbsp;Spirn</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Abel Conference Participants</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
