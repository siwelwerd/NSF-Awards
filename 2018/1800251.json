 "awd_abstract_narration": "It was the French mathematician Charles Hermite who in 1873  proved that the constant e is a transcendental irrational, that is, e is not the root of a polynomial with integer coefficients. Nine years later, Ferdinand von Lindemann use Hermite's method to resolve the old problem that the number pi is transcendental. Hermite's tool was something we now call the Hermite-Pad\u00e9 approximant. His doctoral student Henri Pad\u00e9 studied a special case, a type of rational function that is now called the Pad\u00e9 approximant. These have turned out be a useful tool in problems as varied as scattering physics, numerical solution of differential equations, and rational approximation. Indeed, calculators still use rational approximations related to Pad\u00e9 approximants for calculating special functions. There are a great many unsolved problems about convergence of sequences of Pad\u00e9 approximants. One of the project goals  is to resolve some of these problems. Orthogonal polynomials turn out to be the denominator polynomials in certain Pad\u00e9 approximants, but are an even more important topic in their own right. They have applications in areas ranging from statistics to mathematical physics. \r\n\r\nThe specific goals of the project include investigating the notion of 'exact interpolation' for sequences of multipoint Pad\u00e9 approximants. The PI recently proved that when there is exact interpolation, namely no extra interpolation points, then subsequences or full sequences of Pad\u00e9 approximants converge uniformly in compact sets. The PI intends to establish explicit conditions for exact interpolation. On orthogonal polynomials, the PI recently discovered that universality limits for random matrices  can be turned into pointwise asymptotics for orthogonal polynomials at the endpoints of the interval of orthogonality. The PI intends to explore this in the bulk. On the flip side, the PI intends to use recent asymptotics of Eli Levin and the PI to establish universality limits for eigenvalues, as well as distribution of spacings of successive eigenvalues. Additional goals include establishing explicit formulae for Dirichlet orthogonal polynomials. The results will be disseminated in papers and at conferences. The PI recently co-organized a Computational Methods and Function Theory conference in Lublin, and will help co-organize the next one, most probably in Chile. The PI is also hoping to train another graduate student.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
