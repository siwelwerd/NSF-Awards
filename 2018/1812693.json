 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interaction and scattering of light by periodic structures at the nanoscale \r\nis a topic of great significance in the area of nanophotonics and metamaterials \r\ntechnology. With the current rapid development of this enabling technology, there \r\nis a high demand on new mathematical theories and computational algorithms \r\nfor both direct and inverse problems of the light scattering by periodic complex \r\nmedia or periodic metamaterials. This project aims to develop such theories \r\nand algorithms. Results from this project will advance knowledge, understanding \r\nand imaging techniques in the technology of nanophotonics and metamaterials. \r\nFor instance, the mathematical theories and the computational algorithms developed \r\nfor the direct problems are extremely useful for the simulation, fabrication and \r\nmaintaining of optical devices. The imaging techniques developed for the inverse \r\nproblems can be potentially of practical use for non-destructive tests, which help \r\nto detect and characterize discrete flaws in optical components and devices.\r\n\r\nThe project contains two main areas of study: the mathematical and numerical \r\nanalysis for direct scattering problems, and the development of efficient inversion \r\nalgorithms for inverse scattering problems. More precisely, for the direct problem, \r\nthe PI and his colleagues will work on the following topics: 1) develop volume integral \r\nequation formulations for direct scattering problems for periodic complex media; 2) \r\ndevelop fast integral equation-based numerical solvers for the direct scattering problems; \r\n3) study interior transmission eigenvalues for periodic complex media; 4) study \r\nwell-posedness of the scattering by chiral metamaterials. The proposed research \r\nfor the inverse problem includes the topics: 1) develop sampling methods \r\nfor imaging of periodic complex  media; 2) develop sampling methods for the detection \r\nof local defects in photonic crystals; 3) develop globally convergent methods for \r\nthe identification of material parameters for photonic crystals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
