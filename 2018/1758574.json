 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Texas Algebraic Geometry Symposium (TAGS) is an annual conference that is hosted on a rotating basis by Rice University, Texas A&M University, and the University of Texas at Austin. TAGS 2018 will take place on April 6-8 at Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas. TAGS 2019 will take place  during the Spring of 2019 at the University of Texas at Austin. TAGS 2020 will take place during the Spring of 2020 at Rice University in Houston, Texas. The symposia provide opportunities for local researchers to meet and interact, as well as to learn the latest advances in algebraic geometry, interpreted in its broadest sense. Each symposia includes lectures aimed specifically at graduate students. In addition, early-career researchers have the opportunity to present their work in poster sessions.  In addition there will be a one day weekend workshop for graduate students and postdocs during the fall semester.\r\n\r\nAlgebraic geometry is the study of solutions to systems of polynomial equations in many variables. Such systems are of central importance to mathematics and its applications, such as coding theory, cryptography, and the study of various natural phenomena. This grant will fund a conference series in this area in which investigators from Texas and the neighboring states will discuss the newest developments in the field with each other and with experts from outside the region. The conference series is also an important opportunity for regionally-based researchers, especially graduate students and postdocs, to meet, interact, gain exposure for their research, and establish new collaborations. More information is available at: http://www.math.tamu.edu/~gpearl/TAGS.html.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
