 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hydrothermal vents, which deposit seafloor massive sulfides (SMS), occur along the 89,000 km of mid-ocean ridges, submarine volcanoes, and backarc basins that occur at tectonic plate boundaries in the ocean. Active hydrothermal vent sulfide chimneys are hotspots of biodiversity and productivity in the deep ocean, as well as potential resources for metals. While significant effort has focused on understanding the diversity of biological communities and geochemistry associated with actively venting SMS, relatively little is known about the biological communities associated with SMS once venting ceases. Furthermore, little is known about the microbiological and geochemical changes that occur during the transition period from active to inactive, during which an important succession occurs in the microbial community and geochemistry of fluids within the chimney. This interdisciplinary project will create and sample this transition period by collecting multiple active SMS samples from individual vents at 9 degrees N East Pacific Rise and allowing them to transition to inactive on the seafloor, mimicking the end of venting while allowing for the exact time when venting ceased to be known, something not possible when sampling naturally formed inactive SMS. Microbial community diversity and metabolism will be analyzed in parallel with bulk and fine-scale geological measurements for active, transitioning, and inactive sulfides. This seafloor experimental and analytical approach will provide knowledge of how microbial communities, rates of biogeochemical transformations, and geological conditions change as SMS transition from hot and actively venting to cold and inactive. Students in grades 6-8 will be entrained into the project through research cruise \"ship-to-shore\" interactions and communications, post-cruise workshops for educators working with students typically underrepresented in STEM fields, and a collaboration with the Science, Engineering, Art and Design Gallery (SEAD), a community and economic development project in Bryan, TX. \r\n\r\nHydrothermal vents are quantitatively important to the biology and chemistry of the deep ocean, but the vast majority of current knowledge focuses on actively venting deposits. However, after venting ceases, sulfides can persist on the seafloor for tens of thousands of years, making them long-lived, globally-abundant microbial substrates. In recent years, studies of inactive SMS found drastically different microbial communities than those on active deposits, indicating a succession of the microbial community, and thus a potentially different impact on deep ocean biodiversity and biogeochemistry than actively venting deposits. However, ages of the inactive structures are often not known, so it is impossible to estimate how quickly these changes occur, and how quickly co-occurring changes in sulfide mineralogy and microbiological communities occur. This project will provide the first insight into what happens at the microbial and mineralogical level as SMS initially transition from active to inactive. Active SMS will be sampled and analyzed for microbial community composition, functional capacity, gene expression and metabolic rates. Co-located subsamples will be analyzed for porosity and bulk and fine-scale mineralogy. Subsamples of those active SMS samples will be left on the seafloor to incubate and be collected weeks and a year or more later, with the same analyses conducted upon collection. This will allow for determination of microbiological and mineralogical changes that occur during that initial transition and for comparison with older inactive SMS from the same vent fields. Together, the data collected will be integrated to generate a conceptual model of succession of biology, mineralogy, porosity and pore distribution as vent deposits transition from active to inactive. This project will fill a knowledge gap about hydrothermal ecosystems and has the potential to transform the current understanding of diversity and rates of change in these important seafloor biomes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This was accomplished through seafloor experiments whereby samples of active and inactive vents were collected and either brought to the surface immediately as a baseline sample or placed in exposure chambers and left on the seafloor away from venting for 1 week, 9 months and two years. Nine of those experiments were conducted, and additional, opportunistic samples of inactive vent deposits were collected throughout the fieldwork for analysis of already inactive vents. Fieldwork was conducted at 9&#730;50'N East Pacific Rise using HOV Alvin during two research cruises funded by this grant in March and December 2019 (R/V Atlantis cruises AT42-09 and AT42-21, respectively) and through collaborative participation on a third research cruise using ROV Jason on R/V Roger Revelle in April 2021 (RR2102).<br /><br />Due to Covid setbacks and difficulty getting DNA from active vent samples, analysis of the entire time series is still pending.&nbsp; Initial analysis of 16S rRNA gene diversity, which informs about bacterial and archaeal community composition, from the inactive vent deposit time series samples indicates that there is change over time on the same vent structures, even when already inactive: the 9 month and 2 year samples group separately in NMDS space in comparison to the Day 0 and 2 week samples (Figure 1). We will pair this 16S rRNA data with metagenomes from t0 samples (below) to predict changes in potential function over time on inactive sulfide deposits. Analysis of mineralogy across the time series indicates a shift from primarily iron sulfides on active vents to a complex suite of oxides on inactive vents.<br /><br />The biggest finding to date from this project is the first quantification of primary productivity rates on inactive vent deposits.&nbsp; Using 14C-bicarbonate bioassays, we determined that rates of whole-community primary productivity on inactive vents are surprisingly high and similar to those on active vents (Figure 2). These patterns hold up when normalizing rates to cell counts. This data is particularly exciting as they reveal that inactive vents are home to active microbial communities supported by a resident base of the food web not dependent on surface ocean processes. Paired metagenomic analysis revealed that the majority of carbon fixation genes detected are from the Calvin-Benson-Basham cycle and attributed to lineages of Gamma- and Alphaproteobacteria, while analysis of uptake of stable-isotope label via NanoSIMS revealed that these microbial communities have a low percentage of active cells, but those active cells are highly active and predominately autotrophic. The initial paper on primary productivity was published in 2024 (Achberger et al., 2024).<br /><br />We also quantified exoenzyme activity rates on active and inactive hydrothermal vent sulfides to better understand heterotrophic activities related to carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling. All samples were incubated at both 4&#730;C and 65&#730;C. Overall, exoenzyme activity rates were higher at 65&#730;C than 4&#730;C. Additionally, exoenzyme activities were more often detectable at 65&#730;C for inactive vent sulfides than at 4&#730;C from active vents, indicating that thermophiles remain present and are capable of being revived on hydrothermal sulfides after venting ceases (Figure 3). This is the first data comparing the activity of multiple exoenzymes across vent activity ranges.<br /><br />Finally, this project includes analysis of seafloor basalt microbiomes from EPR 9&#730;50'N.&nbsp; Exoenzyme activity from EPR and Davidson Seamount revealed that the age difference (15 years) between EPR samples may account for differences in microbial abundance and extracellular enzyme activity, but for larger age scales (~10 Ma, EPR vs Davidson Seamount), the age and alteration of basalt may not significantly impact extracellular enzyme activity.&nbsp; This indicates that microbial ecosystem services become established within years of seafloor eruptions and remain consistent for long periods (potentially millions of years) of time. Additionally, the ratios of exoenzymes, which can inform us of the C:N:P acquisition that microbial communities on seafloor basalts are potentially C-limited (Figure 4). Analysis of basalt metagenomes is ongoing and will produce important information about potential funciton and ecosystems services provided on young (&lt;30 years old) seafloor basalts.<br /><br />A central focus of our broader impacts was on engaging middle school students from backgrounds underrepresented in Geoscience. Sylvan worked with Alejandra Martinez, a 7th grade science teacher in Eagle Pass, TX, a town on the US-Mexico border with majority Hispanic and indigenous population. He conducted virtual visits to her classroom and trips to Port Aransas, TX, where students spent a day in the field learning about marine ecology both on the beach with Sylvan and on the R/V Katy, a ~50 foot vessel that conducts educational trips.
