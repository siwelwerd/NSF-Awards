 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores the application of Koopman evolution operators to the study of climate variability.  Koopman operators were derived in the early 1930s and used to prove an important theorem on the behavior of idealized dynamical systems.  But they remained largely unknown beyond dynamical systems theory until the early 2000s, when their usefulness for complicated, data intensive problems was recognized.  Since that time they have been applied in such data-driven applications as fluid flow, stability analysis in power networks, the development of financial trading algorithms, and brain activity research. Like these applications, climate research is often data-driven and involves analysis of a complex system, thus Koopman operators could be a valuable addition to the climate research toolkit.\r\n\r\nResearch conducted here applies the Koopman operator framework to three problems in climate dynamics: 1) Understanding the variability and structure of El Nino in paleoclimate and current climate; 2) decadal-scale variability in the climate system and its implications for predictability; and 3) dynamics of the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) across multiple timescales.  Research in these areas typically relies on methods such as principle component analysis to characterize variability in terms of spatial patterns and their time evolution.  But these methods yield statistical characterizations that are not dynamically based and may not be optimal for relating the variability patterns to underlying dynamical processes. Koopman operators directly express the dynamics of the system, thus they may prove more insightful for understanding how the dynamics of the climate system give rise to the forms of variability that we observe.\r\n\r\nThe work has broader impacts through its potential to enhance understanding of the climate system and thus improve the guidance available to stakeholders and decision makers concerned with climate impacts. In addition, the Principal Investigator (PI) works with the Rutgers Research in Science and Engineering (RiSE) program, through which he hosts undergraduate students from underrepresented groups.  The project also provides support and training for a postdoctoral research associate, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDuring the course of this project, the PI and PhD student (both climate scientists) collaborated with applied mathematicians in order to advance the application of a novel data analysis technique (known as Koopman operators) to the study of climate dynamics.  Briefly, the Koopman operator approach is based on theoretical considerations of dynamical systems with a history dating back to the 1930s.  Recently, the Koopman operator has experienced something of a renaissance thanks to advances in computing that now enable its implementation to data-rich real world problems in diverse areas of science and engineering.  Our applications of the Koopman operator targeted the El Ni&ntilde;o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), two well-known \"modes\" of (tropical) climate variability on interannual and intraseasonal timescales, respectively.  We showed that the Koopman operator approach effectively captures the known characteristics and behavior of these modes of climate variability while, at the same time, offering some potential improvements in current understanding of these phenomena.  For example, in the case of ENSO, the Koopman operator depiction may facilitate a more nuanced depiction of the lifecycles of ENSO events.  While ENSO events involve well-known \"El Ni&ntilde;o\" and \"La Ni&ntilde;a\" phases, the evolution between these two phases is not symmetric; our Koopman depiction of ENSO captures this evolutionary asymmetry in the event lifecycle.  In the case of our analysis of the MJO, the Koopman operator approach points indicates more coherent and more persistent MJO event behavior, which we suggest could ultimately indicate enhanced predictability in the MJO beyond what is currently understood and may, ultimately, be exploited to improve operational forecasting.  A hoped for outcome of these demonstrations of the ultility and power of the Koopman operator to climate dynamics is that more scientists and researchers in the climate science community will take advantage of its application.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/10/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Benjamin R Lintner"
