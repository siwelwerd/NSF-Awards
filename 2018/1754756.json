 "awd_abstract_narration": "Peatlands are wetlands that lock away huge amounts of carbon as thick peat soil deposits.  Referred to as a \"carbon bank\", scientists believe that the carbon stored in peat is at risk of being released to the atmosphere in response to environmental change.  Mosses often dominate plant production in peatland ecosystems, which are concentrated in northern regions where the environment can become extremely cold and is nutrient poor.  Similar to humans or to other plants, mosses contain a diverse microbiome, microbes that are intimately associated with the plant in a symbiotic relationship, that help the host to grow and thrive under extreme conditions.  The plant host provides the microbiome with a stable environment in which to live and in turn the microbes are believed to help mosses acquire nutrients such as nitrogen and carbon.  For example, some microbes convert nitrogen gas from the atmosphere into a form that moss plants can use.  Similarly, there are microbes that can also help mosses acquire carbon from the conversion of methane (natural gas produced in wetland soils) to carbon dioxide. This research will determine how much and how fast nitrogen and carbon are metabolized by peat moss microbiomes, as well as the implications for the growth of peat mosses and carbon storage in northern peatland ecosystems in Minnesota and Canada.   Taking advantage of a large whole ecosystem experiment, the project will further examine the response of peat mosses and their constituent microbiomes to environmental change.  This project will provide fundamental research on how microbiomes aid the growth of peat moss plants, which may store more carbon than any other plant on Earth.  Results of the project will be used to improve predictions on whether peatlands will act as a net carbon source or sink in response to ongoing environmental change as well as the potential use of plant microbiomes as a natural biofilter for methane produced in landfills. This research will also serve society by teaching the next generation of scientists about the important ecosystem services that wetlands provide and the role of microbes in maintaining these services.  At least two graduate students, two undergraduate students, and a postdoctoral researcher will be involved in all aspects of the project.  Two signature activities will be used as instruments to communicate project results to the public.  A 5-day workshop in a Georgia wetland will train 16 middle and high school teachers on developing lesson plans for teaching ecosystem science in the context of conservation, restoration, and global environmental change. Project results will be disseminated to the public through an annual interactive activity at the Atlanta Science Festival (which reaches 20,000 people per year).\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of the research is to investigate the role of the peat moss microbiome in regulating peatland carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles and the resilience of peatlands to environmental change.  Objectives are to: 1) quantify in situ rates of nitrogen fixation and methanotrophy, and elucidate the contribution of keystone microbial associates mediating these processes in the peat moss microbiome, 2) determine the response of nitrogen fixation and its coupling to methane(CH4) dynamics to perturbation of environmental change drivers in the laboratory and in a large-scale whole ecosystem experiment in the field, and 3) leverage datasets from two long-term field sites to estimate the microbiome contribution to ecosystem N and C budgets as well as model the response of microbiome function to perturbation of environmental change drivers. Working hypotheses include: H1: N fixation is a predominant N input to northern peatlands; H2: The dominant nitrogen fixers are methanotrophic bacteria and cyanobacteria; H3: Methanotrophs that also fix N represent a substantial CH4 sink;  H4: Net primary production by peat mosses is directly supported by N acquired from nitrogen fixation and methane-derived C from methanotrophy; H5: Peat moss productivity and its response to environmental perturbations will be largely determined by plant-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions; H6: Increases in temperature and CO2 will result in lower rates of N fixation due to decreased peat moss productivity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Soil carbon accumulates in peatlands because the production of plant biomass through photosynthesis has historically outpaced its breakdown via microbial decomposition. Peat mosses (<em>Sphagnum</em> spp.) dominate plant production in northern peatlands, where they serve as ecosystem engineers that regulate carbon and nutrient cycles. Thus, it has been said that more carbon is stored as dead <em>Sphagnum</em> biomass in soils than any other genus of plant on Earth.

Together, these microbial processes give the plant access to critical nutrients while also serving as a biofilter, preventing the potent greenhouse gas methane from being released to the atmosphere. Only nitrogen-fixing microbes are capable of converting nitrogen gas (N<sub>2</sub>) from air into usable nitrogen for plants, and microbes obtain energy by consuming methane through methanotrophy. It was previously suggested that the coupling of these processes, microbial methane-fueled nitrogen fixation, may serve as a missing link for nutrient cycling in peatlands, but this process and the organisms involved were largely uncharacterized. We studied over 250 <em>Sphagnum</em> microbiomes from peatlands across the United States (5 states, 17 bog/fen sites, 18 <em>Sphagnum</em> species) from Alaska to Vermont.&nbsp; We found that the same or similar groups of methanotrophic and nitrogen-fixing bacteria made up a large portion of the microbiome in most of these moss species. Further, we showed that the two processes were carried out by the same microbe, obligate methanotrophs (microbes that can only produce energy from methane consumption) of the rare biosphere (<em>Methyloferula</em>) that were widely distributed and active.&nbsp; Thus, the results indicate that <em>Methyloferula</em> likely plays a key role in coupling the carbon and nitrogen cycles in nutrient-poor peatlands.</p>\r\n<p>Next, we leveraged the Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE) experiment in northern Minnesota, where air and peat warming are combined in a whole-ecosystem warming treatment, to investigate how the <em>Sphagnum</em> microbiome will react to warming and elevated carbon dioxide levels predicted to come with environmental change.&nbsp; We observed ~94% mortality of <em>Sphagnum</em> mosses between the +0 C and +9 C treatments, likely due to the interactive effects of warming on nitrogen availability and competition from vascular plant species (trees and shrubs). Our results reveal that warming causes a decoupling of methanotrophy from nitrogen fixation as the moss dies, leading to a significant loss in keystone microbial taxa and a decline in nitrogen fixation. While elevated carbon dioxide levels appeared to offset some of the changes in nitrogen cycling caused by warming, the decoupling of these processes remained.&nbsp; Overall, the study suggests that climate change will result in an imbalance or dysbiosis in mosses and their microbial associates, resulting in major and potentially adverse ecosystem outcomes.</p>\r\n<p>To date, the project produced 8 peer-reviewed publications with several more in development, and numerous presentations at national/ international meetings.
