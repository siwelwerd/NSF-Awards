 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the National Science Foundation's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) program, this project will support high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need at Valencia College, a two-year college and Hispanic-Serving Institution.   Lack of knowledge and skills combined with limited access to educational resources are significant barriers to the success of many low-income, high-achieving students in STEM academic and career pathways. This S-STEM project aims to strengthen and diversify collegiate STEM degree completion and, ultimately, the STEM workforce by creating a STEM support program at Valencia College. This project will provide low-income, academically talented students with comprehensive wrap-around support early in their college experience, with emphasis on STEM research, mentoring, coursework, and advising to support STEM degree completion. The project aims to generate a STEM research community that nurtures student development and encourages continuation in STEM education and careers. Over the five years of funding, the project will provide 60 one-year scholarships to 30 students pursuing associate degrees in biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering, or physics transfer pathways.  Students who successfully transfer to a four-year STEM baccalaureate program will receive a one-time scholarship to support their studies.  \r\n\r\nSince Valencia College has unique, non-traditional student demographics, including a considerable population of low-income students, the project will address existing disparities of low-income student completion in STEM degrees.  The project will accomplish this goal by determining optimal conditions for the post-secondary research experiences, the support network, and scholarship assistance to maximize positive impact on student persistence in STEM to successful transfer.  The goals of the project are to: 1) increase the enrollment and diversity of low-income, academically talented students in STEM degree pathways; 2) adapt evidence-based practices and leverage existing resources to create a sustainable student support model; 3) increase student success rates through integrated support services promoting full-time enrollment and degree attainment; and 4) assist student transfer to four-year degree programs and support them to gain access to upper division undergraduate research. The project will advance knowledge through a research study focusing on the impact of early experiences in undergraduate research at a two-year institution and on early interventions including mentoring practices that incorporate growth mindset interventions. The project will disseminate these results to inform the design of curricular methods and educational practices that other institutions of higher education can adapt to support low-income, academically talented STEM degree-seeking students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project overall aimed to provide supportive interventions to maintain a diverse STEM-seeking student population in a two-year community college system through undergraduate research experiences, growth mindset interventions, and inter-institutional partnerships to enhance transfer support. Project goals focused on increasing recruitment and graduation of low-income, academically advanced students in STEM academic pathways from Valencia College, a Hispanic-serving community college in Central Florida. In doing so, this project provided supportive measures toward academic performance, retention, and persistence in STEM. This was achieved through data-assisted recruitment measures, development of a supportive program model that incorporated institutional support services in addition to program faculty mentorship, and transfer assistance to promote completion of undergraduate research experiences at a four-year academic institution.\n\n\n\n\n\nValencia Engaging for Completion Through Opportunities in Research (VECTOR) was developed as the program model, which coordinated support measures for a total of forty-seven students during the life of the grant. Through program activities, students were introduced to research principles and experiences, growth mindset interventions, faculty mentorship, academic and non-academic support resources, engaged in peer-to-peer team building activities to promote a sense of belonging within the program and in STEM, and program or experiential activities that supported transfer and professional readiness. Through the grant period VECTOR became an entry point for research experiences from which students were introduced to existing research platforms at Valencia College with the Seneff Honors College and the Valencia College LSAMP program. All students within VECTOR participated in research activities, which were eventually scaled through collaborations with the Seneff Honors College and LSAMP by year 3 of the grant.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe expected outcomes for fall-to-fall retention, successful completion of the first semester while in VECTOR with a C or better as well as maintaining a 3.0 GPA or better were under expected targets of 90%, 90%, and 80% respectively(see Table 1 below). Challenges in academic performance were also noted for students after transfer to a four-year institution, in some cases impacting qualification for continuation at the four-year institution. Given that most program participants started in VECTOR during the second year of college due to barriers in recruitment, these findings highlight a continued focus on outreach to students early in the college experience to reinforce academic skills. Project expected outcomes also included that program participants will graduate with an A.A. degree with an educational plan to enter a biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering, or physics university baccalaureate program or an A.S. degree in STEM field. Based on student self-reported academic pathways, over 90% of program participants have either completed a baccalaureate, associate in science in a STEM program, or continue to pursue a STEM academic plan. Only a few of these students switched to a non-NSF STEM major. A final project outcome also included that 80% of program participants will transfer to a STEM baccalaureate program. All students that completed VECTOR concurrently with an associate degree (66% of total) transferred to a documented NSF-defined STEM baccalaureate program or interdisciplinary program with the intent to pursue a STEM academic path. The remaining students that exited the VECTOR program prior to completion of an associate degree, in most cases (78.9% of exited students, 15 out of 19) have continued efforts toward an NSF-defined STEM degree. Continued data analysis will focus on differences in project outcomes of VECTOR participants and a comparison group of STEM-seeking students at Valencia College.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn additional product of this grant included creation of a professional development course at Valencia College titled Using Growth Mindset to Support Underrepresented Students in STEM. The goal of this course is to provide an opportunity for Valencia College faculty, advisors, and counselors to incorporate growth mindset principles within professional practices through development of a growth mindset intervention for students. This course builds on previous studies that show positive impacts of faculty mindset on student mindset and academic performance. A total of 73 faculty and staff completed this course experience through the period of the grant. In addition, course facilitation has continued beyond the grant period highlighting sustainable benefits of grant efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\nCollectively, this project features a community college to baccalaureate pipeline that enhances engagement in early research experiences, mindset practices, and transfer assistance to support persistence in a STEM academic pathway and continued high impact practice experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.
