 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award focuses on the long-term study of interactions between fire and a forest disease, Sudden Oak Death, in the Big Sur region of California. While fire is an important part of the ecology of healthy California forests, Sudden Oak Death is a recently introduced disease that has killed millions of trees in coastal California over the past 20 years. Disease-killed trees serve as fuel and may increase the risk for the ignition, spread, and increased intensity of wildfires.  While fire and disease both cause extensive tree death, each disturbance type results in different types of impacts and recovery of forests. To that end, the proposed research seeks to determine how multiple, and altered, disturbances interact to determine the composition of the regenerating plant community and shape the severity, frequency, and timing of future disturbances.  The threat of wildfire plays a major role in policy decisions in many communities throughout California and the western United States. The cost of fighting wildfires has increased dramatically as more people live in locations in and near forests. Understanding how disease and fire interact to impact forests is important in fighting fires, protecting communities, and in aiding the recovery of forests after catastrophic fire and disease outbreak.\r\n\r\nDisease-fire interactions in Big Sur forests will be examined across an 80,000 ha plot network that was established in 2006 to study Sudden Oak Death. Large fires burned across the plot network in 2008 and in 2016, providing an opportunity to study disease-fire interactions at a very large scale.  Initial results from the Big Sur plot network indicate that these forest ecosystems are moving toward novel disturbance regimes with complex interactions between disease and fire, impacting tree and shrub species that are otherwise resilient to either disturbance. Increases in wildfire severity due to the presence of disease can increase mortality of tree species not susceptible to disease, alter forest assemblages and biogeochemical cycles, and ultimately, create the context for how the joint disturbances of fire and disease and will re-emerge across the landscape. The research approach includes monitoring the vegetation, pathogens, and soil nutrients of the long-term field plots, laboratory quantification of pathogens, as well as statistical modeling. The proposed research plan anticipates that the dramatic tree mortality due to Sudden Oak Death in Big Sur will continue for many years, thereby influencing fuel loading and subsequently natural fire regimes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

As of 2019, <em>P. ramorum</em> killed ~42.8 million oak (<em>Quercus spp.</em>) and tanoak tree hosts (<em>Notholithocarpus densiflorus</em>). Since 2006, our research team has studied the effects of SOD and fire-disease interactions in Big Sur forests, maintaining an expansive repeat measurement network that captures variation in abiotic and biotic landscape characteristics, including before and after four major wildfires. The Big Sur ecoregion comprises the western slopes of the Santa Lucia Mountains in Monterey County, California. In 2006-7, we established 280 500-m<sup>2</sup> (0.05 ha) forest plots over ~80,000 ha in Big Sur to understand the ecological impacts of the cause of sudden oak death, <em>Phytophthora ramorum</em>. Plot locations were stratified to capture variation in disease impacts (based on aerial imagery), topography, land ownership, fire history, climate, watershed, and forest type (among redwood- and mixed evergreen-dominated stands). Between 2006 and 2022, each plot has been surveyed between one and eight times. All living or dead stems &gt;3 cm in diameter at breast height (dbh) were tagged and re-censused for growth and mortality. We also tracked mortality of resprouting genets. At the plot-level, we have surveyed non-woody plant composition, fine and coarse surface fuels, standing dead fuels, and seedling recruitment. In addition, four major wildfires (the Chalk and Basin fires (2008), Soberanes (2016), and Dolan (2020) fires) have burned across this network since its establishment, providing high-resolution data from before and after disease and fire disturbances. Post-fire mortality of individual stems and new regeneration of stems &gt;3 cm dbh were recorded in each post-fire survey. During four censuses (2010, &lsquo;13, &lsquo;18, &amp; &lsquo;22), we also quantified forest floor and surface soil capturing pre- and post-fire comparisons and soil changes up to 13 years post-fire. Together, our long-term dataset captures 112,731 stem-level observations, 38,407 genet-level observations, and 913 plot-level surveys, capturing a range of disease impacts (from uninfested to 100% mortality of susceptible hosts) and fire histories (from unburned since the early 1900s to stands experiencing 3 fires since 1999).</p>\n<p>Over the course of the grant, we have observed an increasing occurrence of abrupt forest-to-shrub transitions, triggered by repeated disturbance interactions in the coastal forests of the Big Sur ecoregion of central California. In Big Sur, steep topography and strong climatic gradients from north to south and from the coast inland support a mosaic of adjacent forest and shrubland patches. Forests tend to dominate cooler, lower elevation positions, within a zone exposed to maritime fog, while, shrub-dominated chaparral occurs in warmer, drier and higher elevation areas, typified by species such as&nbsp;<em>Arctostaphylos spp.</em>,&nbsp;<em>Adenostoma fasciculatum,</em>&nbsp;and, in particular, species of the N-fixing genus&nbsp;<em>Ceanothus&nbsp;</em>(hereafter,<em>&nbsp;Ceanothus</em>). Following disturbance in forested sites, it is typical for shrubs to establish quickly, due to their persistent seed bank. Shrubs often co-dominate with trees for the first ~15 years of regrowth; however, they were historically overtopped by surviving tree genets which rapidly resprout. Widespread tree mortality caused by sudden oak death represents a novel biotic disturbance in these coastal forests that interacts with wildfire disturbances. All dominant tree species in this system resprout following aboveground damage; however, our team&rsquo;s past work indicates that SOD kills host tree genets, alters disease-related fuels, and increases subsequent fire severity, resulting in atypical mortality of both ramets and genets of trees. The combustion of disease-related fuels also changes soil nutrient availability by substantially raising phosphorus (P) relative to nitrogen (N), due to the volatilization of N and the persistence of P in ash. In turn, wildfire behavior reduces (but does not eradicate)&nbsp;<em>P. ramorum</em>&nbsp;populations and alters forest structure, shaping post-fire disease transmission. Coincident with the emergence of SOD, anthropogenic ignitions and increasingly favorable fire conditions may be increasing fire frequency across this landscape.</p>\n<p>As part of theproject, our team conducts outreach and works with land managers in the Big Sur area. We provide support for the citizen science SOD Blitzes in the Monterey/Carmel area both during the blitzes and through follow-up discussions with landowners about current treatment options. We also work serve on the Central Coast Prescribed Burn Association. We are working with northern California tribes (Hupa, Yurok, Kashia Pomo, Catho, Karuk) to transfer our work in Big Sur to their forest systems. Other management projects have ben conducted with the USDA Forst Service, BLM, Cal Fire, Soquel Demonstration Forest, and Marin Munipal Water District.
