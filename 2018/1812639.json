 "awd_abstract_narration": "This astronomy project aims at improving our understanding of the thin, warm gas spread throughout the Milky Way Galaxy.  The team hope to understand how this gas, known as the \"Warm Ionized Medium\" or WIM, relates to the large, dense clouds in the galaxy where stars are known to form.  The WIM is notoriously hard to observe because it is so thin and tenuous.  Even so, the WIM is important because it makes up almost 20% of the gas in the galaxy. Understanding how the WIM affects the birth of stars and the evolution of the Milky Way are important goals of this project. The researchers will use the NSF-funded Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to observe radio emission from the hydrogen atoms in the WIM. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the WIM.  The team from West Virginia University (WVU) will map the inner regions of the Milky Way, pausing to take deeper observations of hot bubbles of gas known as \"HII regions\" for comparison with the WIM. The GBT is the most sensitive telescope available for observing the WIM. Almost 40% of the map data have already been obtained. Completing the maps and analyzing these important data will be of considerable use to the astronomy community. \r\n\r\nGraduate, undergraduate, and even local high school students will be involved in this project. The team will contribute to West Virginia's Vision 2015 initiative to improve the state's workforce training in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM). The Principle Investigator has been involved in this effort for a number of years, and with this funding will extend the program to more schools in the area. The team's NSF-supported project \"Mapping the Galaxy\" allows high school students to identify HII regions and then conduct follow-up observations at the GBT. This program will be extended from one to three schools, and from roughly 15 to more than 50 students. WVU students will also be involved in this outreach activity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis grant allowed work on a project called the \"Green Bank Telescope Diffuse Ionized Gas Survey\" (GDIGS). GDIGS is a large (~400 hour) survey of radio recombination line (RRL) emission in the inner portion of the Milky Way's disc. RRLs are produced from ionized gas - gas where electrons have been removed from their nuclei. Ionized gas is created by high-mass stars, and therefore GDIGS allows us to trace the impact of high mass stars throughout the Galaxy. It was the first such large, fully-sampled survey.\n\n\nDuring the grant period, we completed the survey and disseminated the data to the community, investigated the compact and diffuse ionized gas around one of the most massive star formation regions in the Galaxy, created a model to explain the Galactic ionized gas distribution, discovered a population of extremely high velocity ionized gas blobs of unknown origin, and began investigations into the distribution of high energy photons in the Galaxy.\n\n\nWe also led an outreach project in West Virginia that brought high school students from around the state to Green Bank for a weekend of science. At these retreats, the students used telescopes on-site, attended lectures and demonstrations on radio astronomy, and participated in a workshop on career paths.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/03/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: LorenAnderson\n"
