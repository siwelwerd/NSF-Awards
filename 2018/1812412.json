 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Particular emphasis is placed on transforming STEM education through innovative recruitment and retention strategies and experiences in support of groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African-Americans, Alaskan Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. The Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity provides support for postbaccalaureate studies in STEM programs leading to the STEM doctoral degree. \r\n\r\nNortheastern University (NU) is the host site for the 2018-2020 BD program for the Northeast Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (NE-LSAMP) under the leadership of the University of Connecticut.  Strategic Advancement of Rising Scholars (STARS) is the first post-baccalaureate program at NU that supports a student cohort of 12 underrepresented minority (URM) STEM graduate students from LSAMP campuses across the nation. \r\n\r\nThe STARS program incorporates a six Rs model of recruitment, reflection, resources, recourse, retention, and rise. Students receive rigorous academic and experiential research training that support completion of the STEM Ph.D. and the transition to a competitive career in academia and industry.  Faculty STEM mentor training and development along with culturally relevant STEM mentoring and evaluation are prominent features of the program that includes linkages to the National Mentoring Research Network (NMRN).  Formative and summative evaluation activities include evaluation and assessment of the project's implementation and student outcomes.  Project results  and annual evaluation reports will be disseminated through the Northeast Alliance and NU's website and at STEM professional conferences.  In conjunction with NU's Department of Computer Sciences, a new on-line long-term system is proposed for development to track students during and after participation in the program. \r\n\r\nThe long-term impact of the BD activity is reflected in America's STEM workforce, both in academia and in industrial research and development. By nurturing future STEM leaders, the value added is seen in the visibility of underrepresented minorities in science and engineering, increasing representation and providing role models and STEM leadership for the next generation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "The 2018 LSAMP BD award to Northeastern University through the Northeast LSAMP Alliance created the STARS Fellowship program.  STARS, a short title for Strategic Advancement of Rising Scholars, is a cohort based program that uses evidence-based strategies to recruit and retain a diverse cohort of Ph.D. students through a comprehensive and longitudinal support network within a research education program.  Through the 2018 LSAMP BD award, Northeastern recruited and funded 15 LSAMP Scholars as STARS Fellows.  Aggressive recruitment led to an additional 11 STARS Fellows (also underrepresented Ph.D. students of color).  All STARS Fellows were recruited with 5 years of funding with the first 2 years of these 5 through fellowship support allowing them flexibility to focus on research without taking on additional responsibilities such as a teaching assistantship.  STARS Fellow first year retention was 93% exceeding the first year retention for all Ph.D. students.  Among Northeastern\u2019s 26 STARS Fellows, 50% are women. As of the completion of the 2018 LSAMP BD award, all current STARS Fellows are on schedule for completing qualifying exams.  STARS Fellows participate in LEADERs, a distinctive experiential leadership program that equips students with critical skills to manage themselves in their research groups and professional settings.\n \nThe LSAMP BD STARS Fellowship program established three programmatic thrusts Intentional &amp; Proactive Recruitment, Inclusive Research Environments and Academic Guidance &amp; Mentoring.  Partnering with Northeastern\u2019s nine colleges and enrollment management office, the STARS Fellowship program implemented a data-driven strategy for intentional and proactive recruitment leveraging Northeastern and LSAMP networks, which included a new fly-in event, VIEW, prior to the admission cycle; a holistic admissions review process; and proactive recruitment through national databases.   Each STARS Fellow is immediately immersed in an inclusive research environment with a dedicated faculty mentor who has participated in inclusive mentoring training as well as resources to immediately engage in research and conferences.  Academic guidance &amp; mentoring is achieve through regular bi-weekly professional programming to build community, provide just-in-time academic supports and prepare Fellows for long-term career paths via three Northeastern communities: their research group, their Ph.D. program cohort and the STARS Fellow community.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/27/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sara Wadia-Fascetti"
