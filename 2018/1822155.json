 "awd_abstract_narration": "Southern Illinois University Carbondale plans to work together with Arizona State University, the University of Arizona, the University of Southern California, and the University of Connecticut to form a new NSF Industry University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) for Networked, Embedded, Smart and Trusted Things (NESTT). The vision of the NESTT Center is to contribute to the development of an equitable, safe and secure connected world, focusing on creating holistic Internet of Things (IoT) solutions by integrating technology disciplines with expertise in other areas such as law, business, and humanities.\r\n\r\nThis planning grant's objective is to organize with industry partners and the participating universities to outline a research agenda and explore industry commitment.  At the IUCRC planning meeting, SIUC faculty will present their interdisciplinary research interests, spanning the technology areas of embedded systems, networking, edge and cloud computing, smart grid, machine learning, data analytics, and security. Innovative high performance, trustworthy, and secure IoT solutions for transportation, smart cities, energy, and healthcare will be developed. Researchers in non-engineering disciplines, particularly privacy, trade secret rights, and contractual rights, may engage in the Center's activities.\r\n\r\nIf the planning meeting is successful, the efforts of SIUC and partner universities in NESTT could help implement IoT solutions that will improve the quality of life and sustainability. Lowering the barriers to the adoption of IoT technologies through holistic multidisciplinary design and innovation in embedded, networked, trusted, and secure things, our efforts will help realize the full potential of the IoT, and deliver significant economic, societal and environmental returns. The planning meeting will explore ways to broaden the participation of underrepresented students. For example, SIUC will engage with the Success in Engineering through Excellence and Diversity program.\r\n\r\nThe agenda, list of participants, and activities of the NESTT IUCRC planning meeting and workshops will be posted on SIUC's website for the Consortium for Embedded Systems (CES), https://ces.siu.edu. Once NESTT is established, CES will be merged with the NESTT site.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
