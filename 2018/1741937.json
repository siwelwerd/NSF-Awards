 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Eastern Mennonite University (EMU) STEM Scholars Engaging in Local Problems (SSELP) program will  provide 14 scholarships to academically talented, low-income students who\u00a0will pursue employment, service, or continued education in high-need STEM  fields regionally and nationwide. This program will use the local community and the surrounding Shenandoah Valley as a rich resource to\u00a0inspire and\u00a0teach students STEM concepts in a hands-on, problem-to-solution based manner. Scholars will\u00a0receive early and consistent exposure to inquiry- and problem-based learning through mini-research projects that are embedded in their courses and focused on real-world issues. In addition, EMU will offer a new Science and Engineering Practicum course for first year scholars.\u00a0 This practicum will highlight the variety of STEM careers by providing interactions between students and STEM professionals across different careers followed by reflective writing on those experiences.\u00a0\u00a0Scholarships, with\u00a0several\u00a0academic interventions and supports including tutoring, mentoring, career skill-building, encourage academically talented, low-income students\u00a0to\u00a0pursue and persist in STEM majors. These interventions are designed to heighten student commitment to serving as active, contributing citizens; build self-efficacy; engage them in their STEM studies; and help them to envision multiple STEM career pathways.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe\u00a0SSELP program will\u00a01) recruit two cohorts of seven academically talented, low-income students majoring in biology, chemistry, biochemistry, engineering, computer science, mathematics, or environmental science; 2) retain 93% (13/14) of SSELP scholars to Year 2; 3) graduate 14 SSELP scholars\u00a0in four years\u00a0and place 93% of them (within one year\u00a0of graduation) in jobs, service programs, or graduate programs related to STEM; and 4) generate undergraduate STEM education knowledge by exploring the extent to which a place-based interdisciplinary project develops STEM students' level of motivation for their major.  Student motivation for STEM studies will be assessed using validated surveys before and after their participation in the local-based, interdisciplinary, collaborative project.  These quantitative data will be enhanced by qualitative information gathered from semi-structured interviews with the SSELP scholars.  While the impact of place-based learning has been shown to improve engagement and motivation in primary and secondary students, there is a gap in scholarly work on this for higher education settings.  Thus, the SSELP program will also contribute to the growing knowledge on student efficacy and motivation.",
