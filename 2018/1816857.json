 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hybrid cars enable energy-efficient transportation solutions by simply recycling kinetic energy to potential energy stored in a battery.  The concept of hybridization in vehicles is analogous to proposed research activities on this project for computation with charge recycling. Charge-recycling circuits allow for the recycling of the energy from the electrical charge used in computation into electromagnetic energy; consequently, reducing waste of energy in computation.  This project will provide the blueprint for the implementation of charge recycling principles to commercial and consumer electronics.  Green computing with charge recycling, particularly as it impacts smart cities with internet-of-things solutions as targeted in this work, is a contemporary area that is a major recruiting tool, including from students from underrepresented populations in STEM.  Educational materials will be disseminated for the training of a truly diverse, multi-disciplinary workforce in electronics at the undergraduate and graduate levels with the new charge recycling computing principles.  A multitude of research and project-type experience opportunities will be made available, in the form of NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates and the Vertically Integrated Projects programs.  \r\n\r\nA primary goal of this project is to explore the peculiarities of implementing charge-recycling solutions at the scale of an industrial processor core down to a small application-specific integrated circuit node and ultimately deliver greener computing devices.  Innovative solutions are offered at the transistor-level, gate-level and computer architecture level.  Performance metrics that are industry-standard are adopted at each of these levels and will be used in the process of technology transfer of the developed novelties to industry.  The project entails transformative goals in disrupting the conventional CMOS-based digital logic design process in industry and enable more portable and increasingly faster computing solutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project is about exploring ways to reuse the energy wasted in integrated circuits.  While most of the energy we provide to circuits is used in computation, there is a non-negligible amount that is not utilized in desirable manner, in other words, wasted.  Some of this wasted energy, such as energy lost through leakage, is preventable through better design and manufacturing techniques.  Not unlike the loss of heat from a house, energy of an integrated circuit \"leaks\", and can be prevented through better design and manufacturing.\n\nThis project focuses on recycling the \"wasted energy\" by redesigning the order of transistors into charge-recycling orientation. This is an innovation in design, not necessitating any change in the advanced manufacturing infrastructure of integrated circuits.   The energy from one stage of operation is recycled to the next stage for consecutive stages.   Instead of being wasted into heat, the energy is recycled into a supply for the next stage.  The research identified ways to accomplish such an operation at a large scale where circuits can be built in larger dimensions, complexities.  One milestone is the development of CRLSYS (charge recycling logic synthesis) software, which is the automation tool to realizes large scale charge recycling circuits automatically.\n\nThe development of the synthesis tool and the hardware realization, both at the transistor level and the system level, provided opportunities for 3 PhD students and 3 undergraduates students training on these topics of interest.  The results were present at scientific meetings, seminars at other universities, and published for public dissemination.  The graduate students involved in the project, as well as PI, volunteered in a non profit Coded by Kids, assisting in the introduction of students in West Philadelphia to computing and IT disciplines.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/12/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Baris Taskin"
