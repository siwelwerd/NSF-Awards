 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this project, Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO) will transform the recently retired McMath-Pierce Solar Telescope into an astronomy visualization and presentation center.  The newly renovated McMath-Pierce facility will be fully integrated with the existing Kitt Peak Visitor Center (KPVC) and the combined operation will be called the Windows on the Universe Center for Astronomy Outreach.  Two astronomy data visualization systems -- Science On A Sphere (SOS) and GeoDome Digital Planetarium -- along with interactive exhibits and an astronomy classroom will be installed.  Both GeoDome and SOS are equipped to take astronomical imagery and modify it for spherical or hemispherical projection.   The images and animations developed at KPNO can be shared with other facilities employing both SOS and the GeoDome (currently over 225 such facilities worldwide). The goals of this project are to develop the International Astronomy Outreach Center (IAOC), run by KPVC, as a functioning, self-sustaining astronomy outreach center, and expand the focus of the programs to include all NSF-supported astronomy. The benefits of such a program include:  1) significantly improved capability of the KPVC to present more engaging astronomy-based experiences to onsite guests, and 2) extended reach beyond those who travel to Kitt Peak.\r\n\r\nThis project provides a new, cost-effective model for conversion of an outdated science facility to a self-supporting educational facility that communicates the process and results of modern astronomical research. The long history of major investment in the facility will continue to generate returns as the facility is preserved and transformed into a new 21st-century astronomy outreach center using research-based best practices in science visualization and communication. Using the Science On A Sphere (SOS) and GeoDome Digital Planetarium platforms, Kitt Peak gains a highly capable facility to serve its visitors in new ways, while all NSF-funded astronomy facilities gain new global exposure through astronomy visualizations to public audiences without major investments. The Center will acquire imagery from NSF-funded astronomy and astrophysics facilities from around the globe, and then transform those files into data sets for presentation on both SOS and the GeoDome, and for distribution to all so-equipped sites for immediate display.  This enables a major expansion and enhancement of existing programs and the creation of new programs. Guests to KPNO will have a wider window on modern astronomy, and regional and Tribal schools will benefit from new STEM education experiences. Visitors to museums and parks elsewhere in the US and other countries will see astronomy results created in this new, far-reaching facility displayed in their SOS theaters and GeoDome planetaria.   Finally, this project preserves a venerable and iconic solar telescope, which, although eclipsed by the new capabilities of the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope, is useful for public education activities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
