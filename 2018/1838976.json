 "awd_abstract_narration": "Color centers in semiconductors, such as diamond, have emerged as a promising platform for implementation of scalable quantum technologies (quantum computers and quantum internet). However, most of the results so far are impractical, proof-of-concept demonstrations in laboratories, and rely on experiments at ultracold temperature, with long experiment times resulting from poor system efficiencies. In order to enable a true quantum leap, this research will develop a low noise, high fidelity and efficiency, practical and scalable quantum technology which operates in friendlier environments and could thus be ubiquitous. The proposed research will impact quantum engineering and devices, fundamental physics, and materials science. The interdisciplinary team consists of world leading experts in the areas of quantum optics theory and experiment, materials processing and nanofabrication, quantum technologies, and optimized photonics design.  The project includes educational and outreach activities integrated with research, which the PIs have already initiated, including active recruitment of minorities and women for science and engineering careers, development of new classes, undergraduate research and advising, and participation in outreach programs for K-12 students and teachers. \r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\n\r\nThis project is focused on engineering high quality, practical qubits based on diamond color centers with inversion symmetry (Si, Ge, and Sn vacancy) which are more robust to their environment than their non-symmetric counterparts (such as nitrogen vacancy). The effort will be focused on engineering high quality qubits with excellent optical interfaces, where strain, as well as optical and acoustic phonon density of states will be locally controlled by fabrication methods (such as deposition of stressors, annealing) and by structure geometry. The goal is to increase quantum efficiency and enable long coherence times at elevated temperatures (potentially up to ~77K). In addition, photonic optimization methods will be used to increase efficiency of quantum circuits and to increase the yield of functional, optically interconnected quantum devices on chip. The proposed effort has the potential to revolutionize the field of quantum engineering and cavity QED by enabling scalable experiments in friendlier environments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
