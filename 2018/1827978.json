 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Luther College to acquire an inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). ICP-OES is a powerful instrument able to sensitively measure small amounts of elements such as calcium, iron, zinc, copper, and other metals in various types of complex samples. This instrument will be a valuable resource for enhancing research and education at Luther College where faculty extensively engage undergraduate students in their research activities. The ICP-OES will be a central component of several research programs as well as Chemistry and Environmental Studies courses at Luther College. Access to this technology will enable Luther College faculty to more effectively train the next generation of scientists and provide opportunities for students that are not available in a formal class setting. Additionally, the instrument will allow expansion of ongoing water quality research to complement and strengthen community outreach efforts centered around water, which is vital to our local community and state.\r\n\r\nThe ICP-OES will expand research directions for both new and ongoing projects at Luther College. One application will investigate how organisms, such as the small nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, regulate metal concentrations. This work will increase our understanding of the role of metals in growth, reproduction, and survival of cells and organisms support. Another project will use the ICP-OES to examine connections between trace metals, antibiotic resistant bacteria, and animal waste in aquatic environments, including surface and ground water. Further, the ICP-OES will enhance an ongoing project focused on how bacteria sense and respond to metals and expand the knowledge of how metals impact bacteria in ecosystems and natural environments. Finally, an innovative project focused on developing novel nanocrystals has the potential for a better understanding of the conversion of light to electrical energy for solar technology applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
