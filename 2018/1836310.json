In addition, the project will conduct social network analysis to improve our understanding of how best to support computer science teachers virtually and provide opportunities for research on online communities for CS teachers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
