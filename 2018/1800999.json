 "awd_abstract_narration": "Predominantly, cybersecurity education focuses on theory and skills to build secure programs, networks, and systems, but in the event of a cyberattack, when security is breached, theories and models are not enough. To increase national security for the U.S. and meet its workforce needs, cybersecurity education must develop new knowledge and skills. To address this need, the Cyber Up! Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) project at Coastline Community College in California will research, create, adapt, adopt, and implement a suite of course content that supports a Certificate of Achievement and an Associate of Science degree. As a Center for Academic Excellence-Two Year (CAE2Y), the implementation of DFIR has the potential to be transformative, bringing about needed and important change to U.S. education and security. Thus, the program expects to increase the availability and readiness of qualified cybersecurity technicians in the U.S. workforce, resulting in greater global competitiveness for the U.S. economy and increased national security. A comprehensive project evaluation will measure the DFIR program's effectiveness, which will in turn support adaptation and replication by other institutions. \r\n\r\nThe project will focus on the development of curricula that will teach students and professionals the cybersecurity knowledge and skills of digital forensics and incident response, which need to be deployed in real-time and are dynamic to changing situations during and in response to cyberattacks. Through the DFIR program, the project intends to create adoptable educational resources; form academic, government, and industry partnerships; and prepare qualified cybersecurity technicians and professionals for entry into, or advancement within, the U.S. workforce. The DFIR distance education modalities will be designed for a national reach and assist in preparing students for successful employment. It will work towards providing cybersecurity advancement through its various modalities since the content, courses, certificate, and degree will all be available online. The project will also develop virtual labs and faculty resources. The DFIR program will aim to reach educators, institutions, and diverse populations with important new knowledge and skills in digital forensics and incident response. Faculty development will provide educators new knowledge and enhance their abilities in these new technological and pedagogical skill-sets, leading to enriched educational structures at the institution. Because of the adoptable, modular content, other institutions can benefit through adoption into their programs, creating pathways to greater skills and knowledge for students and professionals. Increasing skills and knowledge in diverse and underrepresented populations in cybersecurity will help to assure increased participation of women, minorities, and special populations in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and in the STEM workforce. Thus, the program will strive to generate important new knowledge and skills to share with students, professionals, and the academic community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Campers toured the FBI's mobile forensics van, met Goose from the Fontana Police K-9 unit, and meditated twice daily for stress relief. Campers used forensic software to examine digital evidence of a mock case based on suspicious activity related to the purchase of tiger cubs. In teams, the campers developed a forensic report which included an examination of the digital evidence, their findings of suspicious activity, and how the evidence was case related. On the last day, teams presented an overview of their forensics examination and analysis to FBI agents, industry professionals, and college faculty.</p>\n<p><strong>Course and Lab Materials<br /></strong>Below are links to the courses in the Canvas Commons.

Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) project has successfully created and implemented a series of six cybersecurity courses to address the urgent need for hands-on skills in cybersecurity education. This project supported the creation of virtual machine lab environments designed with industry-recognized tools by professionals in specialized cybersecurity roles. Each course in the Associate of Science in DFIR includes simulated exercises to help students prepare for entry-level positions in the cybersecurity workforce.\n\nOverarching Project Goals \n\nResearch other DFIR programs.\nAssemble and collaborate with an industry advisory board to identify workforce needs related to DFIR work roles.\nDevelop course outlines for six courses.\nDevelop an Associate of Science Degree and a Certificate of Achievement in DFIR.\nCreate model course content and hands-on lab assignments.\nDisseminate model course content to other interested institutions.\n\n\nIndustry Advisory Board\nCoastline College's (Coastline) Technology Department has an industry advisory board for computer networking and cybersecurity. After researching other academic and workforce training programs nationwide, Coastline collaborated with Fullerton College to establish an additional advisory board representing the specialized work roles for DFIR. In collaboration with industry professionals, university faculty, high school teachers, and federal employees, the project developed a degree program to meet local needs and prepare students for entry-level positions and continued education.\n\nSpecial Agent, Digital Forensics, FBI\nCybersecurity Specialist, NASA\nForensics Specialist, High Tech Crime Investigation Association\nProgram Manager, Hi-Tech Crimes &amp; Surveillance Unit, Office of Criminal Investigations\nForensics Specialist, Department of Corrections\nOperational Technology Division, FBI\nForensics Specialist, Verizon\nIncident Response Consultant, CrowdStrike\nDirector, Cisco\nOwner, Golden Star Technology\nCybersecurity Specialist, Undisclosed\nProgram Manager New Collar Initiatives, IBM\nCISO, Desert Research Institute\nLaw Enforcement, Government Agency\nCybersecurity Specialist, Coast Community College District\nForensics Specialist, Qualcomm\nProfessor, Fullerton College\nDepartment Chair, College of Southern Nevada\nForensics Instructor, College of Southern Nevada\nDirector, Webster University\nProfessor CIS, California State Polytechnic University, Pomona\n\n\nProgram Development\nAs of Fall 2020, the DFIR degree and certificate were in the Coastline College catalog. The new Introduction to Cybersecurity course was added to both programs effective Fall 2022.\n\nAS in Digital Forensics &amp; Incident Response \nhttps://catalog.cccd.edu/coastline/pathways/technology/cybersecurity/digital-forensics-incident-response-associate-science/\n\nCertificate of Achievement in Digital Forensics &amp; Incident Response \nhttps://catalog.cccd.edu/coastline/pathways/technology/cybersecurity/digital-forensics-incident-response-certificate-achievement/\n\n\n\nOutreach &amp; Education Pathways\nFaculty established many new relationships through the industry advisory board and promotion of the project. To increase awareness and career exploration opportunities, Coastline hosted pathway events designed to promote the DFIR program to middle school and high school students. These events continue to bring opportunities for high school dual enrollment programs. \n\nCyberTech Girls | Leap into Cybersecurity\nhttps://cybertechgirls.org/ctg-oc-2020/\nAt this one-day event, attendees &#8203;explored careers in cybersecurity workshops, including a digital forensics mock crime scene. It was an &#8203;exciting &#8203;mix &#8203;of &#8203;hands-on &#8203;experience, &#8203;meeting &#8203;inspirational &#8203;women &#8203;in &#8203;security, &#8203;and &#8203;fun.\n\nGenCyber Girls at Coastline College \nhttps://cybertechgirls.org/gencyber-girls-summer-camp-2021/\nThe GenCyber summer camp for female high school students focused on careers in digital forensics and law enforcement. Campers toured the FBI's mobile forensics van, met Goose from the Fontana Police K-9 unit, and meditated twice daily for stress relief. Campers used forensic software to examine digital evidence of a mock case based on suspicious activity related to the purchase of tiger cubs. In teams, the campers developed a forensic report which included an examination of the digital evidence, their findings of suspicious activity, and how the evidence was case related. On the last day, teams presented an overview of their forensics examination and analysis to FBI agents, industry professionals, and college faculty.\n\nCourse and Lab Materials\nBelow are links to the courses in the Canvas Commons.
