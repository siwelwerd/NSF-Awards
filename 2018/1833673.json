Supported participants shall also have the opportunity to attend the associated Gordon Research Seminar, to take place June 23-June 24 in the same location. The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Correlated Electron Systems is a long-running series whose objective is to explore and understand the physics of strongly correlated electron systems (SCES). This GRC meets biennially and covers the most active research topics in this profoundly important subfield of Condensed Matter Physics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
