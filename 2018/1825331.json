 "awd_abstract_narration": "Applications of nanostructured silicon in, e.g., consumer products, nanomedicine and rechargeable batteries, would benefit from economical production of porous silicon powder on the kilogram-to-ton scale needed in new technologies essential for national prosperity. Electroless etching, which is an electrochemical process that is recognized possessing industrial potential but requiring advances in its reproducibility, controllability, purity, cost and scaling. This research will develop a new electrochemical process called regenerative electroless etching (ReEtching), a new concept in electroless wet etching with the capability of producing nanostructured and hierarchically structured semiconductors. ReEtching is a method in which one oxidant is used to continuously regenerate a low concentration of a second oxidant in the reaction mixture which is used in the reaction. These investigations will transform electroless etching from an irreproducible procedure into a process that can produce homogeneous porous films of arbitrary thickness, produce pillared particles of arbitrary length, produce either crystalline or amorphous pillars, produce hierarchical porous materials with nanopores inside of mesopores or nanopores inside of macropores. This work is carried out in a primarily undergraduate institution with strong international components providing the undergraduates involved in the research a unique international research experience.\r\n\r\nRegenerative electroless etching (ReEtching) is a electroless wet etching process with the capability of producing nanostructured and hierarchically structured semiconductors. ReEtching produces nanostructured semiconductors in a process which an oxidant (Ox1) is used as a catalytic agent to facilitate reaction between a semiconductor and a second oxidant (Ox2) that would be unreactive in the primary reaction. Ox2 is used to regenerate Ox1, which is capable of initiating etching. The extent of reaction is controlled by the amount of Ox2 added and the rate of reaction is controlled by the injection rate of Ox2. A specific example is the production of highly luminescent, nanocrystalline porous Si powder through reaction with V2O5 (the catalytic agent) and H2O2 (the regeneration agent) in HF(aq). Because it facilitates control the rate of reaction independent of the extent of reaction, ReEtching possesses previously unattainable processing capabilities. This grant will transform electroless etching from an irreproducible procedure into a process that can produce homogeneous porous films of arbitrary thickness, produce pillared particles of arbitrary length, produce either crystalline or amorphous pillars, produce hierarchical porous materials with nanopores inside of mesopores or nanopores inside of macropores. These meso-to-nanostructures will be characterized by photoluminescence and correlated with the materials structural parameters. Extension to other semiconductors will be developed.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We aimed to obtain a more fundamental understanding of electroless etching, that is, etching performed electrochemically that uses spontaneous reactions rather than hooking up electrodes to a power supply as in anodic etching. We would then use this fundamental understanding to obtain better control over the etching of silicon and attempt to expand beyond silicon into other silicon containing materials and semiconductors. These studies allowed the PI to train 11 undergraduate students, who not only participated in and disseminated fundamental scientific research, but also helped to develop aspects of this research into outreach activities to encourage elementary, middle school and high school students to continue in STEM related studies. Over 100 students were involved in the outreach events. Four of these undergraduates went on to graduate school at Berkely, Penn State, Princeton, and Temple universities.</p>\n<p>Regenerative electroless etching (ReEtching) is a technique invented by the PI. It uses a catalytic amount of an oxidant in combination with injection of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) to control the rate and extent of etching. We demonstrated that we can greatly increase the efficiency of the process while also developing techniques to produce hierarchical nanostructures. These are materials that contain nanostructures with at least two distinct classes of size, for instance, boring 4-nm pores into the walls of 15-nm pores. We discovered that we can extend the benefits of ReEtching to metal assisted catalytic etching (MACE). In this hybrid technique we named iMACE, deposited metal nanoparticles act as the catalyst for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> decomposition, which is again introduced by controlled injection. The optimized ReEtching and iMACE techniques were used on silicon powders with 1?50 ?m particle size to produce gram scale batches of meso- or macro-porous silicon. Not only can we produce arbitrarily large batches rapidly (the whole etch process takes 2?3 hours) but we also learned how to make porosity and pore size distribution tunable based on variation of parameters such as the molar ratio of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to silicon, reaction temperature, silicon doping, and the chemical identity and amount of nanoparticle metal catalyst. A patent application has been submitted for the iMACE process, and a start-up was founded to exploit ReEtching and iMACE.</p>\n<p>Our ability to produce large amounts of nanostructured porous silicon has facilitated a number of spin-off studies. ReEtching produces high-surface-area photoluminescent porous silicon (por-Si). We discovered that coating the surfaces of ReEtched por-Si with sugars enhances their photoluminescence. But the sugar coating was only physisorbed so it washed off with water. This led us to explore chemically binding small organic molecules to por-Si. We used both laser ablation in liquids and mechanochemistry for this purpose. We published results on how to chemically anchor arginine to por-Si nanoparticles. This is particularly interesting since the arginine-covered surface has a positive zeta potential, which might facilitate cellular uptake of por-Si nanoparticles. This led us to pursue studies with a colleague in biology that demonstrated por-Si nanoparticles have antibacterial activity that can be enhanced by doping them with copper nanoparticles.</p>\n<p>Hierarchical photoluminescent por-Si powders were passivated by attaching undecylenic acid to their surfaces and then ground into nanoparticles. These nanoparticles retained their photoluminescence, the wavelength of which was tuned by varying the amount of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> injected. These nanoparticles were shown to be suitable for <em>in vitro</em> bioimaging studies with either one-photon or two-photon confocal microscopy. Furthermore, the surfaces of these passivated particles were functionalized with a peptide, which facilitated cellular uptake of the nanoparticles when they were cultured with prostate cancer cells. Photoluminescence from the particles allowed us to confirm cellular uptake.</p>\n<p>The optimization of iMACE, including the discovery of a process we named low-load MACE, to produce large quantities of por-Si with scalable surface area, pore size and pore size distributions has allowed up to pursue ancillary studies not only for biological applications, but also for materials science applications. Previously only precious metals such as silver, gold, palladium and platinum have been used in MACE. With the introduction of iMACE, we demonstrated that much cheaper copper can also be used. Using copper iMACE we produced mesoporous silicon that was sent to collaborators in Czechia. They performed lithiation experiments and experiments involving atomic layer deposition (ALD) in an attempt to enhance the cycling behavior of rechargeable lithium ion batteries. Preliminary results were promising and will be pursued further.</p>\n<p>We demonstrated that hierarchical por-Si can be produced by ReEtching of AlSi alloys, the photoluminescence of which can be enhanced by coating with sugars. Crystallographically defined etch structures have been observed in multiple metal sulfide semiconductors with a modified ReEtching procedure. While promising, the results require further investigation to determine how and whether porosification can be obtained.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/26/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kurt&nbsp;W&nbsp;Kolasinski</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1825331/1825331_10557668_1653526629180_HLvLLMACE--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1825331/1825331_10557668_1653526629180_HLvLLMACE--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Injection MACE Regimes\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1825331/1825331_10557668_1653526629180_HLvLLMACE--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Injection MACE Regimes\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Injection of oxidant during metal assisted catalytic etching (MACE) allowed us to discover a new regime in which a low load of metal leads to uncorrelated motion of the metal catalyst during etching and more controllable porous silicon structure.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">K.
