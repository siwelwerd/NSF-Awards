 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research\r\n(SBIR) project is significant as it offers a disruptive new mechanical approach to stroke\r\ntreatment. Each year, 795,000 strokes occur in the U.S., 1.7 million strokes in Europe, and\r\nnearly 20.5 million strokes worldwide. This public-private partnership is expected to have an\r\nimportant positive societal impact on the community by saving lives especially the elderly and\r\ndecreasing the economic burden of stroke on the taxpayer. This life-saving device has a unique\r\nvalue proposition for health-systems with lower inventory costs from a single size device, and\r\nfor patients with better vessel re-opening rates, thereby saving brain cells. This textile-based\r\nbraided retrievable stent, also known as an embolus retriever or thrombectomy-assist device is\r\nan innovation that will enhance scientific and technological understanding of how personalized\r\nmedicine can transform the care of stroke patients in the U.S. and worldwide.\r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to bring to market the industry?s longest blood clot\r\nor embolus retriever for removal of short and long clots that can be customized by the operator\r\nbased on each patient?s clot burden. In addition, it is the first textile-based braided retrievable\r\nstent which works well in conjunction with standard catheter-based aspiration systems for stroke\r\ntreatment developed in the U.S. that can be personalized to all clot lengths. Stroke is a major\r\nproblem causing 5.5 million deaths worldwide and currently there is no cost-effective and\r\nefficacious treatments. The mean lifetime healthcare cost per stroke patient is $140,048. This\r\ntextile-based clot retrieval device (aka thrombectomy-assist device) is a cost-effective medical\r\ndevice that can help save a stroke patient?s life. The methods and approaches of this project is\r\nto compare via pre-clinical tests the ability of a textile-based medical device to re-open vessels\r\nblocked with clots compared with existing approved treatments. The goals and scope of the\r\nresearch will focus on the ability to rapidly re-open vessels that are blocked by clots. This paves\r\nthe way for personalized medicine with a customizable stroke treatment device that can be\r\ntailored to a patient?s clot burden.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Insera Therapeutics has developed a stroke tool kit that addresses all of this with a cyclical aspiration system that can be used alone (Fig. 4) in majority of the patients (simple technique for ease of use and scaling up) and in the future, in a selected patient population, a braided thrombectomy assist device may be used adjunctively with the cyclical aspiration system (Fig. 5).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The findings from this project are likely to make a significant impact on personalized medicine for stroke care. Inseras flagship technology, the CLEAR<sup>TM<strong>&nbsp;</strong></sup>Aspiration System, is the industry's first stroke device that leverages varying the vacuum suction pressures to remove stroke-causing blood clots. It is a unique combination of a cyclical vacuum aspiration system (hardware) with algorithms and proprietary data in an iPad app (software) that allows stroke surgeons (neuro-interventionalists) to tailor treatments to each stroke patient thereby improving outcomes both safely (reducing clot fragmentation during retrieval) and effectively (improving complete clot ingestion).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>The same technology can also be leveraged for multiple clinical indications (Fig. 6).
