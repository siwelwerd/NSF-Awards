These SIAM conferences form an important part of the research, education and technology transfer infrastructure for applied and computational mathematics. The funding of this grant will support travel of students and early career professionals, facilitating the integration of education with research. The funding will also support the travel of invited speakers to the conferences and the dissemination of invited conference presentations to the wider community through selective recording of talks and/or live streaming. \r\n\r\nSIAM conferences and workshops are highly interdisciplinary and foster the communication of the latest fundamental and applied research and applications to mathematical and computational scientists, physical and social scientists, and engineers from academia, industry and government. SIAM conferences are designed to identify and disseminate knowledge of emerging areas of research. A sampling of conferences to be held during the award period include those on the following topics: Mathematics of Planet Earth (September, 2018), International Conference on Data Mining (April, 2019), Uncertainty Quantification (May, 2020), and Applied Algebraic Geometry (July, 2021).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
