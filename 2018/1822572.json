This fourteenth meeting of CRCNS investigators brings together a broad spectrum of computational neuroscience researchers supported by the program, and includes poster presentations, talks, plenary lectures, and workshops. \r\n\r\nThe meeting is scheduled for June 13-15, 2018 and is hosted by the University of California, Berkeley.  More information is available at https://www.regonline.com/crcns2018.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
