 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum-confinement occurs when an object's dimensions are small compared to the size of electron motion. Many modern electronic devices, which range from medical diagnostics and therapeutics instruments, to high-resolution optical displays and flexible electronics, rely on quantum-confined nanostructures. However, realization of their full potential requires a fundamental understanding of their interactions with light. With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Kenneth Knappenberger from Pennsylvania State University (PSU) is developing advanced magneto-optical measurement capabilities to probe quantum-confined structures.  Professor Knappenberger and his students are using the unique capabilities of this instrument to understand the behavior of electrons in transition metal dicholcogenide (TMD) materials, and how they interact with vibrations in the crystal lattice.  The insights gained from the work could impact existing optoelectronic and photonic technologies, as well as emerging quantum information and sensing applications. The project is also providing training opportunities for future scientists in advanced experimental techniques.  As part of this project, Professor Knappenberger has established a local student section of the Optical Society of America at Penn State. This activity facilitates a weekly brown-bag optics club lunch, hosted in the Millennium Science Complex at PSU. Students are able to present their research progress in an informal setting that includes faculty, postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate students. The program also includes a component for a high school volunteer student. This student acquires skills in data analysis and processing.   \r\n\r\nThe research team is developing and using novel variable-temperature, variable-magnetic field (VTVH) spectroscopy methods to characterize the electronic structure of a series of two-dimensionally confined quantum materials, including multi-component structures featuring combinations of 0-D/1-D/2-D systems. The overall objective is to understand how electronic carrier coupling to low-frequency phonon modes affects the relaxation dynamics of these systems. In order to achieve this fundamental research goal, the team is developing VTVH ultrafast two-dimensional spectroscopy (VTVH-2DES) capabilities, and using them to characterize key parameters of transient exciton states, such as Lande g factors, zero-field splitting energies, and electron-phonon coupling strengths. Monitoring transient signal amplitudes from these excitons in the time- and energy-domains provides insight into phonon-mediated energy relaxation and transfer in quantum materials. The research activities include 1) understanding the optical properties and electronic structure for single and multi-layer 2-D confined TMDs, 2) development of VTVH-2DES infrastructure of characterizing TMD transient states, 3) quantitatively describing quantum-state-specific electron-phonon coupling and carrier dynamics for TMDs; and 4) understanding fundamental mechanisms of phonon-mediated energy transfer in multi-component quantum structures.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our research under this award has led to many key new understandings of how the structure of multi-component materials affects fundamental properties related to these applications. Our research team has developed new experimental capabilities that provide atomic-level descriptions of structure-property correlations. Examples include the development of nonlinear optical microscopes that combine the highest possible spatial accuracies (10<sup>-9</sup>&nbsp;meters) and temporal resolutions (10<sup>-15</sup>&nbsp;seconds) while maintaining spectroscopic insights.

Interest in these systems stems from the ability of metal plasmon modes to strongly absorb and concentrate light on the nanoscale. Unfortunately, these systems are plagued by large energy losses that reduce energy conversion efficiency. In part, these losses are due to rapid electronic carrier scattering with low-frequency vibrations of the material. A proposed solution to this problem is to transfer electronic energy across interfaces before losses to low-frequency vibrations can occur &ndash; so-called &ldquo;hot&rdquo; electron transfer. In order to probe these mechanisms, our&nbsp;<strong>intellectual merit</strong>&nbsp;involved the development and employment of few-cycle time-resolved two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES). Unlike most ultrafast spectroscopy techniques, 2DES provides the homogeneous linewidth of metal plasmon modes, which is proportional to electronic temperature. This effect is illustrated in Figure 1. Figure 1 (top right) shows the homogeneous linewidth (G<sub>h</sub>) of the plasmon after photoexcitation. The time dependence of the linewidth is shown in the bottom figure panels; broadening of the linewidth reflects hot electron dynamics and subsequent narrowing tracks carrier scattering by low-frequency vibrations. As such, energy transfer by &ldquo;hot&rdquo; electrons can be distinguished from transfer by thermalized carriers. We have employed this method to study electron dynamics in metal alloys (AuPt) and a gold-metal chalcogenide semiconductor series. We successfully demonstrated that careful alignment of the semiconductor valence and conduction bands with the gold Fermi level has a significant impact on hot carrier transfer efficiency (Figure 2). &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Electronic-to-vibrational energy transfer at metal-ligand interfaces.</span></strong>&nbsp;The&nbsp;<strong>Intellectual Merit</strong>&nbsp;of this work involved using ultrafast spectroscopy to study excitation mechanisms of low-frequency vibrations in ligand-protected metal nanoclusters. We have distinguished two excitation mechanisms, which depend on hot electron lifetimes and the single-cycle period of a nanocluster vibrational mode. Direct excitation occurs when hot electron lifetimes are comparable to vibrational periods. Indirect excitation results when vibrational periods are long compared to electronic lifetimes; vibrational modes are launched by a hot lattice in this case. Time domain measurements of these fundamental electronic-to-vibrational energy transfer processes have many connections to applications of&nbsp;<strong>broader impacts</strong>. For example, the coherent time-domain signals from these low frequency modes can be used for trace-level mass sensing of molecules and viruses. Functioning as nanomechanical resonators, the nanoclusters can serve as master clocks in integrated circuits, but with a much smaller footprint than quartz-based systems. Distinguishing these excitation mechanisms is essential because the distinct phase coherence of each must be understood for their integration, use, and interpretation in a device platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 3 shows the two different modes studied.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Energy transfer at semiconductor-molecule interfaces.</span></strong>&nbsp;The&nbsp;<strong>Intellectual Merit</strong>&nbsp;of this work includes use of 2DES spectroscopy and microscopy to study electron transfer in 2D MoS<sub>2</sub>-polyoxometalate (POM) heterostructures.
