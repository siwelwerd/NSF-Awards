 "awd_abstract_narration": "Animals of all species need to recognize potential mates and known foes, and adjust their behavior accordingly. The brain has evolved hardwired neural pathways for controlling key social behaviors like aggression and mating, but basic organizing principles of these neural circuits remain poorly understood. This project tests how pheromonal signals-- chemical signals that impact behavior of the receiving organism-- are used to guide reproduction-specific behaviors, and how the corresponding neural pathways are altered by social experience. Like many animals, male mice form dominance hierarchies that strongly influence their behavior, where aggression is reduced in low-status males and preserved or increased in high-status males. The present experiments examine how becoming familiar with new social partners changes the way their pheromonal signals are processed in the brain, shifting thresholds for triggering aggressive behavior in dominant and submissive animals. First, to examine the basic biological processes that underlie learning, the investigators use single-neuron recordings to test the cellular changes that alter their responses to familiar individuals. Second, the investigators use new tools for visualizing neural activity during active social interactions, evaluating how familiarity shapes the patterns of brain activity corresponding to both dominant and submissive partners. Overall, this work addresses the neural changes that allow animals to adapt their behavior to reflect the history of their social experience with others. The project also offers opportunities for local high school students and undergraduate trainees from diverse backgrounds to engage in neuroscience research, including the use of cutting-edge technologies, and includes the development and dissemination of educational materials for local elementary schools and a science museum.\r\n\r\nKey social behaviors, such as aggression, reproduction, and parenting are controlled by conserved neural circuits with strong similarities across species. Despite their critical role, little is known about the pathways that translate sensory cues into male- and female-appropriate behaviors. This project characterizes neural coding and plasticity in the mouse vomeronasal system, which plays a key role in mapping social chemosignals onto sex-specific responses. The main hypothesis of this work is that distinct behaviors are mediated by dedicated pathways in the accessory olfactory system, which are selectively altered by social experience to reflect individual relationships. It focuses primarily on aggression, a core male behavior that is rapidly and reliably triggered by other males, yet is also dramatically altered as animals establish dominance relationships. To characterize experience-dependent changes in aggression, these experiments combine ex vivo cellular electrophysiology and in vivo imaging of activity in the accessory olfactory bulb, a key node for routing sensory signals to central behavioral networks. The resulting data will address basic principles of sensory coding in a circuit intimately linked to innate behaviors, as well as characterize a novel form of cellular plasticity that may support adaptive changes in diverse social interactions. Together, this work helps establish how the brain organizes and routes the sensory signals that guide stereotyped behavioral responses, while still allowing flexibility in interactions with familiar partners.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSocial interactions are key components of behavior in most species, ranging from insects and mice to humans.  While the brain circuits that control social behaviors like aggression, mating, and parenting are beginning to be understood, many basic principles remain unclear.  Taking advantage of common organizing principles across species for these fundamental social behaviors, this project tested how sensory signals are translated into aggression between male mice, as well as how levels of aggressive behavior are shaped by the outcome of past encounters with other males.  \n\nIn mice, as in most rodents and mammals, aggression is strongly modulated by specialized chemical signals, or pheromones, which are detected by a specialized olfactory system known as the vomeronasal system.  In males, aggression is a sex-specific behavior that is typically only displayed towards other sexually mature males.  While this implies that there are specialized sensory pathways that differentiate between males and female pheromones, the way that the vomeronasal system encodes information about biological characteristics like sex, age, and individual identity is poorly understood.  \n\nThe vomeronasal system has been particularly difficult to study because it is mainly activated when animals are freely moving and actively engaged with one another, requiring technically challenging methods to measure brain activity.  In this study, we used lightweight miniature microscopes that can be attached to the head of freely behaving mice, and used them to capture video measurements of the brain activity generated by pheromones from several different social partners including both males and females.  These data showed that the sensory signals for males and females are strongly overlapping, but a small set of sensory pathways were strongly and selectively activated when mice interacted with either male or female partners.  Male-selective neurons presumably contribute to the pathways responsible for triggering aggression towards other males.  Other neurons were differentially activated by other characteristics such as mice from different genetic backgrounds, suggesting that a substantial part of the vomeronasal system may be dedicated to tracking more nuanced information such as individual identity.  \n\nIn a complementary phase of our study, we also tested how behaviors like aggression are affected by previous social interactions.  Aggressive encounters between male mice lead to dominance hierarchies, where the ?winning? male shows heightened aggression and the ?losing? male reduces their aggression levels.  We allowed mice to form strong hierarchies over several daily encounters, and then used electrical recordings from single neurons in the vomeronasal system to test for characteristic differences between the dominant and submissive animals.  We found that neurons in dominant animals showed much stronger firing when tested with the same stimulus, suggesting that these neurons may control how strongly pheromones are able to transmit signals to the deeper brain structures that ultimately generate aggressive behavior.  \n\nOverall, our work provides a more detailed view of the sensory information that controls social behavior, and establishes cellular-level mechanisms that help explain how aggression levels are modulated by social experience.  This project has also contributed to training and development of scientists across a wide range of career stages ranging from undergraduate to postdoctoral levels, as well as establishing and refining technology for measuring neural activity during complex behavioral states.  \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/18/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ian G Davison"
