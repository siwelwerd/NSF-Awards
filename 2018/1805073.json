 "awd_abstract_narration": "The active transport of microscopic objects is essential for maintaining the bioactivities of living species. Although nature has evolved to possess complex biochemical motors, the development of synthetic motors lags far behind. Recently, a new type of synthetic motor driven by an alternating current electric field was developed, which hold promise for on-demand control of intelligent micro-machines. However, current electrokinetic theory cannot consistently explain their propulsion behavior under different field conditions. A complementary experimental and computational study will be performed to model the hydrodynamic flow surrounding the motors and thus reveal the underlying physical mechanisms that govern the motion of both individual and a large ensemble of motors. This research will provide the fundamental knowledge necessary for the development of technologies to manipulate micro- and nano-scale objects with both spatial and temporal regulations. Education and outreach activities, such as the development of learning modules for K-12 public schools and research summer experience programs for undergraduates, will also be developed with the goal to encourage the participation of underrepresented groups toward university science and engineering programs. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to understand how the electrohydrodynamics of asymmetric particles influence their active behavior ranging from single particle motion to small cluster formation to emergent collective dynamics. Three specific research tasks will be performed: (1) Elucidate the electrohydrodynamic propulsion mechanisms of dielectric particles at both low and high frequencies; (2) Reveal the intricate interplay between hydrodynamic interaction, steric effects, Brownian motion, and electrostatic interaction in the assembly of small clusters; and (3) Investigate the collective behavior of thousands of linear motors and rotating spinners. The experimental framework, by creating asymmetric properties in particles and tuning different field conditions, will allow systematic studies of the propulsion of asymmetric particles and reveal potentially different propulsion mechanisms at low and high frequencies, thus significantly advancing the field of electrokinetics. The computational methods with tunable resolution will also be able to achieve a balance between accuracy and cost, as required for studying the length and time scale of interest. A detailed comparison between experiments and numerical modeling will provide crucial insights and help reveal the underlying physics of electrohydrodynamic motors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

To this end, we have performed the following research tasks. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class=\"TAMainText\">We first investigated the strategy combining a planar magnetic field with a one-dimensional electric field to assemble and actuate linear chains made of paramagnetic microspheres. While a horizontal chain lying on the substrate is symmetric fore and aft and does not translate, a two-dimensional magnetic field can tilt the chain with an angle relative to the substrate. A superimposed alternating-current (AC) electric field leads to the propulsion of tilted chains along the substrate. Our experiments and numerical simulation (Figure 1) confirm that the EHD flow along the electrode is unbalanced surrounding the tilted chain, generating hydrodynamic stresses that both propel the chain and reorient it slightly towards the substrate. Our work takes advantage of both fields, where the magnetic field controls chain orientation while the electric field provides power for locomotion. Our work reveals a propulsion mechanism that breaks the symmetry of hydrodynamic flow by manipulating the orientation of a microscopic object.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Next, we developed a facile route toward forming ordered, anisotropic, and complex structures from microspheres using orthogonally applied electric and magnetic fields. We obtained a high density of well-aligned but individually separated long stripes at low and intermediate particle concentrations (Figure 2). The inter- and intra-stripe spacings were tuned by adjusting the particle concentration and relative field strengths of both fields. At high particle concentrations, the microspheres were assembled into small clusters such as trimers, tetramers, heptamers, and nonamers under the electric field due to the synergy between dipolar interaction and electrohydrodynamic flow. Those clusters, as unique building blocks, were subsequently assembled into hierarchical structures by superimposing a one-dimensional magnetic field (Figure 3). Overall, we develop a method to reach equilibrium states of global configurations with controllable periodicity through competing dipolar and EHD interactions. Our results demonstrate the potential of combining fields to make diversified types of highly aligned structures for applications in high-strength composites, optical materials, or structured battery electrodes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Beyond microspheres, we have also investigated the assembly of dimers. Previously, we observed that the EHD flow could assist the assembly of the chiral colloidal clusters. However, we recently found that the superposition of a rotating magnetic field could also assist the transformation of an otherwise achiral cluster into a chiral one. For example, Figure 4a shows the achiral cluster formed by a central standing dimer and two lying dimers under an AC electric field applied perpendicularly to the substrate. Interestingly, upon applying a clockwise rotating magnetic field, the petals in the achiral cluster can rotate so that it is transformed into a left-handed chiral cluster (Figures 4b-e). This observation broadens the applicability of our combined electric-magnetic fields strategy to make homochiral clusters since the initial colloidal clusters do not have to be chiral. The rotating magnetic field can always transform the achiral clusters into chiral ones. We have also performed Brownian dynamics simulations to understand the behavior of colloidal clusters under both electric and magnetic fields. The simulation results are consistent with experimental observations and explain the underlying mechanism.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finally, inspired by adaptable microbes, we have also performed research that demonstrated that one-dimensional colloidal chains could fold into geometrically complex morphologies, including helices, plectonemes, lassos, and coils and translate via multiple mechanisms that can be varied with an applied magnetic field (Figure 5). With chains of multi-block asymmetry, the propulsion mode can be switched from bulk to surface-enabled, mimicking the swimming of microorganisms such as flagella-rotating bacteria and tail-whipping sperm and the surface-enabled motion of arching and stretching inchworms and sidewinding snakes. We also demonstrated that reconfigurability enables navigation through three-dimensional and narrow channels simulating capillary blood vessels. Our results show that flexible microdevices based on simple chains can transform both shape and motility under varying magnetic fields, a capability we expect will be particularly beneficial in complex in vivo microenvironments.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project supported one MS.
