 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions Program (HSI Program) aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims. This project at Union County College will advance the aims of the HSI Program by integrating research into undergraduate STEM courses.  The project plans to embed course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) into STEM gateway courses, support independent research experiences during the academic year, and develop a summer research academy. The project aims to provide students with research opportunities that increase student engagement, critical thinking skills, retention and graduation rates, and transfer into a STEM major at a four-year institution. Union County College has an economically, racially, and ethnically diverse student body.  Consequently, this project can contribute to building a diverse STEM workforce. \r\n\r\nThe project will examine how research opportunities may increase student engagement, critical thinking skills, student retention and graduation, and transfer into a baccalaureate STEM program. The project includes three coordinated interventions: 1) integrating course-based research into eight STEM gateway courses; 2) supporting independent student-driven research experiences; and 3) creating a summer research academy. These interventions will incorporate student-driven research into the curriculum, enhancing the traditional community college learning experience. The project will assess the impact of research experiences by comparing baseline and post-intervention populations using the Critical-Thinking Assessment Test instrument. In each of the three interventions, the project will use this instrument to determine critical thinking skills at the beginning and completion of the interventions. Students will also be tracked to examine retention in the major. Finally, data will be collected on student performance including grades, enrollment in STEM courses, and graduation and transfer rates. To examine the impact of CURES, a comparison will be made between students who participate in the CURES and baseline data for STEM majors. Students in the academic year research projects and research academy will be compared to students who did not participate, as well as to the college's baseline data. It is anticipated that the project may serve as a model for both two- and four-year institutions seeking to develop a research as pedagogy curriculum model to build critical thinking skills.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The intellectual merit was to test and assess the impact of research experiences on critical thinking skills, retention, and completion for community college STEM students. As a result of IRAP, the research-based interventions have allowed students to take ownership of their projects, make inquiry-based discoveries, and learn to think critically and reflectively.</p>\r\n<p>Central to the gateway STEM course redesigns was the integration of a research project that fits within a standard 15-week semester. The redesigns were designed to prepare students to excel in higher-level courses and STEM degree programs. The course redesigns were implemented in all sections of Introduction to Engineering: Mathematics and Applications (EGG 101), Computer Programming Fundamentals (CST 161), General Chemistry I (CHE 111), General Chemistry II (CHE 112), General Biology (BIO 111), and Unified Calculus I (MAT 171). The Critical-thinking Assessment Test (CAT) was used to assess and promote critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Pre- and post-tests were administered to students in the redesigned STEM courses. In spring 2022, the CAT pre-test was given to students in CHE 111 and CHE 112, with the post-test administered to students in CHE 111. Students in CHE 111 increased their mean score from 10.80 (pre-test) to 11.20 (post-test). IRAP students outperformed the national average on six of the 15 skills assessed by the CAT. In fall 2021, students in BIO 111 increased their mean score from 12.57 (pre-test) to 13.86 (post-test).</p>\r\n<p>IRAP initiatives had extensive broader impacts to address the attrition, retention, and completion rates. Students who participated in the Summer Research Academy during (fall 2021-spring 2023) achieved the highest average GPA (3.6), followed by those engaged in independent research projects (3.1). In contrast, the comparison group of STEM majors recorded the average GPA (2.4). IRAP students from the 2021 Summer Research Academy had a substantially higher graduation rate in both the fall 2022 and spring 2023 terms compared to the comparison group of STEM majors collegewide. Participants of IRAP who transferred from UCNJ to a four-year institution in the academic year 2020 achieved a completion rate of 55% for their bachelor's degrees. In comparison, students who graduated from STEM majors and transferred to a four-year institution in the same year exhibited a completion rate of 53.3%.</p>\r\n<p>The second IRAP intervention, independent research, was designed to engage middle-skill students who would otherwise lack research experience. 145 students participated in independent research projects during the six-year performance period of IRAP. In fall 2023 and spring 2024, 14 mentors worked with 63 students engaged in independent research projects supported by IRAP. Students who completed their semester-long research projects and fulfilled the requirement of 100-120 contact hours were awarded a $1,750 stipend.</p>\r\n<p>The third intervention of IRAP<em> </em>was the Summer Research Academy (SRA). Between 2018 and 2024, 102 students completed the Summer Research Academy. The academy spanned eight weeks and was designed to strengthen research and presentation skills; develop a mindset of confidence and self-efficacy in STEM and build relationships. The students who participated in the 2022 SRA had the highest retention rate at 76.7% This rate exceeds that of the comparison group of STEM majors collegewide, totaling 74.9%. Students who completed their research projects and fulfilled the requirement of 200-220 contact hours were awarded a $3,250 stipend.</p>\r\n<p>To provide faculty with professional development designed to improve their ability to infuse research into courses, mentor research students, and assess critical thinking skills, two members of the project team received formal training at Tennessee Tech University; other faculty and staff members were also trained internally on scoring the CAT, research article writing, proofreading, and formatting. UCNJ published two issues of Undergraduate Research Journal annually that included publications from IRAP students from 2018-2024.</p>\r\n<p>To foster diversity and inclusion in STEM fields, IRAP demonstrated a significantly higher percentage of female participation at 39.9% compared to 23.4% in the Fall 2022 FTFT comparison group. Hispanic and Black/African American women accounted for 63.1% of IRAP participants, a remarkable contrast to the 19.7% observed in the comparison group, highlighting the program's success. In program years five and six, IRAP students presented their research at academic conferences across the state including MSCHE annual conferences in Philadelphia. Faculty mentors and project leaders also shared their findings at conferences and symposiums focused on STEM education and undergraduate research. Student&rsquo;s satisfaction was evident in year six. 90% of students who completed the student survey in year five responded affirmatively to survey question that engaging in undergraduate research has increased their interest in STEM. Similarly, 90% of the students affirmed that they felt more confident about their abilities to complete their degree program.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/03/2025<br>\nModified by: Faraz&nbsp;Siddique</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1832425/1832425_10566967_1735924024180_Cover_of_Undergraduate_Research_Journal_Volume_6__2__Spring_2024--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1832425/1832425_10566967_1735924024180_Cover_of_Undergraduate_Research_Journal_Volume_6__2__Spring_2024--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Undergraduate Research Journal Cover\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1832425/1832425_10566967_1735924024180_Cover_of_Undergraduate_Research_Journal_Volume_6__2__Spring_2024--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Undergraduate Research Journal Cover\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Undergraduate Research Journal Cover</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">UCNJ</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Faraz&nbsp;Siddique\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Undergraduate Research Journal Cover</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1832425/1832425_10566967_1735924092966_STEM_DIVISON_IRAP_Student_Research_Opportunities--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1832425/1832425_10566967_1735924092966_STEM_DIVISON_IRAP_Student_Research_Opportunities--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"IRAP Recruitment Flyer\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1832425/1832425_10566967_1735924092966_STEM_DIVISON_IRAP_Student_Research_Opportunities--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"IRAP Recruitment Flyer\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">IRAP Recruitment Flyer</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">UCNJ</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Faraz&nbsp;Siddique\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">IRAP Recruitment Flyer</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1832425/1832425_10566967_1735924401328_STEM_Research_Day--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1832425/1832425_10566967_1735924401328_STEM_Research_Day--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"STEM Research Day\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1832425/1832425_10566967_1735924401328_STEM_Research_Day--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"STEM Research Day\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">STEM Research Day</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">UCNJ</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Faraz&nbsp;Siddique\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">STEM Research Day</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
