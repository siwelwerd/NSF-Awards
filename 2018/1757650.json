 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award establishes a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates site to create \"Pathways Opening World Energy Resources\" (REU - POWER), located at Northeastern University, Boston MA. The REU-POWER site will provide rising sophomores, juniors and seniors with a summer-based experience working with professors from across the College of Engineering, engaged in research on topics pertaining to the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) Grand Energy Challenge. There is special emphasis on the recruitment of underrepresented minority (URM) students, and because of this, REU-POWER can particularly create professional development programs that address particular barriers of URM STEM populations.   Specifically, REU-POWER will (1) provide annual financial and mentoring support for 10 qualified URM scholars; (2) impact the well-documented U.S. national need for a more diverse energy workforce; and (3) help advance research to make renewable, solar and clean energy more prevalent in society, to help solve the NAE Grand Energy Challenges. The success of the REU-POWER model will be disseminated to other institutions to follow. \r\n\r\nOther unique aspects of the REU-POWER site includes the development of: 1) hands-on short courses with experimental renewable energy labs for all participants; 2) formal mentor training that includes educational modules for mentoring URM engineering students; 3) extensive professional development seminars; 4) formal research training including daily reflection journals, poster presentations and technical writing of a research digest with a faculty member; and 5) recruitment from a unique pool of highly talented URM students that have already expressed interest in energy careers. A primary goal of the REU-POWER site is to excite and engage undergraduate students to pursue careers in the energy field, whether in research labs, industry or to continue their studies in graduate school.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
