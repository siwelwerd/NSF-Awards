The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the fields of Several Complex Variables and Partial Differential Equations.   \r\n\r\nA number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference.  This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference.  The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities. More information will be made available at: http://www.mat.puc-rio.br/~pimentel/pdeca2018/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
