 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a collaboration between the University of Colorado at Boulder, the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, Front Range Community College, and the University of Nebraska/Methodology and Evaluation Research Core Facility.  The project aims to address the challenges institutions face as they seek to improve undergraduate education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.  To this end, the project will implement and investigate a comprehensive approach to transforming instruction and institutional culture. The project aims to increase the adoption of learner-centered, research-based instructional strategies through the Learning by Design professional development program.  The Learning by Design program was developed through a previous Widening Implementation and Demonstration of Evidence-Based Reforms award. Project components include a professional development program focused on course-design principles and research-based instructional strategies, with follow-on mentoring, roundtable discussion, course improvement awards, and research and evaluation activities.  \r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this project is to move undergraduate STEM instructors away from traditional teacher-centered lecture-based instruction, toward learning-centered active learning-based instruction.   The secondary goal is to create, test, and implement different versions of the Learning by Design program in ways that are sensitive to differences between institutions and their varied missions and contexts.  The project team proposes to develop models for sustainability that will enable these versions to persist beyond the life of the project.  Applying grounded theory and correlational analyses, the multiple-case study research study (mixed qualitative and quantitative methods) is designed to address the primary research question:  How can evidence-based instructional methods and professional development programs be effectively propagated in different institutions of higher education to support STEM instructor implementation of learner-centered instruction?  The design/implementation and research components of the proposed effort are grounded in the organizational change literature, primarily through the theoretical and practical work of Kezar (e.g., research-based principles of organizational change, change strategies, change foci, change models, and change outcomes).  The project is designed to provide multiple ways by which faculty, academic departments and other units, institutions, and institutional consortia can support broader implementation of effective instructional strategies/practices, and thus improve undergraduate STEM education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

As a result of these meetings and with input from annual Roundtable Discussions (commencing in spring 2019), the PRIMERS team developed and implemented different courses of action for each institution, UTRGV, CUB, FRCC, respectively.\r\n\n\nThe PRIMERS Active Learning PD Program at the University of Texas- Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV) was conducted with collaborations with the Center for Teaching Excellence (CTE) on campus. PRIMERS Program at UTRGV adapted the three sequential teaching-focused semester-long professional development program components previously developed by the lead PI at CUB. The active learning PD components include: (a) Learning by Design, (b) Follow-up Peer Mentoring, and (c) Course re/Design. Learning by Design was the entry point into the PRIMERS PD program for STEM instructors at UTRGV. For instructors, PRIMERS PD program nurtured sense of community of practice; cultivated a common language for course design principles and research-based instructional strategies; and supported their development of new course materials to use in their courses.

In this program, alumni of Learning by Design paired up to mentor and observe each other through the process of implementing and assessing their incorporation of course design principles and/or research-based instructional strategies into their courses.

Over the course of 6 years, at least 53 STEM courses and over 23,000 undergraduate students in STEM fields directly benefited from the training these faculty members received. Four full-time STEM faculty members were trained to facilitate these professional development programs after the life of the grant and would be able to coach other instructors with design principles and research-based instructional strategies. The 4 trained faculty members would be able to run these professional development programs after the life of the grant.\r\n\n\nFor long term sustainability efforts for Active Learning PD program at UTRGV, PRIMERS has integrated with Center for Teaching Excellence (CTE) and supported two CTE Active Learning Fellows to further engage with both STEM and non-STEM instructors on campus. In addition to the two Active Learning Fellows, two more full-time STEM faculty members from PRIMERS had partnered with CTE to facilitate year-long faculty development sessions and seminars about active learning. The CTE faculty development sessions and seminars are offered annually. PRIMERS PD program participants and Active Learning Fellows will be the 'agents of change' for broader and longer impacts at UTRGV campuses beyond the life of the grant. 67 faculty attendees from annual roundtable discussions, including STEM instructors and administrators, i.e., department chairs, program coordinators as well as CTE directors, would also be the advocates for active learning strategies and continue to impact students at UTRGV after the life of the grant.\r\n\n\nPRIMERS was a collaborative project with the CUB and FRCC (1821709), whose final outcomes are described in a separate report.
