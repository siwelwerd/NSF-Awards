 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite the wide diversity of expertise in social science, women are underrepresented in scholarship and in news coverage of social science expertise. Men are more likely to be invited to talks, to have their work assigned on course syllabi, and to be contacted by the media for reactions to current events. But many social science experts are women; they are simply not as visible or well-known, and it is easier for those seeking expertise to call on those scholars with whom they are already familiar. Reducing this implicit bias against women requires positive steps to make the expertise of women more visible and easily accessible. The Women Also Know Stuff (WAKS) project does exactly that. Created in February 2016, the Women Also Know Stuff initiative is working to make it easier for scholars and journalists to identify experts who are women, through a website of women experts and an active Twitter feed. \r\n\r\nWomen Also Know Stuff has worked for the past 20 months to populate and publicize a crowd-sourced online database that highlights the expertise of women scholars. The Women Also Know Stuff Editorial Board collects and manages this information with the goal of promoting women's public and professional engagement. This project will allow women listed on the website to give citations of 1) peer-reviewed published journal articles and books and 2) media interviews, by allowing them to check boxes for relevant subject areas (e.g., conflict studies, international relations) next to each citation. Icons (e.g., stars) next to the names of scholars will indicate if they have provided a linked citation for a given subject area. This system of linked citations and icons will allow users of the website to narrow their searches to only those scholars who have citations listed for publications and/or media interviews in the subject area of interest. This quality control feature will also encourage women scholars to be more attentive to their profiles on the website, thus making it more likely that they will list (and provide relevant linked citations to their work on) topics in the news, thus increasing its relevance for media users and the likelihood that news outlets will contact women scholars for comment on current events. In sum, adding these quality control icons will both improve the usefulness of the website and also increase its utilization.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We created a user-friendly, searchable website of experts, generated a social media presence, and conducted outreach to scholars and the media. That outreach encouraged scholars to create profiles and for both scholars and the media to use the website to identify scholars and scholarship relevant to their work. We conducted in-person promotion of the project at meetings of professional organizations in the discipline, and on-site visits to colleges and universities interested in hearing more about the project. We reached out to individual scholars from historically marginalized communities, and who teach at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), and community colleges in order to encourage them to create profiles, and provided assistance to do so when appropriate. We boosted the relevant expertise of women scholars via social media, and encouraged journalists to cite and quote women by boosting news stories that did so. We created a how-to guide for how we conducted our work that we shared with interested groups, and helped similar projects to push back against other forms of bias (e.g., against people of color and members of the LGBTQ community). We mentored junior scholars and students who helped us conduct our work and to collect data to assess our impact. We published numerous pieces about the project, and made presentations at academic conferences. Overall, we have shifted the discipline to be more aware of implicit bias against women (and against other groups) and have made political science a more inclusive environment for all scholars.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/26/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Melissa&nbsp;R&nbsp;Michelson</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1836072/1836072_10570195_1669523823061_WomenAlsoKnowStuffsearchabledatabaseimage--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1836072/1836072_10570195_1669523823061_WomenAlsoKnowStuffsearchabledatabaseimage--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Screenshot of the Women Also Know Stuff home page\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1836072/1836072_10570195_1669523823061_WomenAlsoKnowStuffsearchabledatabaseimage--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of the Women Also Know Stuff home page\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This screenshot shows how the Women Also Know Stuff website looks to visitors.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Melissa Michelson</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Melissa&nbsp;R&nbsp;Michelson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Screenshot of the Women Also Know Stuff home page</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1836072/1836072_10570195_1669523552939_WomenAlsoKnowStuffmissiononwebsiteimage--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1836072/1836072_10570195_1669523552939_WomenAlsoKnowStuffmissiononwebsiteimage--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Screenshot of the Women Also Know Stuff mission and about statement\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1836072/1836072_10570195_1669523552939_WomenAlsoKnowStuffmissiononwebsiteimage--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of the Women Also Know Stuff mission and about statement\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This screenshot directs users to the searchable database, to the login and registration pages for users, and to our Twitter page.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Melissa Michelson</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Melissa&nbsp;R&nbsp;Michelson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Screenshot of the Women Also Know Stuff mission and about statement</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
