 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many fluids used in industrial processes are shear-thickening.  That is, they become more viscous the faster they are forced to flow.  This feature can make their use and manipulation costly, require significant energy, and damage processing equipment.  This research will identify low cost and energy efficient techniques for making shear-thickening fluids less viscous so that they can be more easily and efficiently used.  Experiments are aimed at showing that acoustic (ultrasound) waves can be generated in a controlled fashion to tune and reduce the viscosity of shear-thickening fluids.  This viscosity reduction will result in less energy consumption in moving and processing of the fluid.  The success of this work could facilitate many important manufacturing processes, including the design of self-healing materials and 3D printing applications.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that shear thickening can be controlled and mitigated by applying an orthogonal perturbation to the flow. Previous studies have largely used electrical and magnetic properties of colloidal suspensions to tune shear thickening, which is only useful for particles with these unique properties. Boundary-driven shear flows have also been studied, but are not standard in manufacturing contexts. Thus there is an urgent unmet need to demonstrate remote viscosity tuning in pressure-driven flows of shear-thickening suspensions of passive particles. What is currently unknown is how remote perturbation of pressure-driven flows at the particle level to break force chains can be implemented in a scalable architecture that can tune viscosity on macroscopic scales and thus facilitate manufacturing processes. We will de-thicken colloidal suspensions by inducing orthogonal perturbations with biaxial bulk-acoustic-wave forcing.  By characterizing both the systemic response and the microscale structure of the colloidal chains, we will answer the fundamental question of how shear-induced force chains can be broken in pressure-driven flow. Remote perturbation and de-thickening of fluids is important to realizing the many exciting engineering benefits of shear-thickening fluids (self-healing materials, inkjet printing, 3D printing, etc.).  These benefits cannot be achieved unless the manufacturing and processing of shear-thickening suspensions can be managed in a way that is thermodynamically and economically efficient and is minimally damaging to equipment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This transition occurs when the applied shear stresses are large enough to drive particles into contact, forming force chains that are primarily aligned along the maximum compressive axis. The resulting increase in viscosity can span orders of magnitude and in sufficiently dense suspension can result in a completely rigid, shear jammed state. The work conducted under this grant showed that by applying quasi-steady amplitude modulated acoustic perturbations, the suspension viscosity can be tuned from the thickened to the fully dethickened state. The applied acoustic perturbations are presumed to dethicken the suspension by breaking up particle contacts important for force transduction. While dethickening has been shown previously via orthogonal shear protocols, the ease with which acoustic perturbations can be applied enables the current technique to be applied in many more situations and with greater ease. There were a number of outcomes from this work that are very exciting. First, the ability to apply sufficiently high power acoustic perturbations to completely break up the force chains and dethicken a previously thickenened suspension is remarkable. Second, we showed that these types of protocols can be used to dethicken a suspension under impact as well as under shear. Dethickening under impact is directly relevant to the ubiquitous videos associated with people walking on suspensions of cornstarch and water. Third, we showed that the thickening transition can be described as a crossover from a system that is frictionless and jammed to one that is frictional and jammed under shear. Finally, since acoustic perturbations can be applied at kHz to MHz frequencies, there is an opportunity to generate new material properties by rapidly cycling between the thickened and dethickened states.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One student trained through this grant successfully finished their doctoral degree.
