 "awd_abstract_narration": "Weather radar, satellites, and numerical models all require accurate knowledge of the properties of cloud and precipitation particles.  The atmospheric science field has spent decades conducting airborne field measurement campaigns with the goal of collecting as much data as possible to characterize the distribution of droplet and crystal sizes and shapes.  However, fundamental limitations of aircraft probes have left many unanswered questions and uncertainties.  This award is for the development of a new airborne probe that will enhance the observational research community's efforts to characterize cloud and precipitation particles.  The potential societal impacts of this award will be through more accurate precipitation measurements from radar and satellites, and improvements in inputs to weather and climate models.   \r\n\r\nThis Major Research Instrumentation development award is for the design and construction of the fourth generation High Volume Precipitation Spectrometer (HVPS-4) for measurement of cloud and precipitation particles.  The HVPS-4 will provide orthogonal digital images of cloud and precipitation particles at 50 and 150-micron pixel resolution.  The orthogonal views will reduce uncertainties in particle shape, aspect ratio, volume, and mass.  The HVPS-4 could be mounted on the NCAR G-V and C-130 research aircraft, or other aircraft that regularly carry particle probes. The instrument has the potential to: 1) Lead to better understanding of cloud microphysical processes and improved estimates of ice and liquid water content in clouds and precipitation, 2) Improve remote retrievals from ground and space-based radar, and 3) Improve microphysical and hydrological parameterizations in weather and climate models.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
