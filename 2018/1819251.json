 "awd_abstract_narration": "Numerical simulations are a cornerstone of the modern scientific process, and considerable expense and energy, both literally and figuratively, is put into simulations. The two objectives of this project are to (1) shorten simulation time, and (2) ask new questions of the data given the output of an existing simulation (but not its full history) in order to avoid running a new simulation.  To shorten simulation time, a naive approach leads to less accurate estimates of certain variables that are used for both prediction of new material properties and for validation of numerical models against known properties. This program investigates super-resolution methods that do not suffer this loss of accuracy. The second objective records appropriate randomized snapshots or \"sketches\" from simulations.  Because it may not be known in advance which variables should be directly calculated, this program develops techniques to use the sketches to estimate variables that were not originally calculated. The technique is designed to \"future-proof\" simulations, and gives datasets a second chance at being useful without requiring a new simulation to be run. Achieving either or both objectives in this project will lead to fewer unnecessary computer simulations, saving energy and reducing impact on the environment.\r\n\r\nThis project brings together ideas from physical chemistry, high-performance computing, optimization, machine learning, digital signal processing, and time-series statistics. More specifically, the first objective is to estimate spectral variables from a shortened simulation. Shortening the time range usually has the effect of broadening the spectral lines. Under appropriate assumptions on the spectra, recent advances in harmonic analysis show that by solving a semi-definite program, one can super-resolve the spectral lines. These advances have been limited to signal-processing applications, and with appropriate modification, they will have a great impact on spectral estimation from simulations.  The project will develop efficient algorithms to tackle this problem, as well as show how it can be adapted to the situation of scientific computing, and theoretically extended to correctly handle uncertainty. The second objective is compressive parameter estimation, which has only recently been explored and mainly in the context of digital signal processing. The project will develop particular estimators for given statistics, as well as explore a general approach to apply to a broad class of statistics. The approach for storing snapshots of data will be applied primarily to magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of solar convection, a field of great importance due to the effect of the sun's weather on cosmic rays and photons incident on Earth.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
