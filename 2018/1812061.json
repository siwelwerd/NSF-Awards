 "awd_abstract_narration": "The concept of a group arises naturally in mathematics, and has wide applications in physics, chemistry and materials science to name a few. One example is the collection of symmetries of an object.  These symmetries can also be \"multiplied\", that is performed one after another, to obtain new symmetries. Sometimes different combinations of symmetries might have the same overall effect, leading to \"relations\".  Abstractly, a group may be specified with a finite list of \"generators\" and relations among the generators, collectively called a presentation.  An important question in mathematics is whether two presentations define the same or similar groups.  Geometric group theory seeks to use geometric tools to differentiate groups, and to study their large-scale features.  This project will develop new tools to explore such large-scale features and to classify groups according to these features.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe primary focus of this project is to study groups which act properly discontinuously and cocompactly on non-positively or negatively curved spaces, particularly right-angled Coxeter groups (RACGs), geometric amalgams of free groups, and hyperbolic groups.  Newly emerging techniques such as hierarchical hyperbolicity and contracting boundaries will be used to further the program of classifying RACGs up to quasi-isometry and commensurability.  Geometric amalgams of free groups will be studied up to elementary equivalence, a notion of equivalence of groups coming from logic.  This will provide an illuminating class of examples illustrating deep theorems of Sela.  Furthermore, the project will study stable commutator length in RACGs, contributing to a growing program which has connections to the theory of quasimorphisms and bounded cohomology, and has applications in a variety of areas.  The last part of the proposal seeks to understand the set possible distortion functions of subgroups of hyperbolic groups, and conjectures that this set is vast.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nA group is a mathematical entity that arises naturally when one considers symmetries, either of physical objects or of abstract mathematical constructions. A prominent vein in geometric group theory concerns itself with studying infinite groups that arise as symmetries of geometric spaces that exhibit some sort of ``non-positive curvature'' akin to what one might observe on the surface of a saddle or a curly kale leaf. A core idea in the field is to use the geometry of the associated spaces to glean information about the groups.\n\n\nThis project enhances the state of knowledge of the coarse geometry of such groups, with a particular focus on two important classes, namely Coxeter groups and hyperbolic groups. Coxeter groups have been widely studied from an algebraic or combinatorial perspective, but their coarse geometry, especially their quasi-isometry classification remains relatively unexplored. Hyperbolic groups are an extremely well-understood class of groups, but much remains unknown about their subgroups.\n\n\nThe key outcomes of this project were as follows:\n\n\n1. Stallings' techniques for Coxeter groups: Stallings introduced the notion of folding graphs, and used it to study properties of subgroups of free groups. In a series of papers, the personnel on this project and their collaborators generalized and adapted this method to the setting of Coxeter groups and applied them to solve several algorithmic, algebraic and geometric questions about subgroups of Coxeter groups. This has had an impact in that it has led to other researchers to further extend these methods to other settings, and explore their connection to the literature.\n\n\n2. Studying invariants: One preprint arising from this project develops a new tool, called hypergraph index which is shown to compute the important quasi-isometry invariants divergence and thickness in a large (infinite) class of Coxeter groups and conjecturally computes these invariants in all Coxeter groups. This opens up new lines of attack for making progress on the quasi-isometry classification problem for general Coxeter groups.\n\n\n3. Distortion in hyperbolic groups: Understanding which functions are distortion functions of subgroups (especially inside hyperbolic groups) is an old question in the field. This is quite well understood in the general setting but under the hypothesis of hyperbolicity, only sporadic families of examples of such distortion function were known. One preprint arising from this project constructs a vast family of new examples of such functions, sweeping out a big range of functions between the known families. In the process it opens up a new technology for adapting the results from the general setting to the hyperbolic case, which should generate additional progress on this question in the coming years.\n\n\nThe broader impact of this project included outreach to students at all levels, ranging from middle school students to graduate students, in the form of presentations, informal chats and networking opportunities. Additionally, it included mentoring of junior faculty and organizationof conferences, especially one aimed at training junior researchers. An offshoot of the middle school outreach activities conducted as part of this project is a planned mathematics-focussed recurring event aimed at local underserved public middle schools. The first installment will be in April 2024.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/15/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: PallaviDani\n"
