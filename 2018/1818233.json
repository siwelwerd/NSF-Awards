The purpose of this trip is to support approximately 15 - 20 students in the field of Pervasive Computing and Communications. PerCom 2018 will provide a leading edge scholarly forum for researchers, engineers, and students alike to share their state-of-the art research and developmental work in the broad areas of pervasive computing and communications.\r\n\r\nThis conference will provide the students with the opportunity to attend presentations of cutting-edge research results representing the state-of-the-art in pervasive computing, systems and applications.  The attendees are offered a diversity of interactive forums, technical sessions, targeted workshops, interesting poster sessions, and exciting demonstrations. Students will have the opportunity to interact with the world's leading researchers in pervasive computing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
