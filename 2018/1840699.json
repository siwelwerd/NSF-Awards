 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will determine whether formal musical training is associated with enhanced neural processing and perception of sounds, including speech in noisy backgrounds. Music forms an important part of the lives of millions of people around the world, and it is one of the few universals shared by all known human cultures. Yet its utility and potential evolutionary advantages remain a mystery. This project will test the hypothesis that early musical exposure has benefits that extend beyond music to critical aspects of human communication, such as speech perception in noise. In addition, the investigators will test whether early musical training is associated with less severe effects of aging on the ability to understand speech in noisy backgrounds. Degraded ability to understand speech in noise is a common complaint among older listeners and hearing loss has been shown to be associated with social isolation and more rapid cognitive and health declines. If formal musical training is shown to affect improved perception and speech communication in later life, the outcomes could have a potentially major impact on quality of life,\r\n\r\nEarlier studies have suggested relationships between early musical training and improved auditory neural processing and perception, but the studies' impact has been limited by small sample numbers and inconsistent methods between different studies. This project will test a large number of participants (N=360) with uniform recruitment criteria and testing protocols across six different sites. Measures will include the neural frequency following response (FFR) to speech sounds, behavioral frequency selectivity, speech perception in noise, speech perception against a background of competing talkers, pitch discrimination, and auditory masking. The participants will also complete other assessments, including a personality inventory questionnaire, a profile of musical perception skills, a spatial reasoning test to assess general cognitive ability, as well as a background questionnaire to determine socio-economic status, education, and musical background. Participants will be selected to span a wide range of ages and musical experience. The neural data and the speech perception measures will be related to factors of musical training, such as the number of years of musical training and the age at which musical training began. Scientific rigor will be assured by preregistering the study and the analyses and by making the data and analysis code publicly available via a dedicated website.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Numerous studies have suggested that these music-training related enhancements can contribute to improved abilities to understand speech in noise and may even protect against the detrimental effects of aging on this important function. Because of their profound implications, these studies have generated tremendous interest in the scientific and broader community. Although the conclusions have found general scientific and public acceptance, they have been based on studies with relatively small numbers of participants, performed in a limited number of laboratories. Furthermore, most of these studies have investigated aspects of either neuroscience or behavior, but not both. The aim of this collaborative research project is to provide a definitive answer to the question of whether formal musical training is associated with enhanced neural processing and perception of sound. To do so, we conducted a large-scale, multi-site study involving six universities, aiming to examine the robustness of the musician advantage across the adult lifespan by replicating and extending eight key experiments involving the perception and neural coding of speech and non-speech sounds across a large sample of listeners spanning a wide range of musical experience. The lead site co-ordinating the study and performing formal analysis is University of Minnesota (UMN); Purdue University participated by collecting behavioral and neural data and sharing them into a common repository on the cloud (provided by Box.com). Owing to the delays and inefficiencies caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Purdue site enrolled fewer participants than originally targeted, but this was largely compensated for by increase enrollment from the lead site (UMN). The study procedures were pre-registered and all protocols and materials have been publicly available throughout the timeline of the project. All datasets in raw form have been accumulated in a shared Box folder on the cloud and will be made public at the time of disseminating the results. The nature and goals of the multisite study meant that results were not formally analyzed until data collection is complete across all sites in late 2022. Full analysis is being conducted and results assembled by the UMN site in accordance with the pre-registered protocol. These results will be disseminated at the upcoming MidWinter Meeting of the Association for Research in Otolaryngology in February, 2023, and subsequently submitted for peer review and journal publication. Preliminary analyses showed that most of the benefits of musical training are smaller than suggested by previous literature.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/13/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Hari&nbsp;M&nbsp;Bharadwaj</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
