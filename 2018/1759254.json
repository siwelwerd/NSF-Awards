 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivation and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM). It is essential that STEM professionals effectively and efficiently communicate and justify processes, and find and fix mistakes.  In this project, researchers will investigate how students' explanations during play, and the use of step-by-step demonstrations of problem-solving, called worked examples,  can enable early elementary school students, female students in particular, to gain familiarity and competency with commenting and debugging computer programming code. Establishing these practices in elementary education could help create a workforce where commenting on code and explaining one's process of thinking is natural and expected.  The project will connect students' programming experiences with those of industry professionals in an effort to increase their interest in future STEM careers.  \r\n\r\nOver a series of interventional sessions, pairs of first- and third-graders will work in partners to learn how to program using the Coding Awbie game by OSMO(TM).  In particular, researchers will investigate the following research questions over two years: (1) How and when do first- and third-graders comment on and debug their code during free-play compared to when they are asked to explain what they will do before playing, i.e., explained play? (2) How does students' commenting and debugging compare and change depending on if they analyze worked examples before or after their play? (3) How does students' commenting and debugging of worked examples relate to their explaining and correcting errors in mathematics problems in addition to computer coding?  (4) How does the intervention affect students' early attitudes toward programming and knowledge of the role of programming in STEM professions? Measures include programming and mathematics explanation and debugging tasks as well as surveys related to programming.  Through this repeated measures design, researchers will learn what conditions best support students' explaining and debugging while learning to code within the program, and students will gain important STEM practices in their early years of elementary education.  Further, presentations by industry professionals will help connect the practices to a variety of STEM careers, helping students see the relevance of the practices of explaining and debugging.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGoals and Background\n\nThe main goals of this research project in terms of programming were to determine the relative benefits of having first and third graders \n(1) play versus explain their programs and \n(2) play versus analyze worked examples \n\nwhen learning to program, explain their code, and debug their code using a tangible programming system (playing Coding Awbie using the OsmoTM).  Another goal was to increase students? (targeting girls) understanding of programming and increase their attitudes toward programming.  Our final related goal was to determine how explaining and debugging in programming was similar to explaining and debugging problems in mathematics. \n\nDuring the first experimental intervention, students either explained how they thought their character would move in the programming game before they ran their code or played the game without explaining their programming code.  During the second experimental intervention, students either played the programming game or discussed worked examples that showed correct or incorrect programs before playing.  In both cases, halfway through the interventions, students participated in a session during which they learned about programming applications.  \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nAcross the series of interventions, the researchers found that the first and third graders improved in their ability to program and debug their programs, even by the midpoint (after three 20-minute sessions) of their six sessions. Some students were even able to effectively use subroutines. Females benefitted most from playing initially as opposed to having to explain their code right away. Although analyzing worked examples helped students both at the beginning and during the second half of the intervention, females who played first and then analyzed worked examples during the second half of the intervention made larger gains. When debugging code, the majority of students just fixed the bug, while some students rewrote the entire program. Students? difficulties when programming the character to move often corresponded to counting issues when the character switched directions or thinking that the jump command moved the character one space instead of skipping over a space. \n\nStudents used similar debugging practices when solving spatial puzzles as they used when fixing programs on a programming debugging task, suggesting these practices could be widely applicable. \n\nFinally, students? knowledge of what programmers are and what applications involve programming improved by the end of the intervention.  In particular, providing examples of how females use programming in their work and tailoring instruction around programming applications to those that relate to students? future career interests led to girls? positive attitudes toward programming.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nAs part of this research project, I mentored four graduate students and two undergraduate students.  We published research findings from this project in mathematics education journals (both for researchers and practitioners) and conference proceedings and presented at numerous educational conferences.  We also engaged hundreds of first and third graders in learning about programming applications, and several students asked for links to the materials we presented.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/31/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Laura Bofferding"
