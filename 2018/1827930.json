 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Professor Kevin Minbiole from Villanova University and colleagues Robert Giuliano, Deanna Zubris, Aimee Eggler and Thomas Umile Gwynedd from Mercy College have acquired a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as allow study of biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The instrument positively impacts several institutions that participate in the Southeastern Pennsylvania Consortium for Higher Education. Well-documented utilization in classroom activities is also positive. Inclusion of a co-PI from another institution (Mercy College) is a demonstration of the commitment to partner with other institutions.\r\n\r\nThe award of the NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels.  It especially aids in the identification of natural product structures and the rapid and in-depth structural characterization of amphiphiles that lead to improved structure-activity. The instrument is also used to fully characterize 4-amino sugars found in antibiotics and cell-surface glycans and glycosyl cyanides found in fungal toxins as well as in the confirmation of the structure of diplopyrone. In addition, it is essential for the characterization of synthetic analogues of marine sponge-derived Nrf2 activators and for the comprehensive characterization of structure changes in the oxidizable diphenols in phosphate buffered saline. The spectrometer benefits the determination of purity of trace amounts of purchased natural products and the characterization of paramagnetic iron complexes (catalysts) for atom transfer radical polymerization and mechanistic evaluation. It is also essential for the characterization of polymers containing multi-cationic quaternary ammonium compounds.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
