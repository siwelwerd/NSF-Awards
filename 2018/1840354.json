The conference, follow-on workshops, and lectures are held each summer as a coordinated program designed to bring together a distinguished group of senior scientists from around the globe with junior faculty and graduate students from across the U.S. Topics include new developments in game theory, areas in the intersection between game theory and computer science (such as Computation and Privacy), and applications of game theory to business and public policy. The activities advance science by giving young scholars the opportunity to form new research collaborations and present their work to a distinguished audience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
