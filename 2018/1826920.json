 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemical Instrumentation P(CRIF) programs.  Professor Elizabeth Sudduth from Georgia Gwinnett College and colleagues Seungjin Lee and Sang H Park have acquired a total organic carbon/total nitrogen analyzer.  This instrument uses an analysis technique that is historic and fundamental to analyzing samples. This is combustion analysis which by combusting (burning or oxidizing) a sample can provide the content of elements such as carbon and nitrogen.  This a basic analytical tool for environmental analysis of materials in water, or water treatment. The research to be conducted is largely localized to the Georgia region. It provides undergraduate students training in measurement, data analysis, and instrumentation usage valuable as they go on to future technical employment or to higher level training.  \r\n\r\nThe award of this analyzer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially aids the characterization of the effects of urbanization and beaver activity on patterns in organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations and ecosystem functions in urban streams. The instrument is necessary for the evaluation of the efficiency of surface water treatment and recycling processes for sustainable nutrients for the investigation of nitrogenous disinfection byproducts formation potential of Gwinnett County's drinking water source. The analyzer also helps investigators and students in characterizing the composition of atmospheric aerosols and dry atmospheric deposition rates of nitrogen, and for the characterization of combustion exhaust gas from a diesel generator using fuel blends of commercial ultra-low sulfur diesel and biodiesel synthesized on campus.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe analysis of carbon and nitrogen contents in environmental samples provides valuable information for consideration of water and air quality management and is a vital tool in many types of environmental research. The acquisition of the Shimadzu TOC/TN analyzer has allowed faculty and students at Georgia Gwinnett College to use concentrations of nitrogen and carbon to answer questions and look for solutions to a range of environmental problems. Although the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting limitations on field and lab research for much of the grant period greatly impacted our ability to complete all of the goals of this project, this grant created the opportunity for many students from diverse backgrounds to gain experience using an important instrument commonly used in labs in research and industry.\n\nEffects of Beaver Activity on Carbon and Nitrogen in Urban Streams As beaver dams slow stream water flow, they allow more interaction between the microbes in the water and sediment and the nutrients in the water, creating the possibility for beaver activity to improve water quality. Most of the beaver systems examined in Atlanta showed decreases in concentrations of nitrogen and carbon as the urban stream water moved through the beaver pond or wetland. These effects seemed greater the more the water was slowed and the longer the water stayed in the beaver system. In particular, bioavailable dissolved organic carbon, which is easily accessed by microorganisms and, in urban streams, often comes from human sewage, generally decreased in these systems, suggesting that, with help from beaver dams, the microbial community was effective at improving water quality. \n\nEvaluation of Efficiency of Drinking Water Treatment The removal of naturally occurring organic matter and nitrogen is one of the primary requirements for the reliable management of water resources for use as drinking water. A method to synthesize hydrogels via UV initiated polymerization created more co-polymers than other methods, providing better water treatment, as indicated by better adsorption of urea. Another water treatment approach examined was desalination. Distillation consumes a great amount of energy, and membrane-less technologies like solvent extraction could provide more efficient desalination with lower energy costs. Noticeable differences were observed in the efficiency of extraction of water from highly concentrated brine with secondary and tertiary amines.\n\nBroader Impacts Finally, this grant provided valuable opportunities for undergraduate students from underrepresented groups and local high school internship students to participate in research in ecology, environmental chemistry, and engineering. Participating students were able to develop skills in chemical and environmental analysis, including field sample collection, equipment operation, sample preparation, creating calibration curves, and data analysis and interpretation.
