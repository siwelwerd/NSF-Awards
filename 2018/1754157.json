 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental objective of ecology and evolutionary biology is to explain the geographic distributions of species. But species are dynamic entities, and their geographic distributions respond to changing environments. If the environment of their suitable habitat changes, populations of a species can sustain themselves in their current habitat by adaption through natural selection, or they need to shift to new locations. Understanding the mechanisms that account for species distributions is especially timely because of the accelerating pace of environmental change. The contribution of adaptation to population dynamics, local persistence, and to the geographic range inhabited by a species, has rarely been quantified. Although comparative ecological studies and species distribution models typically assume genetic uniformity across a species geographic range, genetic studies have repeatedly demonstrated local adaptation. This project explicitly examines the contribution of adaptation to population growth and the extent of a species geographic range, through the continuation of a long-term field population demographic study and the use of a species distribution model. The project will also involve outreach to a rural middle school, engaging students in research activities, and it will connect citizens to research scientists through an innovative outreach program, Market Science, where researchers engage the public at farmer's markets. \r\n\r\nThe research team will focus on a well-studied California native plant species, Clarkia xantiana, which has been the focus of intensive field research for over 12 years. This research will provide new, exceptionally detailed information about how species' ranges evolve and the factors that are likely to influence species responses to climate variation. The specific objectives of this project are to examine: (1) whether population dynamics vary from the center to margins of the species' range and what environmental factors drive this variation; (2) the spatial scale of local adaptation and how it relates to demographic similarity among populations; and (3) the interplay of population dynamics and adaptation in shaping environmental tolerances (niche width) and geographic range size. Only long-term studies can provide robust predictions about what controls population persistence, evolutionary adaptation, and their consequences for species ranges. Long-term demographic datasets of vital rates (e.g. survival, reproduction), population growth, and abiotic and biotic (herbivory) factors, have been collected in 35 natural populations spanning the major portion of the species' range. All monitoring of field populations will be continued an additional ten years. Past work has examined local adaptation using a large reciprocal transplant experiment among demographically-divergent populations. This experiment will be repeated in the project's second five-year phase.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

For example, the largest tree, the giant sequoia (<em>Sequoiadendron giganteum</em>) has a decidedly small distribution, scattered across the western slope of the Sierra Nevada, that is in danger of declining further due to severe wildfire. Geographic ranges demand scientific explanation, not only for basic understanding of nature, but also for applications to conservation, agriculture, and public health.</p>\r\n<p>A key idea for understanding geographic ranges is the ecological niche: that each species is adapted to limited spans of environmental variables, such as precipitation and temperature. Within those spans, populations of the species can persist in the long term. Outside them, populations decline, ultimately to extinction. From a niche perspective, to explain a species geographic range means answering: (1) to what environments is the species adapted, and why? and (2) how and why do adaptation and population growth rate connect? With this grant from the National Science Foundation, my colleagues and I addressed these questions.</p>\r\n<p>Our study organism is the California wildflower <em>Clarkia xantiana</em>, a member of the plant group named for Captain William Clark, whom Thomas Jefferson sent west in 1804 with Meriwether Lewis and the Corps of Discovery. We used this plant as model for studying niches and ranges, learning lessons that should apply to other species, including those harder to study. Several features made the plant scientifically convenient. It is an annual (i.e., after a seed germinates, the plant has less than one year to make seeds itself, dying afterwards). Thus, we can track individuals throughout their lifetimes. The species is locally common but has a compact geographic distribution, completely within central California. Thus, we can study most or all of its range at once. The key attribute of <em>Clarkia xantiana</em>, however, is that my colleagues, students, and I had been its Corps of Discovery for two decades before this grant began. Having discovered much prepared us to discover more.</p>\r\n<p>This grant supported research instruments and supplies, living expenses for undergraduate students while they assisted the main project and carried out related research projects of their own, and travel and lodging for field work. As in the previous 13 years, we censused 20 populations and monitored regional climate with a network of automated weather stations. Censusing let us characterize the sensitivity of each population to variation in success at different life stages (seeds, seedlings, flowering adults) revealing that some sets of populations share similar patterns. We carried out long-term experiments in the field, to determine the specificity of population adaptation to home locations. We completed lab and greenhouse experiments, to determine limits to the capacity to germinate, grow, flower, and make seed.</p>\r\n<p>What did we learn? I will highlight three areas of findings that have been published so far in the peer-reviewed scientific literature. More will follow.</p>\r\n<p>1. What eats you? The eastern range limit of <em>Clarkia</em> coincides with an abrupt decline in rainfall, a change in the non-living environment, which we have long known helps set the range edge. We showed that another contributor is a sharp increase in the risk that small mammals eat whole <em>Clarkia </em>plants.<em> </em>This finding shakes the prevailing idea that climate dominates species niches and defines the limits to the landscapes that species occupy. To learn where species can occur, we need to know more than where their climates occur.</p>\r\n<p>2. How to live with little water. Several <em>Clarkia xantiana </em>populations we monitor persisted only as seeds in the soil during one or more years of the California Megadrought of the mid 2010s. We found that the adaptations that allow populations to rely on seed banks are due partly to bet-hedging (spreading risk across multiple years, like investors with diversified portfolios), and partly to seeds that germinate only after receiving environmental information that predicts persistent soil moisture. We also learned that differences among <em>Clarkia</em> species in seed germination explains why species sometimes occupy distinct patches on the same hillsides. Relatedly, we identified distinct differences between mechanisms of surviving water stress between <em>Clarkia xantiana </em>and its closest evolutionary relative. Considering those findings and our more recent studies of variation within <em>Clarkia xantiana</em>, it appears that some combinations of plant adaptations to drought evolve together more readily than others.</p>\r\n<p>3. Links between population growth and environmental adaptation. One set of findings represents new facts about the basic biology of populations. Experiments showed that pairs of populations with highly similar sensitivities of population growth rate to life stages also are similar in their adaptation to local environments. We also found that both fast-growing and fast-declining populations are less well-adapted to their home sites than those that are stable in size. We continue to investigate the implications of these findings.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/27/2024<br>\nModified by: Vincent&nbsp;M&nbsp;Eckhart</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1754157/1754157_10554934_1732720786372_Clarkia_Fieldwork--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1754157/1754157_10554934_1732720786372_Clarkia_Fieldwork--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Fieldwork on Clarkia xantiana: population census on a hillside; data collection form; automated weather and soil water logger.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1754157/1754157_10554934_1732720786372_Clarkia_Fieldwork--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Fieldwork on Clarkia xantiana: population census on a hillside; data collection form; automated weather and soil water logger.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Monitoring plant populations & their environments.
