The conference is devoted to recent developments in harmonic analysis and many applications to other disciplines. This conference will feature approximately 30 speakers of the highest international level in the field, which have been carefully recommended by the Scientific Committee. The fund is used to support US based Plenary Speakers who do not have Federal Funding and US based junior, minority, and/or female researchers, priority given to those presenting short talks or posters in the conference. \r\n\r\nMore information will be made available at: http://www.ufrgs.br/haicm2018\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
