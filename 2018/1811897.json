 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2018, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. The Fellow's research focuses on the evolutionary innovations that have allowed tiger moths to ward off their would-be bat predators. Tiger moths protect themselves from bat predators with toxic chemicals obtained from plants and with their unique ability to produce ultrasonic clicks which advertise their distastefulness and/or disrupt bat echolocation. There is a large degree of variation in the chemical profiles and in the sounds produced by tiger moths. It is unknown what drives these differences, given that both of these are defenses against bat predation. The Fellow will address this knowledge gap by utilizing museum collections to estimate sound-production, chemical profiles, and genetic relatedness among a large number of tiger moth species. The Fellow will also utilize geographic information associated with each specimen to determine if any aspects of their environment can explain these differences. As part of this work, the Fellow will work with staff at a major museum to develop an exhibit which will communicate this research to the public, immersing them in the bat-moth co-evolutionary arms race.\r\n\r\nTo address the goals of this project, the Fellow will apply a newly-developed molecular probe set to generate a densely-sampled phylogeny based on >650 genes to resolve evolutionary relationships within the tiger moths. Sound-production will be inferred with a previously-developed predictive statistical model relating morphometric measurements to important acoustic characteristics. Chemical profiles of insect tissues will be generated by utilizing analytic chemistry techniques to identify compounds based on their fragmentation spectra and estimate their concentrations. These traits will be examined in a phylogenetic framework to examine 1) whether sonar-jamming has evolved more than once, 2) the ancestral state(s) of sonar-jamming, and 3) whether gaining the sonar-jamming defense is correlated with losing defensive chemistry. Geographic information from specimen labels will be used to understand whether environmental and/or biotic factors have influenced the evolution of these anti-predator traits. The Fellow will be trained in molecular methods, comparative evolutionary analyses, geometric morphometrics, analytical chemistry techniques, and spatial analyses of overlapping species distributions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY2018 (Research Using Biological Collections) led by PI Nicolas J. Dowdy with mentorship by Jennifer M. Zaspel, explored answers to this question using a major neotropical lineage of tiger moths (Lepidoptera: Arctiinae: Phaegopterina) as a model system. Broadly, this work generated a statistically robust understanding of evolutionary relationships within this group that greatly improved on the results from previous efforts. This led to an unexpected number of major taxonomic re-arrangements, including the recognition of new subtribes and genera. The generated evolutionary backbone provided the basis for the most surprising results from this work ? that the impressive sonar jamming defense of tiger moths likely evolved not once, but at least 18 times! In addition, there have been as many as 13 losses and/or reductions of complex sound production within this group. The reasons for this unexpected result are still a mystery, and this is now a new area of active research. It was also discovered that areas of higher bat abundance and diversity (e.g., Guianan Shield) may harbor higher proportions of moths that are strong sonar jammers. These results demonstrate that biological collections can have utility in broadly characterizing and assessing the evolution of complex behavioral traits and constitute a useful supplement to field work with live animals, especially in situations where species are exceedingly rare, difficult to access, or even extinct.</p>\n<p>During this fellowship, PI Dowdy published 8 peer-review articles, with additional works currently in preparation. He also co-led the formation of an annual international conference focused on tiger moth biology (&gt;80 members in &gt;13 countries), with planning for its 3<sup>rd</sup> consecutive meeting underway. Data from this research have been presented in numerous venues, including international conferences, invited departmental seminars, and presentations to the general public. PI Dowdy gained experience in planning and executing large-scale phylogenomic studies, performing high-quality specimen imaging using optical imaging and scanning electron microscopy, analytical chemistry techniques, conducting comparative phylogenetics analyses, publishing manuscripts, mentoring junior scientists, and applying to positions at both universities and museums. As part of this fellowship, PI Dowdy provided training and mentoring for 2 undergraduates and 2 graduate students (all from underrepresented groups) in hypothesis testing, data science, bioinformatics, presentation of scientific results, and engaging with scientific literature. More broadly, PI Dowdy produced a public exhibit at the Milwaukee Public Museum titled \"The many ways species interact in the rainforest\", which is targeted toward the general public (including elementary school children). This exhibit utilizes text, video, physical models, and real specimens to explain how species interactions contribute to biodiversity in the neotropics. The bat-moth predator-prey arms race is used as a case study, broadly disseminating the research outcomes of the fellowship to audiences that often would not be presented this information. Finally, a YouTube video discussing the results of one of the publications from this work was produced in collaboration with the YouTube channel SciShow (7.34M subscribers), which has received over 136,000 views to date. The products from this fellowship have not only provided a better picture of bat-moth coevolution but have also expanded our ideas about the research potential of museum collections and provided examples of how museum exhibits and online video platforms can be used by researchers to help disseminate new scientific information to the public.</p>\n<p>PI Dowdy?s training as an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Biology has directly helped him to develop as a scientist, mentor, and steward of biological collections. He has forged numerous new international and domestic collaborations as a direct result of this work. The experience he gained during the fellowship was critical in securing his current position as Head of Zoology and Director of Collections Informatics at the Milwaukee Public Museum where he continues his research on bat-moth predator-prey interactions while overseeing the safety, utilization, and development of the biological collections housed therein.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/28/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Nicolas&nbsp;J&nbsp;Dowdy</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1811897/1811897_10630221_1672251676276_img6--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1811897/1811897_10630221_1672251676276_img6--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Moth Voucher Image\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1811897/1811897_10630221_1672251676276_img6--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Moth Voucher Image\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A high-quality voucher image of a moth used in this study, Ischnognatha ssemiopalina</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nicolas J Dowdy</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nicolas&nbsp;J&nbsp;Dowdy</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Moth Voucher Image</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1811897/1811897_10630221_1672251796795_img5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1811897/1811897_10630221_1672251796795_img5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Specimens Prepared for SEM Imaging\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1811897/1811897_10630221_1672251796795_img5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Specimens Prepared for SEM Imaging\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">These are some of the stored specimen dissections awaiting imaging using scanning electron microsopy.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nicolas J Dowdy</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nicolas&nbsp;J&nbsp;Dowdy</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Specimens Prepared for SEM Imaging</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1811897/1811897_10630221_1672252007796_img2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1811897/1811897_10630221_1672252007796_img2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Museum specimens\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1811897/1811897_10630221_1672252007796_img2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Museum specimens\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Some of the specimens borrowed from museum that had their DNA sequenced and traits characterized as part of this work.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nicolas J Dowdy</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nicolas&nbsp;J&nbsp;Dowdy</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Museum specimens</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1811897/1811897_10630221_1672251886262_img4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1811897/1811897_10630221_1672251886262_img4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Student Learning DNA Extraction\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1811897/1811897_10630221_1672251886262_img4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Student Learning DNA Extraction\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Mentee of PI Dowdy, Kathryn Sullivan practicing loading a gel to confirm the results of a DNA extraction</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nicolas J Dowdy</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nicolas&nbsp;J&nbsp;Dowdy</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Student Learning DNA Extraction</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
