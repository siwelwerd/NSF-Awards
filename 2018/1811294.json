 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geophysical, environmental and ecological datasets often include many variables observed over a set of irregular geographical locations. While spatial datasets are increasing in size, they are also increasing in complexity with many variables being simultaneously observed, recorded, modeled or derived. Current methods in spatial statistics are unable to cope with such highly multivariate datasets; this research addresses this gap in statistical science, aiming to establish a new framework for multivariate spatial models. The testbed for the new framework is in the field of climate data science. Understanding of the Earth system relies on coupled physical models that represent the dynamic evolution of the atmosphere, ocean, land use, rivers, glaciers and other processes. These models have led to vast amounts of climate model data that severely constrain storage resources. Moreover, statistical emulators are increasingly common and desirable alternatives to running complex physical models directly. Development and validation of compression and emulation algorithms require understanding and maintaining complex dependencies between physical variables, but current tools are univariate or pairwise-based. This research will provide statistical guidance for climate data science applications.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on a modeling framework for multivariate spatial processes, and relies on new theory incorporating graphical models in multiscale multivariate spatial process representations.  Moreover, many multivariate datasets exhibit non-Gaussian behavior.  A companion thrust of this work is in introducing and exploring empirical likelihood techniques for large multivariate spatial processes.  Finally, the proposed models and estimation frameworks will be applied to a climate dataset from the Community Atmosphere Model.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe field of spatial statistics is an expanding subset of statistical science with numerous applications in a wide variety of specialties such as geophysical, environmental, ecological and economic sciences. However, modern scientific objectives involve analyses of large and multivariate spatial data sets that challenge existing statistical methodology.  The problem of highly multivariate and heterogeneous spatial field modeling is particularly pronounced for climate data science.  The primary focus of this project was in developing flexible spatial models that are adaptable to large, multivariate and nonstationary data sets, with an emphasis on those that arise in the climate and atmospheric data sciences.\n\nWe developed new statistical models that are capable of modeling nonstationary and very large spatial processes.  The models extend well-established techniques in the field, allow for interpretable structure and can handle massive spatial data sets.  We extended these ideas to the multivariate setting where multiple spatial processes may exhibit complex within, and between, process dependencies, and applied the model to a large atmospheric model data set.  We investigated statistical theory connecting lattice and continuous process models.  These methods were illustrated on large, heterogeneous and complex climate model output data sets, and showed good ability to capture appropriate statistical characteristics of atmospheric processes.  Validation of spatial fields of climate model output is difficult; we introduced new geophysical forecast verification technique designed for assessing spatial field structure.  In atmospheric data assimilation, multivariate spatial models can be used as localization functions to reduce sampling errors in empirical covariance estimates; we introduced a new compactly supported multivariate covariance model that was shown to improve assimilation over existing models.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nResearch related to this project resulted in numerous training opportunities for students, including six graduate students at the University of Colorado who gained interdisciplinary training in statistics and domain sciences such as climate and atmospheric science.  Graduate students gained additional experience in collaboration with scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, National Renewable Energy Laboratory and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  Examples of student projects include historical temperature climatology estimation, stochastic modeling of solar irradiances, development of stochastic weather generators and climate model emulation.  The results of these projects may be useful for climate and atmospheric model validation, and power grid planning studies.  The PI also taught two short courses related to research developed during this project to a wide array of statisticians and scientists interested in spatial statistical methods.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/05/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William P Kleiber"
