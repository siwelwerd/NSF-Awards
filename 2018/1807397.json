 "awd_abstract_narration": "Photonic integrated circuits with miniature component sizes and high integration density have been regarded as the technology that can potentially provide breakthrough advancement in modern computing and communication systems, as it aims to achieve an optical analogy of VLSI that can overcome several bottleneck electronic technologies encounter such as speed, bandwidth, and power consumption. Key components in photonic integrated circuits include lasers, waveguides, modulators, and photodetectors that can be lithographically defined and fabricated on low-cost Si platforms to achieve ultimate system compatibilities. Among these, lasers have been the most challenging to integrate with Si due to the incompatible fabrication processes between laser gain materials and Si. In addition to computing and optical fiber communications, lasers that feature facile integration on Si can find vast application scopes in free-space communications, projection displays, lighting, spectroscopy, sensing, biomedicine, etc. Wavelength spectra ranging from UV, visible to IR are all desirable depending on the applications. Although heterogeneous optoelectronics based on chip-level bonding and III-V epitaxial growth on Si in bulk, nanowire or quantum dot (QD) forms have been pursued, the fabrication processes are elaborated which is likely to keep the cost high. Solution-processed materials such as organic materials offer a promising route to overcome this challenge as they can be fabricated on a wide variety of substrates, and organic LEDs have achieved impressive performance and are commercially available now. But the material has not been able to achieve laser operations chiefly due to low charge mobility. \r\nIn recent years, hybrid organic-inorganic halide perovskite materials have emerged as a highly promising newcomer among photonic materials. These materials exhibit high charge mobility, sharp optical absorption edges and high absorption coefficients comparable to GaAs, as well as an unusual defect tolerance. Although lasing in perovskite materials in various resonant-cavity forms have been achieved, perovskite lasers with designed resonant cavities suitable for photonic integrated circuits have not been demonstrated. Furthermore, stability of the perovskite materials is still a main concern in this field, and electrical pumping remains a challenging, overarching goal for perovskite lasers. The objective of the proposed research is to improve and optimize key parameters for achieving electrical pumping in perovskite lasers, and to assess the feasibility of perovskite laser operation under current injection. We will investigate perovskite material properties to improve the charge mobility and material stability. Engineering of the electron and hole transport layers, as well as the device design, will be explored to further enhance the overall device stability. A vertical cavity laser will be designed and fabricated, and optimization of the resonant cavity based on the PI's prior work on optically pumped perovskite QD vertical cavity lasers will be pursued. A waveguide distributed feedback (DFB) laser that can be lithographically defined and fully compatible with Si photonic integrated circuit fabrication will also be explored. These edge-emitting waveguide lasers are expected to achieve lower lasing threshold due to longer gain length and highly confined optical modes. Pulsed current injection with temperature control will be employed to assess the feasibility of electrical pumping. Through the proposed research, key issues for electrically pumped perovskite lasers will be probed and addressed by investigating several aspects of device design and fabrication simultaneously, including material processing, electrical interfaces, optical structures and resonant cavities. The results will contribute to necessary knowledge for realizing electrically pumped perovskite lasers, which provide a promising route to integrated lasers on Si chips.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project provided outstanding training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and research scientists. Technology transfer efforts have also resulted from the research. The outcomes in Intellectual Merits and Broader Impacts are summarized below.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merits:</strong> We identified that to achieve sufficient population inversion and optical gain under electrical pumping for perovskite lasers, the output luminance of perovskite LEDs should be maximized first before the structure is integrated with a resonant laser cavity. However, LEDs made with solution-processed materials, including OLEDs, suffer from significant efficiency roll-off under high injection current density. After optimizing the perovskite material, hole transport layers and include current-injection apertures (Figure 1), we were able to achieve 7.6 Mcd/m<sup>2</sup> luminance under pulsed current injection (Figure 2) which was the highest among perovskite LEDs at the time of publishing the results. The corresponding product of injection current density times external quantum efficiency is still significantly lower than the threshold for achieving optical gain under electrical pumping. Therefore, much improvement still needs to be done and we continue our efforts in this direction. To be able to integrate perovskite lasers on a chip with other photonic components, implementing the laser in a 1<sup>st</sup>-order DFB resonator configuration is highly desirable. We successfully demonstrated the first optically pumped green-emitting 1<sup>st</sup>-order DFB perovskite laser with a narrow linewidth of 0.4 nm and a threshold of 60 &mu;J cm<sup>-2 </sup>(Figure 3). Through the support of this award, we also explore other perovskite devices and achieved functional resistive and optical memory arrays. High-resolution patterning of perovskite materials is challenging due to their incompatibility with most solvents used in lithography. We developed a new way to pattern perovskite color converters and perovskite LEDs through photolithography-based dry liftoff. Using this method, we were able to pattern R/G/B perovskites (Figure 4) as well as multi-color patterning of perovskite color converters (Figure 5). A resolution of 4 microns was achieved (Figure 6).</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts: </strong>Over the entire project period, this research program provided training opportunities for 3 PhD students, 2 MS students, 5 undergraduate students (2 through NSF REU supports), 1 high school intern, 1 postdoctoral researcher, and 1 research scientist. It also provided mentoring experience for the senior graduate students, the postdoctoral researcher and the research scientist. Along the path of technology transfer, we filed two international PCT patent applications. The research in the direction of electrically pumped perovskite lasers seeks to address the long-term overarching goal in the field of photonics to achieve low-cost integrated lasers, and our work on reducing efficiency roll-off of perovskite LEDs under high injection current density demonstrated the potential of perovskite lasers. In the shorter term, our work on perovskite color converters provided an appealing potential solution for high-resolution, high-brightness displays. Augmented reality and virtuality reality (AR/VR) is poised to change how humans interact with the world through digital revolution. Nevertheless, there are critical obstacles remaining, and one notable impediment is optical clarity and resolution, an essential human sense. To this end, the industry is actively investing in micro-LED technology. However, the manufacturing process of micro-LED displays is extremely time consuming and labor intensive, which leads to prohibitive costs, yields, and production times. Our perovskite color converter technology is compatible with existing semiconductor manufacturing, and can significantly reduce the number of key steps in the process for high-resolution displays. We successfully won two seed grants to start the technology commercialization effort, and subsequently received an NSF PFI award to continue this endeavor.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/13/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Lih&nbsp;Y&nbsp;Lin</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1807397/1807397_10568500_1663109037467_NSFECCS-1807397FinalReport2022-OutcomesFigure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1807397/1807397_10568500_1663109037467_NSFECCS-1807397FinalReport2022-OutcomesFigure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1807397/1807397_10568500_1663109037467_NSFECCS-1807397FinalReport2022-OutcomesFigure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Schematic illustration of a perovskite LED with current-focusing apertures for reducing efficiency roll-off under high injection current density.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Chen Zou, University of Washington</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lih&nbsp;Y&nbsp;Lin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1807397/1807397_10568500_1662764593045_NSFECCS-1807397FinalReport2022-OutcomesFigure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1807397/1807397_10568500_1662764593045_NSFECCS-1807397FinalReport2022-OutcomesFigure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1807397/1807397_10568500_1662764593045_NSFECCS-1807397FinalReport2022-OutcomesFigure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Efficiency-Luminance characteristics of perovskite LEDs.
