A key research objective will be to enable the design of a customized, silicon-controlled, tunable laser capable of insertion into a high-speed data communication link based on hybrid III-V/Si integration. A key development objective will be to enable the assembly and manufacture of the silicon photonic integrated circuits using industry-accepted back-end-of-line integration methods.\u00a0",

Optical interconnects created with silicon photonic devices can transmit more information over larger distances, and are more energy efficient than copper-based links.  However, successful commercialization of silicon photonics platform has yet to include an integrated, tunable laser. This fact has limited the platform?s market penetration into because many applications would prefer the compactness, reduced complexity, and lower cost of an integrated source.\n\nAxalume has demonstrated a tunable, chip-scale, integrated laser.
