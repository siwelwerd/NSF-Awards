 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Seventh International Conference on Computational Harmonic Analysis (ICCHA7) will take place at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN during May 14-18, 2018, in conjunction with the 33rd Annual Shanks Conference and Lecture. The conference website https://my.vanderbilt.edu/iccha7 contains a list of the conference plenary speakers and other conference information.  Computational harmonic analysis is a fundamental tool for analyzing and representing information, and is especially motivated by modern applications where data has complex structure and massively high dimension.  Applications of computational harmonic analysis include many areas of national technological interest such as data science, neural networks and artificial intelligence, medical imaging, radar signal processing, coding theory, and quantum computing.  The conference will discuss the most recent theoretical breakthroughs, practical advances, and emerging directions in computational harmonic analysis.  The plenary speakers include a diverse assortment of experts, and female and early career scientists are well-represented.  An important broader impact of the conference is to support the participation of students, early career scientists, and underrepresented minorities; the conference will make a particular effort to invite and provide travel support to members of these groups.  Travel support will be strongly prioritized to those without other sources of travel funding, so as to make the conference accessible those who would not otherwise be able to attend.  This will contribute to expanding and diversifying the nation's talent pool and workforce in the mathematical sciences by contributing to the training of underrepresented groups in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nSpecific technical topics addressed at the conference will include, but are not limited to: compressed sensing, phase retrieval, convolutional neural networks, wavelets and multiscale transforms, frame theory, graph-based signal processing, time-frequency analysis, analog-to-digital conversion, signal and image processing, quantum computation, and mathematical learning theory.  A main intellectual merit of the conference is to provide a venue to disseminate recent advances in computational harmonic analysis.  The conference will consist of plenary talks, as well as shorter talks and minisymposia in parallel sessions.  There will be numerous opportunities for mathematical interaction and collaboration among the participants.  The conference will provide an interdisciplinary link between mathematicians, engineers, and scientists from other fields who are working on computational harmonic analysis.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Seventh International Conference on Computational Harmonic Analysis (ICCHA7) was a public forum for the exchange of ideas, discussion of new methods, and the communication of theoretical and applied mathematical research in the broad field of harmonic analysis.  This domain of mathematics has established its usefulness in a huge spectrum of applications since the early 1940's where Fourier transforms became an indispensable tool for the solution of differential equations for hydro and aerodynamics, and later for diffusion and wave equations with direct implications in seismic imaging for oil exploration and weather forecasting.  In recent years, when the digital revolution took off, harmonic analysis provided a solid theoretical foundation for digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital conversion, audio, image, and signal processing, and post-processing of medical images from various tomographic modalities.\n\n \n\nThe ICCHA7 conference offered participants an educational experience on active research topics ranging from spectral synthesis, a theoretical area emanating from the synthesis of sunlight into an ensemble of the rainbow colors, to cutting edge applied work in artificial intelligence, machine learning and the vastly under-explored aspects of the architecture of complex deep neural networks which are increasingly becoming popular and more known to the general public due to robotic vision and self-driving vehicles.  Other topics discussed at the conference included special bases for smart image and signal transmission over the internet and wireless channels; sparse signal representations and dictionaries that provide building-blocks for image representations which help intelligent systems extract and interpret properties of objects and human behavior in still images and video; solutions of differential equations on the surface of the sphere; super-resolution which enables highly accurate imaging when zoom capabilities are exhausted; and phase retrieval techniques which addresses signal recovery from measurements that are missing phase information.\n\n \n\nLeveraging local funds with NSF support provided an opportunity for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to participate in ICCAH7 by covering or defraying their local and travel expenses.   Early career researchers were able to present their research findings during talks or poster presentations.  Women and other underrepresented groups were encouraged to participate in the conference. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/15/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alexander M Powell"
