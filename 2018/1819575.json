 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research activities of Professors Christopher Carone, Joshua Erlich, and Marc Sher at the College of William and Mary. \r\n\r\nA major goal of elementary particle physics is to understand the spectrum of elementary particles as well as their fundamental interactions.   This is the central focus of the work of Professors Carone, Erlich, and Sher, who construct and study theories that address some of the most profound unsolved mysteries in particle physics.   These theories often lead to testable predictions in experiments like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which was built in order to search for undiscovered particles and to study their properties.  The LHC is best known for the discovery of the Higgs boson, a particle whose existence is related to the origin of the masses of the other known elementary particles.  The LHC operates at the frontier of experimentally accessible energies.  The theoretical work of Professors Carone, Erlich, and Sher is also relevant at lower-energy experiments, such as dark-matter searches, designed to explore the possibility of new particles with very weak interactions. Research in these areas advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions:  the discovery and understanding of new particles and new physical laws. In their research, Professors Carone, Erlich, and Sher will explore several new theories that are experimentally testable. These include theories in which the observed Higgs boson is accompanied by additional Higgs bosons, theories in which new, very weakly interacting particles are present in conjunction with dark matter, and theories which provide a new description of the nature of gravity.  The project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts:  Professors Carone, Erlich, and Sher will provide critical training for both undergraduate and graduate students beginning research in a technical field, giving them skills that translate to the broader technical workforce.  They will also continue presenting public lectures on their research results, giving interviews about new results to interested media, and promoting high-energy physics in the southeastern United States.\r\n\r\nMore technically, Professors Carone, Erlich, and Sher will study models in which a warped extra dimension is stabilized by two Higgs doublets.  They will construct models in which a non-Abelian flavor symmetry leads to familons that play a role in solving the strong CP problem and allowing for successful multi-field inflation.   They have recently demonstrated the existence of a composite graviton in a class of scalar theories, and they will extend this to similar theories with fermions and gauge fields. This may lend support to a new approach to the problem of quantum gravity.  They will also study dark sectors, with exotic fields that have very weak couplings to Standard-Model particles, analyze the renormalization-group running of these couplings, consider how these sectors can be constrained by theoretically well-motivated ultraviolet boundary conditions, and study the phenomenological implications of the dark-sector particles.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "High energy theorists aim to find elegant mathematical descriptions of nature at short distance scales.  This NSF project focused on a range of issues in particle physics associated with the distance scales probed at the most powerful, present-day particle colliders, as well as at the much shorter scales where the effects of gravity become as important.  \n  At the distance scales relevant at colliders, work was completed that explored the possible structure of the Higgs sector -- the particles and interactions which are responsible for generating the masses of the other known elementary particles.  In particular, Sher's work considered the experimental implications of a number of theoretical descriptions of this sector, which each made distinct experimental predictions that can be tested in future experiments, including at the Large Hadron Collider.      \n While the Higgs sector studied by Sher explains the origin of known particle masses, it doesn't explain why some particles are much heavier than others. Carone considered theories that describe physics at shorter distance scales that explain the mysterious pattern of known particle masses.  Carone also considered theories that can explain why it is natural for the overall mass scale of known particles to be so much lighter than the mass scale associated with gravitational physics, and how theories of particles that we observe might be extrapolated to infinitely high energies.  Carone considered dark matter in some of these theories, the mysterious particle that seems to affect the rotation of galaxies but has yet to be directly observed.\n              \n Finally, Carone and Erlich considered new ways of describing gravity; they proposed an economical model in which the particle of gravity is a composite made of the other particles in the theory.   Erlich went on to consider how this framework might be consistent with unconventional models of quantum mechanics.\n           \n The broader impact of this work is that it contributes to excellence in particle physics research in the United States by providing a deeper understanding of the fundamental constituents of the universe and how they interact.
