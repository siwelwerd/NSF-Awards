 "awd_abstract_narration": "The many interconnected relationships between predators and prey in a food web can link seemingly distant organisms and processes.  This study explores how the influence of top predators in a terrestrial environment is linked across ecosystem boundaries to impact primary production and food webs in aquatic environments. This study also explores how aquatic ecosystem responses to predators can reverberate back out of the stream to impact terrestrial predators that rely on the export of emerging adult insects from the stream. Cross-ecosystem food web connections will be studied at three different National Parks (Zion, Rocky Mountain, and Yellowstone National Parks), thereby providing replication at large spatial scales and leveraging the opportunities that National Parks provide to educate the public about food web ecology and the role of top predators in structuring our ecosystems.  This research will be the first of its kind to investigate reverberating effects of trophic cascades whereby indirect effects may cross ecosystem boundaries (terrestrial to aquatic) and then subsequently reverberate back to animals and plants in the original ecosystem (aquatic back to terrestrial).  This work will provide a more complete picture of how the loss of top predatory species worldwide may be indirectly influencing many distantly connected species.\r\n\r\nPrevious investigations have demonstrated the indirect role of top predators (e.g., wolves in Yellowstone Park and mountain lions in Zion National Park) in control of riparian vegetation along streams.  In addition, streams and riparian zones are connected by well-understood processes of material and organism exchange, making them ideal systems to identify and quantify trophic reverberations.  The study will be conducted in streams and adjacent riparian zones and will encompass (1) streamside ungulate browsing and riparian plant communities, (2) community composition and abundance of in-stream biota, quantification of terrestrial fluxes (organic matter and invertebrate) fluxes to streams, and diets of stream biota, and (3) emergent adult aquatic insects in the riparian zone and the response of spiders and bats. These riparian insectivores serve as a bellwether for changes in stream insect emergence and stream-riparian linkages. In each park, replicate study sites will be established along streams with and without controls on ungulate browsing of riparian woody vegetation.  By comparing within and across three national parks, this study will yield a greater understanding of how community and landscape context may mediate the strength, or even sign, of reverberating responses to terrestrial top-down control of ungulate browsing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe overarching goal of this project was to understand how complex species interactions in terrestrial ecosystems that influence streamside plants can indirectly affect stream food webs and the exchange of energy between streams and adjacent terrestrial systems, including potential effects that reverberate from the stream back to land and the riparian predators therein.  We focused our exploration of this question in Yellowstone National Park (YNP), where there is a well-established apex predator trophic cascade that has contributed to the release of streamside vegetation from heavy herbivore browse, and in-turn promoted regeneration of riparian woody plant communities along many streams.  However, this system has also seen substantial increases in bison density over the past 20 years.  Bison are not as strongly influenced by top predators on this landscape, therefore, while some areas have seen strong regeneration of riparian wood vegetation, areas with high bison densities continue to have high browse, and low densities (or complete absence) of streamside woody vegetation.  Across YNP\u2019s Northern Range, this has led to streams with varying riparian plant communities mediated by different degrees of ungulate herbivory (influenced at least in part by susceptibility to apex predator affects).  Within these systems, we quantified streamside plant communities (herbaceous and woody pants), aquatic ecosystem processes, stream aquatic communities (diatoms, macroinvertebrates, and fish), emergent insects, and streamside predators that specialize on insects (spiders and bats). \n\n \n\nOur initial results suggest that dynamics of terrestrial wildlife interactions that alter riparian vegetation in northern YNP do indeed set the stage for differences in core aquatic-terrestrial interactions and stream food web dynamics. However, our studies have also highlighted that these terrestrial drivers are just one of many factors affecting stream ecosystems and energy exchange between aquatic and terrestrial food webs, and, further, that these systems are not static.  We found that sites in this region occur in a mosaic of different stream-riparian ecosystem states that appear to be on different trajectories of change.  Riparian vegetation state is an important influence on organismal and process measures we have made, but ultimately a suite of individual site characteristics &ndash; ranging from landscape position, to hydrologic and geomorphic conditions, to traits of primary producers, invertebrates, and fishes &ndash; all interact to mediate the current diversity, productivity and food web characteristics of the stream-riparian ecosystems in these systems. These preliminary findings, have the potential to clarify key points within the prevailing narrative regarding the various direct and indirect ecological effects of wolf and other top predator changes in the Yellowstone ecosystem.  While our findings suggest that riparian vegetation strongly influences the physical and chemical characteristics and basal resources among the study streams, individual site characteristics interact with and mediate the ecological influences of riparian vegetation conditions on stream and riparian organisms and ecosystem processes across the landscape of northern YNP.  Further, the character of the specific organisms found at each of these streams plays an important role in mediating how different riparian vegetation conditions affect these stream ecosystems, which can affect exchange of resources between streams and riparian zones.  Taken together, our work highlights the importance of considering the effects of both species\u2019 interactions (top-down control in particular in this case) and the underlying geomorphic framework of a landscape together in understanding extended indirect effects.\n\n \n\nIn considering the particular extended indirect effects of trophic cascades in which cascading influences of an apex predator in one ecosystem may cross a boundary into another ecosystem, and then reverberate back in the other \"direction\" to influence organisms in the initial system, this work is contributing to our understanding of how ecological context might mediate the occurrence or magnitude of such reverberating effects, including how these might be influenced by organism traits and behavioral versus numeric responses of predators to resource subsidies. Thus far, findings from our investigations in YNP are consistent with the hypothesis that reverberating responses can occur, and suggests that characteristics of individual sites may mediate such responses.\n\n \n\nPapers associated with this grant include continuing research broadly exploring herbivory and top-down control of riparian communities in YNP, site-specific research studies across our focal streams, and conceptual/review papers that utilize this example of a complex food web interaction.
