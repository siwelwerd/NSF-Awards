 "awd_abstract_narration": "Downbursts, referring to downward high intensity winds associated with thunderstorms, pose a major threat to power transmission grids in many parts of the United States.  Considering the distributed size of the power transmission infrastructure, significant investments will be needed in order to upgrade the existing systems and properly design new infrastructure to resist downburst wind forces. The goal of this research is to develop an integrative experimental and numerical framework that is capable of characterizing the extent of vulnerability of the power transmission infrastructure against downbursts, and identify the most critical components. The framework will provide knowledge that can help reduce outage-induced societal disruptions caused by downbursts, and thus enable continued national prosperity and welfare following a downburst event. Using this framework, various significant factors for the downburst performance of transmission systems and potential causes of past failures will be investigated. Moreover, this research will develop the first generation of downburst fragility models for transmission tower-line systems (TLSs) using experimentally validated numerical models. These fragility models are crucial for risk-informed decision making for design and management of the transmission grid in order to mitigate future failures and enhance the resiliency of the grid against extreme weather events. The numerical and experimental studies will provide the knowledge needed to enhance design methodologies to include downburst wind loads for transmission line systems.  The research findings will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate courses at Florida International University (FIU) and The Ohio State University to better prepare the future generation of infrastructure engineers. Project data will be archived and publicly shared in the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org/). \r\n\r\nThis research will develop an integrative experimental and numerical framework to characterize the fragility of transmission line systems against downbursts. The experimental research will involve developing a versatile downburst simulator at the NSF-supported NHERI Wall of Wind (WOW) Experimental Facility (EF) at FIU. Using this simulator, a scaled, aeroelastic multi-span TLS will be tested; the results will be used to experimentally validate high-fidelity finite element models of coupled transmission tower-insulator-conductor-foundation systems. Through these experimental and numerical investigations, new knowledge will be gained with regard to the aerodynamic behavior of conductors and drag and shielding effects on lattice tower sections under non-synoptic downburst wind fields. Moreover, these investigations will reveal extreme nonlinear behaviors of transmission line systems in post-elastic regimes when towers are damaged or conductors fail. The research also will provide new physics-based insights into the role of uncertainties in the downburst performance of TLSs. Failure modes that are unique to or are more likely to occur under non-synoptic downburst loadings, as compared to those under synoptic hurricane loadings, will be identified and characterized. The produced data and models will be integrated to develop the first generation of multi-dimensional demand and fragility surfaces for TLSs under downbursts at component- and system-levels using highly efficient and accurate machine learning techniques. In addition, the experimental downburst simulator at the NHERI WOW EF at FIU will provide the natural hazards community with a unique testbed with dual simulation capabilities to generate both non-synoptic and synoptic winds and analyze the impacts on buildings and other structural systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

However, their extensive reach makes them vulnerable to extreme weather events, including hurricanes, tornadoes, and downbursts. Downbursts are intense, localized columns of rapidly descending air from thunderstorms, creating strong lateral winds upon ground impact. Unlike atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) winds, downbursts exert their peak wind speeds 50-100 meters above ground, intensifying their impact on structures like TLSs. Additionally, the spatiotemporal characteristics of downbursts significantly alter wind loading on these systems, increasing the risk of structural failures and power supply disruptions.</p>\r\n<p>This project addressed these vulnerabilities through experimental studies and computational modeling of TLSs. At the NSF NHERI Wall of Wind Experimental Facility (WOW EF), the FIU team expanded capabilities to simulate downburst winds for the first time using a wall jet approach. This innovative method redirected the flow from WOW&rsquo;s 12-fan array with a blockage wall and adjustable louver slats, successfully replicating key downburst features. Extensive flow field measurements with Cobra Probes and a newly integrated Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system revealed that this method effectively simulated primary and trailing vortices, performing comparably to the impinging jet approach while allowing for larger geometric scales.</p>\r\n<p>A scaled TLS model was designed and constructed at 1:50 vertical and 1:150 horizontal scales. This included three phases: (1) a damaged transmission tower, (2) an undamaged tower, and (3) a three-tower TLS system. Testing was conducted under both ABL and downburst wind conditions, except for the damaged tower, which was only subjected to downburst winds. Two special cases simulated non-uniform loading and conductor breakage to enhance realism. Testing revealed critical data on TLS performance, with accelerometers installed on all towers and strain gauges applied to select towers for detailed measurements.</p>\r\n<p>Under varying mean wind speeds of 9.04 to 12.81 m/s, findings showed that downburst wind loads produced slightly higher dynamic responses compared to synoptic winds. Towers experienced increased acceleration root mean square (RMS), base shear, and base moments under downburst conditions. Additionally, non-Gaussian responses were more pronounced under downburst loads. The middle tower (T2), subjected to non-uniform loading, exhibited responses reaching 80-95% of the third tower's (T3) response in the across-wind direction and 80-90% in the along-wind direction. Even towers outside the wind flow, like T1, vibrated due to induced effects, with T1&rsquo;s response reaching 40% of T3&rsquo;s. These results underscore how downburst impacts extend beyond directly affected towers, necessitating further investigation.</p>\r\n<p>The project also advanced computational modeling and reliability analysis of TLSs. A key innovation was the global error-based learning function, which optimally refined surrogate models to improve computational efficiency and accuracy. This framework was validated on benchmark problems and applied to practical engineering scenarios, demonstrating reduced errors in failure probability estimates. Another significant contribution was the development of an adaptive multi-fidelity Gaussian process framework, which leveraged high- and low-fidelity models to enhance computational efficiency. This approach enabled the generation of high-fidelity fragility models, with limit states defined by a displacement criterion of 0.25 meters at the top node. This criterion corresponds to serviceability failure, requiring repairs to ensure the tower&rsquo;s safety against future hazards.</p>\r\n<p>Fragility analysis was extended to encompass a broader range of damage states, from slight to extensive, to support risk-informed decision-making. These fragility models were built on a rigorous probabilistic framework that accounted for uncertainties in TLS performance. Additionally, the team developed innovative methodologies for Value of Information (VoI) analysis, enabling efficient resource allocation in decision-making under uncertainty. Active learning and knowledge-sharing techniques enhanced surrogate model accuracy while minimizing computational costs.</p>\r\n<p>Collectively, the experimental and computational advances from this project provide critical insights into TLS performance under extreme wind conditions.
