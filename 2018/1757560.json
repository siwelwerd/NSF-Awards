 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded from the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites program in the SBE Directorate. It has both scientific and societal benefits, and integrates research and education. The Brooklyn College (BC) of the City University of New York REU program aims to advance discovery for the scientific and broader communities while promoting mentoring, learning, and professional development by: (1) immersing students from underrepresented groups (primarily women, racial minorities, first-generation college students) in innovative research in psychology and neuroscience; (2) guiding students through the scientific process, from generation of research questions to communication of results; (3) engaging students in didactics that highlight the relevance and applied value of their laboratory work; (4) enhancing students' competitiveness for graduate school and professional positions; and (5) boosting the research competence of local middle and high school teachers with downstream positive learning effects for their students. This REU program also enables faculty members to supervise talented individuals who might otherwise miss out on mentored laboratory and professional development opportunities, and contributes to the training and advancement of the next generation of scientists. \r\n\r\nThe central (scientific) component of this REU program is a semester-long laboratory immersion, under the supervision of Psychology, Biology, and Chemistry Department faculty mentors, which results in a completed research project. We emphasize the generation of high quality research and integration of psychological and neuroscientific theory with the design, execution, and interpretation of data. We select ten students annually for mentored research projects, especially undergraduates from ethnic-minority serving, public two-year and four-year institutions in the New York metropolitan area. Students also attend weekly didactics: a seminar that dually focuses on psychology and neuroscience principles/research methods and professional issues/career development; a journal club that familiarizes students with scientific literature through learning to select, read, critically analyze, and present summaries of original research papers; and a statistical methods seminar that emphasizes data analysis, statistical reasoning, and presentation of research findings in academic contexts. Given the importance of adhering to ethical norms in research, our students also undergo an intensive scientific ethics training. As a capstone experience, students present a poster at the BC Science Research Day, where they compete for awards based on the quality of their work and ability to communicate their findings. Many of our students work with their mentors to publish their results in peer-reviewed journals. In addition, the project has a RET (Research Experiences for Teachers) component, which provides local middle and high school teachers with coursework in research methods, mentored laboratory experience, and professional development opportunities to enhance their research competencies and raise the level of science education in local middle schools and high schools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Thirty-one outstanding undergraduate students were enrolled including those from ethnic-minority serving, public, two- and four-year institutions in the NYC metropolitan area.&nbsp;Figure 1 presents demographic characteristics of BC REU students aggregated over the award period.

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to the cancellation of the&nbsp;<em>BC Science Research Day</em>; instead, REU students presented their research at local and national conferences that were held virtually (e.g.,&nbsp;<em>American Psychological Association</em>&nbsp;annual conference). Figure 3 displays sample REU presentations from the award period and Figure 4 lists select publications and presentations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>REU students also attended weekly seminars instructed by graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to complement their laboratory work and highlight its relevance and applied value.

Of our 31 students, 7 have already enrolled in competitive doctoral programs, 1 has enrolled in medical school, 1 is undertaking a post baccalaureate program, 10 are enrolled in master's degree programs (in disciplines such as experimental psychology and neuroscience), 5 are research assistants or study coordinators, and the remainder are still completing their undergraduate studies or preparing for graduate school.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For our RET program, we recruited six talented teachers from middle and high schools in NYC. To boost recruitment effects, we teamed up with the New York City Department of Education to advertise our RET program to public school teachers. We also transitioned our application process to an online platform to increase accessibility, and we developed an online evaluation survey that enabled us to understand our program's strengths and impact while identifying areas for improvement.&nbsp;Teachers highly rated their overall research experience and cited the mentored research as the aspect of the RET program that contributed most to their learning and growth.&nbsp;As a result of the experience, teachers made the most gains in: 1) recognizing sound arguments and appropriate use of evidence; 2) working effectively with others; 3) identifying patterns in data; and 4) finding and reading articles.&nbsp;The RET program continues to serve as a critical pathway toward student growth and engagement in psychology, biology, and other STEM fields.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We are engaged in ongoing research related to REU and RET outcomes.&nbsp;In March 2022,&nbsp;PI Laura Rabin presented an overview of the program and select outcomes at the<em>&nbsp;National Social Science and Technology Conference</em>. As the theme of this conference focused on technology, Dr. Rabin highlighted changes made to our program to accommodate remote research and instructional activities.
