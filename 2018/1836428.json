 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will characterize the ignition process of materials caused by firebrand attacks, a key mechanism of wildfire spread into Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) communities. Firebrands are small burning pieces lofted by flame plumes and transported by ambient winds. Although they are small, firebrands can travel in large groups for long distances from the fire front. These firebrands can shower unto structures in WUI communities far from the wildfire itself and therefore pose serious threats to human lives and properties. In this project, lab-scale experiments and computational modeling will be used to systematically study such phenomena. By providing a better understanding of firebrand attacks, this project will promote the development of new testing standards for building codes and materials. This work will contribute to the effort in increasing the safety of structures at the wildland-urban interface, such as optimal geometry of structure for mitigating fire risks.\r\n\r\nFor a combustible solid subjected to external heating, ignition depends not only on the total energy input but also on the spatial distribution of the heating. For ignition due to firebrand attack, the distribution of firebrands and their individual shapes, sizes, and contact areas with the target structure will determine the distribution of heat flux on the structure surface. Environmental conditions (e.g., background radiant heating and air flow speed) also have a significant effect on the kinetics of the burning firebrands and the interactions between firebrands and the target structure. The goal of this study is to obtain a fundamental understanding of how these parameters affect the ignition propensity of a structure material. A combination of lab-scale experiments and computational modeling will be used. The experiment will involve firebrands burning under the influence of air flow and external radiant heating. Temperatures, burning durations, and heat release rates of the burning brands, as well as the temperature of the substrate, will be analyzed. The ignition propensity of the fuel bed will be characterized according to firebrand attributes and environmental factors. A combustion model will also be developed for simulating the thermo-kinetic process of each aspect of the firebrand attack. The simulation results will provide detailed information about gases and solids during the combustion process, thus facilitating the interpretation of the experimental observation. The numerical simulation will also allow the investigation of the underlying physics of these processes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The sizes of these firebrands vary tremendously. Depending on the distance from the fire front, the firebrand&nbsp;size can be very small and of millimeter scales. One firebrand of such a small size alone usually cannot cause ignition of any structural materials and hence the associated fire hazard was overlooked in the past. However, when small-sized firebrands accumulate, the combustion is intensified and the heat feedback to the deposited structure multiplies. This reproject improved the understanding of firebrand ignition mechanisms through three main outcomes: 1) characterization of firebrand-associated ignition propensity of exposed structures, in terms of firebrand distribution, 2) advancement in understanding the influence of the ambient wind conditions on the firebrand ignition process, and 3) development of a theoretical model that predicts the ignition of a combustible substrate during firebrand attack.</p>\n<p>In this project, a new experiment was developed. The experimental setup allowed firebrands to be generated and deposited on a combustible substrate with a precisely controlled distribution pattern. Through this, a systematic study was conducted to investigate how distributions and interactions between firebrands affect the ignition propensity of a structural material. A custom wind tunnel was also developed, allowing the investigation of the role of the ambient wind on the firebrand ignition process. The data resulted from the experiments was one of the first sets with controlled spatial distribution of WUI-associated firebrand geometry. The data helped to characterize the thermal and chemical interactions between the burning brands, advancing the understanding of the firebrand ignition during WUI fires. In addition, the data can be used to validate multiple aspects of a numerical model, including thermal and species transport, gas kinetics, and solid pyrolysis.</p>\n<p>In addition to experiments, a simplified&nbsp;radiation model was developed to predict the fuel bed temperate distribution when subjected to the heat from the firebrands. The model helped evaluate propensity and mechanisms of firebrand-induced ignition of a combustible substrate. The concept and methodology can be translated to other similar ignition processes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"TextBody\">The outcomes of this project were shared with science and technical communities through journal articles, a Ph.D. student?s dissertation, presentations in local and national conferences (e.g., US National Combustion Meeting), and invited talks from the PI?s industry partners (e.g., Underwriters Laboratories).
