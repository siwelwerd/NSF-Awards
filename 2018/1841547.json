 "awd_abstract_narration": "Satellite or airborne mapping, or remote sensing, of soil nutrient and contaminant levels would have wide benefits for forest and rangeland management, carbon budget allocation, water quality, and agricultural systems. The central challenge in the use of remote sensing to infer soil quality is that most soils are covered by vegetation, which shields the soil from direct observation. The goal of this project is to develop new methods that use the chemical and physical characteristics of vegetation that can be mapped using remote sensing techniques to determine the quality of underlying soil. The benefit of using remote sensing techniques to quantify soil properties is two-fold: (1) remote sensing techniques uniquely provide information at the scale of management, for example a watershed or national forest, and (2) allow for repeat and ultimately real-time detection of changing environmental conditions, including drought, nutrient limitation, changing plant species distribution, contamination, climatic change, and disease.  \r\n\r\nThis project seeks to decode the chemical signals in soils using the reflectance of the overlying vegetation, as measured by the National Ecological Observatory Network's (NEON) Airborne Observation Platform (AOP). The AOP collects 1 m reflectance data using a visible to shortwave infrared (VSWIR) sensor, as well as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. To build a relationship between NEON imaging spectroscopy data and the underlying soil characteristics, the research team will analyze a sample archive of paired vegetation and soil and sediment samples from over 400 sites successfully collected in conjunction with the AOP survey in June of 2018. The dataset spans more than 300 km2 in the Upper East River watershed in Colorado, encompassing four headwater catchments with variable geology and topography, including two metals-impacted watersheds and diverse land-use practices. A number of complementary projects will also use the dataset to characterize microbial communities, bare rock mineralogy, and plant species distributions. Here, the airborne reflectance data, when paired with the ground sampling campaign, will be used to test for relationships between vegetation and soil properties and to  extrapolate these relationships across a large spatial domain. Our overarching objective is to develop an approach to characterize soil carbon, nutrients and metal contaminants in a spatially explicit way. Ultimately, establishing the utility of next-generation sensors for mapping biogeochemical processes, at the scale of management, is a critical step in the evolution from airborne-based regional datasets to satellite missions with global, repeat coverage, including NASA's Hyperspectral Infrared Imager(HyspIRI) mission and Germany's Environmental Mapping and Analysis Programme (EnMAP).   This project is jointly funded by the Division of Earth Sciences and the Ecosystem Science Cluster in the Division of Environmental Biology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These advances build on decades of satellite monitoring to provide timely and actionable information for managed and natural systems. &nbsp;However, many ecosystem changes that alter carbon, water and nutrient fluxes are moderated by belowground soil properties and are thus mostly invisible to air- and spaceborne sensors. Currently, in vegetated areas we cannot reliably predict soil characteristics from remotely measurable properties of the land surface (e.g., surface reflectance and high-resolution topographic information). Our objective in this Signals in the Soils (SitS) project was to develop methodologies to characterize nutrient and metal characteristics in vegetation and soils in a spatially explicit way to quantify the stocks and fluxes of nutrients and trace metals that regulate ecosystem processes.</p>\n<p>The central outcome of the project is the development of an expanded methodology for combining airborne data with field-based ecological and geochemical data. The field campaign and sampling approach, which uniquely extends from the top of the canopy to the base of the soils, was the first of its kind. Specifically, in tandem with NSF's NEON Airborne Observing Platform (AOP) mission, we collected vegetation and soil data from approximately 437 sites across a heterogeneous high-elevation 300 km<sup>2</sup> watershed in the Rocky Mountains, Colorado (figure 1), resulting in an archive of over 1700 samples, including foliar, root, litter and 0-10 cm soil samples and attendant site data, including soil moisture and geophysical surveys. Additional samples were collected by collaborators to characterize the microbial communities and deep (&gt;10 cm) soil profiles. We fully documented the methodology for the field campaign (see figure 2) as well as the resulting analytical data and have made it publicly available through the ESS-DIVE data repository (<a href=\"https://ess-dive.lbl.gov/\">https://ess-dive.lbl.gov/</a>).</p>\n<p>In order to use the airborne reflectance data for foliar mapping, we developed a custom atmospheric algorithm that greatly improved correction of the airborne reflectance data. We also expanded on prior methods for mapping vegetation classes and traits. We then used partial least squares regression (PLSR) to map foliar traits across the study area by leaf type (figure 3). We find that the foliar nitrogen, leaf mass per area and leaf water content models performed well. In contrast, foliar C is not well predicted across this study region, which is likely due to the variety of structural and non-structural forms that C takes in leaves across the wide range of vegetation types. Models of &delta;<sup>13</sup>C also do not perform well, possibly because of adaptations associated with water use efficiency. The software for the atmospheric corrections and foliar mapping is publicly available through a versioned code repository. In addition, the spatial datasets have been made available to the public via Google Earth Engine to minimize computational requirements for users. In summary, our research products include publicly available method developments to support scaling from field measurements to landscape scale using airborne reflectance data,&nbsp;and insights into the variability in foliar traits across a heterogeneous high-elevation watershed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The methods outlined above have been preliminarily extended to map foliar metal levels, soil concentrations, soil carbon, and microbial communities and will continue to be expanded through project collaborators, who will use the infrastructure we developed (<em>i.e.</em>, sample archive, analytical database, and scaling methods).</p>\n<p>The project also provided numerous opportunities for engagement and education.
