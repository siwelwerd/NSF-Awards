 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lake-effect snow (LES), the result of a cold air mass being advected over relatively warm water, is responsible for some of the heaviest snowfall accumulations in the eastern half of the United States.  These storms can generate intense snowfall rates of several inches (5-10 cm) per hour, leading to accumulations of more than a meter of snow in the course of a day, and can be accompanied by near zero visibility, strong winds, bitter cold, and even thunders. This project will investigate lake-effect precipitation over the Great Lakes region of the Northeastern U.S.: a multi-scale phenomena combining strong synoptic and mesoscale forcing with fine convective-scale structures that present a prediction challenge. This research will contribute to the graduate theses and dissertations of multiple students, as well as provide material for classroom exercises on numerical weather prediction and effective use of ensemble data. \r\n\r\nThe NSF-sponsored Ontario Winter Lake-effect Systems (OWLeS) field campaign provides an excellent test environment for the evaluation of data assimilation techniques due to the rich observation dataset, including sounding systems, ground measurements, aircraft sensors, and mobile radars, as well as the rich, diverse scientific interests of a large group of collaborators investigating fundamental science. This project will implement and compare the most advanced four-dimensional ensemble and hybrid data assimilation systems, and evaluate their relative strengths and weaknesses for analysis and prediction of lake-effect snow. Radar products for winter weather will be assimilated, and their impact on timescales of predictability determined. Results will quantify the impacts of each observing system on forecast quality, establish the intrinsic and practical predictability of lake-effect snow, and assess the contributions of the lake surface boundary, model errors, and synoptic and mesoscale initial conditions and their underlying dynamics.\r\n\r\nAn additional broader impact is the development and evaluation of the best data assimilation techniques. This has the potential to provide guidance to operations as the nation moves toward a national convective scale ensemble. The next-generation regional operational prediction systems will require kilometer-scale convective-permitting model resolution and rapid updates ingesting all available observations using the most effective four-dimensional ensemble and/or hybrid data assimilation techniques. Improved forecast lead time and accuracy for lake-effect events will have positive societal impacts on residents of lake-effect prone regions. Reanalysis fields produced by this research are a vital component to the analyses of collaborators investigating the structure and evolution of lake-effect snow bands and the role of upstream lake-atmosphere interactions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project has improved understanding of lake-effect snow events and why they are difficult to predict. The project generated reanalyses, which combine high-resolution computer simulations with atmospheric measurements, to characterize the environment around the Great Lakes region during intense lake-effect snowstorms during the NSF-sponsored Ontario Winter Lake-effect Systems (OWLeS) field campaign. Papers used these reanalyses along with OWLeS field campaign observations (including those from weather balloon launches) to understand what factors lead to how far inland lake-effect snow will extend, along with how strong temperature gradients impact the behavior of lake-effect events as they extend over land. Reanalyses and observations were also used to explore elevated layers of reduced atmospheric stability, which can be formed through lake-effect circulations and/or overrunning of denser airmasses; these layers can extend downwind hundreds of km and potentially lead to interactions with convection originating from other lakes.\n\n\nData assimilation reanalyses and forecasts were evaluated using conventional and field campaign observations, and the predictability of these events was characterized. While a favorable environment for lake-effect events can be predicted days in advance, the details of events such as the precise locations of snowbands can be difficult to ascertain even hours in advance. Regional convection-allowing ensemble data assimilation increased the skill of short-range forecasts within a day or two lead time, but increasing skill at longer ranges depended on how well features beyond the lake-effect domain were analyzed. The benefits of ensembles to quantify forecast confidence were demonstrated, and optimal ensemble system design that considers multiple types of uncertainties originating from both data and model errors was developed. A new technique (the geometry-sensitive ensemble mean) was applied and refined to summarize ensemble information, such as the location of lake-effect snowbands, in a way that considers spatial structures and preserves intensity information better than the traditional ensemble mean.\n\n\nThis project trained several students (graduate and undergraduate) on numerical weather prediction, ensembles, data assimilation, and the dynamics of lake-effect snow. Undergraduate students at Penn State have also been exposed to the research in the classroom through lectures on lake-effect snow, and lake-effect events serving as case study events for computer projects. Results have been shared with the broader community through publications, conference presentations, and through a National Weather Service collaboration.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/19/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: StevenJGreybush\n"
