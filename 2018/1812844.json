 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.\r\n\r\nThere are an estimated 2-4 billion specimens in the world's natural history collections that contain the data necessary to address complex global issues, including biodiversity and climate. Digitized natural history collections present an untapped opportunity to engage learners in crucial questions of science with far-reaching potential consequences via object-based research investigations.  This project will develop and study a prototype online learning environment that supports student learning via Engaging Practices for Inquiry with Collections in Bioscience (EPIC Bioscience). EPIC Bioscience uses authentic research investigations with digitized collections from natural history museums.  The project team will create a curriculum aligned with the Next Generation of Science Standards (NGSS) for middle school students, emphasizing a major disciplinary core idea in grades 6-8 life science, Ecosystems: Interactions, Energy, and Dynamics. The project has three major goals: 1) Develop an online learning environment that guides students through research investigations using digitized natural history collections to teach NGSS life science standards. 2) Investigate how interactive features and conversational scaffolds in the EPIC Bioscience learning environment can promote deeper processing of science content and effective knowledge building. 3) Demonstrate effective approaches to using digitized collections objects for contextualized, research-based science learning that aligns to NGSS standards for middle school classrooms.\r\n\r\nThe project will examine how and when interactive features of a digital learning environment can be combined with deep questions and effective online scaffolds to promote student engagement, meaningful collaborative discourse, and robust learning outcomes during research with digitized museum collections. Research activities will address: How can interactive features of EPIC Bioscience help students learn disciplinary core ideas and cross cutting concepts via science practices through collections-based research? How can effective patterns of collaborative scientific discourse be supported and enhanced during online, collections-based research? How does the use of digitized scientific collections influence students' levels of engagement and depth of processing during classroom investigations? A significant impact of the proposed work is expanded opportunities for research with authentic museum objects for populations who are traditionally underserved in STEM and are underrepresented in museum visitor demographics (Title I schools, racial/ethnic minorities, and rural school populations). Research activities will engage over 1,500 Title I and rural students (50 classes across three years) in meaningful research investigations with collections objects that address pressing global issues.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Classroom testing demonstrated significant impact of EPIC Bioscience investigations on student learning and strong student engagement with specimens from museum collections; it also demonstrated that teachers can implement investigations with few modifications.

EPIC investigations are published online and are free for educational use. To date, 340 teachers have utilized one or more of the investigations online. A conservative estimate of 20 students per teacher means that EPIC Bioscience investigations have reached over 6,000 students during the project, resulting in more than 98,000 page views across investigations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/12/2023<br>\nModified by: Kirsten&nbsp;R&nbsp;Butcher</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1812844/1812844_10543882_1702403191461_BatVirtualDissection--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1812844/1812844_10543882_1702403191461_BatVirtualDissection--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Virtual Dissection\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1812844/1812844_10543882_1702403191461_BatVirtualDissection--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Virtual Dissection\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The learn-by-doing introduction in Insect Apocalypse! investigation: virtual dissection of bat stomach contents to assess existing bat diets.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Natural History Museum of Utah</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kirsten&nbsp;R&nbsp;Butcher\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Virtual Dissection</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1812844/1812844_10543882_1702403025237_VeveltAntMeasurement--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1812844/1812844_10543882_1702403025237_VeveltAntMeasurement--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Data Collection from Museum Specimens\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1812844/1812844_10543882_1702403025237_VeveltAntMeasurement--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Data Collection from Museum Specimens\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Data collection via specimen measurement in the To Eat or Not to Eat? investigation.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Natural History Museum of Utah</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kirsten&nbsp;R&nbsp;Butcher\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Data Collection from Museum Specimens</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1812844/1812844_10543882_1702403790012_BatAnalysis--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1812844/1812844_10543882_1702403790012_BatAnalysis--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Guided Data Analysis\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1812844/1812844_10543882_1702403790012_BatAnalysis--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Guided Data Analysis\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students learn to analyze their data and communicate their findings to others.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Natural History Museum of Utah</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kirsten&nbsp;R&nbsp;Butcher\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Guided Data Analysis</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
