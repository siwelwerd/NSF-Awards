 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support participant travel for two-hundred and thirty participants to attend three Underrepresented Students in Topology and Algebra Research Symposia (USTARS) to be held April 6-8, 2018 at Reed College, in April 2019 at Iowa State University, and in April 2020 at the University of Iowa.  The goal of the symposia is to highlight research being conducted by underrepresented students in the areas of algebra and topology. Speakers will give 30-minute parallel research talks and graduate students will give at least three-quarters of these presentations. The topics of the presentations will span algebra and topology. Two distinguished graduate students and one invited faculty member will be asked to give one-hour presentations, and a poster session featuring invited undergraduates is also planned.\r\n \r\nAt this unique meeting, participants are exposed to a variety of current research, ideas, and results in their areas of study and beyond. Participants are also given the opportunity to meet and network with students and faculty members from underrepresented groups. USTARS promotes diversity in the mathematical sciences by encouraging women and minorities to attend and give talks, and USTARS exposes all participants to the research and activities of mathematicians from underrepresented groups, encouraging a more collaborative mathematics community. Further details and an application are available at the conference website: www.ustars.org.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
