 "awd_abstract_narration": "Throughout Earth's history continents have broken apart and reassembled as part of the fundamental plate tectonic evolution of the planet.  How continents break apart by rifting processes is thought to be predefined by inherent structural and compositional variability of Earth's crust and mantle that make up the lithosphere and is likely inherited from previous tectonic events. Understanding the style of continental breakup provides fundamental information for the exploration for energy and mineral resources and to understanding the geologic hazards associated with these processes. Geological observations often support the fact that these inheritances are key parameters in the development of rift structures but the extent to which these inheritances play a role during the rifting process remain unclear. This project investigates how the variable composition of continental lithosphere and the presence of inherited geological structures affect rifting processes. A multi-disciplinary approach will employ geological and geophysical observations to characterize inheritances in the crust and mantle of the lithosphere. These observations will be integrated into numerical models that simulate the deformation of the lithosphere over millions of years by extension.  The results of this project will fundamentally advance the understanding of lithospheric scale deformation processes and impact structural geology, computational geosciences and potentially the fossil fuel communities. Under broader impacts the project supports an early career female researcher at Texas State University, a primarily Hispanic-serving institution, and a master student will be recruited to participate directly in the research.\r\n\r\nPassive margins define about half of the Earth's coastlines and have been the focus of numerous studies in recent decades. While understanding of rifting processes has greatly improved, fundamental questions remain on the effects of inherited conditions on localization processes in extending lithosphere. Multiple studies suggest that structural, compositional and thermal inheritances are key parameters in the development of rift structures. However, the extent to which they play a role during breakup is still unclear. This project will address the hypothesis that inheritances strongly affect rifting processes and can explain: 1) the distribution of strain during the initial phase of deformation, 2) the mechanism of thinning during the rifting process, and 3) the mechanism leading to the exhumation and/or the formation of oceanic crust. To test this hypothesis numerical rifting experiments will be run with both structural and compositional inheritances. Inheritances are parameterized as oriented fabrics obtained from 2D seismic and 3D structural observations. A polymineralic composition is assigned to these heterogeneities in order to account for the natural variation in compositions observed in the continental lithosphere. In order to constrain the models, a multidisciplinary approach will be used that combines: 1) the analysis of geological and geophysical data, 2) a systematic exploration of the effects of numerical modeling experiments using a bimineralic rheology, and 3) a case study of the Northeastern Canadian margin with 2D and 3D numerical models. This approach will allow for a large amount of quantitative information on rift evolution to be acquired by independently varying the composition, distribution and orientation of inheritances. Results will help improve understanding of strain distribution, localization processes and mechanisms of deformation during continental breakup, and visualize the dynamic evolution of rifting processes depending on the type of inheritances.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This process is called rifting and its style depends on the composition of the continental crust and the presence of preexisting faults and other geological structures defined as inheritances. Domains of transition between continents and oceans, called margin, are common sites for oil and gas exploration and therefore understanding the style of continental breakup provides fundamental information to the field of exploration for energy resources in the oceans. It is also critical to our understanding of how plate tectonics functions over millions of years. Geological observations often support the fact that these inheritances are key parameters in the development of rift structures but the extent to which these inheritances play a role during the rifting process remain unclear. In this study, we investigated how the heterogeneous composition of continental crust and the presence of inherited geological structures affected rifting processes. In the first part of the project, we used a numerical approach to simulate the deformation of the lithosphere (crust and uppermost mantle) over millions of years by extension. To test the role of crustal inheritances, we introduce in each model some differently oriented inherited structures. This study clearly demonstrated that inheritances explain the deformation processes and the style of the rifting and control the geometry of the domains of transition between continents and oceans (see Figure 1).<br /> <br /> In the second part, we focused on the Northeastern Canadian margin. In this area, the continental crust has been formed by the collision of several terranes of different composition and inherited crustal structure. Several millions of years after, the northward propagation of the Atlantic Ocean and the opening of the Labrador Sea between Canada and Greenland led to the formation of the Northeastern Canadian margins (see Figure 2). The highly variable architecture of the resulting margins suggests that inherited fabrics affected rifting structures. To test this hypothesis, we used a multi-disciplinary approach. In a first step, based on published data, we compared the structure and composition of the different terranes of the Canadian Crust (From North to South: Churchill, Grenville and Appalachian Provinces). Secondly, we used these observations as initial condition for numerical modeling experiments of lithospheric extension. Finally, our results were compared to the Northeastern Canadian margin to understand the variability of architecture of the margin in the three main provinces. This study demonstrated that the magmatic intrusions present in the crust before the beginning of the rifting can probably explain the variability of the rifting style along the margin and the resulting complex geometry of the margin and his conjugate (see Figures 3, 4 and 5).</p>\n<p>These results help us improve our understanding of localization processes and mechanisms of deformation during the continental breakup and visualize the dynamic evolution of rifting processes depending on the type of inheritances. They consequently fundamentally advance the understanding of the role of inheritances on lithospheric scale deformation processes and can potentially impact the structural geology, computational geosciences and the fossil fuel communities.<br /> <br /></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/27/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Suzon&nbsp;Jammes</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1753574/1753574_10540396_1632747458544_Fig1_ResultsPapier1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1753574/1753574_10540396_1632747458544_Fig1_ResultsPapier1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Summary of the results of the first part of the project\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1753574/1753574_10540396_1632747458544_Fig1_ResultsPapier1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Summary of the results of the first part of the project\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Evolution of a) model 1 with randomly distributed heterogeneities, b) model 2 with horizontal crustal fabrics, c) model 3 with vertical crustal fabrics, d) with oblique crustal fabrics.
