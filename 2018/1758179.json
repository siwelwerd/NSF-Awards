 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve security by providing the strongest levels of network destination control with minimum deployment requirements. This project addresses the problem of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks on the Internet, which have been used in recent years to silence a variety of organizations, including companies, governments, and non-profits. The proposed mechanism defends against such DDoS attacks, and can improve Internet availability for a variety of customers. Bringing a DDoS-prevention mechanism to market prevents attackers from silencing and denying service to their targets, enabling increased availability to deployments of such systems.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project explores the commercial potential for a cloud-based traffic filtering technology.  The technology combines two significant, but distinct, approaches to Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) prevention - commercial approaches that perform in-cloud filtering to remove the most obvious DDoS traffic, and academic approaches that perform in-network filtering based on protocol-specific fairness criteria. The technology explored combines the in-cloud filtering of existing commercial approaches, together with a mechanism called \"capabilities\" in the academic approaches, to create an in-cloud, destination-driven enforcement of per-flow bandwidth allocations. This destination-driven approach can enforce a wide variety of destination-specified policies with a single mechanism, and each destination can choose the traffic that it wishes to prioritize. As a result, the same mechanism can to be used to defend against DDoS attacks and to provide priority to certain traffic.",

Cloud SecurityService Providers (CSSPs) play an important role for DDoS prevention: over 80 percent of our interviewed potential DDoS victims purchase services from CSSPs.

Over 80% of all interviewed potential DDoS victims purchase scrubbing services from one of these CSSPs. Their opinions towards these services are mixed.
