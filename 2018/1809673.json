 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical description\r\nThis research introduces a new approach for making quantum-cascade semiconductor laser light sources that that emit electromagnetic waves in the mid-infrared spectral region. Efficient and high-power mid-infrared laser sources are desired for a wide range of applications, including astrophysical spectral measurements, remote sensing, gas-phase spectroscopy, and infrared countermeasures. In this proposed work, our team will investigate a new strategy for developing high-power lasers with excellent beam quality, the quantum-cascade (QC) vertical-external-cavity surface-emitting-laser (VECSEL). Part of our team has recently developed this technology in the terahertz spectral region (wavelengths greater than 60 microns), in this project we will re-envision the concept for the shorter mid-infrared wavelengths. We propose a suite of approaches tailored for the various spectral sub-regions that comprise the mid-infrared, including the very-long-wave-infrared (VLWIR) spectral region (16-28 micron wavelength), the long-wave infrared (LWIR) (8-13 micron wavelength), and the mid-wave infrared (MWIR) (4-5 micron wavelength). This work is a GOALI university-industry collaboration between the PI at UCLA and an industrial partner at Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems. As a part of the project, the research will train graduate and undergraduate students, and will support recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities to engineering through participation in a targeted research project course.\r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\nThe research goal is to develop quantum-cascade (QC) vertical-external-cavity surface-emitting-lasers (VECSELs) in the mid-infrared spectral range. This is proposed as path for (a) high brightness mid-IR sources with scalable output power (up to tens of watts) in a circular diffraction-limited beam, and (b) a platform for multifunctional lasers associated with the ability to locally engineer the amplitude, phase, and polarization response of the metasurface. We propose a set of distinct approaches tailored for the various spectral sub-regions that comprise the mid-IR. The intellectual merit in the proposed work is present on multiple levels. The primary innovation is the development of novel schemes for implementing VECSELs for mid-infrared quantum-cascade lasers, in particular in the MWIR and LWIR based upon surface-emitting gratings. The broader impacts are addressed at several levels including undergraduate and graduate research experiences, dissemination of results, technology advancement, outreach to underrepresented minorities, and industrial interaction. Outreach to underrepresented minorities (URM) will specifically occur through the PI?s development of research projects for a course designed for the recruitment and retention of URM engineering freshman. This GOALI program will result in interaction between the university and industrial partner, potentially for technology transfer and student training/exposure within industry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
