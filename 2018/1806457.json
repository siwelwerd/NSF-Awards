 "awd_abstract_narration": "Embedded deep in the Antarctic polar ice cap, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory is the world's largest and most sensitive high energy neutrino telescope. In the past few years, IceCube has discovered neutrinos of astrophysical origin at energies reaching the PeV scale, and its DeepCore extension has performed measurements of fundamental parameters in particle physics through the measurement of atmospheric neutrinos at energies as low as roughly 5 GeV.  Within the course of this project the group will pursue improvements in the simulation and reconstruction of events to sharpen the energy resolution and the identification of the direction from which the neutrinos reach the detector as well as implement general improvements to reduce the interfering background.  \r\n\r\nOpportunities are provided for young physicists at all levels to become involved in particle astrophysics, with a particular emphasis on encouraging participation among women and underrepresented groups. In addition, the PI founded and continues to serve as the faculty mentor to the Physics and Astronomy Women (PAW) student group. PAW provides a forum for open discussion of the challenges facing women as well as their solutions, runs a mentoring program for starting undergraduate and graduate women in physics, increases the local visibility of women in science through outreach activities, and provides networking and professional development opportunities in a friendly environment. \r\n\r\nDeepCore, situated at the bottom center of the IceCube array, benefits from its unmatched multi-megaton fiducial volume and the availability of surrounding IceCube modules to veto atmospheric muon background events, greatly enhancing the neutrino signal-to-noise ratio. DeepCore has been used to measure muon-neutrino disappearance and tau-neutrino appearance, as well as the flux of atmospheric electron neutrinos, at energies an order of magnitude higher than previous observations, and with uncertainties that are comparable to the world's best current measurements. With this award, the Penn State IceCube group will continue to exploit the DeepCore data to answer fundamental questions of neutrino physics, focusing on better and faster event reconstruction and more effective background rejection to improve its measurement of the tau neutrino normalization, to determine Delta (m_23)^2 and theta_23 with greater precision, and to reduce systematic errors for these and other similar analyses. It will also continue to provide strong support for the use of neutrinos from IceCube and DeepCore to facilitate real-time searches for multi-messenger astrophysical sources via the AMON network headquartered at Penn State.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Penn State IceCube group was funded for one year under Federal  Award ID 1806457.  In this year, our group's work on a new neutrino  event reconstruction showed substantive improvement over the previous  version used by the IceCube Collaboration, both in accuracy and  processing speed.  It was thus adopted as the official reconstruction  algorithm for lower-energy neutrino events and will improve our ability  to measure fundamental properties of neutrinos.  In particular, in  combination with a larger data set, it will allow us to achieve  world-leading precision in the measurement of tau neutrino appearance,  one of the least well measured parameters of the neutrino sector in the  Standard Model of Particle Physics.\n\nOur group is very  well-positioned to make this measurement due to our leadership in the  first version of this measurement, published in a leading journal, the  Physical Review D, in January 2019.   This effort is currently underway.\n\nLeveraging  local computing resources, including the NSF-funded CyberLAMP cluster  with a large number of Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), we have  started a new effort using Deep Learning to better identify tau  neutrinos at much higher energies.  If this effort realizes its current  promise, it will allow IceCube to detect many more tau neutrinos than  our current analyses permit.  Since high energy tau neutrinos have an  extraordinarily high likelihood of astrophysical origin, they could be  used to detect new astrophysical multimessenger sources that emit  neutrinos and other particles or gravitational waves.\n\nThe  detection of tau neutrinos could also be used in real time at the South  Pole to identify these neutrinos immediately after they arrive.  The  \"lightweight\" nature of the algorithm produced by Deep Learning, the  excellent 24/7 connectivity from the South Pole to the north for  compressed data transmission, and the infrastructure already in place at  Penn State for processing alerts like this via the Astrophysical  Multimessenger Observatory Network (AMON), all work together to insure  that we will be able to fullly exploit this exciting new physics  opportunity.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/06/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Douglas F Cowen"
