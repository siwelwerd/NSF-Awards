 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will convene a synthesis and design workshop on next generation science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learning. It envisions a two-tier timeline that looks three years and then ten years into the future. One primary workshop topic involves design considerations for \"boundary-crossing\" project-based learning, by which students (middle school through college) collaborate on challenging STEM projects while they reside in different national, economic, cultural, and academic settings.  Based on preliminary research, such \"distributed\" collaboration has important potential to become a life changing, abundant, and seamless aspect of enhanced, next generation STEM learning. The workshop, along with its preparations and the discussions and draft iterations that follow, will culminate in a synthesis and design paper suitable for use by the National Science Foundation and by STEM education practitioners, designers, policy-makers, and researchers. The workshop will benefit from the participation of internationally prominent participants from Finland, Mexico, and Singapore, engaged in similar next generation STEM education design efforts in their countries.\r\n\r\nThis workshop, along with a preceding series of webinars, is intertwined with crucial and exciting areas currently unfolding in education research, innovation, and the learning sciences. Its primary theoretical frameworks originate in computer supported collaborative learning and social cognition literature.  The synthesis represents a prospectus that incorporates the interconnections of next generation teacher roles, sociocultural and affective dynamics in STEM cognition, computational thinking, and the integration of content, assessment, and management in personalized and collaborative learning.  The design task of the workshop is to organize principles responsive to the synthesis, while furnishing overall design guidance by which a) the energy and intrinsic draw of distributed collaboration; b) the appeal, challenge, and intrigue of STEM-rich collaborative projects; c) the intrinsic pleasure and satisfaction of teaching others and helping others to succeed; and d) the intrinsic satisfaction of creating and making, are all operational and mutually reinforcing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project began prior to the pandemic and before what became, in 2020, mass implementation of virtual teaching worldwide.  Video teleconferencing for STEM problem-based collaboration was integral to this workshop proposal and its precursor project (funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning Program in EHR); this workshop in 2019 may seemingly have dovetailed with this large-scale shift to remote communication in learning.  In fact, though, little of the thrust of the workshop, involving multipoint, multinational, and student-originated collaboration aligned with the virtual learning upheavals caused by the pandemic.
