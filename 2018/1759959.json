 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since 2002, the GEOLocate project has been engaged in developing, distributing and supporting innovative solutions for deducing geospatial coordinates from free-form textual descriptions of locations, typically from where biological specimens have been collected and/or observed. It has resulted in a suite of web-based tools and services which have become critical components of workflows to digitize and mobilize biodiversity collections information, ultimately giving researchers and the public access to the vast archive of specimens held in natural history collections.  Annotating biodiversity collection records with geospatial information enables specimen occurrences to be visualized on digital maps and allows researchers to relate the occurrences to other kinds of data (e.g., environmental data).  These data increase our capacity to study important scientific and societal issues, such as endangered species conservation, environmental restoration, and preparing for global climate change.  GEOLocate has long served the georeferencing needs of the natural history collections and research communities and has been integrated into numerous third-party biodiversity data management and analysis systems.\r\n\r\nThis project will permit the GEOLocate platform to continue providing technology and support for semi-automated geospatial referencing of natural history collections data while addressing long-term sustainability in maintaining operation beyond the length of this grant. Specifically, this project will enable continued operation and day-to-day maintenance of web clients, server software, spatial data, hosting infrastructure and end-user support services.  The project will continue to educate end-users, provide guidance on large-scale georeferencing projects and promote the use of the latest standards and best practices for georeferencing.  Finally, the team will work with the natural history collections community, third-party integration partners and other relevant stakeholders to evaluate and implement a model for fiscal sustainability enabling support for the platform into the future.  The GEOLocate project web site is located at: http://www.geo-locate.org\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
