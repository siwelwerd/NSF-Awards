 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) supports conferences and workshops that seek to increase the research and education capacity of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students and faculty at HBCUs.  Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University will hold a workshop on October 18-19, 2018 to improve the preparation of pre-service earth science teachers at HBCUs.  About fifty pre-service teachers and faculty will attend.\r\n\r\nThe workshop provides hands-on activities and reflection sessions to equip college faculty in using the micro-spiral approach in their geosciences courses at the undergraduate level. The objectives are to: transfer geosciences concepts, knowledge and skills to pre-service and in-service teachers; support pre-service teacher education programs; and support in-service teachers in their quest to educate future geoscientists. The workshop will focus on training in the communication of culturally and regionally relevant geoscience knowledge, and on providing a geosciences tool capable to give support to pre-service teachers in Earth Science Standards content and National Science Teachers Association Standards for the Science Teacher Preparation Certification process.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nMicro-Spiral Methodology 2019 NSF Workshop Outcomes \n\nThe overarching objective of the workshop was to improve the preparation of pre-service earth science teachers at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). This project will increase teacher educators? awareness about a micro-spiral instructional approach.  While participating in this workshop, university faculty will learn how to implement inquiry-based Micro-Spiral Methodology teaching strategies into pre-service teacher education programs.\n\nIntellectual Merit: Micro-Spiral Methodology (MSM) is an innovative instructional approach where educators blend recursive teaching with inquiry based on instructional strategies (Davis, 2015).  This neuroscience informed approach to teaching (Leaf, 2016) emphasizes the neurological process of storing (learning) and retrieving (using) information.  The benefits of a spiral approach, however, can be extended to university faculty and K12 teacher education programs (Fried &amp; Amit, 2005).\n\nBroader Impacts: Broader impacts includes teaching university faculty at HBCUs about learning progressions who are then able to produce knowledgeable, literate, and critical thinking pre-service and middle school teachers will then understand learning progressions through the process of a micro-spiral methodology.  With this knowledge, they can integrate earth science courses into state-of-the-art, cutting edge, earth science concepts\n\nOutcomes \n\nOver 200 Pre-service, In-service, Higher Education Professor Science and Earth Science teachers at Historically Black Colleges as well as Universities (HBCUs) learned how to implement inquiry-based Micro-Spiral Methodology (MSM) teaching strategies into pre-service teacher education programs.  Tennessee State University, Savannah State University, and Florida A &amp; M University Professors, Pre-Service Teachers, and In-Service Teachers learned how to implement inquiry-based Micro-Spiral Methodology.\n\nPresident of Florida A &amp; M University introduced the Micro-Spiral Methodology (MSM) to the entire Florida A&amp;M University at the 2019 Annual Faculty Retreat August 13-16, 2019.  Faculty members referred to Principle Investigator (PI), to obtain additional information about how to implement the Micro-Spiral Methodology in their classrooms.\n\nA past President has been invited by the Superintendents of the Florida School Systems to spearhead a committee to assist in marginalizing populations to help improve student?s educational outcomes by using the Micro-Spiral Methodology.  PI, has been invited to assist underserve populations in Quincy, Florida.\n\nPI, and others attended the Earth Educators' Remdezvous July 15-19, 2019 Nashviulle, TN.  The Micro-Spiral Methodology was introduced at the GEO-PATH meeting for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). A Past President, announced that he is committed to implementing the Micro-Spiral Method in all 40 counties of the State of Florida. \nWhite House Secretary of Education Representative, attended the National Science Foundation (NSF) Micro-Spiral Method (MSM) Workshop to learn about the Micro-Spiral Methodology.  White House Representative was impressed with the MSM NSF Workshop and reported back the benefits of MSM.  The Micro-Spiral Method helps overcome absenteeism and loss of instructional time, which schools, colleges, and universities all needed to overcome in order to transfer concepts, knowledge, and skills. \n\nThe communication team led from Florida A&amp;M University distributed newspaper articles to the Tallahassee Democrat and invited local TV stations (WTCV, WTWCFOX, and WTXL ABC). Additionally, superintendents across the State of Florida were informed and were invited to the Micro-Spiral Method Workshop.  Also superintendents submitted the names of their top science teachers to participate in the MSM Workshop.\n\nThe Association of the Teacher Educators (ATE) national leadership attended the NSF MSM Workshop and they were impressed with the MSM NSF Workshop.   ATE leadership informed the President of Florida State University, about the Micro-Spiral Method.  They dispersed Micro-Spiral Method to 1,200 Deans, Faculty, Administrators and communities of high impact educators? through-out the country.\n\nPI and others work with the Micro-Spiral Method has been accepted by Association Teacher Educators (ATE's) 100th Annual Meeting in Atlantic City, NJ Feb 15th - 19th, 2020.  PI? topic is:  \"Hilda Taba gave the world the gift of the Spiral Curriculum.  PI continues her legacy with her latest research highlighting \"The Multiplication Factor of the Micro-Spiral Curriculum.\"\n\nIn 2009, PI arrived at Florida A&amp;M University and immediately began her work to increase the systemically low State Science test scores.  The fifth grade science scores doubled by 2011, they eventually went up 26 points and in 2019 their scores went up 9%. Below are two videos featuring the 2019 National Science Foundation sponsored Micro-Spiral Method workshop.  The Micro-Spiral Method has helped in the transfer of concepts, knowledge and skills. The Micro Spiral Method helps overcomes absenteeism and loss of instructional time. PI?s former students have gone on to raise the State Science Education scores.\n\nFlorida A&amp;M University Developmental Research School fifth grade State Science test score went up 9% due to the Micro-Spiral Method Multiplication Factor.   The Micro-Spiral Method affected the students three fold: 1) many of the students were introduced to science concepts knowledge and skills beginning in kindergarten to the fifth grade through PI?s weekly visits to their classrooms.  2) The fifth grade teacher was taught the Micro-Spiral Method,  3)  PI support the students middle school science education. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Edith G Davis"
