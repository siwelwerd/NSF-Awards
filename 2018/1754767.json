 "awd_abstract_narration": "Subduction zones are regions where one of Earth's tectonic plates slides beneath another. The zone of slip between the two plates is a geologic fault where the motion of the lower plate is imperfectly transferred to the overlying plate through frictional processes allowing for unreleased strain to build up in the upper plate.  The abrupt release of built-up strain in the upper plate causes earthquakes, which can be large on subduction zones because of the size of the slip region. These great earthquakes cause damage both from the shaking itself but also because of the flooding of seawater from a tsunami. Recent events in Sumatra in 2004, Chile in 2010, and Japan in 2011 all demonstrate the devastating hazard associated with these events.  Subduction zones also lie offshore the US coasts along Northern California, Oregon and Washington State and another along Alaska and the Aleutian Islands.   Both of these subduction zones have experienced great earthquakes in the past and will do so again in the future. A goal of this project is to better understand the geophysical processes at work at subduction zones and to improve the quantitative assessment of potential hazard. This project will deploy a combination of seafloor geodetic sensors to track the slow buildup and possible release of seafloor motion offshore of a New Zealand subduction zone.  The New Zealand Hikurangi site was picked because the subduction zone is shallow and can be imaged more effectively with seafloor geodetic instruments.  This site also has a history of rapidly repeating slow slip earthquakes that provide insight into the slip process.  Broader impacts of this project include training and support for a graduate student in the research. The project leverages international efforts by New Zealand and Japanese research teams who will occupy adjacent seafloor geodetic sites. The project will also transfer operational know-how for how to conduct seafloor geodesy experiments to NZ research counterparts, enabling them to collect measurements at these critical sites during this proposed project and continue in the future past the end of the project.\r\n\r\nThis project will measure deformation near the trench of the New Zealand Hikuangi subduction margin over a four year period using the GPS-Acoustic (GPS-A) method. The GPS-A site will be established in the Hawkes Bay area to provide critical measurements centered between GPS-A sites in the northern and southern parts of the margin established using Japanese and New Zealand funding. This central site is near the transition from an apparently strongly coupled margin to the South, and a nearly uncoupled margin in the North.  The project will implement the more efficient and cost-saving Wave Glider platform for the GPS-Acoustic measurements. Permanent seafloor benchmarks will be installed for horizontal positioning to ensure the time series of positions can be continued into the future, past the end of this project. An array of absolute pressure gauges will also be deployed for two years to measure the offshore extent of slow slip events observed from land arrays beneath the Hawkes Bay area, a region thought to have experienced many >8 magnitude earthquakes in the past based on paleoseismology. The array is expected to detect vertical uplift and hence the spatial extent of at least one large slow slip event in this region during the deployment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe measurement of deformation of the edges of colliding tectonic plates is an important goal in Earth sciences.As the plates move past one another, they become locked together at some locations causing elastic stress to build up in the rock.Eventually the rock is stressed beyond its limit and breaks, resulting in an earthquake.In some places, the stress is released gradually on occasion in slow earthquakes, which are faults moving to release stress but occurring slowly  over weeks or months  such that no radiated seismic signals are detected.Studying this build up and release of stress is important to learn about the mechanisms of the earthquake cycle.While 70% of the planet is beneath an ocean, 95% of the plate boundaries are offshore, making it very important to develop methods to track stress buildup on the seafloor.On land this is done with GPS (now called GNSS for Global Navigation Satellite Systems).However, GNSS signals cannot penetrate seawater so alternative means are necessary.One method is called the GNSS-Acoustic (GNSS-A) method.In GNSS-A, a platform floating on the ocean surface is navigated with GNSS while it sends timed acoustic pulses to seafloor markers.These markers are transponders; they receive acoustic pulses sent from the surface platform and send back replica pulses.The time taken for an acoustic pulse to make the round trip can be used to infer the distance between the surface platform and the transponder.With several transponders onthe seafloor participating in the acoustic ranging, their positions can be determined in a GNSS coordinate frame because the surface platform is navigated with GNSS.Seeing the slow change in positions of the seafloor transponders over several years reveals how the plate is deforming due to the subduction zone process, where an oceanic plate slides beneath a continental plate. Knowing this, we can better asses the likelihood and size of future regional earthquakes and tsunami.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIn this project, we measured the deformation of the submerged edge of the Australian plate offshore New Zealand at the Hikurangi subduction zone by surveying seafloor transponders at two sites over five years.We learned that the continental plate is only being deformed slightly at these sites, indicating that the Pacific plate is not locked to the Australian plate in this region.This impacts our model of the rate that stress is being accumulated on this particular fault.Further measurements at additional locations along the fault will help build a model that eventually can contribute to the assessment of earthquake and tsunami hazard presented by this fault.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/06/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MarkAZumberge\n"
