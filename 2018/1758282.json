 "awd_abstract_narration": "Retaining STEM teachers is a challenge across the Nation. This Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program Track 4 project seeks to investigate factors that affect retention of novice science teachers throughout the first five years of their career.  The project will pay particular attention to understanding the ways in which school districts design and implement mentoring and induction programs that demonstrate success in retaining teachers. The study will include examination of retention rates of science teachers in high-need schools, science teachers of color, and retention of Noyce Scholarship teacher recipients.  In the United States, significant resources are devoted to recruitment and preparation of science teachers, yet the mentoring and induction experiences that may contribute positively to science teacher retention are poorly understood. A better understanding of evidence-based practices for designing mentoring and induction experiences for new science teachers could have clear implications for both policy and practice. This study will use state level data, spanning a ten-year period, from New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, to identify school districts with exemplary novice science teacher retention, and then conduct site visits and write case studies that describe the characteristics that contribute to the high retention of science teachers in these districts.\r\n\r\nThis study has two phases. In the first phase, researchers will examine publicly available staffing data to develop a 5-year retention map for three cohorts of teachers in each state, with additional cohorts tracked over the duration of the study. This staffing data from each state will be used to map the career paths of individual science teachers for a more comprehensive picture of teacher retention, mobility, and attrition. By identifying districts that are highly successful in retaining science teachers, the findings from this analysis will be used to set the stage for the second phase of the research. In the second phase, the researchers aim to closely examine a subset of districts that demonstrate high science teacher retention rates.  This analysis focuses on gaining a better understanding of the role of mentoring and induction programs, as well as other factors cited in the literature that may influence teacher retention.  This project uses a theoretical framework, based in research literature, that looks at teacher retention in terms school contexts and personal/professional backgrounds.  One state study will occur in each of years two through five of the project, beginning with New Jersey in the second project year. A subset of districts that are successful at retaining science teachers of color, science teachers in high-need districts, and Noyce graduates teaching science will be identified for further study. It is estimated that a sample of 15-20 school districts per each of the four states will be identified, with the aim of representing the range of district characteristics, and mentoring and induction programs.  From these districts, the research team will select five to six exemplar districts for case studies that will address the best practices, structure and organization, funding, and critical issues in each district related to the mentoring and induction program. Anticipated outcomes of this study include: state-specific reports on the role of mentoring and induction and other retention-related factors for dissemination (through policy briefs, conference presentations, peer-reviewed manuscripts, and a multiple-case study in the form of a book-length manuscript featuring generalizable best practices in mentoring and induction, as well as other factors influencing retention), and the production and dissemination of a shareable database analysis tool for calculating actual retention rates (disaggregated by teaching certification) from existing staffing data sets. The potential contributions of this study include the dissemination of knowledge about how to better support novice science teachers so that they remain in the profession. Further, this study will provide all states with a set of tools by which actual retention rates can be measured.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Using state-level staffing data, the team identified the novice science teacher five-year retention rate for teachers hired between 2007 and 2012 in each of the four focus states (NJ, NC, PA, WI) and selected five districts for case study in the top 10% of each state. A detailed examination of the NJ retention data was the first publication of the project (See Figures 1 &amp; 2). Each of the selected sites was then invited to participate in the study and host a site visit by our team to collect qualitative data. Though hampered by the COVID-19 pandemic, ultimately our team completed and published 13 district case studies on our project website <a href=\"http://www.montlcair.edu/imprest\">www.montlcair.edu/imprest</a>. We then conducted a cross-case analysis to identify the most common retention factors across the cases, and noted any connection to existing mentoring and induction efforts in these schools. Our team also completed a quantitative analysis of the state level-data to examine categorical factors related to novice science teacher retention.</p>\n<p>The results of the cross case analysis showed that there were ten factors most commonly cited from participating teachers and administrators as reasons for novice science teacher retention. Each of these factors will be discussed briefly here:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Support from departmental colleagues.</strong> Teachers most frequently cited the collaborative nature of their science department, being welcomed by their colleagues in the department as novice teachers, and long-lasting friendships as reasons for staying. This support often took the form of sharing resources and providing informal mentorship.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>2. School/district-level systems and culture of support.</strong> A common feature of high-retention schools and districts in our study was the existence of a systemic culture of teacher support. These organizations made it possible for new teachers to receive support through the regular operation of the workplace.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Compensation. </strong>Teachers in this study cited the adequacy of salary compensation, professional development and continuing education, as a reason for staying. A number of teachers cited the role of the teachers&rsquo; union in negotiating salaries and working conditions.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Teacher autonomy and agency.</strong> Participants often referenced having the freedom and flexibility to teach how they wanted, without being micromanaged. Autonomy within the classroom, particularly concerning the curriculum, was frequently mentioned, as well as having agency over their own professional working conditions.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Specialness of place.</strong> The physical environment, geographical location, cultural significance of place, or being a teacher&rsquo;s home town were frequently cited.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Resources for teaching.</strong> This included access to adequate classroom supplies from school budgets as well as partnerships within the community.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Opportunity and agency for professional growth.</strong> This included financial support for professional development opportunities, including being supported in attaining advanced degrees. Additionally, some districts provided opportunities for teachers to take on leadership roles and engage in professional development activities beyond their classrooms.</p>\n<p><strong>8. District and school-level race-consciousness.</strong> Districts that were able to retain high numbers of teachers of color often exhibited practices that demonstrated an awareness of the impact of race and racism on teachers&rsquo; and students&rsquo; lives.</p>\n<p><strong>9. Affordances related to school size. </strong>Retained teachers in smaller districts cited small class sizes, personalized administrative support, and feelings of being part of a tight-knit community as reasons for staying. Teachers in larger districts cited within-district job mobility and the greater variety of colleagues.</p>\n<p><strong>10. Personal satisfaction and rewards.</strong> The factor of teachers&rsquo; personal satisfaction and rewards from their job and profession&mdash;which was a primary retention factor in prior research&mdash;was still cited by many as a reason for retention.</p>\n<p>The full set of descriptive statistics for the data from all four states are shown in Table 1. Wisconsin had a much higher overall rate of retention than the other three states, and this finding is consistent across all six years of data. North Carolina and New Jersey hired many more teachers of color, but they were retained at a much lower rate than those in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. In all four states, there was not a significant relationship between highest degree and retention. Though the average starting salary was quite different across the three states where salary was locally negotiated within each state there was no correlation between starting salary and retention for teachers when the degree level was taken into consideration. There was no significant relationship between district or school science department size and retention.</p>\n<p>The broader impact of this work is to provide research-based information to administrators, teachers, and other education stakeholders to influence policy and practice toward teacher retention. We note that very few of the retention factors were limited to science teachers, and therefore may be applicable to the general population of educators in schools.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 09/12/2024<br>\nModified by: Douglas&nbsp;Larkin</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1758282/1758282_10570441_1726158631036_Figure_2_Retention_of_first_year_secondary_science_teachers_in_New_Jersey_during_their_first_6_years_of_teaching--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1758282/1758282_10570441_1726158631036_Figure_2_Retention_of_first_year_secondary_science_teachers_in_New_Jersey_during_their_first_6_years_of_teaching--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2 Retention of first-year secondary science teachers in New Jersey during their first 6 years of teaching\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1758282/1758282_10570441_1726158631036_Figure_2_Retention_of_first_year_secondary_science_teachers_in_New_Jersey_during_their_first_6_years_of_teaching--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2 Retention of first-year secondary science teachers in New Jersey during their first 6 years of teaching\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 2 Retention of first-year secondary science teachers in New Jersey during their first 6 years of teaching</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Douglas B Larkin</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Douglas&nbsp;Larkin\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2 Retention of first-year secondary science teachers in New Jersey during their first 6 years of teaching</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1758282/1758282_10570441_1726158507217_Table_1_Descriptive_statistics--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1758282/1758282_10570441_1726158507217_Table_1_Descriptive_statistics--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Descriptive Statistics for NJ, PA, WI, & NC Novice Science Teachers hired 2007-2012\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1758282/1758282_10570441_1726158507217_Table_1_Descriptive_statistics--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Descriptive Statistics for NJ, PA, WI, & NC Novice Science Teachers hired 2007-2012\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Descriptive Statistics for NJ, PA, WI, & NC Novice Science Teachers hired 2007-2012</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Douglas B Larkin</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Douglas&nbsp;Larkin\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Descriptive Statistics for NJ, PA, WI, & NC Novice Science Teachers hired 2007-2012</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1758282/1758282_10570441_1726158580389_Figure_1__The_person_position_framework_for_teacher_retention_research--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1758282/1758282_10570441_1726158580389_Figure_1__The_person_position_framework_for_teacher_retention_research--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1  The person-position framework for teacher retention research\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1758282/1758282_10570441_1726158580389_Figure_1__The_person_position_framework_for_teacher_retention_research--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1  The person-position framework for teacher retention research\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1  The person-position framework for teacher retention research</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Douglas B Larkin</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Douglas&nbsp;Larkin\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1  The person-position framework for teacher retention research</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
