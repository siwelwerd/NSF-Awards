 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Microelectronics-Photonics REU site for Tomorrow's Nanomanufacturing: Engineering with Science (TNEWS)at the University of Arkansas (UA) merges discovery-focused research with professional skills training to prepare a rising generation of leaders to speed translation of nano-scale materials, devices and processes to commercial manufacturing. To provide trans-disciplinary training as well as cultivate innovation, teamwork, and ethics, faculty from science and engineering disciplines collaborate with industry leaders in nanomanufacturing to mentor REU participants in laboratory discoveries within a framework of experiences in design, metrology, communication, and leadership. Participants will be recruited from minority-serving institution partners of UA and societies for female STEM students to broaden participation in STEM, with special consideration given to first-generation and economically disadvantaged students. Participants will be mentored by successful entrepreneurs to transform discovery to intellectual property from which peer-reviewed publications, patent applications and nanomanufacturing spinouts can emerge. Long-term engagement among TNEWS REU alumni will be facilitated as they advance to leadership in nanomanufacturing.\r\n\r\nThis REU Site at UA aims to provide (i) rewarding research experiences that bridge science and engineering; (ii) training to use broadly applicable emerging technologies relevant to nanomanufacturing; and (iii) development of professional skills to REU participants recruited from science and engineering undergraduates who are underrepresented in engineering, particularly first-generation and economically disadvantaged students. REU participants will conduct student-focused research projects on topics ranging from quantum to nanoscale materials discovery to devices and systems that integrate nanoarchitectures. Projects target biological, sensor, energy and electromagnetic technologies that offer commercializable innovations from which peer-reviewed publications, patent applications and nanomanufacturing spinouts can emerge. REU participants will interact regularly with faculty and industry mentors outside their immediate research laboratory to enhance student research and progress. This especially benefits women and minorities. TNEWS will train participants in innovation, design, metrology, teamwork, communication, ethics and leadership using a tested experiential learning framework that has contributed to five recent UA nanotech spin-offs. Integrating these experiences with cohort-building activities and mentored student sharing will nurture a cadre of emerging leaders in tomorrow?s nanomanufacturing workforce who grasp complex interactions between personal and community values to effectively and responsibly transform research discovery to commercializable innovations that create significant benefit. Outcomes relative to nine discrete learning objectives will be analyzed by a program evaluator using both novel and proven assessment methodologies to ensure participant progress and to refine and develop administration of the TNEWS REU site.",
