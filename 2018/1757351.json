 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Description\r\n\r\nThe quality of surface and ground waters is of great concern across the United States. The factors that control water quality are complex and include land use practices and soil and geological features of the landforms within the watershed. Montana is home to a variety of land uses that have the potential to significantly impact the quality of waters in different ways, including agriculture (rangeland grazing and grain production) and mining. This project is based on the comprehensive analysis of the nature, sources, and extent of environmental pollutants in ground and surface waters associated with rangeland and crop production agriculture and surface coal mining in Montana. The project will result in significant advances in the ability to evaluate and predict the concentrations of pollutants in natural water. This understanding of the sources and concentrations of pollutants will lead to efforts to prevent pollution and to remediate polluted water. The project will also make significant investments in STEM education including outreach programs for Native Americans, and will investigate how a community's trust in water quality management decisions is related to the community's ability to respond to water pollution.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\n\r\nThis project will investigate the sources, and fate and transport, of pollutants originating from rangeland and crop production agriculture, and from surface coal mining in Montana. The primary focus of the project is to study the fate of agrichemicals such as nitrate and pesticides across landscapes and into ground and surface waters. The research will include analysis of the interactions between these chemicals and their uptake across microbial membranes associated with agrichemical transformation, and their impacts on biofouling of reverse osmosis systems used for removal of pollutants. The sources and fates of arsenic and heavy metals released during coal mining operations will also be investigated, and the potential impacts of nitrate on algal blooms and associated transport of those metals in surface waters will be studied. The broad environmental focus of the project will facilitate programs in STEM education encompassing levels of education ranging from K-12 through mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students as well as junior faculty. Significant outreach and diversity components involve inclusion of faculty and students from two tribal colleges, and a structural equation model will be developed that will test the relationships between trust, community resilience, and demographic variables.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Researchers worked collaboratively across institutions to develop a deeper understanding of natural water systems and water quality related to three important industries in the Montana economy: mining, agriculture, and energy. The five-year project explored how changing compositions and levels of nutrients and contaminants affect water quality - from soils and rivers to the local communities and industries that rely on clean water. Researchers focused on three Montana landscapes where water systems and economic activity are inextricably linked: the Upper Clark Fork River, the Judith River Watershed, and the Powder River Basin.</p>\n<p><em>Research Highlights</em>: CREWS researchers made substantial scientific discoveries and technology advances related to environmental water quality. These include finding that riparian ecosystems, even when highly altered, attenuate nitrate loading from agriculture into streams. Researchers developed a metabolism model that advances our understanding of changing carbon levels in rivers and streams, and a model for changing biota and metal and nutrient concentrations in streams in response to snowmelt. We found that engaging the public in decisions favorably alters perceptions of efforts to maintain water quality. We conducted novel mesocosm experiments with CREWS-developed biofilms to remove contaminants. CREWS scientists and engineers collaborated to develop drone-based hyperspectral imaging for measurement of river algae and a \"smart\" in situ sampler for dissolved organic carbon. Researchers developed novel methodology to quickly, accurately, and inexpensively measure sulfate concentrations in environmental waters. And one of our most important and long-lasting research developments was the <em>Continuous Flow Metal Recovery</em> system which removes metal pollutants from contaminated waters. CREWS produced a diverse portfolio of 165 disciplinary and interdisciplinary publications that disseminated discoveries and outcomes. The CREWS project leveraged over $80 million in new funding and produced two provisional patent applications.</p>\n<p><em>Workforce Development</em>: Over five years, CREWS supported 77 faculty, 192 undergraduate students, 94 graduate students, and 8 postdocs. CREWS supported three new faculty hires. Dr. Brian St. Clair was hired at Montana Technological University, Dr. Andrew Felton was hired into the Department of Land Resources and Environmental Sciences at Montana State University, and Dr. Fernando Sanchez was hired into a tenure-track faculty position at the University of Montana as the Director of the Cobell Land and Culture Institute in the Native American Studies Department.</p>\n<p><em>Partnerships</em>: A notable success of the CREWS project is the statewide network of researchers and professionals that was established through site-based working groups. The Upper Clark Fork Working Group includes over 170 individuals from academia, government agencies, nonprofit and private business organizations, all committed to fostering collaboration and generating knowledge needed for decision-making as it pertains to the Upper Clark Fork River. This working group is a collaboration with Montana's Natural Resources Damage Program and Geum Consulting, an ecological consulting firm. The Judith River Watershed Working Group includes individuals from universities, state agencies, and federal agencies, all committed to improving environmental water quality in agricultural regions. In the Powder River Basin, CREWS researchers worked extensively with the Crow Tribe, the Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology, and the Crow Environmental Health Steering Committee to lay the groundwork for continued water quality research in the region.</p>\n<p><em>Outreach</em>: CREWS outreach, communication, and dissemination reached over 100,000 individuals, including K-12 teachers, students, and citizens in Montana. Six grant awards were made to Tribal College faculty, and CREWS supported a First Year Research Experience Seminar for minority students. The project supported the Indigenous Research and STEM Education's American Indians in Math and Science program, a summer STEM camp for over 100 middle school students from Montana's Tribal
