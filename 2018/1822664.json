 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will inform the use of Oxidation Flow Reactors (OFR) in the study of atmospheric chemistry.  OFR are used to study the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in the atmosphere.  Experimental and modeling investigations of the use of the OFR will help to determine their representativeness to understanding chemical reactions in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThis effort addresses two research questions: (1) What is the representativeness of OFR chemistry compared to the atmosphere and large environmental chambers, and how can it be optimized?  (2) What are the key SOA precursors for OH oxidation of ambient air in biogenic environments?  The project includes modeling and laboratory studies to simulate observational measurements from recent NSF-supported field campaigns. This research will provide critically-needed information on the usefulness, interpretation, and best practices of the OFR technique that is being adopted rapidly by the atmospheric science community.  This effort also will help place firmer constraints on the key precursors, pathways and anthropogenic-biogenic interactions controlling SOA formation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
