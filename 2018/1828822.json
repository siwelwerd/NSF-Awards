 "awd_abstract_narration": "Landscapes are accumulating stresses across multiple sectors due to accelerations in the pace and magnitude of natural disturbances, nutrient pollution, energy transformations, land use, and urbanization. Management of these landscapes must necessarily address these processes collectively, recognizing the vast timescales of systems' development, and focus on solutions. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to The Pennsylvania State University provides interdisciplinary training opportunities in ecology, human dimensions of natural resource management, and agriculture and development, while training the next generation of scholar-practitioners to deftly cross disciplinary boundaries and work in partnership with stakeholders to co-create solutions to these challenges.  Landscape gradients within the Chesapeake Bay watershed exemplify the challenges facing linked food-energy-water systems globally and provide opportunities for developing strong science-management partnerships.  The project anticipates training sixty (60) MS and PhD students, including thirty-five (35) funded doctoral trainees from ecology, natural resources, agriculture and development, and related disciplines.\r\n\r\nNew models of university-society partnerships are needed to find solutions to pressing food-energy-water problems at landscape scales. Through an orientation, foundational coursework, science communication training, internships, lab rotations, and community-building and outreach events, carefully aligned along existing intercollege graduate degree programs, trainees will have the confidence, skills, and professional networks necessary to have an impact on pressing societal challenges at local, regional, and global scales. Student-research case studies will explore landscape change across time, and may include: (1) the influence of critical zone processes (including the geological template) on hydrology patterns and subsequent decisions about food and energy systems, (2) the deep history of human entanglements in intertidal systems, based on archaeological evidence, that indicates sustainable oyster harvesting by Native Americans in the Chesapeake Bay, thus providing important baselines for sustainable restoration, and (3) energy transformations, many of which originated in the Chesapeake Bay watershed.  The traineeship focuses on transdisciplinary competencies for graduate education through an emphasis on regenerative solutions, ecological design and planning, and landscapes as the unit of analysis for linking food-energy-water systems across scales. \r\n\r\nThe NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

To do so, LandscapeU identified transdisciplinary competencies in graduate student training, which were linked to innovative training activities, including specialized coursework, field trips, lab rotations, and structured hands-on experiences with practitioners, such as group projects and internships. The program brought together 13 faculty from a range of disciplinary backgrounds, including geosciences, ecology, meteorology and atmospheric sciences, rural sociology, environmental engineering, and recreation, park, and tourism management. The Chesapeake Bay watershed served as the geographical foundation for research, training, and collaborations due to its longstanding nutrient pollution challenges. By combining interdisciplinary research activities in partnership with practitioners, the LandscapeU transdisciplinary approach trained the next generation of graduate students in research that has a direct impact on society, preparing them for a broad range of career pathways in academic and non-academic settings.</p>\r\n<p>LandscapeU identified core competencies in transdisciplinary research including (1) design thinking &ndash; framing a problem from multiple social, temporal, and cultural perspectives and evaluate alternate solutions, (2) systems thinking &ndash; analyzing the interactions, boundaries, components, and identities of socio-ecological systems and how they change through time and space, (3) communication &ndash; effectively communicating with diverse audiences, (4) team facilitation &ndash; facilitating collective action through development of intentional group agency (5) ethical dimensions &ndash; recognizing the importance of different value systems in multiple societal and cultural contexts, (6) innovation &ndash; identifying creative solutions by taking risks and integrating knowledge, and (7) interdisciplinary proficiency &ndash; demonstrating proficiency in one discipline and emergent skills in another.</p>\r\n<p>These competencies were used to frame a new approach to address nutrient quality issues in the Chesapeake Bay, called Regenerative Landscape Design (RLD). RLD is defined as a process for finding pattern-based solutions, emphasizing cooperative, iterative, and facilitated engagement for the co-production of locally relevant knowledge for desirable landscape stewardship. Trainees were encouraged to consider how using transdisciplinary approaches within an RLD framework could be useful for addressing a broad range of food-energy-water nexus issues globally.</p>\r\n<p>Over 40 students were trained by LandscapeU, coming from over 14 departments and programs. Participants were 47.8% white, 17.4% international, 10.9% Asian or Asian American, 10% Hispanic or Latino, 6.5% Black or African American, and 6.5% multiple races. 71% of participants were female. Based on the program evaluation, 90-100% of trainees reported competence at the end of their LandscapeU experience in LandscapeU transdisciplinary research, with an average of 83% reporting high to very high perceived competence. For example, one LandscapeU trainee reported that</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;LandscapeU has given me experience and confidence to work with people from different disciplines. It's not just about working in a team but also learning how to communicate with scholars from different fields. This experience has already had a huge impact on how I approach my research.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Evaluation also identified that LandscapeU helped to shape graduate student identities as interdisciplinary scholars, preparing students for the next step in their careers as emerging researchers.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The program gave me explicit permission to expand my knowledge beyond my discipline, leading to numerous educational and professional experiences that enriched my education and career,&rdquo; shared another LandscapeU participant.</p>\r\n<p>Evaluation further identified that trainees valued the exposure to new ideas, diverse people, and collaboration opportunities that were unique compared to their home graduate programs. Informal spaces like the LandscapeU Caf&eacute;s, a regular gathering of students and faculty to hear a speaker or share in a professional development experience, allowed students to engage with other transdisciplinary scholars, fostering a tight-knit community and encouraging further learning. The program also provided trainees with the opportunity to connect with mentors who had non-academic career experience and participate in field trips, broadening their perspectives about alternative career pathways. LandscapeU foundational coursework resulted in deliverables for community partners focused on topics such as Chesapeake Bay research networks, legacies of mill dam sediment on water quality and remediation strategies, energy systems, urban wastewater management, and conservation landscaping. Over 25 community partners were directly engaged through course projects and 33 additional partners were included as internship hosts.</p>\r\n<p>Sustainability of the LandscapeU program at Penn State is evidenced by the new dual-title graduate program called TREES (Transdisciplinary Research on Environment and Society), which currently includes 12 participating departments and 50 graduate faculty, co-chaired by PI Smithwick and co-PI Hunt. Based on their experiences in LandscapeU, graduate students led a peer-reviewed journal publication on transdisciplinary research successes and challenges. To date, one student has been awarded an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and at least four students have been awarded DDRIGs. Over 100+ student products were attributed to student participation in the program.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/20/2024<br>\nModified by: Erica&nbsp;A&nbsp;Smithwick</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1828822/1828822_10574576_1734635350229_IMG_8419--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1828822/1828822_10574576_1734635350229_IMG_8419--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Hike in Arizona backcountry\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1828822/1828822_10574576_1734635350229_IMG_8419--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Hike in Arizona backcountry\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Spring 2023 trip to Arizona was a collaborative effort that involved many partners, including another NRT at the University of Arizona: Indige-FEWSS.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Erica Smithwick</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Erica&nbsp;A&nbsp;Smithwick\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Hike in Arizona backcountry</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1828822/1828822_10574576_1734633326307_IMG_2239--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1828822/1828822_10574576_1734633326307_IMG_2239--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Teamwork\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1828822/1828822_10574576_1734633326307_IMG_2239--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Teamwork\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Trainees and faculty working on Individualized Development Plans at an annual orientation gathering.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Erica Smithwick</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Erica&nbsp;A&nbsp;Smithwick\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Teamwork</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1828822/1828822_10574576_1734634938977_IMG_4315--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1828822/1828822_10574576_1734634938977_IMG_4315--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Field Trip 2023\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1828822/1828822_10574576_1734634938977_IMG_4315--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Field Trip 2023\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A week-long trip in Arizona took our NRT to many stops.

LandscapeU foundational coursework resulted in deliverables for community partners focused on topics such as Chesapeake Bay research networks, legacies of mill dam sediment on water quality and remediation strategies, energy systems, urban wastewater management, and conservation landscaping. Over 25 community partners were directly engaged through course projects and 33 additional partners were included as internship hosts.\r\n\n\nSustainability of the LandscapeU program at Penn State is evidenced by the new dual-title graduate program called TREES (Transdisciplinary Research on Environment and Society), which currently includes 12 participating departments and 50 graduate faculty, co-chaired by PI Smithwick and co-PI Hunt. Based on their experiences in LandscapeU, graduate students led a peer-reviewed journal publication on transdisciplinary research successes and challenges. To date, one student has been awarded an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and at least four students have been awarded DDRIGs. Over 100+ student products were attributed to student participation in the program.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/20/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: EricaASmithwick\n"
