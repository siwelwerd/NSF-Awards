 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many datasets of interest to scientists, analysts, clinicians, and patients include events that take place over time. Events can come from electronic monitoring devices or manual data entry, and all together form an event sequence. By analyzing event sequences, we can make inferences about complex behaviors over time. Interactive visualization tools are an important tool for human decision makers to use for exploring and understanding data. However, the existing visualization techniques need to be improved to support interpretation of data in applications with a large number of events that vary in frequency, accuracy, and timing. This project will create new visualization encoding and interaction design techniques that will advance the state of the art for understanding long streams of event sequences. Techniques will be validated for general uses as well as in a case study on type 1 diabetes treatment decision support. This research will afford more effective data exploration and decision-making tools for analyzing temporal data, applicable to many domains. The resulting visualization techniques will benefit clinicians and patients performing intensive insulin management for type 1 diabetes by enabling them to reduce the burden of care and improve outcomes. In addition, there are immediate applications to the treatment of chronic heart failure as well as non-health domains such as data centers monitoring cyber security. The outreach efforts in this research will disseminate the findings to the type 1 diabetes community, including both caregivers and patients, as well as encourage teenage girls to pursue careers in STEM. \r\n\r\nThis research will advance the state of the art in visualization and visual analytics for long streams of temporal event sequences with multidimensional, interrelated data. It will create methodologies for: (1) folding and reconfiguring long event sequences to align by dual non-periodic sentinel events; (2) scaling time axes between dual aligned events to show time distributions; (3) dual-event alignment of overlapping units of folded and reconfigured event sequences with data duplication; (4) compositing data from multiple event sequence sources to enable temporal inference with uncertain, erroneous, and missing data; and (5) displaying rapidly changing time series scalar values composited with point and interval event sequences at different time granularities and at different aggregation levels. The domain case study problem will be characterized and refined through semi-structured interviews with certified diabetes educators (CDEs). The visual encodings and interaction designs will be iteratively designed and evaluated through formative usability studies, visualization expert review, controlled task-based experiments, and qualitative studies with CDEs. The project website (http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cody/p/IDMVis/) will include resulting materials, including relevant publications, visualization software, data analysis tools, documentation, deidentified data from user studies, and deidentified domain data for reproducibility and demonstration.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

IDMVis includes widely useful techniques for folding and reconfiguring temporal event sequences; aligning by one or two sentinel events of interest and scaling time axes between two aligned events; and for superimposing data from multiple sources to enable temporal inference with uncertain data. Evaluations with clinicians and a controlled experiment demonstrated the efficacy of the visualizations and led to design recommendations for future visualization researchers and practitioners.</p>\n<p>(2) Sequence Braiding is a novel network visualization of event sequence data. Sequence Braiding aligns many temporal events and attribute groups simultaneously to support overview analysis of sequence and attribute data, while still preserving the ability to follow individual sequences. The tool also includes a novel layered network layout algorithm with grouping and group ordering constraints that is necessary for creating these visualizations. A controlled experiment comparing Sequence Braiding with IDMVis demonstrated the utility of our new approach for showing overviews of temporal data. Our study demonstrated that participants are in general faster using Sequence Braiding for many tasks and that participants found it easier to understand.</p>\n<p>We also contributed a novel form of task abstraction for visualization design called hierarchical task abstraction (HTA). HTA marries hierarchical task analysis with task abstraction so as to better capture user goals and processes. We used this to create a data abstraction and hierarchical task abstraction for clinicians performing type 1 diabetes data analysis for treatment recommendation. We also defined generalizable tasks for visualizing temporal event sequence data based on a distinction between elementary and synoptic tasks. This will be useful for future researchers doing projects related to overviews, identifying and comparing features, and investigating data quality.</p>\n<p>More generally, we evaluated how timeline shape influence user task performance. Our experiment tested 12 combinations of 4 shapes&thinsp;?&thinsp;horizontal line, vertical line, circle, and spiral&thinsp;?&thinsp;and 3 data types&thinsp;?&thinsp;recurrent, non-recurrent, and mixed event sequences. We found good evidence that timeline shape affects user task completion time but not correctness, and that users have a strong shape preference.

Moreover, this project contributed generalizable temporal event sequence and timeline visualization techniques, as well as recommendations for building tools around them. These contributions will help design practitioners to deliver more effective and consumable visualizations for the general public.</p>\n<p>The project has also funded the training of three female graduate students and one male graduate student. The project marks the first paper on visualization submitted by any of these students. Moreover, we have taught these visualization and task abstraction approaches in across several courses and presented the results to diverse audiences outside the university.</p>\n<p>We have made extensive efforts to ensure our research is reproducible, replicable, and open by preregistering studies and posting the design, stimuli, data, analysis code, source code online using OSF.
