 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions.  Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational culture and climate.  ADVANCE \"Adaptation\" awards provide support for the adaptation and adoption of evidence-based strategies to academic and non-academic non-profit organizations.\r\n\r\nThe Bowling Green State University (BGSU) Adaptation project will implement activities to improve the representation and advancement of women STEM faculty at BGSU.  BGSU will develop the ALLIES project which adapts evidence-based strategies from two ADVANCE-IT projects to build faculty allies within departments and inclusive leaders across the university: North Dakota State University's \"Advocates & Allies\" program and Florida International University's \"Deep Change\" program.  The ALLIES project will focus on how administrators and faculty allies can work collaboratively to reduce biases and transform institutional policies and practices. Department allies ensure equitable review of job candidates and evaluation of faculty, serve as mentors to support colleagues' careers, and intervene when bias emerges. Inclusive leaders advocate for faculty and ensure policies and practices produce an equitable workplace. The long-term goal of the project is to make allyship and inclusive leadership the expectation and norm at BGSU.  \r\n\r\nInclusion, intersectionality, and interconnections--the 3 I's--serve as the unifying theme of all BGSU ALLIES programming. The BGSU ALLIES model is innovative because it integrates the concepts of allyship--rooted in the activities of faculty colleagues within departmental cultures--and inclusive leadership--the domain of department chairs, deans and other senior administrators--into a single unified program of institutional transformation. This approach is directed both top-down and bottom-up, as neither is likely to be effective alone.  The BGSU ALLIES project has four objectives: 1) revise institutional policies and processes to make allyship and inclusive leadership the expectation for faculty and administrators, 2) design training materials, workshops, and online modules to train and develop departmental allies and inclusive leaders, 3) deploy new data collection processes for better tracking of faculty careers, and 4) disseminate training materials and best practices to other institutions through a strategic communication plan and a regional conference at BGSU. Most research on ally building in higher education settings focus on students therefore this project will contribute important new information about faculty and administrator allies to that literature.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Allies leverage their privilege to support marginalized colleagues.</p>\r\n<p>The ALLIES project goal was to make allyship and inclusive leadership the expectation and norm at Bowling Green State University (BGSU). We created an integrated model to develop a critical mass of faculty allies within departments and inclusive leaders across the university who are knowledgeable about inclusion and equity issues and empowered to actively combat gender bias (Figure 2).</p>\r\n<p>The ALLIES project was organized into multiple components:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Faculty Allies and Advocates Program</strong></p>\r\n<p>We designed a multi-event program for STEM faculty to develop their allyship skills, including recognizing bias, knowing when and how to intervene, and other allyship actions they can take to support their women faculty colleagues. We also trained 12 senior faculty as Faculty Advocates, who delivered unit-level workshops on addressing gender bias. In all, 112 faculty (meeting our target of 40% of all full-time STEM faculty) were trained as Faculty Allies and Advocates.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Inclusive Leadership Program</strong></p>\r\n<p>We developed several workshops on inclusive leadership principles and practices in which most BGSU department chairs and other faculty administrators participated. In all, 75% of current STEM chairs/directors have participated in ALLIES programs.</p>\r\n<p><strong>University Policies and Practices</strong></p>\r\n<p>With BGSU's Division of Inclusion and Belonging, General Counsel, and President's Cabinet, we established a new equity impact assessment requirement for all University-level policies. We also developed a set of evidence-based best practices and policy recommendations to address gender biases that were shared with administrators.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Research on Gender Equity and Faculty Allyship</strong></p>\r\n<p>The ALLIES team conducted research on faculty allyship beliefs and behaviors (see Figure 3 for publication details, Figure 4 for conferences at which we presented). Five PhD students were trained in research best practices, equity and inclusion in STEM, and accessibility and inclusive design principles.</p>\r\n<p>We explored ways that faculty define and discuss their intersecting forms of privilege and communicatively enact allyship. We found tensions in the degree to which faculty perceived privilege to be un/earned and rooted in structural power and a focus on interpersonal allyship actions rather than ally actions that dismantle power structures and challenge biased policies and cultures (Hanasono et al. 2022). Additional work (Ro et al. 2023) reinforced the idea that faculty focus on individual-level ally strategies rather than strategies to effect institutional and structural change, possibly because the hierarchical structure of university systems makes it difficult for individual faculty to identify or consider institution-wide actions. Also, true allyship (as opposed to performative allyship) involves risks that already-marginalized faculty may not be in a position to take.</p>\r\n<p>The ALLIES team is now developing a new Faculty Ally Behaviors Scale, to better understand how institutional policies, practices, and culture shape faculty perceptions and behaviors of allyship (Ro et al. 2024).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Sustaining ALLIES</strong></p>\r\n<p>To sustain our work, we have created online learning modules designed to help learners recognize and combat biases that result in inequities based on gender, race, and other marginalized identities. New faculty and administrators can use these modules, ensuring that allyship and inclusive leadership do indeed become the expectation and norm at BGSU.</p>\r\n<p>Working with support from the Office of the President and Chief Inclusion Officer, we have established two Faculty Associate positions in the Division of Inclusion and Belonging. The Faculty Associates will use ALLIES resources to design and facilitate relevant programs for faculty and staff.</p>\r\n<p>We organized a conference on \"Advancing Gender Equity for Faculty\" held at BGSU in May 2022. Over 100 attendees from 40 universities across the country shared allyship and inclusive leadership strategies for gender equity, broadened their networks of support, and discussed future collaborations.</p>\r\n<p>Word of our programs' effectiveness has drawn interest from outside parties interested in adopting our workshops. We have conducted allyship and inclusive leadership workshops at Case Western Reserve University, the University of Toledo, and for IT professionals at U.S. National Laboratories. We are developing a structure to continue offering our workshops to academic, government, and industry audiences.</p>\r\n<p><strong>BGSU's Transformation</strong></p>\r\n<p>Based on survey responses, 95% of participants in the Faculty Allies program reported an increase in their personal commitment to addressing gender bias and discrimination. Many reported increased awareness of how gender bias impacts women faculty, more open conversations about these issues, and that the frequency of allyship actions had significantly increased in their units. Most faculty administrators have attended at least one of our workshops on inclusive leadership. Together, this critical mass of change agents will shape academic unit cultures and infuse institutional policies and practices with best practices to support the career success of women and other marginalized STEM faculty for years to come.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/23/2024<br>\nModified by: Margaret&nbsp;M&nbsp;Yacobucci</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1760389/1760389_10569939_1734965859159_BGSU_ALLIES_Final_Outcomes_Fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1760389/1760389_10569939_1734965859159_BGSU_ALLIES_Final_Outcomes_Fig2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"BGSU ALLIES Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1760389/1760389_10569939_1734965859159_BGSU_ALLIES_Final_Outcomes_Fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"BGSU ALLIES Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Project goal and objectives</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Margaret Yacobucci</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Margaret&nbsp;M&nbsp;Yacobucci\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">BGSU ALLIES Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1760389/1760389_10569939_1734965898240_BGSU_ALLIES_Final_Outcomes_Fig3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1760389/1760389_10569939_1734965898240_BGSU_ALLIES_Final_Outcomes_Fig3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"BGSU ALLIES Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1760389/1760389_10569939_1734965898240_BGSU_ALLIES_Final_Outcomes_Fig3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"BGSU ALLIES Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Research products</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Margaret Yacobucci</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Margaret&nbsp;M&nbsp;Yacobucci\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">BGSU ALLIES Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1760389/1760389_10569939_1734965950677_BGSU_ALLIES_Final_Outcomes_Fig4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1760389/1760389_10569939_1734965950677_BGSU_ALLIES_Final_Outcomes_Fig4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"BGSU ALLIES Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1760389/1760389_10569939_1734965950677_BGSU_ALLIES_Final_Outcomes_Fig4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"BGSU ALLIES Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Conferences at which the BGSU ALLIES team has presented</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Margaret Yacobucci</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Margaret&nbsp;M&nbsp;Yacobucci\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">BGSU ALLIES Figure 4</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1760389/1760389_10569939_1734965829371_BGSU_ALLIES_Final_Outcomes_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1760389/1760389_10569939_1734965829371_BGSU_ALLIES_Final_Outcomes_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"BGSU ALLIES Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1760389/1760389_10569939_1734965829371_BGSU_ALLIES_Final_Outcomes_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"BGSU ALLIES Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">BGSU ALLIES project title and NSF Award number, logos, and website url</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Margaret Yacobucci</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Margaret&nbsp;M&nbsp;Yacobucci\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">BGSU ALLIES Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
