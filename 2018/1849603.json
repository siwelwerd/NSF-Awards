 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide consumers a promising solution to purify indoor air, decontaminate water, and inactivate environmental pathogens to prevent infectious disease outbreaks. Conventional strategies for pollution and pathogen control face great challenges of a high cost in operation, intensive energy consumption, and complicated and frequent maintenance. The project aims to advance a new technology and material, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), for pollution and pathogen control with reduced cost, energy footprint, and maintenance, and promote commercialization for diverse applications in both U.S. and abroad. g-C3N4 is a visible-light-responsive photocatalyst that can be synthesized from inexpensive earth abundant chemicals, and the material holds promise for a broad range of applications, including indoor air purifiers, point-of-use or point-of-entry water treatment reactors, self-cleaning and antimicrobial paintings/coatings by utilizing sunlight (a type of renewable energy) or indoor light. Moreover, the project will be the first to explore the potential market of g-C3N4 as a promising advancement for current commercial photocatalysts (e.g., titanium dioxide), accelerate the implementation of innovative materials for industrial, civil, and military applications, and enable a new sustainable strategy of pollution and pathogen control that will be beneficial for our societal development. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project will advance the commercial application of visible-light-responsive g-C3N4 for indoor air purification, water decontamination, and antimicrobial applications in different environments (e.g., healthcare, food). The team has developed g-C3N4 with enhanced photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation and with excellent stability, robustness, and biocompatibility. The team has demonstrated g-C3N4 effectively degraded organic contaminants in water and inactivated pathogens in the form of planktonic bacterial cells and biofilms, under the irradiation of both simulated visible sunlight and white light emitting diodes. Reactive species for contaminant degradation and pathogen inactivation have been identified, and the mechanisms have been elucidated. The team has also initiated the collaboration with an industrial partner to fabricate antimicrobial coatings with g-C3N4 for both healthcare and food applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Through the 6-month NSF I-Corps program, this project has generated a clear business model and a substantial first-hand evidence of product-market fit, and the team decides for no go at the current stage. At the beginning of the project, the team did not have a clear business model. Due to the potential versatile applications of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, it was challenging for the team to identify the clear market. Through 6-month business knowledge learning and interviews, the team finally was able to decide the customer segments. The team decided to focus on antimicrobial application of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> for catheter applications in biomedical science and engineering, and the value proposition is to provide catheter manufactures with cost and performance-effective antimicrobial additive. Moreover, the team has interviewed 117 professionals from different industries, including food processing companies (Tysons food, Simmons food, Nestle, Oceanpro, etc.), food packaging companies (Cargill, Nestle, MS packaging Inc, General Mills, etc.), medical device companies (Johnson and Johnson, Braun, Promed, etc). Based on the feedbacks, however, the material is not in an urgent need in food industry to prevent foodborne pathogens. Fortunately, from the interview, the team has identified that hospital acquired infections caused by microbial contamination on the medical devices are a huge challenge for the medical professionals and catheter manufacturers. By further discussions with catheter manufacturers, the team has learned that few suppliers were providing low-cost and effective antimicrobial additives for the current market. Therefore, there is a potential market fit for g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, which can be supplied as a low-cost and effective antimicrobial additive for medical device manufacturers. Even though the team has found a fit market, the team still has no evidence to show g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> is competitive in the market. It is difficulty for the team to estimate the cost of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> production at a large scale, since all studies were conducted at a lab scale. In addition, more research has to be done to coat g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> onto medical devices (e.g. catheters) and to test the antimicrobial efficiency based on industry standards. Last but not least, the team has to get US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the material for medical device applications. In summary, &nbsp;the NSF I-Corps project has bridged the gap between the lab research and industrial needs, and it is the first time to demonstrate potential markets and practical challenges of visible-light-responsive photocatalyst of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>.
