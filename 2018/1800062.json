 "awd_abstract_narration": "The security of an energy supply, its sustainability and environmental consequences are global concerns in modern society. Nature has optimized the mechanism of photosynthesis to absorb and harvest solar energy by transforming carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrate fuels. Yet, this apparently simple transformation of carbon dioxide and water - the most ubiquitous chemicals on earth - to a sustainable fuel source still represents one of the grand challenges of science today. In this project, Dr. Rochford of University of Massachusetts Boston learns from nature and develops a next generation of molecular catalysts that can mimic photosynthesis to efficiently transform carbon dioxide and water into useful fuels. Just as we are strongly influenced by our own environment in a macroscopic world, the behavior and properties of carbon dioxide and water are also very sensitive to their local environment at a molecular scale.  Dr. Rochford and his students utilize \"self-assembly\" techniques, inspired by photosynthesis, to leverage the environmental sensitivity of carbon dioxide and water to optimize their sustainable transformation into fuels. This grant from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the NSF Chemistry Division enriches the undergraduate and graduate experiences of many UMass Boston students and has a major positive impact on the UMass Boston research portfolio. \r\n\r\nThis project represents a novel approach to electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction through the design and synthesis of molecular catalysts with engineered second- and outer-coordination spheres providing selective control over product formation (carbon monoxide vs. formic acid vs. hydrogen gas). Significant intellectual merit is achieved by targeting first-row Mn(I)-based transition metal catalysts whereby tailoring the second- and outer-coordination sphere of the ligand, transition-state energies is optimized to promote proton-coupled electron transfer, thus reducing activation energies for critical rate-determining steps to maximize catalyst turnover frequencies, and reduce the minimum required overpotential. Dr. Rochford and his students develop cutting-edge catalyst design methods, from synthesis to self-assembly, combined with tailored electrochemical analyses, which impacts on a host of research areas that employ nanostructured and electroactive surfaces. Success in this area informs the chemical catalysis community to better design, control and optimize first-row transition metal catalysts for selective carbon dioxide conversion at accessible overpotentials. Dr. Rochford is a strong advocate of education for young scholars regarding the environmental impacts of carbon dioxide, renewable energy alternatives, and advances in renewable energy technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Specifically, the molecular environment of the catalyst active site was tailored to engineer catalytic carbon dioxide conversion at a lower thermodynamic cost. For example, by introducing a tetramethoxy hydrogen-bonding functionality in the second-coordination sphere of the catalyst (Figure 1, [Mn]<sup>-</sup>) the lower overpotential <em>protonation-first</em> pathway for carbon dioxide conversion to CO is accessed. Notably, this second coordination sphere H-bonding, provides a bonding environment in the catalyst active site to favor acid-driven cleavage of the carbon-hydroxy (C-OH) bond of the metallocarboxylic acid intermediate ([Mn-CO<sub>2</sub>H]); a computed transition state illustrating such hydrogen bonding is provided in figure 1. Electrochemical data in figure 2 illustrates a saving of up to 0.5 V in energy relative to a reference catalyst, [Mn(mes<sub>2</sub>bpy)(CO)<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>3</sub>CN)]<sup>+</sup>, lacking such second coordination sphere H-bonding effects.</p>\n<p>This grant allowed us to further explore second-coordination sphere (SCS)<strong> </strong>promotion of the protonation-first catalytic pathway with expansion of this strategy to also investigate outer coordination sphere (OCS) influence on catalytic efficiency. Continuing with the established catalyst template [Mn(R<sub>2</sub>-bpy)(CO)<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>3</sub>CN)]<sup>+</sup>, a functional group dependence for optimization of the protonation-first pathway was successfully completed. After screening over a dozen second-coordination sphere functional groups it was learned that the <em>ortho</em>-arylether or <em>ortho</em>-arylester substituted ligands are key to directing molecular catalysts to this lower energy pathway via SCS and OCS ligand modification (Figures 3 and 4). Of equal merit was our parallel observation of how steric bulk on the ligand structure actually impeded both the protonation-first and reduction first pathways by inhibiting catalyst rate, increasing the activation energy required and necessitating a greater electrochemical overpotential for carbon dioxide conversion.</p>\n<p class=\"TAMainText\">A simpler approach was also adapted to avoid the tedious and laborious synthesis of covalently bound second/outer coordination spheres by adapting a self-assembled-bilayer (SAB) strategy. Successful proof-of-principle for electrocatalytic carbon monoxide to formic acid reduction was achieved using the hydrophobic [Mn(dnbpy)(CO)<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>3</sub>CN)]<sup>+</sup> pre-catalyst adsorbed at an equally hydrophobic electrode surface (octyltriethoxysilane at fluorine doped tin oxid, FTO&#9474;OTS). Electrocatalysis studies yielded an improved current density with an onset potential of just ?1.2 V vs NHE (pH = 8.2) for the FTO&#9474;OTS&#9474;catalyst assembly in the added presence of the <em>N</em>-methyl-4-decylpyridinium co-factor to engineer an electrostatic second coordination sphere effect (Figure 5). Formic acid was identified as the primary product with an overpotential of just 0.46 V.</p>\n<p>Overall this project provided multi-disciplinary training for a 1 postdoctoral associate, 6 graduate students, and 6 undergraduate students.
