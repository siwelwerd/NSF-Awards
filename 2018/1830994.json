 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemical Measurement and Imaging program of the Division of Chemistry is funding Professor Zachary D. Schultz of the University of Notre Dame to explore ways to enhance the signal from molecular samples being imaged by a scanning probe microscope.  A type of light scattering (Raman scattering) can reveal information about the structure of molecules.  In a scanning probe experiment, the probe tip can enhance the Raman scattering signal (this is called tip-enhanced Raman scattering, or 'TERS'). Professor Schultz is investigating the origin of Raman signal enhancements observed from nanostructures coupled with tip enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) imaging. The instrumentation and methodology is being used in collaboration with Snite Museum of Art to identify pigments in medieval artwork and aid conservation studies. The incorporation of graduate and undergraduate students in this research provides a platform for promoting measurement science and a training opportunity for the students to gain research skills relevant to academic research and commercial interests.\r\n\r\nThe project focuses on understanding the plasmonic effects that give rise to chemical specific signals in TERS experiments. TERS imaging combined with hyperspectral dark-field microscopy determines the plasmon modes and Raman scattering arising from the interaction of a TERS-tip with various sized and shaped nanoparticles (NPs). The electric fields experienced by molecules around the nanostructures are being studied by vibrational frequency shifts rather than signal intensity. Chemical functionalization of the TERS tip and the surface is being used to study the location of the molecules that give rise to the observed TERS signals. The sensitivity of the TERS measurements is being investigated to determine the possibility of single protein studies. This project has the potential to enable chemical characterization of protein receptors in intact cell membranes.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes Report for CHE-1830994\n\nNanomaterials have properties not found when the materials exist as macroscopic materials.  The interaction between nanoparticles that support plasmon resonances and light generates electric fields that give rise to signal enhancements in high sensitivity Raman experiments.  When light resonant with the plasmon resonance impinges on a nanoparticle, the electric field around the particle increases.  When particles are in close proximity, the interactions between the particles alters the electric fields in ways that produce new properties.  In this project we explored the properties arising from these interactions between particles.\n\nIntellectual Merit. Gold (and silver) nanoparticles give rise to enhanced fields with interesting properties when their electrons are excited.  By controlling one of these particle?s position by placing it on the end of an atomic force microscope time, images can be obtained based on the Raman scattering that molecules around the particles produce.  In previous work, we demonstrated that protein receptors near these particles could be detected, and their position imaged based on the receptor?s Raman signal.  These signals were unexpectedly large, which suggested new interactions that generated the observed signals.\n\nExperiments were performed to verify the signals originate from proteins on a surface.  These experiments demonstrated that binding of a nanoparticle to the protein (as detected by a change in the surface plasmon resonance) correlated to the observed Raman signals.  We further investigated how heat was generated when nanoparticles are in close proximity and showed that the absorption, and corresponding heat generation, does not increase as significantly as the optical scattering signal.  These experiments support the high-sensitivity detection of proteins is possible in other experiments. \n\nExperiments were performed to experimentally verify the electric fields around these particles.  It has been shown that the vibrational frequency of chemical bonds will shift in the presence of an external electric field, known as the Stark effect.  The Stark effect from a reporter molecule was used to monitor the electric fields around the nanoparticles.  Using controlled spacing between the particles, it was shown that electrons tunnel between nanoparticles giving rise to large DC surface potentials.  These potentials can catalyze chemical reactions on the surface of the nanoparticles, suggesting a new mechanism for photocatalysis with these plasmonic materials.   \n\nBroader Impact.  In addition to providing new insight into biosensing and catalysis, this project has impacted society in multiple ways.  The instrumentation supported by this award was also used to assist art conservation efforts.  A 15th century Briton book of hours belonging to the Rare Books Collection at the University of Notre Dame's Hesburgh Library was analyzed by Raman microscopy and the analysis was presented in an exhibition.  Additionally, this project fostered an international collaboration with Chile.  A visiting student from Chile performed research and exposed American students to international perspectives on science. \n\nA total of 8 individuals (2 postdoctoral fellows, 4 graduate students, and 2 undergraduate students received training in how to conduct scientific research and in effective scientific communication through presentations and publishing their work.  Two PhD dissertations were completed under this project.  Everyone involved in this project has remained in a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) related field, contributing to the STEM workforce.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/30/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Zachary Schultz"
