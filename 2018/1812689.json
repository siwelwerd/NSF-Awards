 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are all familiar with gas temperature: a higher temperature implies\r\nmore energetic atoms which we feel as heat.  Gasses at the same\r\ntemperature have the same distribution of energies: a\r\nMaxwell-Boltzmann distribution.  If we heat some of the gas,\r\ncollisions quickly re-establish the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.\r\nIn addition, collisions between electrons and ions can excite\r\nelectronic states (in a neon sign, for example).  The excitation rates\r\ndepend sensitively on the tails of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.\r\nAstrophysicists use these ideas to infer the temperatures, densities,\r\nand compositions of gases in the cosmos.  Observations of the\r\nintensity and wavelengths of the emitted photons provide information\r\nabout the composition and energies of the gas.  However, the gas\r\ndensity in much of the Universe is extraordinarily low. It is so low\r\nthat the heating and cooling times are longer than the equilibration\r\ntime for the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.  The discrepancy from the\r\nthermal distribution affects radiative cooling rates and the balance\r\nbetween ionization and recombination.  This changes our interpretation\r\nof observed spectra.  Spectra are important diagnostic of gas\r\nproperties throughout the Universe.  The results of this research will\r\nbe an improved understanding of cosmic gas for use by all astronomers.\r\nThe proposed research projects will provide training for graduate\r\nstudents in high-performance computing and dynamical systems.  These\r\nskills will translate to wide variety of STEM careers.  The proposed\r\nsimulations will generate a number of small-scale analyses suitable\r\nfor undergraduate projects.  We will provide both term-time and summer\r\ninternships for all institutions in the 5-College Consortium.  This\r\nwill help recruit and retain future STEM leaders.\r\n\r\nThese fundamental physical issues motivated a new collisional\r\nBoltzmann equation solver based on Direct Simulation Monte Carlo\r\n(DSMC).  Development of this code motivated new algorithms for\r\ncomputing the multiple ionization states found in tenuous cosmic\r\nplasma.  The new computational method reproduces the standard LTE\r\ncooling curve. But, it also tracks the non-thermal time-dependent\r\nevolution of gas affected by multiple heating, cooling, and dynamical\r\nprocesses.  This novel approach promises new insight into the exotic\r\nstates of gas in galaxies.  For example, consider the circumgalactic\r\nmedium (CGM). Interpreting non-thermal ionization fractions in the\r\nthermal limit may yield the wrong elemental abundances and\r\nunexpectedly large volumes of thermally unstable gas.  Even in the\r\nsimple case of a hydrostatic halo, this non-thermal distribution may\r\npass through multiple CGM gas phases.  This results in an overall\r\nnon-thermal mixture of energies and ionization fractions, which\r\nimpacts our understanding of gas accretion and wind processes that\r\ngovern star formation in galaxies.  The implications are even more\r\ndrastic for smaller scale structures like gas clouds embedded in a hot\r\nhalo or for shocks.  Overall, these non-thermal distributions affect\r\nabsorption and emission features in the optical, UV, and x-ray.  They\r\nalter our interpretation of quasar absorption-line and x-ray spectra.\r\nIn short, the proposed work will improve our core understanding of\r\nnon-fluid gas dynamics.  This may lead to ground-breaking solutions of\r\noutstanding observational dilemmas.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe interplay between cold gas (ISM), halo gas (CGM), and intergalactic gas (IGM) though cosmic time holds the answers to key problems in galaxy formation and evolution that affect nearly all galaxy observables including star-formation rates, chemical enrichment, quenching, and morphology, to name a few. Data from space and ground based observatories provide a wealth of evidence for this interplay, but interpreting them remains challenging. This project developed new algorithms to treat the non-equilibrium and non-thermal properties of gas in the plasma state that differs from the common predictions of a thermal equilibrium. Although terrestrial fluids are well described by a single temperature, galaxies are rife with regions of non-equilibrium non-thermal gas and plasma. Non-thermal (or non-LTE) states may arise from the disparate timescales for equipartition between electrons and ions, radiative energy loss, and non-thermal or supra-thermal energy injection. For example, the equilibrium time for establishing the high-velocity tails of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution may be much longer than heating or cooling times, enforcing a non-LTE state. Although these tails do not represent the bulk kinetic energy density, they critically affect radiative heating and cooling and determine ionization and recombination balance; small deviations from thermodynamic equilibrium can cause significant differences in ionization states, with significant consequences for our interpretation of spectral data, our key diagnostic for understanding gas properties in much of our Universe. To address these fundamental physical issues, we have developed a collisional Boltzmann equation solver based on Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) to investigate and predict the ionization states and observed spectra for these important astrophysical non-LTE scenarios. Development of this code has already motivated new algorithms for the accurate statistical representation of multiple ionization states for observed atomic species in the tenuous gas. This development was a significant challenge and is computational intensive and still requires more work before being generally applicable. Nonetheless, we have been able to show that the new computational method reproduces the standard LTE cooling curve in the closed-box steady-state limit, but tracks the non-thermal time-dependent evolution of gas affecting multiple heating, cooling and dynamical processes. This novel approach promises new insight into the exotic states of gas in galaxies.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/04/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MartinDWeinberg\n"
