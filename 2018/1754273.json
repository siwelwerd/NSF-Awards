 "awd_abstract_narration": "Invasive plants cost millions of dollars annually in control and eradication efforts and are among the most pervasive threats to biological conservation and natural area management. However, only a small percentage of introduced plants actually become problems, and one of the biggest challenges in invasive species management is to identify whether some species are 'pre-adapted' to invade - that is, have attributes in their home range that may identify them as potential threats before they are introduced. This project compares the performance of over 40 species of invasive plants in their home and invaded ranges across fields and forests in the Northeast U.S. and in similar climates of Europe and Asia. Combined with laboratory tests of leaf chemistry and structure, the investigators will determine whether invasive plants change in their invaded range in ways that make them better able to compete with native vegetation, or whether they already possessed these competitive attributes in their home range. The combination of field and laboratory measurements across a large range of species in multiple habitats will provide a unique set of data to identify the main constraints on leaf function. The project fosters international knowledge transfer and research partnerships through exchanges of senior personnel, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates between research labs. Results will contribute to land management practices through a better understanding of mechanisms behind successful invasions of non-native plants. The project enhances STEM education by increasing resource development and outreach activities for the \"Syracuse Global Change Garden\", an education-based arboretum on the Syracuse campus.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses the mechanism of ecological advantage of invasive plant species from two complementary angles. First, researchers will determine how plants of different photosynthetic capacity allocate a key limiting resource (nitrogen) to different leaf functions (light harvesting, carbon fixation, cell wall structure, defensive compounds) to test whether nitrogen allocation drives assimilation rate, and whether invaders have higher allocation to assimilation than co-occurring native species. Second, researchers will determine whether invasive species have altered their allocation to assimilation rate in their invaded range in response to reduced natural enemies, or whether photosynthetic advantages were already present in their native range due to different regional evolutionary histories. Finally, the investigators will test experimentally whether photosynthetic performance is the principal driver of competitive dominance in invaders. This project will be among the first to test invasion and leaf allocation theory empirically across a large number of species and habitats (forest and field environments), and to test the 'pre-adaptation' theory of species invasions at a physiological level. The project will also advance our understanding of invasion processes by determining whether shifts in leaf function commonly occur in the invaded range, and whether such processes are sufficient to alter interactions with native species.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This award supported a collaboration of researchers in the US, France, and Japan to better understand the underlying biology of invasive plants and whether physiological changes in leaves between species' 'home' and 'away' ranges drive their invasiveness. Many plant invaders in US open (e.g., agricultural) landscapes have home ranges in Europe (including France), while most woody forest invaders have home ranges in Asia and particularly Japan. This project investigated leaf performance of over 40 invasive species across all three regions, and made several discoveries. First, we hypothesized that photosynthesis--the rate at which plants acquire and store energy--would be more efficient in the away range of invaders because they allocate more of a critical leaf nutrient (nitrogen) toward photosynthetic proteins rather than defensive compounds. We found this to be true for many herbaceous, open-site invaders originating in France, but, contrary to expectation, not true for most shade-tolerant woody invaders. Second, we found that the amount of nitrogen in leaf defensive compounds, such as alkaloids, was generally small even in the home range of invaders, as was the amount of nitrogen that contributes to cell structure (e.g., cell wall proteins). Together, these results suggests that reallocation of nitrogen to photosynthesis in the away range, as is often supposed, is not a general explanation of why species become invasive when introduced to new areas, thus falsifying our hypothesis that photosynthesis, and perhaps leaf processes in general, are the key to understanding the competitive superiority of invasive plants. However, in a more detailed analysis of the properties of shade tolerant, invasive woody species in US forests, we identified a 'functional trait syndrome' of invaders that reflects coordinated variation across leaves, stems, and roots, reflecting their tendency to both grow fast when resources (such as light) are abundant but also tolerate deep shade. This discovery prompted a symposium session at the Ecological Society of America conference involving researchers of forests invasions from around the world (U.S., Europe, Brazil, Australia, and New Zealand), and resulted in our recent publication of a new theoretical framework for understanding and managing forest invasions. A key outcome is that it may be possible to inexpensively 'screen' new species to identify their invasiveness potential before they are widely introduced to a new region. Our project also fostered the training of three graduate students, numerous undergraduates, and one postdoctoral researcher, and solidified international research collaborations of biologists working at the vanguard of forest invasions.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/04/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jason&nbsp;D&nbsp;Fridley</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1754273/1754273_10541899_1672845147131_Vincetoxicum_CNY--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1754273/1754273_10541899_1672845147131_Vincetoxicum_CNY--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Swallowwort\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1754273/1754273_10541899_1672845147131_Vincetoxicum_CNY--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Swallowwort\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Invasive swallowwort in Central New York.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jason Fridley</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jason&nbsp;D&nbsp;Fridley</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Swallowwort</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
