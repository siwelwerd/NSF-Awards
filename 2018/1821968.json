 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will collect vegetation exposed along the margins of receding glaciers on Baffin Island, Canada and use radiocarbon dating to determine when it was frozen as glaciers advanced during the Little Ice Age. Samples from the same sites collected in 2005 suggest that ice may have expanded following volcanic activity. This study will address hypotheses about the rate of cooling by combining the distance of ice retreat since 2005 and difference in age of the mosses. A graduate student will participate in field work and prepare results of radiocarbon dating for publication.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to examine the rate of onset of persistent Little Ice Age (LIA) cold by dating 50 new samples from current ice margins from ice complexes in Baffin Island, Canada, and comparing them to similar collections from 2005. If LIA ice expansion was abrupt and persistent then dates on the new plants should be about the same age as the 2005 samples, 200 to 500 m distant. Whereas if summers slowly cooled over decades-to-centuries through the late Holocene, then the new dates will be significantly older than their 2005 counterparts. Collectively, these data will provide the most robust testing of an abrupt onset of LIA cold and will be of interest to the sea ice and climate modeling communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit:  Portions of most small ice caps in low-relief Arctic landscapes remained largely cold-based since their inception during the Holocene. As a result, cold-based portions preserve in situ tundra plants that were killed as ice expanded across vegetated landscapes. As summers warmed in recent decades, ice caps in the Eastern Canadian Arctic have receded rapidly, exposing entombed plants. The radiocarbon ages of these ice-entombed plants define times when ice caps expanded in the past.  In a previous study many of the plant ages coincided with episodes of explosive volcanism, which subsequent climate modeling suggested triggered cold episodes, including the Little Ice Age, the coldest centuries of the past 8000 years in the Northern Hemisphere.  Ice recession since the initial plant collections has  been 150 to 200 meters.  We revisited the two main ice complexes and re-collected plants at the current ice margin to test whether we could reproduce those results.  59 new radiocarbon dates on ice-edge plants confirmed our former results, and showed that more ages of early Common Era ice expansion are now being exposed as ice recedes farther to its point of origin.\nBroader Impacts: Although maximum ice dimensions can be often reconstructed from moraines and moraine ages may be dated by various means, but the timing of onset of ice expansion has largely vexed the paleo-community.  Lake sediment records sometimes provide ancillary evidence, but direct dating has eluded the community.  Ice-advance-killed tundra plants preserved beneath cold-based ice provides the most secure evidence of past ice advance, providing the paleo-community with secure evidence on decadal to century time scales of past ice expansion, to compare with model simulations and other proxy climate evidence.  Ice-entombed plants, and the evidence they provide is also easily communicated to a broader audience.  These data not only provide timing of past ice expansion, they also place contemporary warming in a millennial perspective, as plant preservation requires continuous ice-cover, and their current exposure is, in most instances, the first time summer temperatures have been consistently warm enough to melt the ice since their date of plant death.  Our results indicate that summers are currently warmer than any century average  on millennia.  They also support our earlier interpretation of explosive volcanism as a trigger for widespread climate change, when sufficient positive feedbacks are triggered to perpetuate the summer cooling. This provides easily understood mechanisms for climate change and positive feedback to an interested public.\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/07/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gifford H Miller\nAll Data are archived at the NSF Arctic Data Center(https://arcticdata.io/) under the doi of doi:10.18739/A24F1MK29.\n\n \n\n\n\nLast Modified: 08/12/2021\nSubmitted by: Gifford H Miller"
