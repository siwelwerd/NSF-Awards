 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research concerns how groups of people can cooperate to protect their privacy. The researchers will study how people can help one another to manage their digital privacy and security. Offline, people support each other informally to make privacy and security decisions, by sharing stories or exchanging advice, but technology designs for privacy do not reflect these social processes. This project builds on social science research on collective efficacy and citizen participation in problem solving, and develops a model of community oversight to help groups of people collectively manage their digital privacy and security. The researchers will evaluate this model within the context of mobile smartphones, and prototype a mobile app for groups of interconnected users to share and provide feedback regarding a range of mobile privacy and security settings. Research with people will also provide insight into how to support different groups to communicate and collaborate around mobile security and safety.\r\n\r\nThe willingness of individuals to intervene on others' behalf is known as collective efficacy, and the intention of the model of community oversight is to support and improve this outcome among interconnected individuals or existing communities such as families, friends, co-workers in a manner that enhances their digital privacy and security. The work makes a theoretical contribution by offering a model of community oversight and demonstrating how this model might be translated into sociotechnical design. The user studies will provide valuable insights into the social and technical factors that impact user participation in community oversight for digital privacy and security. Through the implementation and deployment of the mobile app in the field, the researchers will evaluate how users interact with the technology artifact and with each other, providing valuable design guidelines for future systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project delves into the previously unexplored domain of community oversight for mobile security, unveiling the intricate interplay between social factors and collective engagement. We move beyond individual behavior analysis, revealing how network topology, trust dynamics, and communication patterns influence participation in these collaborative mechanisms. Our research not only sheds light on how social structures shape collective efforts but also offers a theoretical framework for future studies in this emerging field.\n\n\nBeyond the realm of theory, we translate our findings into tangible solutions. Our CO-oPS mobile app embodies the principles of community oversight, serving as a platform for transparent information sharing and collaborative decision-making regarding mobile security practices. This user-centric design, developed through extensive prototyping, empowers individuals to understand and manage their privacy settings effectively. By fostering meaningful interactions and feedback loops, the app promotes a sustainable, community-driven approach to mobile security, shifting the paradigm from individual responsibility to collective action.\n\n\nOur impact extends beyond immediate user engagement. Rigorous deployment and evaluation of the CO-oPS app provide not only concrete evidence of its effectiveness in enhancing collective efficacy but also pave the way for broader societal benefits. Recognizing the universal need for accessible mobile security solutions, we released the app as open-source software. This act of knowledge sharing offers potential for widespread adoption and adaptation, empowering researchers and communities to tailor the platform to their specific needs. The project's contribution extends beyond technology; it fosters the professional development of graduate assistants, equipping them with valuable user-centered research skills applicable to tackling real-world problems.\n\n\nThis project represents a significant stride towards a future where collective action empowers communities to safeguard their digital privacy and security. By illuminating the social underpinnings of community oversight and translating them into user-driven solutions, we offer a novel approach with far-reaching implications. The open-source nature of the platform ensures its sustainability and scalability, fostering knowledge sharing and empowering stakeholders to build a more secure mobile ecosystem for all. This multifaceted research effort lays the groundwork for a new era of collaboration, paving the way for communities to collectively protect themselves in the ever-evolving digital landscape.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/02/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JessicaKropczynski\n"
