 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Chrys Wesdemiotis and his group at the University of Akron are developing new methods for the characterization of advanced materials used in mechanical, electrical, biomedical, optical, or environmental applications (such as implants, coatings, adhesives, membranes, and \"smart surfaces\").  The methods are based on mass spectrometry, a powerful tool for characterizing the compositions and structures.  They allow accurate and sensitive analysis of the molecular structures of the synthetic macromolecular compounds comprising these materials, enabling meaningful understanding of the relationships between molecular structure and useful properties, thus facilitating the design of better, commercially viable products with desired macroscopic features. The research provides opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students (including students from underrepresented groups) to engage in modern chemical analysis and materials research, two areas with growing employment opportunities that are vital for our nation's technological advancement.\r\n\r\nA major objective of this research is to integrate mild thermal desorption/degradation with online mass spectrometry for the microstructural characterization of crosslinked polymers and materials with very high molecular weight, such as hydrogels and rubber copolymers. Relatively low temperatures are employed in order to preferentially break weak bonds or to probe sterically crowded sites, yielding oligomeric species that provide molecular connectivity detail as well as insight into crosslinkers and polymer precursors. A further objective concerns the development of surface-layer matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometric imaging for the detection of intact molecules within the top 2 nm of synthetic material surfaces. Understanding of the surface composition and detection and characterization of unwanted defects or deliberate surface modifications is imperative for deciding a material?s suitability for a given application, since the surface is the first point of contact with the environment. The Wesdemiotis group uses multidimensional approaches (combining mass analysis, tandem mass spectrometry, and orthogonal separation by polarity and/or shape) to enable sensitive and precise analysis of the composition, structure, and architecture of synthetic macromolecular compounds that are widely employed in industrial, biomedical, and technological applications.  They specifically target materials that are challenging to characterize by other methods because of their complexity, size, or topology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The reactants and products in these interconversions generally include isobaric species with distinct charges that are superimposed at the same mass-to-charge ratio. The use of orthogonal, online ion mobility spectrometry prior to mass analysis permits quantitative separation and identification of the interconverting species and assessment of their relative concentrations, from which equilibrium constants (i.e., thermodynamic information) can be derived.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mild thermal desorption/degradation with in-situ mass spectrometry characterization of the products provides unique connectivity information about the composition and structure of crosslinked materials.

Both the covalently linked components of the networks as well as their additives were conclusively characterized by performing experiments at temperatures ranging from 250 to 450 ?C.

It involves chromatographic separation in solution by polarity, orthogonal separation in the gas phase by ion mobility (size and shape), and accurate mass analysis as well as fragmentation of the isolated ions (LC-IM-MS-MS/MS). Isomers and isobars, which are generally present in amphiphilic blends are conclusively identified by such experiments, making it possible to detect minor variations in composition which can still trigger significant changes in physical properties and performance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the analysis and imaging of solid surfaces, our group has developed surface-layer matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (SL-MALDI-MS), a solvent-free MALDI variant that probes only the top 1-2 molecular layers of polymer films. This capability was utilized for the first time to image defects on polymer films caused by foreign materials, material absence, mechanical etching, and solvent perturbation. Moreover, combination of solvent-free with solvent-based MALDI-MS imaging also reveals compositional differences between the bulk and the surface of polymer films, which provides fundamental insight about the mechanism and physics of film formation from polymer solutions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A new protein footprinting technique has been introduced, using supramolecular polymer-protein conjugates to probe surface-accessible basic residues.
