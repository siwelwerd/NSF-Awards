 "awd_abstract_narration": "The biology of iconic megatoothed 'megalodon' shark-the largest shark species to have existed on Earth-and other extinct sharks remain largely unknown. For example, it is unclear whether 'megalodon' was 'cold blooded' or 'warm blooded' and how other fossil shark species compare. Understanding these biological details coupled with environmental reconstructions could help researchers understand what led to the demise of 'megalodon' during the late Pliocene (about 2.6 million years ago), and thus help to better understand the sensitivity of large shark species to ecosystem changes. This project uses isotopic 'fingerprinting' of teeth to reconstruct not only the body temperatures, but also dietary behavior and seawater chemistry of 'megalodon' and other shark species during the past 15 million years. In addition, this work supports a PhD student, a postdoctoral research fellow at a Hispanic Serving Institution, and undergraduate research experiences for under-represented minority (URM) students.  \r\n\r\nShark teeth are the most abundant vertebrate fossil and their resistance to diagenetic alteration provides a substrate for gechemical analysis. This project explores the phylogenetic history of endothermy within lamniform sharks using a coupled paleoecological and geochemical framework. Specifically, this work consists of four objectives: (1) estimate body temperatures of modern and ancestral marine vertebrates using 'clumped' isotope thermometry (i.e., thermodynamic preference of 13C and 18O to form bonds, or 'clump', in the carbonate mineral lattice), and assess foraging behavior using calcium isotopes (44Ca/42Ca) and 3D microwear analysis in bioapatite; (2) reconstruct and compare shark habitats using oxygen isotopes ( 18O) of shark tooth phosphate and carbonate; (3) infer changes in seawater Sr/Ca between the mid-Miocene Climate Optimum (17-15 million years before present) and Pliocene (~5.3-2.6 million years before present) from bioapatite; (4) build a research community of under-represented minority students. Coupling 'clumped' isotope thermometry-a relatively new method to determine body temperature-with other stable isotope and biogeochemical proxies to explore shark paleoecology through geologic time is the first of its kind. In addition, this project coincides with an upsurge of interest in the debate surrounding the rise and extinction of 'megalodon.' This research, therefore, combines paleontological questions with geochemical techniques to bring scientists one step closer to tackling the 'megalodon extinction hypothesis'.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project explored the diet and environment of <em>Otodus megalodon</em> using chemical signals encoded in teeth. To validate novel chemical techniques, we also analyzed modern shark teeth.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the primary ways to study modern shark diet is using the stable isotope composition of organic carbon and nitrogen (&delta;<sup>13</sup>C and &delta;<sup>15</sup>N), but these components do not preserve in fossils. Therefore, we compared these relatively well-studied isotope systems in modern shark teeth, then compared to calcium, zinc, and enameloid-bound nitrogen isotope systems. A record of calcium isotopes over the past 100 million years reveals fluctuations that are likely a combination of ocean calcium chemistry and influences in shark diet (Akhtar et al. 2020). One of the most exciting results of this project is the comparison of <em>O. megalodon</em> and white sharks, which still live today. The first study analyzed trace amounts of nitrogen embedded in the mineral coating of shark teeth known as enameloid, which indicated that <em>O. megalodon</em> was at the top of the food chain, beyond anything we know today (Kast et al. 2022). Another study used zinc isotopes and found comparable diets in <em>O. megalodon</em> and white sharks (McCormack et al. 2022); although these two studies slightly differ in their results, they both indicate that <em>O. megalodon</em> was an apex predator in Miocene ? Pliocene oceans.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Beyond diet, physiology is also an important ecological trait. We analyzed modern and fossil shark teeth for chemical tracers of temperature, which is similar to surrounding waters for most sharks. However, there are some modern sharks with elevated body temperatures, such as the white shark and others in the Laminidae family. We used oxygen isotopes in phosphate and carbonate to look at temperature, like past studies, but also compared these to ?clumped isotope? measurements that are independent of source water composition. Phosphate oxygen and ?clumped? isotopes indicate <em>O. megalodon</em> had elevated body temperatures. In contrast, carbonate isotopes are enigmatic and may be influenced by diet and environmental factors, such as water temperature and dissolved inorganic carbonate (Karnes, 2022). To gain insight to diet from shark teeth, we created a method to evaluate chemical preparation techniques to isolate organic carbon and nitrogen from the dentine portion of teeth (Trayler et al., 2023).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The final goal of this project was to increase belonging in science among early career scientists from minoritized groups. The Kim lab hosted three undergraduate students from William Paterson University in 2019, supported four undergraduate research assistants and two MS graduate student theses, and delivered ?Shark Survivor!,? a virtual summer workshop during the summers of 2020 and 2021. All the students participating in research were from historically underrepresented groups in college, many with intersectional identities. Most participants in Shark Survivor were from the Central Valley of California, an underserved region that was hard hit by the global pandemic.
