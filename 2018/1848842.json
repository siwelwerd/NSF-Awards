 "awd_abstract_narration": "Student loan debt is frequently discussed as a creating a financial burden to underrepresented minority students (URM) leading to the lack of completing degrees at the undergraduate and graduate levels in engineering. This research project investigates a framework that describes students? perceptions about financial options for graduate school and how these options impact decisions to enter graduate school and the engineering workforce. The focus of this project is to leverage relationships with select Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI) and Predominately White Institutions (PWI) in the Midwest that were established from the implementation of an earlier graduate recruitment program. \r\n\r\nThe data collected from students of the participating universities includes decisions related to borrowing practices of student loans, accumulation of debt, decisions that impact career decisions related to debt, along with investigating students? perceptions and knowledge of financial options available related to their future as engineering graduate students. In addition, the researchers will investigate students, perceptions, knowledge and usage of financial options taken while they are an engineering graduate student and how these choices impact their decisions during graduate school. A mixed methods approach will be employed using quantitative and qualitative data to explore these issues from various perspectives. The expected outcomes from the analysis and the methods that are most effective at increasing the recruitment, retention and graduation of underrepresented minorities students will be disseminated through workshops and journals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In reviewing the literature, it was established that of necessary importance to the discipline is to educate URMs about financial capability and the lifelong impact it has on their future.&nbsp; Throughout the grant we offered workshops on Job Offer to Retirement, Capitalizing on Benefits and Financial Opportunities, Cognitive Bias in Financial Decision Making, Financial Capabilities, including how family history impacts financial decision-making. The following are definitions of the grant variables.</p>\n<p><strong>Financial Capability, Financial Literacy, Financial Wellness</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Financial      Capability Access, Behavioral Factors, Social Influences, Emotions,      (ABSiE)&nbsp;</strong>includes      financial literacy, but adds&nbsp;<strong>access</strong>&nbsp;<strong>to financial      services</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>behavioral</strong>&nbsp;<strong>factors</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>social      influences</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>emotions</strong>. It further involves capability      as both the&nbsp;<strong>ability to act</strong>&nbsp;(i.e., internal capacities      such as knowledge) and the&nbsp;<strong>opportunity to act</strong>&nbsp;(i.e.,      availability of products that are accessible, affordable, and financially      attractive, easy to use, and safe and reliable). It also includes finanical wellness.</li>\n<li><strong>Financial      Wellness CONTROL &amp; FREEDOM, (C &amp; F)&nbsp;</strong>is about a sense      of security and feeling as though you have enough money to meet your      needs. It's about&nbsp;<strong>being</strong>&nbsp;in control of your      day-to-day&nbsp;<strong>finances</strong>&nbsp;and having the&nbsp;<strong>financial</strong>&nbsp;freedom      to make choices that allow you to enjoy life.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Financial Capability</strong></p>\n<p>What is obvious from these definitions is that financial capability incorporates literacy and wellness. What is lacking is the social behavioral emotional family history of financial decision-making that has been deeply ingrained in the college students from their family of origin.&nbsp; The financial literature indicates that the most crucial components in understanding the college students financial decisions are based on their family's financial history and the behavioral cultural emotional impact it has on the college students financial decisions.

The PI with the support of the advisory board began the process of taking the outcomes and data gathered from the face-to-face conference to develop a CANVAS online Financial Capability and Wellness course to be offered free of cost, which included a research component to further examine and validate the preliminary findings of the first conference.&nbsp; The online course included pre and post measures that captured URMs responses to issues of financial capability, cultural intelligence, and familial financial decision-making. This provided the ability to gather pre and post data across the underrepresented minority students to expose, measure, and assess the impact of the variables that educated students about financial capability. The course remains active and is still in use by faculty and institutions free of cost to its participants.&nbsp; Data continues to be gathered through the online course.</p>\n<p>Two virtual conferences were developed through collaborative efforts between the Minority Serving Institutions in this grant.
