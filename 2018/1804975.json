 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fertilizer is used in various agricultural practices in order to increase the yield of crops to feed the growing US and global population. However, this fertilizer use has led to an excess of reactive nitrogen (N) in the environment that impacts water quality and reduces the commercial and recreational value of water bodies.  A majority of the N entering water bodies is from sources such as agriculture and stormwater runoff.  Woodchip bioreactors (WBRs) are a low-cost method to reduce N pollution from these sources, but they can also produce nitrous oxide (N2O), a major greenhouse gas and ozone-depleting substance.  This project will explore how to design and operate WBRs to reduce N pollution while minimizing the release of N2O as a waste product.  This project will provide training for an environmental engineering Ph.D. student and will provide research experiences for undergraduate research assistants in a STEM field.  Community outreach will be conducted through the Cayuga Lake Floating Classroom, a boat-based platform for engagement of K-12 students and community members on issues relating to New York Finger Lakes water resources and quality. If successful, this project will provide and refine a low-cost method for protecting the Nation's water security. \r\n\r\nEngineered and natural ecosystems at land-water boundaries are critical for the mitigation of nonpoint source N pollution, but there can be tradeoffs between biological removal of reactive N and N2O emissions. The goal of this project is to advance mechanistic understanding of couplings between water-air mass transfer and microbial transformation as controls of N2O fate in environments at terrestrial-aquatic interfaces, with WBRs chosen as a representative system for investigation.  The working hypothesis for this study is that water table fluctuations in porous media lead to entrapment of air phases in the pore structure, and that exchange of oxygen (O2) and N2O between the mobile water and immobile gas phase is a key influence on N2O accumulation inside and export from WBRs due to O2 inhibition of microbial N2O reduction kinetics and N2O partitioning into gas phases.  This project employs complementary techniques including dissolved gas and stable isotope tracer measurements and modeling, quantitative imaging, and next-generation sequencing to disentangle the effects of microbial consumption from gas transfer on aqueous N2O balances and to account for N2O behavior in two-phase (air-water) systems.  Specific tasks include: 1) Interpretation of dissolved gas tracer experimental data with nonequilibrium advection-dispersion-mass transfer models to quantify the impact of hydrologic regime on two-phase transport of N2O and O2 within porous media; 2) Evaluating the role of hydrologically-driven O2 exchange on inhibiting microbial N2O reduction via imaging of dissolved O2 and 15N isotope measurements; and 3) Evaluating the role of recently-identified \"clade II\" N2O-reducing microbes in regulating N2O fate in WBRs via metagenomic and gene expression analysis.  Results of this research will advance a unified mechanistic framework to integrate biotic and abiotic process controls on N2O emissions from aquatic-terrestrial interfaces, and will inform the design and hydrologic management of WBRs and other engineered systems for the interception of nonpoint source nitrogen.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Todd Walter, have completed the project ?Biotic and Abiotic Controls on Nitrous Oxide Dynamics in Denitrifying Bioreactors?.  This project has led to five manuscripts describing new insights into biogeochemical dynamics of nitrogen and carbon in woodchip bioreactor (WBR) systems, and has supported the training of two graduate and nine undergraduate students in environmental engineering.\n\n \n\nThe goals of this project were to elucidate how abiotic factors (e.g., water level fluctuations; hydraulic retention times) and biotic factors (e.g., the WBR microbial community; activity of nitrous oxide-reducing specialists) impact nitrous oxide (N2O) production in and emission from denitrifying WBRs.  N2O is the third most important greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide and methane, and N2O production during biological transformations of excess nitrogen (N) in fertilizers is an important source of N2O.  WBRs are nature-based technologies that are increasingly used for removing nitrate (NO3-) from stormwaters by stimulating microbial denitrification.  WBRs are cost-effective tools for water quality protection, but there is a risk that stimulating denitrification can enhance production of N2O. The practical application of this research is therefore to guide decision-making around the design and operation of WBR systems to promote NO3- removal without increasing N2O production.\n\n \n\nThe first major activity of this project was to evaluate the impacts of water level fluctuations on N transformations within WBRs.  It has been shown that oxic-anoxic cycling resulting from water level fluctuations can enhance NO3- removal rates by increasing the release of labile organic carbon from woodchips, but this could increase N2O emissions because the biological reduction of N2O to dinitrogen gas via NosZ enzymes can be inhibited by oxygen.  We used dissolved gas tracer tests in conjunction with ?CT imaging to show that rising water levels lead to entrapment of gas phases in the interior woodchip pore structure (Image 1).  While these trapped gas phases served as a reservoir for methane and led to large methane emissions when water levels fell, the impact of this process on N2O was relatively small because of N2O's greater solubility compared to methane. Laboratory flow-through reactor experiments further showed that drying-wetting cycles both increased NO3- removal rates and either decreased or had no effect on production of N2O (Image 2).  This positive outcome was linked to greater release of labile carbon in the aftermath of drying-wetting cycles.  The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool released from woodchips after air exposure had a smaller contribution of aromatic lignin residues compared to the DOC pool under continuously-flooded conditions, indicating that breakdown of lignin could be an important control on the release of bioavailable DOC from wood.\n\n \n\nA multi-omics sequencing analysis was then used to probe the biological processes driving enhanced NO3-removal rates after drying-wetting cycles. Drying-wetting cycles led to complementary expression of ligninolytic enzymes during oxygen exposure, followed by expression of denitrification enzymes once woodchips were re-flooded (Image 3).  In contrast, glycoside hydrolase enzymes involved in degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose sugars were not significantly affected by drying-wetting cycles.  This outcome further suggests that breakdown of lignin was the key step controlling release of bioavailable carbon that stimulates denitrifying activity. The activity of so-called \"atypical\" (or clade II) N2O reducers was stimulated around the oxic-anoxic transition.  Clade II N2O reducers are thought to be less sensitive to oxygen exposure, so the activity of microbes with these \"atypical\" nosZ genes may explain why the drying-wetting cycle did not increase N2O emissions.  These outcomes underscore the importance of lignin degradation processes to the overall performance of WBR systems, and have motivated further study on abiotic and biotic pathways for lignin degradation.\n\n \n\nThis project also supported a 3-year monitoring campaign of NO3- and N2O dynamics within a field-scale WBR.  These data were used as part of an undergraduate honors thesis project to develop a process-based model describing effects of climate warming on denitrification performance of WBR systems.  Longitudinal NO3- profiles were used to calibrate a temperature-response model for NO3- removal rates (Image 4).  This model was used with synthetic time series of precipitation and WBR discharge, produced with a stochastic weather generator, to show that NO3- load reductions will be improved under climate warming due to faster microbial activity.  This model-based result showed that WBRs are a climate-resilient tool for managing nonpoint source NO3- pollution.  \n\n \n\nThe Broader Impacts of this project included the training of two graduate students and nine undergraduate student researchers.  Five of the undergraduate students are now in STEM graduate programs.  Dr. Reid also participated in outreach activities with middle and high school educators in environmental and agricultural science from rural areas of Central New York State on the use of WBR technologies to reduce environmental impacts of agriculture (Image 5).  Educators toured the field-scale WBR system, discussed nature-based technologies with PI Reid, and have incorporated these topics in their curricula.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/28/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew C Reid"
