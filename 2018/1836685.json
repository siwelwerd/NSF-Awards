This conference is necessary since most work related to sexual misconduct has focused on student-student sexual harassment and there is limited research, knowledge-sharing, and expertise on faculty or staff sexual misconduct in institutions of higher education.  \r\n\r\nThis conference will be the first international forum to share resources, discuss barriers, and identify institutional practices on academic sexual misconduct. The outcomes of this conference include an open-access online repository of resources, conference proceedings, and recommendations for best practices for preventing and addressing faculty or staff sexual misconduct in institutions of higher education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
