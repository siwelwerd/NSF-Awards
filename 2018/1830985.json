 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase II project will expand on Phase I R&D work to build, test, and optimize a web-based software system for the classroom setting to complement the digital library app for home use developed in Phase I. This cost-effective system will further promote adult-mediated dialogic reading routines with children 0-7 years in age. Early exposure to dialogic reading has been shown to foster virtually all school and reading-readiness indicators - from cognitive and social-emotional development to vocabulary attainment and concepts about print. The new system also introduces foundational science knowledge and habits, such as the capacity to observe, experiment, and problem solve. The ever-widening education attainment and opportunity gaps between rich and poor result in diminished human potential and citizens unequipped for the demands of an information-based labor market. Investments in early childhood can prevent educational deficits, so a cost-effective system that coaches adults to engage children in a dialogic reading process can make a substantial contribution to ending school-readiness gaps - the precursor to persistent achievement gaps - and the cycle of economic and societal disadvantages they perpetuate. This project also addresses the urgent need to bolster the teaching of higher-order thinking skills by early education teachers. The market for early-education digital products is sizable and growing. Purchasers in this market are K-3 schools, preschools, Head Start, social- service agencies, and libraries, as well as individual families.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will build the technical capacity to augment and measure the growth of adult-led dialogic reading with children 0-7 years in age. The systems architecture and proprietary algorithms will produce a system that increases adult capacity for dialogic questioning and exploration by using the copyrighted, text-specific guidance embedded in the library. Metrics, children's work product, and online adult-learning modules aim to incentivize and build teacher/caregiver confidence, inform school leaders, and focus them on continued application of the dialogic process to other books and subjects. Augmentations to the content management system developed in Phase I will enable the sales, distribution, management, and evaluation of all product form factors. The secure data-sharing portal and dashboard built through this project will allow institutional clients to monitor and evaluate their programs. R&D will include collection of engagement metrics, including usage data (access to which is built into the digital library) and online surveys. The core innovation to be studied is whether this product enables adults of varying educational backgrounds to practice an intellectually ambitious reading and thinking method with their children.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Dialogic reading?having back-and-forth communication about stories that adults read with young children?has been shown to develop children?s language, cognitive and social-emotional capacities, and readiness for independent reading.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ReadAskChat system enables all the adults concerned with children?s intellectual growth and wellbeing?parents, teachers, and caregivers?to practice this&nbsp;foundational approach to literacy development. Because ReadAskChat is designed for children to learn in informal settings, childcare centers and primary schools use it as a centerpiece of their family-empowerment and engagement strategy and as a tool for maximizing the effectiveness of teacher aides when they work with individuals or small groups of students. The ReadAskChat library app is also available for purchase by libraries and individual families.</p>\n<p>The central tool in the ReadAskChat early-learning system is an enhanced picture-book library app with embedded on-demand conversation prompts that guide back-and-forth communication (dialogue). Users can switch between English and Spanish views. ReadAskChat conversation prompts are crafted at three developmental levels spanning the library?s 6-month to 6+-year age range. Prompts are designed to support open-ended<em>&nbsp;</em>exchanges<em>&nbsp;</em>about ideas and concepts; tap children?s curiosity, responses, and feelings; and advance their understanding and knowledge. The richly illustrated and thought-provoking ReadAskChat content, coupled with the ReadAskChat dialogic-reading method, particularly support early science learning and scientific practices and dispositions. These include observing closely, asking questions, hypothesizing, thinking creatively, and collaborating to make meaning. Additional prompts suggest ways to extend learning after reading through creative and exploratory activities linked to story themes, such as drawing, playacting, and hands-on projects.</p>\n<p>To engage a broad range of families in&nbsp;the enjoyable, yet intellectually ambitious, dialogic-reading experience, the ReadAskChat library features a signature character, Andie, who is depicted in six different ethnicities across seven stories. The digital medium of the library enables children to choose the version of Andie they want to see and talk about in each Andie story. Identification with characters in stories has been shown to increase children?s motivation to read.&nbsp;The name ?Andie? was chosen because it spans gender, ethnic identification, and language. Each&nbsp;Andie story humorously focuses on an early childhood milestone on the pathway to personal independence.&nbsp;The stories were written to facilitate family conversations&nbsp;that affirm children?s&nbsp;identity and pride in themselves and their families?central goals of early childhood education in a multicultural society.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The ReadAskChat system includes a data dashboard that enables schools to measure family engagement using multiple metrics, including time spent reading stories, use of the developmental prompts, weekly reading goals met, and other indicators. Aggregate data is useful for monitoring and reporting, while user-level data enables program managers to customize personal outreach and family-support programming.</p>\n<p>Rounding out the ReadAskChat system are complementary learning tools for adults to foster improved practice of dialogic reading and the resulting benefits for children. These tools are designed specific to adults? roles and include:</p>\n<p>+&nbsp;A robust digital Educators Guide comprising 20 short (1?3 minute) videos unpacking elements of the ReadAskChat method of dialogic reading.</p>\n<p>+ A five-part professional development course comprising (1) ?Curiosity and Science Learning,? (2) ?Talking about Stories with Children,? (3) ?Encouraging Imagination and Storytelling,? (4) ?Open-ended Conversation,? and (5) ?Advancing Equity and Inclusion through Family Reading and Conversation.?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>+ A series of 36 one-minute video tutorials for parents and caregivers to encourage the joys and benefits of reading with children; how to introduce children to early literacy and foundational science knowledge through reading; and how reading with children can meet their need for playful bonding and supportive early learning experiences. The videos are available in both in English and Spanish.</p>\n<p>The consistent learning approach practiced across home and school, along with the easy availability of the central tool?the ReadAskChat library app with embedded conversation prompts?thereby strengthens the quality and potential of young children?s early learning and sets them up for future school success. The pathway taken by ReadAskChat is shaped by its vision to democratize early learning by making a substantial home library available to all children and guiding them to read for meaning from the earliest age and explore ideas with others.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/11/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Alice&nbsp;Letvin</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1830985/1830985_10572900_1649731117111_High-ResREVOutcomesReportslides.001--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1830985/1830985_10572900_1649731117111_High-ResREVOutcomesReportslides.001--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"A bilingual picture-book library app\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1830985/1830985_10572900_1649731117111_High-ResREVOutcomesReportslides.001--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"A bilingual picture-book library app\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A bilingual picture-book library app for children 0-6 with stories, poems, songs, and folktales from around the world</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Read, Ask, Chat Ltd.</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Alice&nbsp;Letvin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">A bilingual picture-book library app</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1830985/1830985_10572900_1649731176074_High-ResREVOutcomesReportslides.002--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1830985/1830985_10572900_1649731176074_High-ResREVOutcomesReportslides.002--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Science features\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1830985/1830985_10572900_1649731176074_High-ResREVOutcomesReportslides.002--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Science features\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Science features specially chosen for young children to spark curiosity and prompt questions, reflection, and exploration</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Read, Ask, Chat Ltd.</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Alice&nbsp;Letvin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Science features</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1830985/1830985_10572900_1649731266248_High-ResREVOutcomesReportslides.003--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1830985/1830985_10572900_1649731266248_High-ResREVOutcomesReportslides.003--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Focus on early childhood milestones\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1830985/1830985_10572900_1649731266248_High-ResREVOutcomesReportslides.003--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Focus on early childhood milestones\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Andie Stories focus on early childhood milestones.
