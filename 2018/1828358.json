 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) Programs as well as the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).  Professor Rosalynn Quinones-Fernandez from Marshall University and colleagues Michael Norton, Aley El-Shazly, Iyad Hijazi and Sean McBride have acquired a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM).  A scanning electron microscope is an essential tool for the study of materials.  It focuses a beam of electrons at the sample.  The electrons interact and are scattered from the material to produce an image of the surface and its structure.  A field-emission SEM has a electron gun designed to provide very high resolution images.  This instrument upgrade improves image resolution and allow elemental analysis presently unavailable to researchers at Marshall.  The science enabled by the acquisition impacts areas of interest to the community (for example, Appalachian geology, insects endemic to West Virginia and forensic/environmental analyses).  Undergraduate research training and course instruction (100 students/year) involves largely regional students from Appalachia. The FESEM enhances at least five different annual outreach activities some of which target specifically minority and underrepresented students.  A researcher from West Virginia State University, a Historically Black College and University, and another researcher at the University of Charleston also benefit. \r\n\r\nThe proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels.  Research projects are ongoing to control surface properties of metal oxide nanoparticles and to investigate DNA based platforms for single molecule sensing nanostructures.  Other projects focus on atomistic modeling techniques to probe for nanomaterial with unique properties, and experiments on self-assembled nanoparticle membranes. Investigations are underway to model and simulate rigid and flexible body dynamics for soft robotic applications. Other investigations use geological sample imaging and analysis to understand the tectonic setting of metamorphic and igneous rocks of the southern Appalachians. Arachnid sensory morphology and characterization of sensory sensillae in the Tsetse fly are being studied.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The SEM instrument in this environment has its own dedicated space including sample preparation facilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br /> In the first 9 months of operation, 339 hours were logged by users on the SEM from the departments of Chemistry, Physics, Geology, and engineering. &nbsp;From dates staring 3/22/2020, Covid-19 caused MU campus lock down, so from 3/22/2019 through 6/12/2020 - no outside users were allowed to complete work with the SEM, only periodic checks on machine status were performed. &nbsp;&nbsp;Between June 2020 and July 2021, an additional 331 hours were logged on the SEM.&nbsp; Some major users of the instrument post covid lockdown were from MU chemistry, forensic science, physics, geology, biology, school of medicine, and engineering departments.&nbsp; Also, outside collaborations from Shawnee State University Geology Department, WVU Wood Sciences and Chemical Engineering, Rubberlite corp., Parabon Nanolabs, and BHE corp. used the instrument.&nbsp; Additionally, local high school students toured the facilities and were given demos (including virtual ones) of the SEM.&nbsp; During summers, young rising MU freshman students of First2 program (first generation college students) were able to have some hands-on experience with the instrument. The instrument was showcased for the West Virginia Science Olympiads, High School Physics Days, Appalachian section American Association of Physics Teacher fall meetings, and the WV Governor's STEM Institute.&nbsp;&nbsp; One manager/technician, 2 local WV residents, 4 industry customers, 11 graduate students, 19 PhD researchers, 50-60 undergraduate students including 5-7 proficient users, and quite literally hundreds of high school students via demonstrations have used the SEM. The instrument was used evenly between research and student training/courses such as Engineering Materials Lab, analytical chemistry, and forensic science analysis. For example, the SEM was used to analyze particle size and elemental composition of various types of fingerprint powders and compared them with certified fingerprint examiners for quality of pristine and diminish prints. This project was published by Quinones group at the Forensic Chemistry journal.</p>\n<p>The instrument was used for preliminary studies used to inform a proposal to the NSF for RII Track-1: Structural and Functional Connectomics: Innovations in Neuroscience through Advanced Data Science, which will involve combined electron microscopy and optical (fluorescence) microscopy. Use of the microscope by an undergraduate researcher, supported through an NSF infrastructure grant to characterize gold nanoparticles produced using nanosphere lithography, helped inform MU in the writing of the recently awarded NSF major instrumentation grant: Acquisition of a CytoViva system for multidisciplinary research and education in nanotechnology. Furthermore, 2 publications related to nanoparticle integration into silk fibers were supported by imaging experiments performed with the microscope.</p>\n<p>The instrument was also used for quantitative analysis of minerals from schists and gneisses from the Little Pine Garnet Mine (Blue Ridge Province, Appalachian Mountains).
