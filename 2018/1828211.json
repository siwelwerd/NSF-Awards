 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to West Chester University of Pennsylvania to support the acquisition of a confocal imaging and total internal reflection microscopy (TIRF) system. This imaging system will enable researchers at West Chester University and other regional institutions to perform cutting-edge research, provide transformative undergraduate research experiences, and promote STEM career advancement for trainees. The new system will ensure that faculty can expand their research focus, publish in high quality journals, and remain competitive for external funding opportunities. Importantly, the PIs on this grant are committed to training undergraduates in confocal/TIRF microscopy to ensure their students remain competitive in academic and professional fields. The new microscope will be integrated into independent undergraduate research projects, Biology or Physics lab courses, and outreach programs that focus on engaging underrepresented groups in the sciences.\r\n \r\nResearch projects enabled by the new confocal system include: (1) using in vivo approaches to study how folic acid, an essential vitamin, affects embryonic development, (2) biophysical in vitro studies on the folding of a novel nucleic acid structural motif in the presence and absence of molecular crowding, (3) discovering novel mechanisms of mitochondrial dynamics and cell adhesion in single-celled parasites, and (4) using ex vivo explant cultures to examine cell sorting behavior and changes in cell-cell adhesion during early embryonic development in Xenopus laevis. The imaging system will enhance faculty research capabilities, serve as a catalyst for future initiatives, and promote interdisciplinary and cross-institutional research among its broad user base. Data and analyses from these studies will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, presented at scientific meetings, and used in both educational and public outreach activities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
