 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Fifth International Workshop on Computational Network Biology: Modeling, Analysis, and Control (CNB-MAC 2018) will be held in Washington, D.C., August 29, 2018. The workshop will be organized in conjunction with the 9th Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Health Informatics (ACM-BCB 2018). CNB-MAC 2018 is a continuation of the first, second, third and fourth CNB-MAC workshops in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, which have been successfully organized in conjunction with ACM-BCB 2014 (in Newport Beach, CA), ACM-BCB 2015 (in Atlanta, GA), ACM-BCB 2016 (in Seattle, WA) and ACM-BCB 2017 (in Boston, MA) respectively. The continuing partnership with ACM-BCB will enhance the visibility of the workshop and attract researchers from various disciplines across engineering, computer science, statistics, biology, and medicine. This project will provide travel support for eight graduate students to attend CNB-MAC 2018, present their latest research findings, and actively engage in interactions with other researchers in the field.\r\n\r\nCNB-MAC 2018 aims to provide an international scientific forum for presenting recent advances in computational network biology and boost the awareness of the importance of rigorous mathematical modeling in transforming big biomedical data into reproducible and meaningful scientific knowledge. One of the missions of CNB-MAC that is of foremost importance is to foster next-generation scientists in the emerging field of computational network biology. The workshop aims to offer research talks to provide future research directions for participating graduate students and post-doctoral researchers, especially women and minorities. Utilizing this award, CNB-MAC 2018 will provide travel awards to encourage graduate and undergraduate students to participate in the workshop and present their latest research findings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
