  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop at the SIGPLAN\nInternational Conference on Functional Programming was held on Sunday,\nSeptember 23 in St. Louis, MO.\n\nThe workshop aims to encourage women and underrepresented minorities\nto join the programming language research community.  To achieve this\ngoal, PLMW seeks to attract participants who would not normally attend\nICFP.  This objective guided the selection of speakers and funded\nstudents.\n\nIn addition to the $15,000 in funding from the NSF, the workshop was\nsupported by SIGPLAN ($20K), an anonymous donor ($20K), and Google\n($1K).  This money was used solely to provide travel scholarships for\nstudents to attend the one-day mentoring workshop as well as ICFP, a\nthree-day premier research conference on programming languages and\nfunctional programming.  The conference was co-located with\nStrangeLoop, a large industrial programming conference held annually\nin St. Louis.\n\nThere were 45 attendees, of which 40 were students, and 28 were\nsupported with financial aid.  Of funded students, 50% reported being\nmembers of underrepresented minorities, 16.67% reported N/A.  36.67%\nreported their gender as female, 6.67% as nonbinary, and 6.67% as N/A.\n60% of funded students were from the USA (and NSF funds were only used\nfor US students).  In 2017, 24% of funded students self-reported as\nwomen, so 2018 represented a signficant improvement.  None of the\nscholarship recipients had previously been awarded support to attend a\nPLMW.\n\nThe program consisted of technical talks, mentoring talks, a social\nevent, and a panel discussion.  Speakers represented a diverse\ncollection of international researchers from both industry and\nacademia, with a wide range of seniority.  Of the technical and\nmentoring talks, 62.5% of the speakers were women or members of\nunderrepresented minorities.  To reach a broader audience beyond the\nin-person attendees, the program was video-recorded and made available\nonline.\n\nIn sum, the PLMW @ ICFP 2018 project was successful in cultivating a\nnew cohort of future programming languages researchers.  Scholarships\nwere awarded to a diverse range of students, who were able to attend a\nmentoring worskshop with technical and career-oriented talks.  They\nsocialized with eachother and accomplished academic and industrial\nresearchers.  Participants also were able to attend one of the premier\nresearch conference in programming languages: ICFP.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/02/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David Van Horn"
