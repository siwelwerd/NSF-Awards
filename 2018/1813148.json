 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project to address the impacts of Hurricanes Maria and Irma in Puerto Rico.  The overall goal is to understand how natural disturbances such as hurricanes impact plant biodiversity in tropical forests on the Island. Experiments and surveys before and after the hurricanes will be used to determine whether or not the hurricanes disrupted the process thought to be responsible for maintaining the incredible diversity of plant life there. Tropical rain forests are one of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth, and provide habitats for more than half of all plant and animal species, but we still do not fully understand how such immense diversity is maintained or how human and natural disturbances affect it. One well-known hypothesis predicts that species-specific natural enemies (disease-causing microbes) reduce the competitive ability of some trees, thereby allowing other trees to grow and survive, but detailed tests of this hypothesis are few. This project will test the hypothesis in various ways, by examining whether tree and soil microorganism distribution patterns are in sync with one another, and whether such interactions were altered by massive inputs and mixtures of leaf litter from recent hurricanes Irma and Maria.  The studies will take place through the auspices of the Luquillo Long-term Ecological Research (LTER) site in El Yunque. The intellectual and technical capacity building for students and researchers in Puerto Rico and Oregon will directly benefit goals of improving the competitiveness of the United States in research, as well a broadening participation in science.\r\n\r\nThe Janzen-Connell hypothesis is one of the main hypotheses evoked to explain how tree diversity in tropical forests is maintained. To explicitly test the underlying assumption that trees have unique microbial signatures in the soils surrounding them, the DNA of fungi and bacteria will be sequenced from soils sampled at 0-10m within the bases of nine target trees before and after the hurricane in the 16-ha Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot, which has a gradient of human land use. To determine whether or not the strength of Janzen-Connell effects was altered, and how land use legacies interact with these processes, seedling transplant experiments will be conducted, and pathogens and mycorrhizal fungi will be isolated and used for further experiments. In combination with this team's extensive pre-hurricane data, the following hypotheses will be tested: H1: Sudden inputs of mixed leaf litter and debris from hurricane-force winds attenuate microbial signatures of canopy trees, which weakens Janzen-Connell effects due to diluted species-specific pathogen loads near canopy trees; H2: Mycorrhizal fungal colonization, richness, and diversity decrease following hurricane disturbance due to a lack of photosynthetic input from defoliated trees, making seedlings more vulnerable to generalized pathogen attack and nutrient limitation; H3: Recent human land use interacts with hurricane disturbance to further impede microbially-mediated coexistence processes.  Since human disturbance is pervasive in all tropical forests, and hurricane disturbance is increasing in intensity across a wide range of tropical areas from the Caribbean to the Asian tropics, results of this study will have generalizable implications for predicting tropical forest dynamics, and may provide insight into some of the unexplained variation observed in studies of forest recovery.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Hurricane Maria was a Category 5 storm that hit Puerto Rico in September of 2017. Prior to the hurricane impact, our team had collected soils from nine target tree species across an area of forest that was split into low land use and high land use. The high land use area of the forest had a history of agriculture that was abandoned approximately 80 years ago. This set up allowed us to examine the impact of coupled agricultural and hurricane disturbance on tree-microbe relationships for groups of microbes important for tree survival and growth. After Hurricane Maria, we collected soils from the same trees to see how microbial associations changed. We also set up a seed experiment to disentangle the factors associated with hurricane damage: notably light and soil modifications. We found that trees had unique microbial signatures associated with them, but that these signatures were distinct across the land use gradient. However, even in the high land use area of the forest, microbial communities were distinct in the soils surrounding individual tree species. These results indicate that human land use may cause legacy effects that shift microbes into alternate stable communities that may not fully recover to pre-disturbance conditions. We also found more pathogens in the litter on the forest floor compared to the mineral soil, demonstrating how homogenization of the litter following a hurricane may disrupt tree specific signatures for this functional group of microbes. Seeds in the high land use area of the forest also suffered more natural enemy damage and died more often. We also found that many seeds were unviable after the hurricane possibly causing a lag in forest regeneration. Together these results suggest that hurricanes cause massive disruptions in forest dynamics and that areas with legacies of human land use such as agriculture may suffer more severe effects of hurricanes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/02/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Krista&nbsp;Mcguire</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
