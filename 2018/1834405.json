The agenda includes breakouts, panel discussions, lightning talks, and poster sessions to encourage intellectual engagement across the programs, thus setting conditions for new projects and multi-disciplinary activities. The meeting will produce a report that highlights outcomes for broader dissemination and sharing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
