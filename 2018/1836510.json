 "awd_abstract_narration": "Promoting students' science learning and retaining students in STEM fields requires educational experiences that help them grow as engaged and ethical citizens who are also innovative scientists.  This project aims to provide these educational experiences by engaging students in scientific research that intersects with issues of interest to the local community.  Specifically, this project will involve university and community college students in researching a locally important biological resource, Boulder's historic apple trees. In the mid-1800s, there were thousands of diverse apple varieties in the United States. When the apple industry settled on a handful of varieties to promote worldwide, the rest of the varieties were forgotten. Across Boulder County today, these forgotten apple trees are still growing in residents' yards or in public parks. However, they are beginning to die, and the community is at risk of losing this important ecological, genetic, and historic resource. This project will engage students in research projects to study and preserve historic apple trees, enabling the students to use their scientific knowledge to serve their community. This project has the potential to increase the engagement of tomorrow's scientists in civic action that will serve citizens of the United States. \r\n\r\nThis project will develop and study the impact of course-based undergraduate research experiences that incorporate place-based learning, thus creating community-relevant research opportunities for students.  Students will engage in research projects to map the location of apple trees in Boulder County, characterize how these trees interact with the local ecology, identify which genetic varieties are currently growing, and graft the trees to preserve these genetic and cultural resources. It is expected that participation in this research will help students develop a sense of belonging to their local communities and to their scientific communities, will increase their civic engagement and civic efficacy, and will improve institution-community relationships. Both the scientific and educational goals of this project will be assessed to track progress, discover the processes by which students develop into civically-minded scientists, and prepare this model for broad dissemination. Among the broader impacts of this program are its potential to increase the civic engagement of future scientists, improve students' sense of belonging to and persistence in STEM, and enhance how institutions of higher education can serve the broader good.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In those four years, the project team consisting of&nbsp; STEM educators, STEM education researchers, ecologists, and many graduate and undergraduate students accomplished many goals in line with the projects? broad aims to 1) design and implement ?power-of-place? course-based undergraduate research experiences (PoP-CUREs) in which students would engage with the community and elements of their local environment to conduct locally impactful research, 2) engage the community collaboratively with university supported ecological research with potential for positive local impacts, 3) assess the efficacy of our PoP-CUREs, 4) ensure the sustainability of PoP-CUREs at CU Boulder, and 5) disseminate our PoP-CURE model.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>This project broadly aimed to advance knowledge and innovate in the area of STEM (specifically Biology) education by proposing and testing a new CURE model. We combined prior research done on CUREs that indicated which instructional elements are necessary for CUREs to have positive impacts on student learning with both theory and empirical work done on community-engaged research and place-based instruction. Using these frameworks as guides, we designed a learning experience that is a) research focused, b) place-based, d) interdisciplinary, and c) collaborative. Our learning experiences leveraged the Boulder Apple Tree Project, a project dedicated to the preservation of unique historic apple cultivars via grafting of historic trees, surveying tree health and disease distributions, and developing a better understanding of the ecosystem services offered by orchards. In collaboration with this project, students in our courses and summer bridge experiences worked to understand how the trees contribute to local communities and to discover how we can best preserve and care for these trees for years to come. The semester-long PoP-CURE courses and two-week bridge programs were successful in engaging a few hundred students from CU Boulder and Front Range Community College in this work. With three PoP-CURE iterations and two bridge iterations, we were able to make adaptations&nbsp; serving to vet this new model of instruction for use in Biology courses at other 2 and 4-year institutions.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>In effort to more fully and comprehensively understand the outcomes of these experiences, our team developed a new instrument to test whether the courses were likely to contribute to students? future </span><span>scientific civic engagement </span><span>or their engagement with local communities to improve community well being </span><span>using their science skills</span><span>.

As mentioned, several hundred students have participated in the PoP-CURE courses and bridge programs and benefited from the outcomes of developing research skills and engaging with local communities. In this work, we were intentional in recruiting students from underrepresented groups in STEM. Students from these groups stand to gain more from these types of research experiences than their well-represented peers. Furthermore, this project has seeded additional efforts to involve students from across the Rocky Mountain Region in apple preservation. With the support of an NSF IUSE Level 2 grant, we are now expanding engagement in PoP-CUREs to other institutions, including several community colleges and minority serving institutions across the region. The next phase of the project will broaden the impact that these courses have. Finally, our project?s main goal of increasing students? ability and confidence to engage with their communities using their scientific knowledge and skill has potential for broad and far-reaching impacts. If we do achieve our aim of increasing students? future scientific civic engagement, we may have impacts beyond the classroom within students? own communities that are an indirect result of this work. While results of future scientific civic engagement cannot easily be tracked or characterized, it is our hope that this work will contribute to the development of the next generation of civically engaged and capable scientists. </span></p>\n<div><span>Photo credit: Kika Tuff, Impact Media Lab</span></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/27/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Lisa&nbsp;A&nbsp;Corwin</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1836510/1836510_10576143_1674836004158_LisaCorwin_IML2021-02371--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1836510/1836510_10576143_1674836004158_LisaCorwin_IML2021-02371--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"EBIO Research In Progress\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1836510/1836510_10576143_1674836004158_LisaCorwin_IML2021-02371--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"EBIO Research In Progress\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Apple Project data collection.
