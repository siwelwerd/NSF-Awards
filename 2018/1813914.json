  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course on: Frontiers &amp; Techniques in Plant Science\n\nJune 30 - July 20, 2023\n\nThe Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory summer course on Frontiers and Techniques in Plant Science (FTPS) has been continuously taught with funding by the National Science Foundation since its inception 30 years ago. Topics have covered a wide variety of plant systems, reflecting current research priorities in many US and international laboratories and the expansion of genome-enabled plant species and technologies.  The course has allowed students to take advantage of a wealth of technological resources applied to biological processes that are unique to plants.  It is designed to fulfill a continuing demand within the plant science community for training in molecular and genetic approaches.  The course teaches state of the art techniques to scientists already involved in plant research so that they can apply these technologies to their own future research and introduces scientists familiar with microbial, animal or plant systems to cutting-edge research carried out by top plant biologists.\n\n The 2023 course consisted of a rigorous lecture series, a hands-on laboratory, and informal workshops on a variety of research tools.  Speakers provided both an overview of a broad area of expertise and an in-depth discussion of their work.  These speakers included experts in a variety of plant species, research questions and applications, and brought a range of technical expertise to the course.  The laboratory sessions provided intensive training in modern techniques in plant biology and reinforced the lessons learned in lectures.  The lecture topics ranged from plant anatomy to phylogenetics, aspects of morphogenesis and development, plant-environment interactions, hormone signaling, metabolism, cell wall structure, and plants in the context of bioenergy.  The experimental approaches that corresponded to these topics included microscopy to examine gene expression, transformation techniques, isolation of actively translated transcripts through ribosome purification followed by quantitative PCR, biochemical fractionation of proteins, proteomics, and metabolite profiling.  In recognition of the increasing importance of computational methods in plant biology, modules on phylogenetics, QTL mapping, machine vision, and the use of statistical methods for global analysis of transcript, protein, and metabolite levels were included.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/29/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David J Stewart"
