 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. Johnson C. Smith University will develop and implement polymer chemistry courses and research opportunities into the curriculum of the Department of Natural Sciences & Mathematics. Exposure to polymer science and widely used characterization instrumentation will better prepare undergraduates to pursue employment and graduate studies in an area that has strong employment and entrepreneurial opportunities, but has low representation of minorities. \r\n\r\nThe overall goal of the program is to design an upper level research course centered on the synthesis, characterization and application of synthetic and natural polymers. Specific project objectives include 1) the development of a Research in Polymer Science course that will introduce students to polymer science through student-led, faculty-advised research projects, 2) establish collaborations with local polymer-based industries through participation in project programming and 3) implement a Thermal Analysis Certificate program to increase the employability of JCSU students as technicians/scientists. Most importantly, this project will increase the institution's research capacity, thus providing additional opportunities for students to participate in active research projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Smith University's lower/upper-level Chemistry Courses\n\nDirector/PI: Tracy Brown-Fox\n\nFederal Award ID: 1818708\n\nIn 2018, Johnson C. Smith University (JCSU) received a $400 K NSF HBCU &ndash; UP Target Infusion Project (TIP) award entitled \"Innovating the Research Educational Experiences in Johnson C. Smith University's lower/upper-level Chemistry Courses.\" This project was intentional with the primary goal of increasing undergraduate research experiences for JCSU STEM students while infusing the chemistry curriculum with enviable, exciting undergraduate research projects and developing a new undergraduate polymer research course.  This was accomplished through the procurement of thermal analysis instrumentation worth 340K leading to the establishment of a Thermal Analysis Instrumentation (TAI) suite.  This addition led to over 50 students participating in undergraduate research experiences through the National Science Foundation Student Minigrant Research Program (NSF SMRP), faculty-mentored student minigrants, and course undergraduate research experiences (CUREs).  Moreover, nearly 60 students earned technical certificates to add to their resumes, thereby making them marketable for future employment in STEM-related fields.  Much of the success with the outcomes of this project was accomplished through ingenuity, creativity, and perseverance. \n\nModernizing Teaching Laboratories with High-Tech and Powerful Instrumentation: The monies from this grant were used effectively and efficiently to secure modern-day, high-tech instrumentation to support undergraduate research via coursework in chemistry courses, individual research projects, or group research projects. The investment into the research infrastructure has made JCSU competitive with surrounding research universities, mainly predominately white universities (PWIs), to offer research opportunities to students looking for hands-on experiences.  The establishment of the TAI suite has led to students receiving technical certificates via the TAI certificate program.  Furthermore, it gives the College of STEM the ability to leverage its research infrastructure to attract outside businesses to work with and invest in our students. Most importantly, the TAI certificate program is designed to ensure that future students will continue to earn certificates through their coursework.\n\nIncreasing Undergraduate Research Opportunities: The grant afforded students to participate in faculty-mentored undergraduate research experiences via faculty-mentored student research minigrants and/or course undergraduate research experiences (CUREs). A total number of 10 students participated in faculty-mentored student research minigrants and 15 students participated in CUREs.  However, through ingenuity and re-imagination of offering undergraduate research experiences, the NSF SMRP made research opportunities more diverse, frequent, accessible, and flexible. As a result of NSF SMRP, over 30 students participated in undergraduate research experiences and nearly 50% of those students returned to the program to complete another research experience.  This was accomplished by relaxing the requirements (&lt;3.0 GPAs) for students, and any student who wanted an opportunity to conduct research was able to do so in the NSF SMRP.  Also, they were paid research stipends, amounting to a total of $64, 200. The goals of NSF SMRP were 1) to increase the number of students participating in research, 2) to train students on high-tech, modern-day instrumentation, and 3) to graduate more STEM students with at least one undergraduate research experience on their resumes.   \n\nReimagining Undergraduate Research Mentorship: The pandemic created a perfect opportunity to reimagine undergraduate research and its delivery to students. As universities opened back up social distancing and wearing face masks was the new normal for typical faculty-student mentorship.  Thus, marrying ingenuity with convenience, the NSF SMRP research course was created in the learning management system (LMS) CANVAS.  This online research course was readily accessible and efficient in delivering undergraduate research opportunities for students seeking research opportunities.  The course was a \"one-stop\" shop for delivering undergraduate projects with guidelines, virtually.  In-person meetings were limited and only necessary instrumentation training sessions for recipients.  The guidelines were likened to a car navigation system that guided students from the start of the project to the end.  These guidelines were the replacement for the multiple typical in-person faculty-student meetings.  This delivery method through CANVAS streamlined the process that was usually associated with faculty-mentored, student-led undergraduate research experiences.  Furthermore, the NSF SMRP research course became a predominantly student-led research program by design, and it has proven to be the most sustainable and efficient.\n\nPromoting Student Autonomy and Leadership &amp;Improving Student Marketability Beyond Graduation: Students who participated in the NSF SMRP had to set goals for themselves to complete their projects in a timely manner.  The NSF SMRP recipients learned skills in experiential design, delegating tasks, leadership, and communication to be successful in the program.  Other essential skills included sample preparation, data collection &amp; organization, data analysis, and technical writing.  Students learned to rely on one another to solve any problems with their projects instead of seeking outside.  Some students emerged as leaders while other students were good supporting members.  These transferrable skills make student participants in NSF SMRP more marketable to future employers in either STEM or non-STEM fields. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/01/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Tracy Brown-Fox"
