The conference attracts new and original research, and some of the top data mining researchers from the U.S., and abroad to discuss their latest. The conference covers advancement in research in many topics relevant to data mining that include statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition, databases, data warehouses, data visualization, knowledge-based systems and high-performance computing. The proceedings of the ICDM conference will be distributed through the IEEE Computer Society and will be available through the IEEE Explore Digital Library.\r\n\t\r\nBesides having a strong technical program, the conference features workshops in emerging topics on data mining, tutorials, panels, demos, and the PhD Forum. The PhD Forum is designed to provide an interactive environment in which PhD students can meet, exchange their ideas and experiences both with peers and with senior researchers from the data mining community. The ICDM organizers recognize the importance of recruiting, engaging and retaining students in data mining research given the importance of this topic in emerging field of data science. The conference participation enables the students to share their original research results with their peers and experts, learn about new algorithms and tools in the field of data mining, and obtain experience with application of data mining for various transdisciplinary problems. Participation of U.S.-based students is critical to developing U.S. competitiveness of future workforce in science and technology.",
