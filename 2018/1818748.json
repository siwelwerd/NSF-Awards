 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the past two decades, implicit solvent models are of tremendous importance to the biomolecular\r\nmodeling community with thousands of exemplary applications in the literature due to their low\r\ncomputational cost and relatively high accuracy. The accuracy of implicit solvent models depends\r\non the geometric description of the solute-solvent interface and the solvent dielectric profile that\r\nis defined near the molecules. Successful implementations of the proposed model in this project with\r\nrealistically generated solute-solvent smooth boundaries will greatly improve the accuracy and\r\nefficiency of these implicit solvent models. This investigation will be directly integrated into existing\r\nimplicit solvent software and visualization packages to ensure extensive usages by an established\r\nuser community of researchers in chemistry, physics, and biology. Moreover, the proposed work will  present \r\nan unconventional computational method for diffuse interface models applied to spatial multiscale modeling \r\nin mathematical biology. Successful development of the proposed work will become a valuable computational\r\ntool for studying the transition between regions described by discrete and continuum models. \r\nThe outcome will have potential impacts across a wide range of scientific fields such as multiscale\r\nmodeling in cancer research and drug design. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop a novel computational method for diffuse interface models of\r\nimplicit solvation of biomolecules. The computational approach will be mathematically rigorous and\r\ncomputationally efficient to generate physically realistic solute-solvent smooth boundaries by free\r\nenergy minimization. To this end, an innovative construction is proposed to transform a variational\r\nproblem subject to bounded admissible functions into an equivalent unconstrained problem so\r\nthat the traditional Euler-Lagrange Equation can be applied directly. This new computational\r\nformulation will be implemented with advanced computational algorithms to ensure their accuracy,\r\nstability, and efficiency, and it will be validated by several common biomolecular modeling tasks.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
