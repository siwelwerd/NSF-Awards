 "awd_abstract_narration": "Continental rifting is a fundamental part of the plate tectonic cycle, and lies at the nexus of geothermal and mineral resources, seismic and volcanic hazards, and geophysical research. Substantial variation between rift zones worldwide indicates that continental breakup is dictated by a complex interplay of tectonic forces and geologic characteristics. Therefore, it is critical to understand the full context for a rifting system, from the highly extended rift center that houses volcanoes and earthquakes to the flanks of the rift, where extension is just beginning and pre-rift structures are still evident. The Main Ethiopian Rift segment of the East Africa rift is perhaps the world's most iconic continental rift. New imaging techniques will be applied to recently acquired seismic data spanning this rift to reveal the 3-D internal structure of this rift and shed light on key geologic processes in this and other rifts around the world. This project involves collaboration with scientists from Ethiopia and provides career opportunities for early career researchers under-represented in the Earth sciences. \r\n\r\nDetailed imaging of the internal structure of an entire rift system, from flank to axis, can shed light on the mechanics, controls, and time-dependency of extensional processes in the Main Ethiopian Rift. Recently acquired data from a wide aperture broadband seismic array is critical in sampling pre-rifted structure that may control rift dynamics, as well as to image the geodynamically crucial transitional zone between rift axis and flank.  Our tomographic technique entails simultaneous inversion of P and S receiver functions with Rayleigh wave phase velocities within a Bayesian framework; this approach is ideally suited to capture lithologic/seismic discontinuities, the presence of melt, and complex 3-D rift structure. Anisotropic body wave inversions and splitting studies will help constrain the locus of melt as well as the time-integrated strain history of this rift. This project utilizes seismic data from a number of previous projects in the region, combining the strengths of multiple deployments to achieve a synoptic understanding.  Collaboration with Ethiopian scientists and supporting the early careers of under-represented researchers are among the broader impacts of this project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Simplistically, geoscientists often treat this rift as highly focused, because the MER has a narrow rift axis as observed from surface faulting and volcanoes. This project set out to explore the transition between the MER and the rest of Ethiopia to the west, where an array of new seismometers provided opportunities to see into the Earth's crust and mantle away from the heavily-studied rift axis. To complicate things, the MER runs through highlands and thick crust caused by igneous activity that may relate to rift initiation. We set out to explore whether the African tectonic plate away from the rift has been modified, and how it transitions from off-rift to rift character.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We used four main measurement techniques to look at the Earth's interior structure, with the goal of making 3-D maps of rock properties to understand variations in temperature, composition, and where there is melt beneath the surface. Since we cannot access these properties directly, we rely on proxies - measurements of rock's elastic and anelastic properties. One technique (\"Receiver functions\") tells us about sharp gradients in elastic properties with depth. Another measurement (\"Rayleigh wave phase velocity\") tells us about average elastic properties as a function of depth. Together, these two techniques combine for high-resolution profiles of mantle and crustal wavespeeds. We interpreted these profiles in terms of temperature and melt content, and found that although there is an expected large difference between the rift and the off-rift, two unexpected features stand out: 1) even the off-rift regions are very unusual in a global context ? they are extremely hot, and may therefore be easier to rift; 2) there is an isolated swath of the off-rift region, running parallel to the rift, that seems to be extra slow, and intermediate between off and on-rift. This swath is coincident with limited volcanic features. We hypothesize that this swath may be the locus of a new, parallel focus of rifting. The development of such distributed extension flouts the assumptions of models often used to explain the supposed narrow-ness of the MER. Although the MER is \"narrow\" at the surface, at depth it is anything but.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The last two techniques we use measure rocks' wavespeeds and the rate of decay of seismic energy (\"body wave travel times\" and \"t-star\"). We turn these into 3-D images of elastic and anelastic properties: seismic wavespeeds and attenuation, respectively. The reason this is so useful is that both of these properties are dependent on several input factors - temperature, melt, crystal sizes, composition, and others. Observations of just one property can leave us ignorant about tradeoffs between these factors. Measuring these two complementary properties simultaneously allows us to exploit their slightly different dependence on those input factors, to tease apart those tradeoffs. This represents the first time anyone has co-located measurements and 3-D images of wavespeeds and attenuation for a continental rift. The results are partly clear, and partly mystifying. We clearly see (consistent with the above) that the western margin of the rift is extremely broad: this corroborates our finding that the rift is not narrow at depth, and it seems to have both very high temperatures and high melt fractions. We may even be observing shoots of melt eating upwards into the plate, corroding its strength from the bottom-up. The mystifying part is that attenuation does not seem to agree with wavespeed in a simple way. Geoscientists have wondered in the past about how exactly melt affects attenuation. Most models argue that it should enhance attenuation and suppress wavespeed. Our results cast some doubt on that 1-1 relationship; it may be that (for reasons we do not understand), abundant melt in this region is indeed suppressing wavespeeds but is not affecting attenuation very much. This result provides fodder for experimental rock mechanicists to further explore the relationship between melt and attenuation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/29/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Zachary&nbsp;C&nbsp;Eilon</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1723170/1723170_10543625_1693351057912_RESULTS_TOMO_zslice_wvpvs_AB--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1723170/1723170_10543625_1693351057912_RESULTS_TOMO_zslice_wvpvs_AB--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Tomography vertical slice\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1723170/1723170_10543625_1693351057912_RESULTS_TOMO_zslice_wvpvs_AB--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Tomography vertical slice\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Vertical slices through the velocity and attenuation tomography models in central MER, showing percentage deviations in properties.
