 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project establishes the NSF Industry/University Collaborative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Big Learning (CBL) to accelerate innovation and impact of Deep Learning in various embedded applications. The vision is to create intelligence towards intelligence-driven society. Through catalyzing the fusion of diverse expertise from the consortium of faculty members, students, industry partners, and federal agencies, CBL seeks to create state-of-the-art deep learning methodologies and technologies and enable intelligent applications, transforming broad domains, such as business, healthcare, Internet-of-Things, and cybersecurity. This timely initiative creates a unique platform for empowering our next-generation talents with cutting-edge technologies of societal relevance and significance. \r\n\r\nThe University of Missouri at Kansas City (UMKC) site focuses on the deep learning in embedded systems for mobile and IoT applications. It is based on a framework called DeepLite for deep learning model compression and acceleration that can fit cutting edge deep learning capabilities in embedded systems with very limited computing, storage, communication and power capabilities. DeepLite allows embedded deep learning model training and compression for power, storage, computation complexity tradeoffs with learning performances for targeted embedded applications like immersive content capture, depth and action sensing, visual surveillance, next gen image and video compression and communication. \r\n\r\nCBL is expected to make wide ranging and long lasting impact to machine learning algorithm, system and application research, accelerating deep learning technology innovation and adoption in the real world, enable transformative new capabilities and new applications in all aspect of society, from education, medicine, media, to security and defense. CBL seamlessly integrates innovation, engineering education, technology business incubation, and community engagement. It facilitates closer interactions and cross pollination of ideas between academia and industry, broaden the research horizon for faculties and students,  while help shrink the time to impact and time to market of new technology. \r\n\r\nThe center repository will be hosted at http://nsfcbl.org. The data, code, documents will be well organized and maintained on the CBL servers for the duration of the center for more than five years and beyond. The internal code repository will be managed by GitLab. After the software packages are well documented and tested, they will be released and managed by popular public code hosting services, such as GitHub and Bitbucket.",
