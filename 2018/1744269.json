 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earth's magnetotail is the elongated portion of Earth's magnetic field formed on the night (or anti-sunward) side of the magnetosphere. This region is characterized by energy release that accompanies the reconfiguration (aka 'reconnection') of oppositely directed magnetic field lines. In the process, magnetic field energy is converted to plasma kinetic and thermal energy. The researchers will perform computer simulations to investigate the roles played by several types of magneto-hydrodynamical instabilities. This work will contribute to fundamental knowledge of plasma discontinuities and magnetic reconnection. These processes are pertinent not only to Earth,  but also to solar, planetary and stellar magnetospheres, as well as fusion devices and laboratory reconnection experiments. Knowledge derived from the work will advance understanding and modeling of space weather. Educational benefits will be provided in the form of hands-on research training for student summer interns.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
