 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative award funds the research activities of Professors Sebastian Franco and V.P. Nair at the City College of the City University of New York, and Professor Daniel Kabat at Lehman College of the City University of New York. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to further our understanding of nature at its most fundamental level, tackling questions in quantum field theory (QFT), gravity, and string theory.  Professors Franco, Nair, and Kabat will study the dynamics of QFT's in various dimensions, a topic of fundamental importance since QFT's provide a general framework through which physicists study subjects ranging from the behavior of the elementary particles to the physics of condensed matter.   Professors Franco, Nair, and Kabat will approach this problem from multiple perspectives, including the use of string-theoretic tools. They will also investigate the entanglement of quantum states --- a mysterious phenomenon that has bearing on diverse topics such as quantum computing and strange new phases of matter.  As such, research in these directions advances the national interest by pushing forward the boundaries of fundamental science within the United States. This research also has significant broader impact components.  Professors Franco, Nair, and Kabat will actively involve undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral associates in their research, providing ideal training to junior physicists entering research in this field.  This research project will also strengthen the close collaboration between City College and Lehman College. Maintaining a joint research program has had a positive impact on attracting students to these research areas, especially from minority and underrepresented groups which constitute a large part of the student body at both colleges.  Professors Franco, Nair, and Kabat will also continue and expand a broad outreach program that they established in recent years at City College, building partnerships with several local institutions which serve underprivileged populations. \r\n\r\nMore technically, the key objectives of this research can be organized into three areas:  1) Quantum field theory, its applications and variants including the Casimir effect, entanglement, noncommutative geometry and gravity, and infrared behavior of non-abelian gauge theories;  2)  The dynamics and dualities of QFT's in various dimensions, and development and application of novel brane constructions for these purposes;  and 3) String-theoretic investigations into nonperturbative D-brane instanton effects, reconstruction of bulk physics in the AdS/CFT correspondence, and holographic cosmology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGravity is both the simplest and most familiar, and the most involved and mysterious, of all the fundamental forces in nature.\n\n\nGravity is surely the most familiar force as it's the one we experience in everyday life.  At first it seems pretty simple, since in everyday life gravity can be summarized by saying that all objects fall to earth with the same constant acceleration.\n\n\nExtrapolating to large distances Einstein found that gravity can be understood as the bending of space and time.  This means gravity controls the overall shape and growth of our universe, and it opens up the possibility of regions (black holes) where gravity is so strong that even light can't escape.\n\n\nExtrapolating to small distances we know that gravity must merge into the quantum world.  How it does this is a mystery.  A particularly promising approach to reconciling gravity and quantum mechanics developed out of string theory.  It is known as the \"AdS/CFT correspondence\".\n\n\nThe research funded by this award sought to improve our understanding of gravity through a series of theoretical investigations.  For the most part we focused on the AdS/CFT correspondence.  One significant development was a new understanding of how space and time arise from the correspondence.  The correspondence can be set up using an \"operator algebra\" -- a sort of generalization of the familiar rules of algebra to a new and more complicated setting -- and in this approach the shape of space and time captures certain aspects of the structure of the operator algebra.\n\n\nMost of the research focused on the AdS/CFT correspondence.  For example we carried out mathematical work to understand the structure of the algebra better, and we showed how a \"spin-1/2\" particle like an electron can be described using the correspondence.\n\n\nIn addition to the AdS/CFT correspondence, we explored several other aspects of gravity.  In particular we explored the interplay of gravity with dark matter.  We know that most matter in our galaxy is invisible or \"dark\".  Although it emits no light, dark matter should still feel the pull of gravity.  It should be attracted to the black hole at the center of our galaxy.  We studied this theoretically and developed a quite general understanding of the way in which a particular type of \"axion-like\" dark matter builds up around (and falls into) a black hole.\n\n\nThis award had significant broader impacts, in particular in education and training.  Three postdocs and two graduate students were involved in the research, receiving valuable training and experience as a result.  There was outreach beyond the scientific community as well, including guest lectures at college classes and public talks at Bronx institutions.  By providing students with exposure to advanced scientific research, especially at a minority-serving institution like Lehman College, this award helped develop a broad and deep interest in science that will pay dividends for years to come.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/19/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel Kabat"
