WiSec is one of the leading international conferences on the security and privacy of wireless communications and mobile networks, attracting students, researchers and industry specialists from all over the world. Participation in conferences such as WiSec is an extremely important part of graduate students' research and career development, providing the opportunity for them to present their own work, attend panel and keynote speech sessions, interact with peers and senior researchers, and exposure to leading edge work in the fields of wireless networks security and mobile privacy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
