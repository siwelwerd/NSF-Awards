 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the travel of two University of Iowa (UI) undergraduate students and two UI faculty lecturers to attend an international undergraduate student sounding rocket field school called CaNoRock  that is a week-long workshop based upon collaboration between the Andoya Space Center and seven Canadian and Norwegian Universities. The two UI professors will participate in the development of the geospace curriculum at the Andoya Rocket Range by teaching regular classes and helping to support the student rocket experiment preparations. In addition to these lectures, the workshop would focus upon hands-on student rocket activities to help train students while introducing them to the possibilities of graduate study or the prospects of a career in the aerospace industry. The primary project objectives are aimed at increasing awareness of US educational opportunities for space research activities and experimental rocket research. Eventually, it is expected that this collaboration would be developed into a more extensive activity that would include participation by students from other US educational institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
