 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nodal sets (or zeros) of vibrational modes of plates and membranes have been fascinating scientists for centuries -- early experimental observations were mentioned in the works of da Vinci, Galileo, and Hooke. Nodal sets can reveal important information about the structure of the underlying vibrating body. The mathematics of the nodal sets of eigenfunctions in dimension one (for a vibrating string) is well understood; however, in dimensions two and higher even some very simple questions remain unanswered. The subject of this research project is a network of one-dimensional strings, also known as a metric graph. The project aims to answer several interrelated questions concerning vibrational mode analysis on metric graphs. Some questions under study have many potential applications, from quantum physics (stability of soliton solutions on networks of optical waveguides and optical semiconducting devices) to civil engineering (buckling analysis of metal frames), while others are aimed at development of fundamental tools useful to the area. \r\n\r\nMetric graphs occupy a special niche in the wider field of spectral analysis on manifolds. On one hand, they are easy to visualize and to study numerically. On the other hand, they often display features found in more complicated systems, such as manifolds of constant negative curvature, and they also have a plethora of applications. Three sets of questions will be addressed in the project. The first set is the optimal placement of a rank one perturbation (such as a forced zero). It has several potential applications, both theoretical (understanding the nodal count) and practical (optimizing the spectral gap to tune stability of a network-like structure). The second set of questions addresses the type of information about the graph that can be gleaned from the nodal count. The third set of questions is more fundamental in nature as it creates tools for the other two sets: the principal investigator will classify perturbations on graphs by their rank and signature, study the singular limits of operators on graphs as some edges shrink to zero, and investigate a connection between the nodal count and the scattering phase on a graph. Mathematical techniques to be used include spectral analysis, microlocal analysis, graph theory, symplectic geometry, and combinatorics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nResearch sponsored by the project resulted in several discoveries reported in 13 peer-reviewed papers.  One such discovery is the \"lateral variation principle\": It turns out that if the operator H is a perturbation of the operator A, then the stability of the eigenvalue of H with respect to further perturbations coincides with the value of the spectral shift between the operators A and H.  Another achievement is a simple yet general formalism for determining the joint conditions on a 3-dimensional network of Euler-Bernoulli beams; this work brings mathematical rigor to physically meaningful beam models used in civil engineering.  In a further result, combining algebraic topology with perturbation theory, a complete classification of the Morse indices of the singular points of eigenvalues was established for generic parametric families of self-adjoint matrices.  Such families are mathematical generalizations of concrete problems arising in applications, such as ab initio calculations of the potential energy surfaces in quantum chemistry.\n\n\nSeveral students, both graduate and undergraduate, took part in projects sponsored by the award and received training in both the mathematical theory relevant to their work and in preparing their results for publication.  Numerous research presentations have been made.  A cycle of 5 lectures for graduate students has been delivered at Lake Como School of Advanced Studies \"Quantum Graphs and Quantum Random Walks in Mathematics, Computer Science and Physics\".\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/09/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gregory Berkolaiko"
