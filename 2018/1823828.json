 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the conditions of migration, settlement, and incorporation of people who moved to a bi-national border region from a third country. The international expansion of multi-national corporations and bi-national economic border operations has facilitated the increase in people who are from neither border country but have transborder lives. This project examines how the unidirectional movement of people and capital investment contributes to regional border economies, and how community economic networks shape settlement processes in the border region. The study also will evaluate how people that are engaged in inter-community social and economic interactions within both countries are integrated into them, and how community ties, identity, and political context affect their integration process. The findings will inform bi-national economic community stakeholders, local government officials and policymakers, and community leaders on issues of regional development and strategies for balanced accommodation and integration of a fast-growing population.    \r\n\r\nThe project involves an intensive case study of border communities that engage in transborder economic activities. The main objective of the project is to understand the political and economic contexts of their migration and settlement processes and to identify the factors that affect their incorporation processes. Data come from: (1) interviews with three groups of border residents from the community, namely, business operators on either side of the border and commuters; (2) field observations at community churches, businesses, and community events related to the regional economy; and (3) archival research of local and community periodicals related to the regional economy. The project will provide important insights into the impact of contemporary economic trade and transnational investment on international migration and how bi-national economic settings influence people?s inter-community relations and incorporation processes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
