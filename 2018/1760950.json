 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will enable the reproducible analysis and sharing of large human brain imaging datasets.  Imaging the brain using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an essential tool for the study of the human brain, but the processing of large neuroimaging datasets is often a difficult and time-consuming process. This project will improve the ability of researchers to analyze these data more effectively and share the results.  This work will build upon the OpenNeuro project, which provides researchers with the ability to easily upload and share neuroimaging data. The first aim of this project is to develop the ability to process these datasets using national supercomputing resources. Because these resources are both much more powerful and more cost-effective than commercial cloud computing resources, this extension will allow researchers to process larger datasets using more sophisticated analysis procedures.  The second aim is to extend the reach of data storage and processing beyond standard neuroimaging datasets to include heterogeneous datasets with clinical and psychological data in addition to brain imaging data. A large study of human brain development will be used as a test case for this extension. The third aim of this project is to engage researchers and software developers in order to develop a broad community that will further extend the reach and capabilities of the proposed technical developments and promote the sustainability of the resources beyond the grant period.\r\n\r\nThe first aim will implement the ability to execute computational workflows using national supercomputing resources through a Science-As-A-Service model, via technologies such as the Agave API and the Singularity container system.  This will provide the ability for researchers to execute complex containerized workflows using large datasets, providing a long-term sustainable computational platform for analysis of open data. The second aim will involve the extension of the current OpenNeuro platform to represent data from a large longitudinal neurodevelopmental study, in order to allow the joint analysis of imaging, clinical, psychological, and genetic data.  The third aim will engage the relevant user and developer communities through workshops and code sprints.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Building on the successful OpenNeuro data sharing archive, we made a number of advancements towards the three specified aims of the project.\nThe first aim was to enhance the ability to perform computing on shared data across a heterogeneous set of computing architectures.  To this end we worked with the developers of the BrainLife.io platform to allow users of OpenNeuro to seamlessly analyze shared datasets on a large number of possible analysis workflows using the computational platform provided by Brainlife (powered by national supercomputing resources).  We also continued the development of a set of containerized data processing workflows that provide robust data processing across a wide range of computational platforms.  We also took advantage of the resources of the Frontera supercomputer at the Texas Advanced Computing Center to process a large number of the datasets in the OpenNeuro archive, and developed a new framework for the sharing of these derived data via OpenNeuro.\nThe second aim was to enable workflows for heterogeneous data.  Based on our initial experience developing the fMRIPrep workflow for functional MRI data, we generalized this approach to the NiPreps framework, which provides a common approach to the processing of a range of neuroscience data types.
