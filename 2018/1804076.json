 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference in Biology and Medicine through Mathematics (BAMM!) will take place May 30 - June 1, 2018 at Virginia Commonwealth University. The aim of the conference is to highlight recent developments in the broad fields of mathematical biology and medicine.  The plenary speakers will cover a range of expertise and will provide highlights from advances in the field in recent years.  The goals of this conference are to: i) provide a regional biomathematics conference that promotes junior investigators (graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty); ii) give visibility to a range of applications and methods in mathematical biology; iii) provide a good environment for networking between junior and senior researchers.  The conference will host approximately 100 attendees. The conference will be a mix of plenary talks, break-out sessions and a poster session.  Travel support will be used to increase the accessibility of the conference by junior researchers.\r\n\r\nJunior researchers (undergraduates and graduate students, postdoctoral scholars and early career faculty) will benefit from participating in this meeting. BAMM! will provide an intimate conference environment with opportunities to present a poster or give a talk for researchers at all levels. The travel award funds will promote junior presenters attendance at BAMM!. Given the diversity of the planned talks, student researchers new to the field will have the opportunity to attend talks from many subfields. This will be an excellent opportunity for undergraduate and master's students from VCU and other regional institutions. Participation of women and underrepresented minorities in mathematics and science will be encouraged and supported. More information can be found at http://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/bamm\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
