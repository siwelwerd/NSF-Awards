 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will address questions about primate and human biology using cutting-edge visualization techniques to map the cellular processes involved in growth and development of cranial cartilage and bone across a wide range of primates.  Findings from this project will advance knowledge about the ways in which cranial growth determines overall skull shape, which is important for understanding primate adaptations and life history through time. The project will support research infrastructure and training of young scientists, and may inform clinical research and treatments for children with cranial malformations.\r\n\r\nThis study relates differences in cranial base structure (including degree of basicranial flexion and facial orientation) to direct evidence of growth processes. Nine primate species are studied using a novel combination of micro-computed tomography and histological procedures to create 3D virtual reconstructions of the developing skull.  Growth patterns in cranial base synchondroses are quantified using linear and cross-sectional area measurements of cartilaginous zones.  Cranial shape in perinatal and older subadults is described using volumetric, angular, and landmark-based morphometric data.  A combination of descriptive and inferential statistics are applied to address four specific aims: 1) describe the structure of the perinatal cranial base in a comparative sample of primates; 2) document evidence of cellular and tissue-level mechanisms contributing to growth; 3) test for a phylogenetic effect in perinatal cranial base structure; and 4) test the association of cranial base growth patterns with cranial base angle and facial orientation in the perinatal period and in the adult. This project is the first to assess early postnatal synchondroseal patency or fusion in a broad range of primates and advance understanding of growth characteristics of bone and cartilage by directly observing indicators of chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy, two drivers of interstitial growth.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Funding for this collaborative research (BCS-1830894 and BCS-1830919) supported work at the University of Florida and Slippery Rock University on developmental mechanisms that produce differences in skull shape across primates.  Results from this research were published in eight peer-reviewed manuscripts, including one recently accepted for publication, and thirty presentations at national and international scientific meetings.  Imaging data produced in this study were made available online to other researchers to build scientific infrastructure and encourage reproducibility.  Grant funds and the data produced in this project supported the professional development of 12 graduate students and five undergraduate students at the University of Florida and Slippery Rock University, many of whom have advanced to faculty positions, clinical practice, or further graduate study. \n\nThe purpose of this research was to show how localized growth processes in the cranial base around the time of birth influence the eventual shape of the skull in adults.  The cranial base is the floor of the braincase.  It is originally formed in cartilage that ossifies to become bone.  The cartilage of the cranial base extends into the face, forming the nasal septum and walls of the nasal cavity.  Growth processes in this cartilage result in integration of the braincase and facial skeleton.  This project used a diverse sample of primates to capture a broad range of craniofacial variation, including long- and short-snouted primates.
