 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Rancho La Brea tar pits of Los Angeles, California contain thousands of bones from large mammals --dire wolves, sabertooth cats, coyotes, extinct bison, horses, and others-- trapped in sticky surface oil deposits during the last Ice Age. This unparalleled fossil assemblage allows rigorous studies of extinct mammal biology, especially of carnivores which are rare at most fossil sites. The La Brea fossils span a critical time in Earth's history (approximately 50,000 years ago to the present) that includes major events such as the end of the last Ice Age, the arrival of humans in North America, and an extinction that killed two thirds of the large mammals on the continent. This unique deposit will be used to investigate relationships between major environmental changes and evolutionary variation (size, diet, etc.) in large mammals, information that is critical for promoting the survival of wildlife today. The project involves significant community outreach in the greater Los Angeles area through the Tar Pits Museum and will create educational content that will be available online for high school teachers across the country.\r\n\r\n\tThe major impediment to system-level study at Rancho La Brea is a paucity of radiocarbon dates and the resulting inability to correlate biotic change with time. This project will intensively radiocarbon date samples from multiple pits spanning the last 50,000 years to establish the first detailed chronology for the entrapment of four extinct species of large mammals, and one extant species. It will involve the collection and compilation of census data for these species to track changes in total abundance and diversity, as well as data on morphological and dietary changes.\u00a0A well-resolved chronology will allow these data on evolutionary changes in mammals and the Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions to be linked to existing records of major paleo-environmental changes. This work will have broad implications for our understanding of extinctions, survival, environmental variables, and humans on mammalian ecology, which is directly relevant to modern conservation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

First, this award allowed extensive radiocarbon dating of five different fossil deposits at the La Brea Tar Pits. This &ldquo;wholesale&rdquo; dating is crucial to this site because it is impossible to be able to just look at where the bones are located in the Tar Pits and know how old they are. Each fossil must be dated separately to know how old the fossils are at this site. Knowing the precise age of the fossils at the Tar Pits allows researchers to address important questions about how Ice Age animals and environments change through time from 45,000 years ago to the present. This project also expanded the number of known Ice Age radiocarbon dates in mid-latitude North America twofold. Second, these fossil dates helped provide a better understanding of the timing of the Ice Age extinction event, specifically in Southern California, and generally in North America. Data from this project, in conjunction with other externally gathered data from lake sediments, and charcoal data allowed a better understanding of the causes of the Ice Age extinction event in Southern California, as well as the timing. Findings show that a combination of naturally caused climate warming, coupled with human-caused fires was the proximate cause of the extinction event of very large mammals in Southern California approximately 12,000 years ago. These findings can help conservation biologists and fire specialists better understand how modern ecosystems will be affected by current climate change and widespread fires. Third, the other major activity from this project is a comprehensive ecological evaluation of five different Ice Age mammal species at the Tar Pits. This project will produce a holistic view of how each species lived, what they ate (and how they hunted), and whether they migrated or lived year-round at the Tar Pits. These data allow modern biologists to better understand the historical context for the animals that live in Southern California today.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 06/29/2024<br>\nModified by: Julie&nbsp;A&nbsp;Meachen</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
