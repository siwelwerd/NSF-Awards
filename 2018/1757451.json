 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site is focused on training students in the implementation of Sustainable Land and Water Resources. Its goal is to introduce undergraduate students to key elements of research on land and water resources essential to improving management practices, with a focus on Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) and diverse interdisciplinary research teams.  Each year, students divided into three teams to conduct research that integrates Earth-surface dynamics, geology, hydrology and other disciplines. Research teams are hosted by two Native American communities (Confederated Salish Kootenai Tribes and Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa) and the University of Minnesota to work on projects developed in collaboration with the tribes' resource management divisions. This REU Site incorporates an interdisciplinary team-oriented approach that emphasizes quantitative and predictive methods, CBPR, indigenous research methods, and traditional ecological knowledge. The REU Site encourages participation by underrepresented students and students who are unsure about how they fit into the world of science to pursue STEM careers. \r\n\r\nThe REU Site introduces a new paradigm for undergraduate research incorporating place-based and community-based participatory research. The PIs are building knowledge on increasing participation in REUs by non-traditional students and students from groups underrepresented in STEM. The researchers have developed a proven, structured, scaffolded method of teaching science research and writing, which takes students who may have never written a technical research paper and provides them with the skills and support needed to routinely deliver high quality intellectual outputs and increase their intellectual self-confidence in the process. The mentoring plan for the REU Site is focused on helping mentors to: a) prepare to mentor highly diverse teams of students; b) support mentors to deal with the expectations, issues and challenges that arise when you are mentoring teams that have a large number of nontraditional students; and c) help mentors get acculturated to conducting research on tribal lands and with Native people. The students, faculty, graduate and post-doctoral mentors, tribal professionals and other community members are intimately engaged in CBPR, developing projects that inherently support tribal resource management goals. Results are disseminated to tribal authorities and community members as well as the broader scientific community. Outcomes of this REU research paradigm will concurrently establish a legacy of broader scientific capacity within reservation communities and provide pathways to scientific discoveries with a shared foundation of trust and respect.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Students work on one of three teams on projects that integrate Earth-surface dynamics, geology, hydrology and other disciplines.&nbsp; Research teams are hosted on two Native American reservations (Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes) and at Salish Kootenai College and the University of Minnesota and projects are developed in collaboration with the tribes' resource management divisions.&nbsp; The REU SLAWR incorporates an interdisciplinary team-oriented approach that emphasizes quantitative and predictive methods, TCBPR, Indigenous research methods, and traditional ecological knowledge.The REU develops unique rigorous scientific research projects that are place-based, meaningful, and are the product of an intensive collaboration with Native American communities. This REU supports students in ways that go far beyond a typical REU.&nbsp; It takes place at three different and geographically dispersed sites (Salish Kootenai College, Pablo, Montana; the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities Campus; and the reservation of the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, with students living and working at the University of Minnesota, Duluth). The REU encourages all students to apply, including Native Americans, students from other groups underrepresented in the sciences, nontraditional students, parents, veterans and students with disabilities. Students who are not able to come and participate at one of our sites can apply to participate remotely. The students, faculty, graduate and post-doctoral mentors, tribal professionals and other community members are engaged in tribally focused, community-based participatory research (TCBPR).&nbsp; The protocols and methods for effective TCBPR are modeled and supported by literature and practice.&nbsp; Projects developed through TCBPR for this REU inherently support tribal resource management goals.&nbsp; Results are disseminated to tribal authorities and community members as well as the broader scientific community.The program is for 10 weeks in the summer from mid-June to mid-August. Participants live and work on three teams in three locations but form one research community. Participants gather at the beginning of the program for an orientation session in Glacier National Park in Montana. After intensive team-building activities, and orientation to our core program elements of TCBPR and Ethical Research on Tribal Lands, participants head for their research locations (at Salish Kootenai College in Pablo, MT for Team SPA; in Minneapolis, MN for Team Stream; and in Duluth, MN for Team Zaaga'igan). Weekly videoconferences keep our community closely knit, and participants share their research progress. An All-Team Gathering at the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory in Minneapolis, MN at the end of the summer allows everyone to come back together and share their research. Finally, students have the opportunity during the following year to share their research at a national conference of their choice.The REU encourages participation by underrepresented students and students who are unsure about how they fit into the world of science.&nbsp; Between 2018 and 2021, 38 students completed research projects with the REU.&nbsp; 22 of our participants have graduated from their 4-year programs since completing the REU.&nbsp; Of these 55% (n=12) are in graduate programs and 2 more are actively applying for graduate programs.&nbsp; Five of the graduates are working in resource management for tribes. The teams were diverse in ethnicity, institution-type, and included many non-traditional students as participants. 76% of the participants were from underrepresented groups, with 45% Native American or Native Alaska, 8% Native Hawai'ian or Pacific Islander, 5% Black, and 18% Hispanic.&nbsp; 58% were female.&nbsp; 26% were non-traditional students and/or parents. 66% of participants were from home institutions that are Minority Serving Institutions or 2-year colleges.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/06/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Diana&nbsp;M&nbsp;Dalbotten</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1757451/1757451_10542824_1633545534725_manoomin--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1757451/1757451_10542824_1633545534725_manoomin--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Manoomin Field Wrk\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1757451/1757451_10542824_1633545534725_manoomin--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Manoomin Field Wrk\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Trinaty, a participant on Team Stream in 2019, collects sediment samples with support from tribal resource managers.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Brena Mullin</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Diana&nbsp;M&nbsp;Dalbotten</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Manoomin Field Wrk</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1757451/1757451_10542824_1633545966801_img_1593--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1757451/1757451_10542824_1633545966801_img_1593--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Glacier Park\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1757451/1757451_10542824_1633545966801_img_1593--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Glacier Park\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students finish a challenging hike during the REU 2019 orientation in Glacier National Park.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dennis Lichtenburg</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Diana&nbsp;M&nbsp;Dalbotten</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Glacier Park</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1757451/1757451_10542824_1633547555956_IMG_20181012_154240462--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1757451/1757451_10542824_1633547555956_IMG_20181012_154240462--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SACNAS\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1757451/1757451_10542824_1633547555956_IMG_20181012_154240462--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SACNAS\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Bruce, a participant on Team Zaaga'igan, presents his research at the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science conference in 2019.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Diana Dalbotten</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Diana&nbsp;M&nbsp;Dalbotten</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SACNAS</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1757451/1757451_10542824_1633548356186_img_5786--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1757451/1757451_10542824_1633548356186_img_5786--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Prepping for Field Work\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1757451/1757451_10542824_1633548356186_img_5786--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Prepping for Field Work\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Myrna and LeeAnn prepare their \"peepers\" to be installed in the lake.
