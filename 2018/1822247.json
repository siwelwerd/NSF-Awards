 "awd_abstract_narration": "This IUSE conferene project, Pedagogical Initiatives in Linear Algebra, will develop, hold, and follow up on a conference for 55 faculty in the U.S. The two-day workshop will include mathematicians and mathematics educators listening to plenary talks and panel discussions by experts in the field.  They will then work together to examine current issues in Linear Algebra teaching and learning and to develop new pathways for studying and implementing more evidence-based teaching. The project aligns with the national effort to improve STEM Education by introducing and refining research-based strategies for the teaching of linear algebra, and more broadly, other proof-based mathematics courses at the undergraduate level.\r\n\r\nThe project goals are: a) move forward on producing an instructional and research guide for linear algebra (first course and second course); (b) work toward writing research- based recommendations for teaching and learning of linear algebra; (c) generate new research questions; and (d) encourage collaboration between research mathematicians and mathematics educators. The products after the conference will be plans to develop and publish a new instructional guide for teaching linear algebra, curricula recommendations, and a themed journal publication.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
