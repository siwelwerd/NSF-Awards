 "awd_abstract_narration": "Due to the anomalous behavior of fresh water, which below 3.98C has a negative thermal expansion coefficient, convection occurs when the surface of a mid- to high latitude freshwater lake is heated in the spring. This implies that convection can be driven by shortwave radiation in the absence of wind on calm, sunny days. Observations over the last several years in Lake Superior, made as part of unrelated fieldwork, have provided an opportunity to start to explore the dynamics of this convective process from a number of different platforms, including moored and glider-based observations. Observations show parcels of water being warmed at the surface and transported to the bottom (O(200m)) on the order of hours, and suggest short (O(10m)) horizontal scales for convective chimneys, providing real challenges for observations and models alike. This project will combine observations, numerical modeling, and analytical work to determine and understand the spatial and temporal scales of the instability process. Lakes at mid-to high latitudes can spend a significant portion of the year in this state, during which these dynamics will dominate circulation and mixing. From a fundamental fluid dynamics perspective, this phenomenon provides an opportunity to study buoyancy-driven convection in the absence of other forcing mechanisms such as surface waves and wind-driven currents, in contrast to most significant examples of oceanic convection. This process may have significant impacts on primary productivity, since the strong convection, spanning the water column, will make it impossible for primary producers to maintain their position in the euphotic zone. In addition, parcels of water are being transported from the surface of the lake to the bottom on timescales of hours, and may have significant impacts to lake sediment biogeochemistry. A graduate student will be supported at each of the three institutions involved. An interactive one dimensional mixing model will be developed for classroom use, similar to tools already developed by one of the PIs. This work will foster collaboration between limnologists and oceanographers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe centerpiece of the field work will consist of a \"horizontal mooring\" equipped with fast thermistors as well as ADCPs capable of measuring vertical velocities, and an auxiliary mooring to measure surface heat fluxes. Glider transects and velocity microstructure surveys will be taken during both calm and windy conditions. Modeling will consist of an exploration of parameter space using direct numerical simulation and large eddy simulations. Analytical methods will be used to constrain the parameter space. Unlike well-studied Rayleigh-Benard convection, the process is driven by injection of Available Potential Energy directly into the bulk of the fluid. The researchers intend to study not just the turbulent properties of the phenomenon, as in most of the existing literature, but also approach it from the novel perspective of an instability problem.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Sunlight shining on the lake when the water temperature is below 4C (the temperature of maximum density for fresh water) makes surface waters denser, driving convective circulation throughout the water column. This process can dominate circulation for 1-3 months of the year, depending on conditions, and results in extremely efficient mixing of the entire water column and all of its constituents on a daily basis.&nbsp; This project was a focused effort to collect high-resolution physical data (temperature and currents) to better characterize this process. In spring 2019, 2021, and 2022, large instrumentation arrays were deployed in the western arm of Lake Superior. In 2019 and 2021, the centerpiece of these deployments was a large, two-dimensional array of temperature sensors that allowed us to characterize the lateral scales of temperature structure, which are on the order of tens of meters. We were able to combine temperature measurements along the horizontal portion of this mooring with currents measured on a nearby platform to form cross-sectional images of individual convective plumes, as well as to understand the structure of the boundary between ambient water and recently warmed, convecting water. &nbsp;In 2021 and 2022, we also deployed a high-resolution single-point (vertically oriented) mooring which carried 91 thermistors and a pair of Acoustic Doppler Current Meters (ADCPs), providing ~2m vertical resolution of temperature in approximately 180m of water. This was deployed not only during the convective season, but year-round, providing an innovative perspective on the evolution of stratification in a deep, dimictic lake.</p>\n<p>In addition to physical characterization of the lake, we demonstrated that convection influences zooplankton migratory behavior. Specifically, in the early spring, the lake transitions from a state of inverse stratification (cold water sitting on top of warm), during which convection only mixes the upper layer, to a state of neutral stratification, during which convection mixes the entire water column. Using an ADCP, we were able to show that there is a dramatic decline in zooplankton daily migration, which is part of their feeding behavior. We hypothesize that this is due to the sudden availability of food (phytoplankton) at depth, due to convective circulation. This was reinforced by water column measurements taken with a profiling platform, which showed a significant redistribution of multiple water quality parameters pre- and post-transition to neutral conditions. This demonstrates the importance of convection for determining ecosystem function, and we are currently interested in determining a better understanding of the consequences of convective circulation for primary productivity, the main conduit for sunlight being turned into energy in the food web.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/06/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jay&nbsp;A&nbsp;Austin</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1829895/1829895_10575180_1675706790634_RDC_2019_MAP--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1829895/1829895_10575180_1675706790634_RDC_2019_MAP--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Map showing location of deployment, and schematic diagrams of instrumentation deployed in 2019\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1829895/1829895_10575180_1675706790634_RDC_2019_MAP--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Map showing location of deployment, and schematic diagrams of instrumentation deployed in 2019\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Top: map showing deployment location.
