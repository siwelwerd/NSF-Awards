 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/ commercial potential of this project is to commercialize previous research in tensegrity robots for new markets in disaster rescue, surveillance, scientific monitoring, and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) education. Future deaths by both victims and first responders in disaster rescue in unchartered risky environments could be prevented by utilizing semi-autonomous technology to explore the regions of disasters, provide surveillance to inform first responders, and assist in the rescue of victims until human first responders can arrive. Current autonomous vehicles can be ineffective in navigating surface obstacles and climbing steep slopes to reach areas of interest. Aerial operations may be limited to dropping supplies, which may not be beneficial if victims are immobile or unconscious. The goal is to drop the proposed shape-shifting robots from aerial vehicles, so that these mobile robots can reach previously difficult areas for effective emergency response. This proposed technology will have broader impact in use for scientific monitoring and surveillance as well. A secondary market will be for K-12 students, teachers, parents and roboticists with the potential to have large impact in STEM education.  Robot kits will be developed for educational applications that will meet new Next Generation Science Standards.\r\n\r\nThe Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on de-risking prior research in the development of spherical tensegrity structures as a robotic platform for the proposed target applications. To meet market needs, the specifications need to include impact testing from a drop from an aerial vehicle along with ground travel requirements of slope, rubble and speed. New hardware and software will be designed to meet these specifications. The following three control algorithms and actuation schemes will be developed and evaluated for target specifications and tested in simulation and in hardware for locomotion (1) Multi-cable rolling motion on inclined surfaces, (2) Dynamic rolling using Model Predictive Control (MPC), and (3) Deep reinforcement learning. For applications where the terrain has been mapped, a (4) Generative path-planning algorithm will be developed. (5) Control mechanisms for the internal sphere of the robot will be developed so that the tensegrity robot will be able to manipulate and orient a payload of sensing equipment (e.g., camera, ultrasound, infrared, laser, spectrometer) while traveling on rough terrain. (6) Associated sensor validation, fusion and estimation techniques will be developed to meet the specifications. The results will be a proof-of-concept prototype that meets the target specifications.",

Over 200 customer interviews were conducted to refine the business goals and develop product specifications to meet the needs of disaster response in the CBRNe (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, explosion) market.</p>\n<p>Squishy Robotics developed two parallel hardware platforms: (1) a stationary sensor robot that can be dropped and remain in a single location and (2) a mobile sensor robot that can maneuver over rough terrain after landing. The key to both platforms is to be rapidly deployable via drone or other aerial vehicles. The stationary robot would be less complex, weigh less, withstand higher drops, and have a longer battery life than the mobile robot. Both platforms should be designed to carry and protect a customizable payload of sensor combinations. Potential customers made a convincing case that both platforms would enjoy a strong product-market fit if they could be reconfigured for specific tasks.</p>\n<p>The <em>stationary</em> robot is the testing vehicle for drop survivability and structural design and is small enough to be easily transportable. The robot must protect a payload of approximately 300 gm, the mass of the final sensor payload. The total weight is less than 1 kg, light enough to be dropped by every common commercial drone and thus be a marketable product in its own right. Rigorous drop tests were performed on several different robot iterations. High-speed camera footage, post-event inspection of the tensegrity structure, and accelerometers were the used to assess the success of drop testing.</p>\n<p>The<em> mobile</em> robot platform builds on the success of the stationary robot by extending the earlier robot?s capabilities with the additional ability to traverse rough terrain. By combining the impact-resilience and rapid deployment benefits of the passive system with robust rolling locomotion, the mobile robot hardware platform provides an additional product line that is well-suited for handling dynamic scenarios, where conditions might change at a moment?s notice, as well as for situational awareness over a large area. The mobile robot was tested in simulation with dynamic rolling using Model Predictive Control, deep reinforcement learning and A* path planning.</p>\n<p>Live demonstrations by Squishy Robotics were showcased at &nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://ocr2018.vztechnologies.com/ocr2018\">Operation Convergent Response</a></em> as a leading-edge robotic technology for saving lives and assisting emergency first responders during critical disaster situations. The testing took place at the <em>Guardian Centers </em>in Georgia, a leading disaster training facility. <em>Squishy Robotics</em> dropped the stationary robot from a drone at the&nbsp;mock <a href=\"https://ocr2018.vztechnologies.com/earthquake\">earthquake scenario</a> and was the only company to make a successful aerial drop from a drone. While there, interactions with first responders reaffirmed that visual and chemical data gathered and transmitted from <em>Squishy Robots</em> would enable disaster response teams to make better decisions, save lives, reduce costs and risks, and increase the effectiveness of the emergency response, all while increasing the safety of team members. Surpassing the original goal of a 20 m drop, Squishy Robotics current stationary robot can withstand a 122 m (400 ft) drop while safely carrying a central sensor payload.</p>\n<p>The educational market was determined not to be immediately commercially viable, but Squishy Robotics maintained some of its original educational market objectives to meet broadening impact goals. An engineering design challenge utilizing a stationary tensegrity robot and aligned with middle school science standards was developed. Components of the curriculum were tested at the Lawrence Hall of Science (Berkeley, California) as a one-day <em>Phenomenal Physics Sunday Funday</em> exhibit and as a two-day STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Math) workshop as part of the <em>Pinoleville Pomo Nation Summer Academy</em>, part of a 4-year Indian Education Demonstration Grant under the Department of Education to support Native American students (Pre-K to 12th grade) to achieve college and career success. Students were able to explore the concepts of kinetic energy, gravitational potential energy, and kinetic energy, along with their ability to integrate these ideas in assessing the drop test results.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/30/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Alice&nbsp;M&nbsp;Agogino</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1747189/1747189_10526834_1553989259533_Figure2-Squishy-Robot-Earthquake_demo--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1747189/1747189_10526834_1553989259533_Figure2-Squishy-Robot-Earthquake_demo--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure2-Final Robot\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1747189/1747189_10526834_1553989259533_Figure2-Squishy-Robot-Earthquake_demo--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure2-Final Robot\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Final stationary robot design with length of 50 cm.
