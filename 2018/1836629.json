The project organizes and funds a community event on October 24, 2018 in Bellevue, Washington, for the researchers of awards from the CSR program. At this event, the researchers funded by the CSR program will have the opportunity to meet and share their research and ideas for the future.\r\n\r\nThe project organizes a meeting of CSR researchers that includes three types of activities. Plenary presentations will give a forum for the most remarkable research in the field to be presented and diffused to a large audience. These presentations are also useful to set the tone and quality of expected research for the researchers of more recent awards. Poster presentations of ongoing award enable casual scientific conversation and person-to-person research diffusion; they are expected to strengthen the social interaction between CSR researchers and to lead to new collaborations and synergy in the field. Breakout sessions will focus on subfield of systems research to summarize recent successful methodology and identify problems and opportunities for future work. The project provides a forum for systems researchers to meet and to form new collaborations, to discuss and to disseminate successful efforts, to identify the problems and opportunities of the future, and to maximize the impact of subsequent systems research efforts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
