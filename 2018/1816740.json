 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria and whose genome is,  in some cases,  a double stranded DNA molecule. In order to develop strains of double stranded (ds) DNA bacteriophages that can be efficiently used in nanotechnology and for treatment of bacterial infections, a detailed mathematical and biophysical characterization of the packing and delivery of the viral genome is required. Paradoxically, very little is known about these processes due to the extreme density and pressure conditions that the DNA is subject to inside the virus. In the proposed research, the investigators will combine experimental work and the theory of liquid crystals to determine the properties and organization of the DNA molecule inside bacteriophages and of its release. The project will establish a firm theoretical framework for genome delivery in nano-technological applications. In particular, it will produce the first analytical model describing the liquid crystalline phase of DNA in confinement. Two postdoctoral fellows and at least two graduate students will be trained each year. Results and materials will be broadly disseminated, through open access as well as standard journals and conference presentations. Materials developed in this project will be presented at the UC Davis program for high school students COSMOS. Collaborations and contacts with device development laboratories will be established.\r\n\r\nThe overarching hypothesis of the project is that the DNA molecule inside the viral capsid forms a hexagonal chromonic liquid crystal phase for which mathematical models are lacking. In the proposed project, the investigators will first build a mechanical model determined by an energy function that incorporates information from cryo-EM data, information from semiflexible polymers, results from Onsager theory of lyotropic liquid crystals and parameters from experiments on chromonic liquid crystals. Next, they will extend their mechanical model by including polyelectrolyte gel features, acknowledging the presence of water with many types of ions and their interaction with the negative charge of the DNA molecule. Third, the investigators will develop models of delivery of genomes with different biophysical properties. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that defects in the DNA liquid crystalline ordering are manifested as knots and DNA kinks. The proposed mathematical and computational models will be, both, guided and validated by multiple experimental techniques including cryo-EM, topological analysis, estimation of osmotic pressures and delivery of DNA sequences. The ultimate goal of this project is to construct and analyze a mathematical model of chromonic liquid crystals capable of making packing, pressure and delivery predictions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nBacteriophages are viruses that infect and destroy bacteria.\n\n\nThe intellectual merit of this project hinges in the mathematical modeling of the quiescent state and organization of bacteriophage viruses. When bacteria are not present, the virus saves its genome in an icosahedral protein capsid of width between 40 and 80 nm. The packaging of the viral genome into the capsid is done by a molecular motor, one of the most powerful known in nature. As an evolutionary feature, a good organization of the stored genome is necessary in order to achieve an orderly ejection that leads to a successful infection. X-ray analysis performed in the early 1970's revealed that condensed DNA is found in a liquid crystal phase. This project mathematically represents condensed DNA, a semiflexible polymer with rigid groups, as a liquid crystal with a vector field--filament pair, the latter representing the DNA central axis, being tangent to the vector field. The vector field minimizes the Oseen-Frank energy of liquid crystals, involving penalties for bending and twisting arrangements, such terms quantified by the corresponding elastic moduli or Frank constants. One of the results of the reported work is the unique, optimal, helical arrangement of the genome central line, tangent to the vector field, for an appropriate range of values of the ratio between the bending and the twist moduli. For values outside the helical range, the arrangement is found to be in the form of torus. Another aspect of the packaged DNA that the organization prevails only near the capsid walls, becoming disorganized towards the center, the capsid core. In this work, we develop several tools to predict the organized region of the capsid, and provide an estimate of the size of the core region. These regions are then compared with those revealed by the cryo-EM images of the viruses synthesized by the UC Davis group. The pressure inside the capsid, of the order of 10 atm, is also predicted by the mathematical model. The second part of the project incorporates the water and ionic environment into the model, requiring substantially different mathematical tools. The results are then compared with experiments that involve several ionic species. In related work, the PI and collaborators have modeled and simulated the role of the motor in the packaging of DNA.\n\n\nThe mathematical studies and numerical simulations of the genome organization are a key components of the broader impacts of the project. Indeed, the availability of effective models, with properly identified macroscopic parameters such as the elastic moduli, provide a user-friendly and very valuable predictive tool in applications. For some time now, researchers in the medical community have envisioned bacteriophage based therapies against diseases caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria. The hurdles that such therapies present, such as the difficulty to control of the overly rapid viral multiplication inside the bacteria, are progressively being resolved. This project has fostered training and education of young researchers, including two graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow. In addition, the PI has mentored a group of 4 women from the SIAM group on the Mathematics of Materials. The work has been extensively disseminated in conference talks and departmental lectures, in the US and abroad.\n\n\n\nThis project addresses the quiescent state of bacteriophage viruses in a protein capsid.
