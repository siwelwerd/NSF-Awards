 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a model system of a soft-robotic prosthetic designed to treat joint disease. Through the use of models of osteoarthritis progression and how mechanical loading impacts disease onset, progression, and regression, combined with models of continuous, compliant and configurable prosthetics, the research team will develop a soft-robotic prosthetic that is capable of responding in real time, based on implanted sensors, to the changing pressures of the joint while moving, such that the optimal dislocation will be achieved to promote healing. The research brings together two radically different concepts and approaches: (1) that the manipulation of mechanical forces can bring about regeneration of the knee cartilage and be curative for osteoarthritis, and (2) through the novel use of a robotic system, precise determination of forces and precise manipulation of the knee joint environment can occur to provide evidence of repair and regeneration of the knee joint.  \r\n\r\nThe research team will evaluate knee osteoarthritis as their testbed, but the program could have far reaching capabilities for other musculoskeletal disorders like hip-related osteoarthritis, gait-dependent back pain, and other disorders that would benefit from dynamic input rather than static control. Development of an engineered bioactive soft-robotic brace would be transformative to the field of musculoskeletal regeneration, as it is unlike any previous attempt to treat osteoarthritis. The approach is non-invasive, responds dynamically to the physical loads imposed upon the joint, is informed by the actual extent of disease progression of the joint, and is highly cost-effective. The project is high-risk, but may create a new engineered paradigm for the treatment of one of the world?s most prevalent diseases. The results of this project will be shared amongst the greater research community through peer-reviewed publications, conference proceedings, podium presentations, and poster presentations, and as content of any invited chapters or reviews on topics germane to the work described.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "The overarching goal of this project, entitled \"EAGER: Soft-Actuated Bionic Regenerative Engineering\", was to develop a non-invasive method for easing the physical loading that is encountered in the knee joint during normal physical movement.  This can be particularly helpful if there is pain in the knee joint, and may reduce or slow the progression of osteoarthritis, a painful and debilitating disease of the cartilage that can develop in knees through aging.  One solution to osteoarthritis is to perform knee surgery and replace the cartilage of the knee with implants, but it is our belief that the need for invasive surgery can be reduced by changing the way in which the knee is loaded when walking or running.  The approach taken here was to use soft robotics to develop an externally-worn knee brace that can transfer the load in the knee in a way that could reduce pain and may also reduce the chances of developing severe osteoarthritis.  The objectives of this work were to design the brace, to use computer models to test the efficacy of the design, and to use 3D printing to make prototypes and perform early-stage testing to evaluate the feasibility of the idea. A prototype device was designed that uses soft-robotic actuators to change the alignment of the knee joint, such that the load that would typically be applied to the damaged cartilage during normal walking is redirected, and the physical force applied to the cartilage is reduced.  The prototype relies on the use of inflatable bladders that change the orientation of the knee, so finite element analysis (FEA) was used to evaluate several designs for these bladders to determine how the design influenced the application of forces.  From these computer models, a prototype was 3D printed and tested, and found to function much like the FEA modeling suggested.  Further studies will be done to fine-tune the design to maximize the control over knee displacement such that precise forces can be applied at specific locations to fine-tune the reallocation of forces in the knee. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/14/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Cato T Laurencin"
