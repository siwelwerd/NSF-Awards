 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns research in geometry and dynamical systems, some of which uses computer experimentation to study simply-stated questions about which little is known. The idea is that new and powerful computing tools will provide insight that was not available to earlier generations of mathematicians.  One such question, known as Thomson's problem, asks how some number of electrons will arrange themselves on the sphere so as to minimize their total potential energy.  Such a problem has wide-ranging applications because in many scientific fields it is quite useful to know how to evenly distribute points or sensors or energy sources in a space.  The principal investigator recently resolved a large part of the story for the case of five points on the sphere and plans to continue to develop this theory.  Another problem asks about the stability of the solar system in a highly simplified model of celestial mechanics called outer billiards.  It is known that there exist initial conditions for which the corresponding orbits are unbounded; this project aims to further develop a theory that provides detailed theoretical pictures of these orbits in a special case.  Another problem under investigation in the project is the famous square peg problem, which asks if every loop in the plane has four points on it that make the corners of a square.  \r\n\r\nIn technical terms, the project focuses on the following areas.  First, it is planned to extend results related to a phase-transition conjecture for the 5-electron problem.  The principal investigator proved that there exists a constant c such that the triangular bi-pyramid is the energy minimizer for the Riesz s-potential if and only if s is not greater than c.  It is conjectured that some pyramid with square base is the energy minimizer for the Riesz s-potential if and only if s is not less than c. Second, the project aims to continue developing the plaid mode, a combinatorial construction that assigns to each rational number a collection of polyhedral surfaces contained in a cube.  When the model is sliced in one coordinate direction, it gives loops which accurately model certain orbits of outer billiards with respect to the kite with the same parameter.  When the model is sliced in the other two coordinate directions it gives loops that are combinatorially isomorphic to those found in Truchet tilings and in corner percolation.  Third, the principal investigator plans to continue an ongoing study of the space of inscribed rectangles in a Jordan loop.  He has established that every Jordan loop has associated to it a connected set of rectangles such that every point of the loop, with at most 4 exceptional points, is the vertex of one of the rectangles in the set.  This result leads to a question of how a rectangle can slide continuously along a pair of arcs, a problem akin to studying the solutions of a differential equation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nRichard Schwartz spent the period for this grant working on his research in geometry and dynamical systems.  Schwartz tries to discover new mathematical phenomena with the help of computer experimentation.  These experiments often involve the creation of sophisticated graphical user interfaces. Schwartz worked on several research projects during the period of the grant and continues to work on the broader impacts of his research.\n\n\nOne of the projects Schwartz worked on this year is a geometrical understanding of the famous four color theorem. The four color theorem says, informally, that no matter how you divide the world into different countries it is always possible to color each country one of four colors so that bordering countries have different colors. He wrote a computer program to study what these colorings can look like in the special cases when each country is surrounded by atmost six others.  This is an attractive family of examples to consider because there are infinitely many examples but they fall into just a few different general family.  For instance, one family features maps having twelve countries surrounded by five neighbors and the rest surrounded by six.  These kinds of maps are also closely related to Fullerenes from chemistry. For the maps in these special families, the problem can be reformulated as a statement about certain black and white drawings one can make on the surfaces of apolyhedra.  In these cases, Schwartz discovered a connection between these kinds of drawings and continued fractions, which are a number-theoretic way of understanding real numbers.\n\n\nSchwartz also made a careful computer-aided study of billiards inside tetrahedra.  One of the simplest unsolved problem about billiards is the question of whether, for any possible polyhedron, one has a periodic billiard path.  Informally this means thatone can stand inside a polyhedral room, a pyramid say,and throw a superball at the walls in such a way that it bounces around in an endlessly repeating pattern.  (The superball is an idealized one, so that it has infinitesimal size and is not subject to friction, gravity, energy dissipation, and so on.) Schwartz made a graphical user interface to study this problem for tetrahedra.  He discovered thatthat for certain shapes, technically the orthoschemes very near the orthoscheme that tiles space by reflections, there appear to be no short periodic billiard paths, and perhaps none at all. He is currently trying to understand this phenomenon, with a view towards resolving the unsolved problem mentioned above.\nIn a different direction, Schwartz, in collaboration with his former student Matei Coiculescu, studied singularity formation in the curve shortening process as it is applied to figure-8 curves.   Informally, the curve shortening process starts with a curve and evolves it so that it rounds out the sharp corners as quickly as possible and only changes the straight parts slowly. Informally, if a bunch of ants run around the curve and try to save time, they might start rounding out the path by smoothing the corners.  For figure-8 curves this process makes the curve shrink to a point.  Schwartz and Coiculescu studied what happens when the size and aspect ratio of the evolving curve is changed so that it always fits precisely inside a unit square.  Schwartz and Coiculescu proved, under certain restrictions on the initial curve, that the limit of these pictures is always a 4-sided polygon that looks like a bowtie.  They discovered this result through computer simulations of the process.\n\n\nSchwartz has continued to work on the broader impacts of his research.  These past few years he has given several high profile talks: the Kemeny Lectures at Dartmouth, the Britten Lectures at McMaster University, the Lewis Lectures at Rutgers University, and an invited lecture at the 2022 International Congress of Mathematicians.  \nSchwartz continues to mentor undergraduate students, working with about three of them each summer on research projects.  This past summer, he worked with Ethan Bove on geometric group theory, with Cassie Ding on triangulations of surfaces, and with Eli Sporn on knot theory.  \nFinally, he continues to make graphical user interfaces which help illustrate mathematics.  In addition to the ones he made in connection with the research mentioned above, he has recently made interfaces for studying the optimal folding patterns for paper Moebius bands, the behavior of rectangles inscribed in polygonal curves,  the behavior of dynamical systems defined on Platonic solids, and the differential geometry of three dimensional curved spaces.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/12/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard Schwartz"
