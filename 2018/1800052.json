 "awd_abstract_narration": "On the most fundamental level, through the molecular origins of life and photosynthesis, the interaction of light with matter has played an essential role. The many applications of these interactions continue to revolutionize society through advances in medicine, communications, technology, and entertainment. Controlling the fundamental way in which matter interacts with light represents a major priority for many phenomena of great importance for society. This grand challenge is yet to be fully conquered despite the efforts of many chemists and physicists. With this award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms-B Program of the Division of Chemistry is supporting Professor Carlos E. Crespo-Hern\u00e1ndez of Case Western Reserve University to investigate whether strategic structural modification of the DNA component pyrimidine can be used to rationally control the dissipation of energy, processes critical to DNA photochemistry and photostability. Prof. Crespo-Hern\u00e1ndez and his research students use a combination of experiment and theory to examine this innovative idea. The transformative potential of this research is the development of molecular design principles for the control of light-induced pathways in biological and other organic molecules in general. Prof. Crespo-Hern\u00e1ndez seeks to motivate students to enter and persist in scientific studies and careers by providing research opportunities to high school, undergraduate and graduate students, and by mentoring and serving as a role model. The interests of these students are heightened by opportunities for cross- and multidisciplinary research and training in important areas of modern photochemistry and photobiology, time-resolved techniques, and computational methods, and by exposure to national and international collaborations. Research opportunities are provided for economically disadvantaged and underrepresented students from the Greater Cleveland area.\r\n\r\nIn this research, Professor Crespo-Hern\u00e1ndez is investigating whether selective functionalization of the pyrimidine chromophore can be used to rationally control the radiative and nonradiative decay pathways that are critical to nucleic acid photochemistry. Prof. Crespo-Hern\u00e1ndez and his research students examine this innovative idea by gathering experimental and theoretical data using femto-to-microsecond transient absorption spectroscopy and multiconfigurational calculations.  The objectives include: 1) unravel the electronic relaxation pathways in rationally selected nucleic acid derivatives; 2) map the topology of the potential energy surfaces; and 3) establish structure-dynamics relationships to reveal how functionalization regulates radiative and nonradiative decay pathways. Close collaboration with the theoretical group of Professor In\u00e9s Corral of the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid, Spain enhance the impact and increase fundamental understanding of the transformative science proposed. Understanding how functionalization of the pyrimidine chromophore regulates the electronic relaxation pathways in nucleic acid derivatives can assist in the development of therapeutic drugs, crosslinking agents, and fluorescent biomarkers, and may hold the key for understanding why the genetic alphabet is composed of only four nucleobases.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In particular, the notion that light is a driving force of change is essential to understanding the chemical origins of life on Earth. The nucleic acid bases that we know today are thought to have originated from simple precursors also referred to as proto-biotic RNA. These molecular ancestors of RNA/DNA may have formed from a vast number of organic compounds found on early Earth and/or delivered by meteorite infall. Understanding the evolution of chemical synthesis ranging from those precursors to today's canonical nucleobases modified by light is essential in answering fundamental questions about the chemical origins of life and practical applications for the development of fluorescent biomarkers and phototherapeutic agents.</p>\n<p>The PI's group examined whether rational functionalization of pyrimidine and purine could be used to control the emissive and intersystem crossing decay pathways in the nucleobases. The ubiquitous presence of pyrimidine and its amino and carbonyl substituents, make the pyrimidine and purine moieties exceptional candidates to investigate why nature settled upon five RNA/DNA building blocks to encode the genetic material of life, as we know it. For the canonical RNA/DNA monomers, the PI's group and others have shown that absorption of ultraviolet (UV) light results in the ultrafast dissipation of the excess energy to the surrounding environment as the primary relaxation mechanism, making them highly photostable to UV light. The PI's group also revealed that direct excitation of uracil RNA derivatives results in a competitive population of long-lived electronic states with singlet and triplet multiplicity. The PI's group demonstrated that the removal or addition of amino or carbonyl groups at specific positions of the pyrimidine and purine moieties, radically modify the emissive and intersystem crossing pathways of the nucleobases, which significantly increases the probability of light-induced transformations. Therefore, it was shown that pyrimidine substituted with amino or carbonyl groups in the C<sub>2</sub> and purine derivatives substituted in the C<sub>6</sub> position, respectively, can be simultaneously used as fluorescent biomarkers and light-activating drugs (a.k.a., photosensitizers) for bioimaging and photodynamic applications. Of relevance to the chemical origins of life and prebiotic chemistry, the results also demonstrated that amino or carbonyl substitution at the position C<sub>4</sub> of the pyrimidine or position C<sub>6</sub> of the purine moiety plays a key role in controlling the ultrafast dissipation of the absorbed UV light and their stability.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;As part of this NSF award, the PI's group also demonstrated that the substitution of oxygen atoms in the exocyclic carbonyl groups of cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil derivatives by sulfur atoms results in a remarkable change in their photochemical properties. Thionation of the DNA/RNA bases shifts their absorption spectra to longer wavelengths by up to 100 nm; increases the yields of reactive electronic states by nearly two orders of magnitude to yields that approach unity; and leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species in aqueous solutions. Given these remarkable observations, the PI's group also investigated the phototherapeutic efficacy of the sulfur-substituted DNA/RNA derivatives for the treatment of cancer cells. The results led to the discovery of several DNA/RNA derivatives exhibiting high efficacy for the treatment of several types of cancer cells (<em>USA Patent</em>, Appl. #<em> </em>16573682).</p>\n<p>The scientific results of this project have been disseminated in more than 30 peer-reviewed scientific articles in widely accessible journals.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> Training and mentoring of students was an integral part of our group's broader impact.
