 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the formation and growth of new particles in the atmosphere.  Laboratory experiments will be conducted to measure changes in the rate of new particle formation and growth with changes in composition, temperature, and relative humidity.  The results are expected to lead to improved accuracy in predicting the impacts of new particle formation on climate, health and visibility.\r\n\r\nLaboratory research includes experiments to: (1) conduct measurements of nucleation rates in the ammonia - H2SO4 system as a function of reagent concentrations and temperature; (2) conduct measurements of the synergistic effect of ammonia on nucleation rates for the amine - H2SO4 system at low H2SO4 concentrations; (3) characterize growth rates using a Photolytic Flow Reactor with growth via H2SO4 and using a second flow reactor with growth agents injected in the vapor phase; (4) measure the nanoparticle size-dependency of the growth capabilities of select organic compounds; (5) estimate absolute growth rates (i.e., uptake efficiency) by incorporating measured gas-phase concentrations into model simulations; and (6) explore the capability of the Photolytic Flow Reactor as a tool for understanding growth via uptake of complex secondary oxidation products such as are produced in photo-oxidation of alpha-pinene.\r\n\r\nThe Principal Investigator (PI) plans to use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the flow reactor to bolster the interpretation of the experimental results.  The CFD simulations allow for estimates of the free energies of small molecular clusters and extrapolations of the results to conditions in other experiments so that nucleation rates can be compared.  The PI intends to compare the results from this project with global atmospheric particle formation measurements from the CERN CLOUD project.\r\n\r\nThe project will help develop undergraduate research capabilities by exposing undergraduates to high-level experimental and computational work that will prepare them for careers in science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNucleation experiments were performed using sulfur dioxide photooxidation as a source of sulfuric acid molecules and, in another apparatus, particle growth experiments were performed with a number of organic compounds, primarily biogenic, that underwent gas-phase oxidation.  The results of these experiments have provided new baseline measurements of nucleation rates in the sulfuric acid - water system and the sulfuric acid - amine systems (particularly ammonia and dimethylamine).  From kinetic models of these photoxidation flow reactors, we provided (1) empirical Gibbs energies for sulfuric acid molecular clusters with water and with amines and (2) secondary organic aerosol yields for a number of organic compounds.   \n\nSeveral undergraduate students received training and experienced doing research during the lifetime of this project.  Four faculty members at our primarily undergraduate institute (Augsburg University) branched out in their research goals and furthered their academic scholarship credentials.  \n\nIn addition to the primary results of our work, we reported the detection of a number of peroxy radicals and nitrates in the photooxidation of alpha-pinene, a common atmospheric organic compound.  This detection was accomplished using chemical ionization mass spectrometry using water-proton ions.  We compare an example mass spectrum from our work to that from an early work using a similar detector (green X's, A. Lee, 2006) and to that from a recent work (purple triangles, B. Lee 2023) that used a newly-developed high-resolution mass spectrometer system (see the attached image).  All of the masses we observed were also reported in the other work, despite wide variations in the experimental conditions.  We observed several species that had much higher intensities than that reported in the B. Lee work.

Our PTrMS system has usefulness in detecting peroxy radicals in chemical systems that do not require high resolution detection, such as in the laboratory with controlled oxidation conditions. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/29/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David R Hanson"
