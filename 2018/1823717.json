 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thermokarst lakes that form when permafrost thaws and subsides are common features in Arctic regions. Recently, these lakes have been identified as providing a key pathway for methane release to the atmosphere. However, quantifying these fluxes has remained elusive. The purpose of this project is to connect direct observations of lake methane gas emissions, local geophysical mapping of these emissions, and regional-scale satellite-based observations, to improve the quantification and scaling of methane gas release from Arctic thaw lakes.\r\n\r\nRapid and non-invasive ground-based geophysical measurements will be taken to describe thermokarst lake methane emissions, develop relationships between lake expansion and methane emissions, and then use Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery to scale the results to large regions. The synergy of direct, geophysical, and remote sensing measurements will provide linked, multi- scale observations not previously available. The outcomes of this work have implications for understanding global carbon budgets, Arctic engineering, and the development of environmental monitoring methods. Furthermore, this research will provide additional validation to the Ground Penetrating Radar and Synthetic Aperture Radar methods, benefit their respective development fields, and encourage more widespread application of these methods across the Arctic. This project includes outreach efforts to local communities that will result in summaries of the scientific results for general dissemination. Graduate and undergraduate students will be mentored throughout the research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Permafrost is estimated to store ~ 20% of the total terrestrial carbon, and high-latitude lakes are responsible for about two-thirds of natural methane emissions. Thermokarst lakes and drained thermokarst lake basins may occupy as much as 80% of the Arctic lowland landscape in permafrost regions. Methane production and ebullition from the bed of thermokarst lakes occurs year-round, but as the lake ice forms during the winter, ebullition gas bubbles (diameter typically in centimeters to decimeters scale) become trapped throughout the ice column as well as underneath the ice. Ebullition gas bubbles trapped in lake ice are thought to be the key factor that drives variability in the physical properties of lake ice.<br /><br />The main purpose of this project was to study if ground penetrating radar (GPR) measurements made in the field on the surface of lakes could reveal information about the properties and thicknesses of lake ice that could be used to validate and scale regional satellite remote sensing estimate of methane gas flux. Measurements of the properties and geometries of Arctic lake ice are valuable for learning about ice growth processes related to climate, ice road engineering, and the study of lake hydrology. There is need for quantitative methods to make estimates of lake ice thickness, gas/bubble content, and liquid (unfrozen) water content at local scales, with the potential for extension to larger scales compatible with remotely sensed observations. GPR is a non-invasive geophysical measurement well suited to acquire lake ice radar velocity data and measurements of ice thickness. GPR measurements were conducted on ten North Slope thermokarst lakes and two Interior Alaska lakes during the spring field seasons when ice thickness is near maximum. We also looked at the evolution of the lake morphology to understand how rapidly lakes may be thawing laterally into adjacent carbon-rich permafrost.<br /><br />The key outcome of this project was that there is more complexity in ice physical properties than expected, and that it was not possible to replicate past remotely sensed methane flux estimates using GPR. This was primarily due to the observation that more than 50% of the field GPR measurements revealed radar velocities in the ice lower than for pure ice &ndash; this could only occur if there were a material within the ice that would suppress the bulk velocity of the ice, and we interpret that must indicate small amounts of liquid water are present. Limited observations with borehole nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) suggested corroborating evidence of liquid water content.
