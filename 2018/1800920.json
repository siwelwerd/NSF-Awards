 "awd_abstract_narration": "A recent study by Randstad US found that interest in STEM education declines as students get older. Additionally, eleven- to seventeen-year-old students were unclear about what jobs related to STEM subjects: 49% did not know what kind of math jobs exist and 76% did not know what engineers do. Only 22% of girls in comparison to 465 of boys named technology as a favorite subject and girls were 34% more likely to say STEM jobs are hard to understand. Students' perceptions about technology and engineering start early. This project aims to change perceptions through targeted activities for students and families, together with professional development for educators.  The overall goal is to increase the number of skilled individuals, especially women, in targeted technology and engineering fields.\r\n\r\nThis project will engage students, parents/guardians, and high school teachers and staff to accomplish two principal goals: (1) to improve understanding and perception of technology and engineering careers, and the educational pathways involved in those careers; and (2) to increase the number and diversity of technicians available for the workforce. The motivating rationale for this project comes from four main sources: 1) feedback from area high schools; 2) a literature review of perceptions on STEM fields and why students pursue careers in these fields; 3) industry and workforce needs; and 4) results of integrating Problem Based Learning and Gender Equity at Ashville-Buncombe Technical Community College over the past five years. Industry partners will offer mentorships, speakers, advisory board members, and tours. Recruitment and relationship building with females will be supported by the Ambassador's program. High school personnel will receive \"intrusive engagement\" related to gender equity, ensuring marketing and classroom engagement is inviting to all students, including women and minorities. Events will be held both on the Ashville-Buncombe Technical Community College campus and at high schools (e.g., early-release day presentations; in-service day presentations; and departmental meetings).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
