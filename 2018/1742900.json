 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the U.S. Committee on Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (USNC/TAM), organized and supported by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The committee will represent the U.S. in the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM) and serve as a focal point to chart future priorities in mechanics based research, applications and education. USNC/TAM promotes new research directions and provides opportunities and experiences for both practitioners and early career faculty in the field of mechanics. USNC/TAM will encourage, foster and facilitate activities that engage U.S. scientists and engineers domestically and internationally. The Committee also advances the economic competitiveness of the U.S. through a comprehensive series of activities that focus on diverse groups such as early career researchers. Interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research and an improvement in racial and gender diversity of the committee are additional foci for this effort. Thus, through these efforts, USNC/TAM will promote the progress of the field of mechanics; advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; and secure the national defense.\r\n\r\nThis award supports the core functions of the USNC/TAM including IUTAM dues, travel support to the biannual IUTAM General Assemblies, and support for an annual USNC/TAM committee meeting. Specific opportunities to be enabled by the Committee include the U.S. National Congresses of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, National Academies' workshops, IUTAM and AmeriMech symposia, travel experiences, and mentoring breakfasts for early career researchers. The Committee will also reach out to diverse communities through videos in YouTube and Vimeo, social media announcements, professional society newsletters, and livestreaming workshops.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
