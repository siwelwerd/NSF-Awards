 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computing on personal data is critical for both personal and social good. For example, we write programs that predict early onset medical conditions and detect the spread of diseases before they become epidemics. However, such computing is fraught with privacy concerns because programs, and the hardware they run on, create a trail of clues that an attacker can observe to reconstruct personal data without ever seeing the data directly. This project will create computer systems that proactively leave no clues, i.e., no side-effects that can leak personal secrets.\r\n\r\nThe technical approach is to introduce a new Oblivious Instruction Set Architecture (OISA) for side-channel secure execution. The key idea in OISAs is to decouple the programming model from the concrete techniques that prevent information leaks. The first project thrust will investigate a range of Oblivious instructions---from simple oblivious instructions like an oblivious conditional move or oblivious load to more complex instructions like oblivious sort or floating point operations---to improve performance. The second project thrust will investigate how each of these instructions can be ported across threat models, e.g., digital and power side channels.\r\n\r\nBy decoupling threat model from programming model, OISAs will unlock innovation on both software and hardware fronts. Programmers can focus on identifying secret variables that are intrinsic to applications, while abstracting out micro-architecture and threat model details. Hardware architects can focus on how to efficiently protect those secrets, and how to patch existing implementations when new threats emerge. To support this philosophy, the project will train a new class of students and researchers who can work across circuits, micro-architecture, compilers and applied cryptography to build secure systems and, in the future, apply the lessons learned to other high-impact problems that require cross-layer solutions.\r\n\r\nThe OISA project will store all publications, code, and data-sets on public-facing websites, hosted at both University of Texas and Illinois for at least 3 years after the end of the project. This information will be made available via commercial websites. Links to these websites will be mirrored at http://spark.ece.utexas.edu/oisa and http://cwfletcher.net/oisa.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project developed new computer interfaces for passing security-relevant information from programs to the processors they run on.  The key observation made in the project is that it is possible to get all of performance, security and simplicity of reasoning in a single interface.  By passing abstract but explicit security-related information down to the hardware, the hardware has sufficient information to apply protections to data that needs protecting.  At the same time, this same style of interface leaves enough about the implementation undefined so that hardware can innovate/performance optimize (just subject to the constraint that security isn't violated) and software can easily reason about the guarantees it will be getting.\n\nIntellectual Merit: The project led to a number of publications and awards at top conferences, on topics ranging from how to build secure hardware and novel ways that (in)secure hardware can leak privacy.  Ideas from the project seeded a large collaboration with industry to study microarchitectural (hardware) security.\n\n\nBroader Impacts: Multiple students interned in industry as a result of the project, and several achieved full-time positions.  The project further enabled multiple all-day conference tutorials to disseminate ideas with the broader academic/industry community.  Finally, the project was the foundation for a hardware security course developed at UIUC which itself seeded material in courses at several other universities (e.g., MIT).\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/06/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christopher Fletcher"
