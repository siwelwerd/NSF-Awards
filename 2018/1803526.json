 "awd_abstract_narration": "Category 4 Hurricane Harvey, the most intense wind and rain event to strike Texas in 56 years, made landfall on August 25, 2017, with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph and a storm surge of over 2 m. In addition, the hurricane brought 30-50 inches of rain and caused record-breaking freshwater flooding throughout southeastern Texas, inundating large tracts of coastal marshes with flood waters from rivers and the Gulf of Mexico. Severe freshwater flooding also occurred in inland fluvial wetlands along the Brazos, Trinity, and San Bernard Rivers. Harvey provides an excellent opportunity to study the sedimentary signatures of a rare wind-and-rain event and to estimate its return period by documenting past similar event deposits in the geological record. In addition, there is growing public awareness of the detrimental effects of climate change, particularly in coastal areas threatened by accelerated sea-level rise. This research will help determine whether coastal marshes can survive rising sea-level by providing new information on the role of hurricanes in contributing sediment to marshes, causing accretion and counteracting relative elevation loss due to sea-level rise. This is a collaborative project by research teams at Louisiana State University and the University of North Texas encompassing the complete sedimentary impacts of Hurricane Harvey along a coastal (saltwater)-to-fluvial (freshwater) transect across southeastern Texas.\r\n\r\nStudies conducted to date suggest that hurricanes are major contributors to marsh growth, with the\r\nmagnitude of Hurricane sedimentation (millions of metric tons) exceeding annual riverine and coastal sediment inputs, but the topic is still debated.  Through marsh coring along the freshwater to marine transect, this study?s main objectives include: (i) documenting the magnitude, character and extent of washover and flood sedimentation in coastal marshes in southeast Texas, and (ii) to measure the magnitude and inland extent of washover sedimentation in the lee of foredune barriers to evaluate whether relatively subtle increases in barrier dimensions can cause substantial reductions in the magnitude of washover sedimentation in marshes. The study will inform coastal management agencies on the use of barriers to block or reduce storm overwash, potentially reducing washover sediment magnitude and inland extent in adjacent marshes, at a time when such sedimentation may be a crucial factor in survivability of marshes in the face of accelerating sea-level rise. This study also aims at producing centuries-to-millennia-long multi-proxy records of hurricane-generated extreme events for southeastern Texas. These long-term records are vital for estimating the return period of such extreme events as Harvey and is critically important for hurricane- and flood-risk assessments and coastal management decision-making.",

The hurricane generated storm surge sedimentation along the Texas coast, which is a common feature of intense hurricanes. Less commonly, the hurricane also generated rainfall-induced flood waters inland which drained to the coast and deposited flood sediments in coastal marshes and estuarine environments. A better understanding of the role of hurricanes in coastal sedimentation?whether by freshwater flooding or by saltwater overwash?is important in view of the threat of marsh submergence posed by accelerating sea-level rise. The two main goals of the study were to characterize and quantify the flood sedimentation and to use multiproxy techniques, including X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF), to discriminate terrestrial and marine sediments. &nbsp;At San Bernard National Wildlife Refuge, the XRF technique tentatively identified saltwater intrusion resulting from the hurricane?s storm surge in cores taken from a predominantly freshwater marsh. This is a promising result and further work is planned to test and refine the XRF technique. At McFaddin National Wildlife Refuge, terrestrial floodwaters, draining from inland, raised coastal water levels and deposited a muddy flood deposit over much of the marsh, ranging up to 7 cm in thickness. Comparison of the flood deposit thickness to long-term sedimentation rates in the marsh suggests that the flood sedimentation was the equivalent of seven years of ?normal? sedimentation. This result demonstrates that terrestrial flood sedimentation plays a significant role in aggradation of coastal marshes ? this is valuable new information, particularly in view of the threat posed to coastal marshes by accelerating sea-level rise. The study results improve our understanding of marsh sedimentation sources, pathways and rates. In turn, this information provides a better basis for decision-making by coastal management agencies. This study included participation by two post-doctoral students and seven graduate students. To date, the study has generated two refereed journal articles and six conference presentations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/06/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Harry&nbsp;F&nbsp;Williams</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1803526/1803526_10525325_1575648528453_FIGURE4(2)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1803526/1803526_10525325_1575648528453_FIGURE4(2)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Suspended sediment plumes at McFaddin NWR.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1803526/1803526_10525325_1575648528453_FIGURE4(2)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Suspended sediment plumes at McFaddin NWR.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Rapid response imagery acquired on August 31, 2017, showing plumes of suspended sediment being carried by flood waters into marshes on MNWR.
