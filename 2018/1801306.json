 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increased participation in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) is an area of national concern, especially as enrollment in STEM disciplines and development of the STEM workforce is not keeping pace with the need. This is particularly true in the geosciences where the lack of diversity compounds the problem. This Geosciences Streamlined Pipeline And Research for Community Colleges (Geo-SPARCC) at Mississippi State University (MSU) fills a gap in the awareness of and education in the geosciences through collaboration with the State's community colleges. Mississippi is a rural state with a strong community college system, enrolling greater than 75,000 students, ~42% from underrepresented groups (majority African American). Mississippi State University collaborates with Jones County Junior College to develop engaging online versions of introductory geology courses, which will be available to all community college students through Mississippi's Virtual Community College Consortium. The Geo-SPARCC project also develops an e-mentoring network to recruit community college students to consider geosciences degrees and careers, and facilitate their transfer into a 4-year university. The MS Virtual Community College Consortium fosters sustainability of Geo-SPARCC and has the potential to help significantly increase the number of underserved and underrepresented populations in the geosciences.\r\n\r\nThe Geosciences Streamlined Pipeline And Research for Community Colleges (Geo-SPARCC) project proposes a collaboration between Mississippi State University (MSU) and Mississippi's community colleges (CCs) to develop a pathway from 2 year to 4 year institutions via online instruction and e-mentoring. Geo-SPARCC will 1) interest/recruit CC students in geosciences through engaging online physical/historical geology courses; 2) provide individualized research and field opportunities within online courses; and 3) develop an e-mentoring/social media program between MSU Geosciences faculty/graduate students and CC students. Jones County Junior College (JCJC), the lead CC on the Geo-SPARCC project, will make Geo-SPARCC's online geology courses available through the Mississippi Virtual Community College (MSVCC), providing access for students at all 15 Mississippi CCs as well as MS high school students in dual enrollment courses. The Geo-SPARCC online courses will include personalized research/field components where students conduct independent research and geocaching, and opportunities to participate in MSU Geosciences-led field excursions. Career video vignettes included in the online course design will introduce students to geosciences employment opportunities. Geo-SPARCC further provides CC students with directed individual study research opportunities that can culminate in student presentations at the Mississippi Academy of Science annual conference. Sustainability is ensured since the Geo-SPARCC online courses will be offered in perpetuity by JCJC through the MSVCC, with MSU collaborating with JCJC beyond the Geo-SPARCC project to provide credentialed adjunct instructors to teach the online courses.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Since many Mississippians begin their higher education at a community college, Geo-SPARCC developed online physical and historical geology lecture and laboratory courses, hosted by Jones College, and made available to <em>all </em>community college students through the Mississippi Virtual Community College consortium.

Units also include \"Meet a Geoscientist\" videos that showcase potential geoscience career opportunities. Each unit requires students to move beyond the confines of their computer and apply geological content. For example, physical geology students search for local examples of mass wasting and build slime glaciers, while historical geology students find fossils in local Paleozoic gravel and calculate the amount of salt deposited when the Gulf of Mexico was formed. Students must complete a field project by either joining an excursion with their video instructors and/or professional geoscientists or investigating their local area through geocaching. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Through Spring 2023, a total of 121<strong> </strong>students from four Mississippi community colleges enrolled in the interactive, online courses, with some students later transferring to a university to major in Earth Science or Geology.
