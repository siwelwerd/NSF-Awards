 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum (BPBM) is the world's largest repository of biological material from Hawaii and the Pacific region.  This collection represents a historical record of the many species that have been lost to extinction in this ecologically sensitive region, and also serves as an invaluable tool for research on the rich biodiversity resource that remains.  This project will support acquisition of modern cabinets and containers for two of BPBM's natural history collections, Vertebrate Zoology (VZ) and Invertebrate Zoology (IZ), that are urgently needed to rescue specimens from deteriorating cabinets and inadequate shelving, and remain inaccessible to the scientific community because there is no secure space to properly house them.  The project will also improve the quality and accessibility of the specimen information within the collections' electronic databases.  During the award period, researchers will be providing twelve STEM undergraduate interns and eight high school students with training in collections care and taxonomy, as well as career mentoring. This collaboration will strengthen the museum's relationship with local educational institutions and increase public engagement with science, technology, and Hawaii's unique natural history. \r\n\r\nDuring this two-year project, 64 new cabinets will be installed to provide improved storage for 43,800 specimens and 9,051 specimen lots.  The improvements will relieve hazardous overcrowding and allow for the completion of long needed curatorial projects.  While cataloged specimens are pulled from old cabinets and placed into new ones, their corresponding data records will be cleaned, updated, and expanded.  Other material will be digitized anew, including an estimated 10,000 specimens from the VZ collection and 4,000 specimen lots from the IZ collection.  Researchers and educators across the globe will be able to access new and updated records via BPBM's website and other online data aggregators, including VertNet, iDigBio, and GBIF.  Additionally, each specimen that is touched during this process will receive a QR code.  These codes will vastly improve the ability of staff to locate specimens within the collections and track specimens as they are used for research and outreach.  The transfer of specimens from old to new equipment also presents an ideal opportunity to assess the conservation status of each specimen.  With help from BPBM's assistant conservator, the specimens will receive the care and attention to maintain their integrity well into the future.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The IZ and VZ collections collaborated on this project to improve the quality, safety, and longevity of their resources, as well as increase the accessibility of invaluable specimens to the scientific and educational communities. Specimens affected by this project included avian skins, mounts, eggs, and nests, as well as mammal skeletons, VZ subfossils, and IZ Hawaiian marine invertebrates, including all of the IZ type specimens. In total, 21,300 physical specimens and 9,051 specimen lots were successfully installed into new cabinets and their associated digital records were either created or updated. Space was also created for 22,500 VZ subfossils, which can now be returned from decades-old loans to the Smithsonian Institution. Additionally, a new Marine Invertebrate Taxonomic Reference Library was created, with digital references that are now freely available to the scientific community.</p>\n<p>This grant allowed these collections to acquire the modern cabinets and containers necessary to eliminate risks posed by old equipment and to create new, permanent storage solutions for backlogged material. Over the course of this project, 64 new cabinets were installed, which increased the storage capacity from 1,446.2 ft<sup>3</sup> to 2,111.4 ft<sup>3</sup>. These new cabinets provide secure housing for specimens previously held in unsafe, overcrowded, or temporary storage conditions (per IMLS conservation survey, 2011). The need for this grant was urgent, as a significant number of specimens in VZ and IZ, including irreplaceable types, were stored in cabinets that were too small, deteriorating, and hazardous to their long-term survivability.</p>\n<p>In addition to securing physical specimens, this grant also allowed both collections to increase the amount of information available for scientific research and improve the quality of existing digital records. Prior to this award, roughly 10,000 VZ sub-fossil specimens and 4,533 IZ Hawaiian marine invertebrate lots were uncatalogued and stored in substandard, temporary containers. During this project, they were transferred to archival storage containers, curated, digitized, assigned QR codes, and organized within the new cabinets. This resulted in thousands of backlogged specimens and their associated data becoming newly available through data portals, including iDigBio, VertNet, and GBIF, as well as BPBM?s data website. In addition, 16,351 existing IZ and VZ digital records were verified and upgraded during the course of the project.</p>\n<p>In addition to improving access to specimens and their data, we were able to expand access to scientific literature by creating a physical and digital comprehensive Marine Invertebrate Taxonomic Reference Library. The physical reference library holds unique and singular copies of marine invertebrate references. The corresponding digital reference library (created in Endnote) now has over 9,600 references, including all IZ type specimen publications. The library will continue to grow, and all digital references are available to the scientific community at no cost.</p>\n<p>The new cabinets also provided space to properly house IZ and VZ Teaching Collection specimens that were previously without a permanent home. They have an enormous impact for students and the general public when used for in-house or off-campus educational outreach. Having these resources stored in one secure area allows for better management and planning for future growth.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">Due to COVID, our ability to recruit students during the course of the grant was limited.

Each participant was trained in collections care techniques and taxonomy while assisting with essential collection upgrades. Students also received mentoring in the educational and career opportunities available in a museum setting. The participation of these students strengthened the museum?s relationship with local educational institutions and increased public engagement with science, technology, and Hawaii?s natural history.
