 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physical characteristics of animals can help determine which ones survive and flourish, especially in a changing environment. These characteristics, also known as functional traits, include features such as length, height, shape, weight, growth rate, sex, and reproductive state. Studying these traits provides insights into how communities of different types of animals come together and how species and communities respond to changes in their environment over time, which is critical for conservation efforts. However, very little information about functional traits is available, and what is available is difficult to combine with other data. How these traits are influenced by environmental changes - such as climate change, pollution, urbanization and human predation - and how they shift over longer timescales are poorly understood, and the need for this information is outstripping the speed with which scientists can collect these data. Digitized collections of animals representing life from the past two million years contain a treasure trove of information about these individuals' functional traits, but these data are stored in multiple places and in different formats. Researchers may have recorded dates differently, for example, or used a variety of terms to describe a single physical feature. Making these data widely available in standardized formats could help scientists study changes in functional traits through time, linking their observations of traits of modern animals to those from fossil and archaeological records. The Functional Trait Resource for Environmental Studies (FuTRES) project will gather trait data from digitized records; to engage communities of researchers to make these data available, standardized, and useable; and to develop a more complete workflow for using these data in research. \r\n\r\nFunctional trait data have revolutionized ecology and are transforming paleontology, but acquiring them requires extensive labor, not only in measuring traits but in managing and communicating the resulting data. When trait data are lacking, researchers substitute average values, or other characteristics like behavioral or dietary categories. These substitutes - assigned at the species level - obscure intraspecific changes in traits. FuTRES fills the clear need for informatics tools that give researchers access to existing trait data and a place to store new data as they are generated. FuTRES is assembling a varied collection of existing trait data, building a pipeline that converts data to an integrated, semantically enriched form, and developing an Application Programming Interface (API) and web platform to serve the data. One of the key innovations of FuTRES is the use of ontologies, an information science approach that creates computer-readable definitions of traits and describes the interrelationships of traits, organisms, collecting events, and other entities. In this way, FuTRES will make functional trait data searchable through reference to time, space, and vertebrate anatomy.  FuTRES will also provide access to trait data via popular data portals (e.g., VertNet) and software such as R, opening the data to scientists in biodiversity and other domains. The toolkit will be tested with mammalian use cases that leverage the massive scale of the unlocked data.  In sum, newly created access mechanisms and tools will provide novel approaches for analyses of trait variation across space and time, providing researchers in disparate fields discovery capabilities for relevant data that would otherwise have been invisible to them.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Florida FuTRES NSF Outcomes report by Robert Guralnik (09/29/2023), traits are the measurable attributes of morphological, physiological, behavioral, and life-history characteristics of organisms that directly interact with the environment. They serve as a measure of how organisms respond to changing environmental conditions and how species differentiate and give rise to present and past diversity. Thus, understanding variation of traits within and among species through time and across space is central to many questions in biology. Many resources assemble species-level trait data and can answer questions about species differences, but the data and metadata underlying those trait measurements at the individual level are often not reported leaving a knowledge hiatus within species variation and how that variation scales to the community level. FuTRES (Functional Trait Resource for Environmental Studies) was created to develop a community-based individual-level trait reporting that utilizes a semantic framework. Collaborative PI Bernor was charged with refining and expanding his integrated equid measurement database and developing an equid user base. The equid database expansion included specimen identification, taxonomy, recording standardized equid measurements for all skeletal elements.&nbsp; The metric database was integrated with a locality database including 300 country-locality combinations. Publications resulting from use of this database addressed species taxonomy, diversity, phylogeny, geochronologic ages, biogeographic ranges, hypsodonty (evolution of crown height), paleodiet and paleoecology, integration with paleoclimatic data, methods for body mass estimation, and functional anatomical differences between 3-toed and 1-toed horses leading to the replacement of 3-toed by 1-toed horses in the Pleistocene. The FuTRES database program published a total of 38 journal articles (with 1 additional submission), of which 31 were publications on the Bernor-led equid program.&nbsp; The ABI program required the FuTRES database initiative to enlist 40 users; the equid portion contributed a total of 69 authors with 42 authors contributing 14 articles in a 2020 Frontiers Research Topic <em>Examining Evolutionary Trends in </em>Equus <em>and its close relatives </em>and a 19 author contribution to a Biology Special Issue on Paleontology in the 21<sup>st</sup> century (Schweitzer and Kaya, eds., 2021).&nbsp; These two multi-authored sets of publications advanced our understanding of the diversity and evolution of Equini (Hipparionini and Equini) substantially and led to new, productive PI collaborations in North &amp; South America, Eurasia and Africa; several other multi-authored equid publications also were realized.&nbsp; In addition, Bernor engaged 8 Howard University student trainees who across 3 years attended a series of seminars aimed at educating them about a range of topics on the anatomical bases of evolutionary biology.&nbsp; Through this grant interval, the Bernor equid database has grown to 26,284 measurement records from 300 localities.&nbsp; Acquisition of additional records is ongoing with plans to publish the database with its prime movers in the near future.&nbsp; The FuTRES equid program included the training of Dr. Omar Cirilli (University of Pisa, Italy) with follow-on postdoctoral research fellowship at Howard University.&nbsp; Dr. Cirilli has secured an additional postdoctoral research fellowship at the ICP, Barcelona Spain where he continues research on North American, Eurasian and African hipparionines and equines and continues to collaborate with Bernor and international colleagues. FuTRES as a whole coordinated interdisciplinary collaboration focused on mammal traits held multiple workshops, facilitating new connections among communities that often operate in isolation.&nbsp; FuTRES explicitly focused on support for early career scientists to become involved. Despite the new collaborative contexts fostered by the workshops, a minimum number of publications have yet to be realized beyond the equid working group.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 06/10/2024<br>\nModified by: Raymond&nbsp;L&nbsp;Bernor</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1759882/1759882_10545189_1717789159865_2.FuTRESEquidContributors_6_7_2024ONLY_Page_1--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1759882/1759882_10545189_1717789159865_2.FuTRESEquidContributors_6_7_2024ONLY_Page_1--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"2.FuTRESEquidContributors6_7_2024ONLY\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1759882/1759882_10545189_1717789159865_2.FuTRESEquidContributors_6_7_2024ONLY_Page_1--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"2.FuTRESEquidContributors6_7_2024ONLY\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">EquidContributors1-48</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Raymond Louis Bernor</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Raymond&nbsp;L&nbsp;Bernor\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2.FuTRESEquidContributors6_7_2024ONLY</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1759882/1759882_10545189_1717789227912_2.FuTRESEquidContributors_6_7_2024ONLY_Page_2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1759882/1759882_10545189_1717789227912_2.FuTRESEquidContributors_6_7_2024ONLY_Page_2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"2.FuTRESEquidContributors6_7_2024ONLY\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1759882/1759882_10545189_1717789227912_2.FuTRESEquidContributors_6_7_2024ONLY_Page_2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"2.FuTRESEquidContributors6_7_2024ONLY\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">FuTRESEquidContributors49-69</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Raymond Louis Bernor</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Raymond&nbsp;L&nbsp;Bernor\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2.FuTRESEquidContributors6_7_2024ONLY</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1759882/1759882_10545189_1717791697137_FuTRES_Publications___Talks_6_7_2024__s30_39_Page_1--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1759882/1759882_10545189_1717791697137_FuTRES_Publications___Talks_6_7_2024__s30_39_Page_1--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"3.FuTRESEquidPublications31-39\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1759882/1759882_10545189_1717791697137_FuTRES_Publications___Talks_6_7_2024__s30_39_Page_1--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"3.FuTRESEquidPublications31-39\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">39-31</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Raymond Louis Bernor</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Raymond&nbsp;L&nbsp;Bernor\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">3.FuTRESEquidPublications31-39</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
