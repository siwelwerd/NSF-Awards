 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) program, this project will support high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need at Weber State University. Over the five years of funding, this project will provide scholarships to 30 students who are pursuing bachelor's degrees in the physical sciences including chemistry, geoscience, mathematics, physics, computer science, and engineering. The program will also support the Scholars through graduation with a system of academic support services that emphasizes the development of community leadership and involvement. Scholars will complete their coursework in cohorts, attend a weekly STEM seminar course, meet regularly with faculty mentors, and participate in leadership opportunities. The goal of the project is to improve the four-year graduation rate of the Scholars from 12% to 50%.  Moreover, the project will investigate and assess which interventions are the most significant to improve student success and persistence to degree completion for this population of students. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to lower the unmet financial need of low-income, high-achieving students, and implement evidence-based interventions to enhance student success. The interventions include targeted recruitment to STEM degrees, student academic cohorts, STEM faculty mentors, and a STEM seminar course responsive to students as they progress through the program. An important aspect of the program is a consistent focus on engaging the Scholars in their community, including participation in community engaged learning projects.  By using student focus groups, the project will investigate students' perceptions of STEM careers and assess the effectiveness of these interventions within the context of regional student demographics. The research results will provide formative assessment to guide ongoing project improvements and will identify effective strategies for recruiting and retaining future students.  These results can also provide information to other institutions that aim to increase the participation and success of STEM students from diverse, low-income populations in which cultural or religious beliefs may discourage pursuit of a STEM degree.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Students who received scholarships and who were provided the various supports were called WEST Scholars. A total of 66 WEST Scholars received at least one semester scholarship of $2,500, 38% of them women. However, the majority of scholars received between a one year to 3 years of scholarships through the WEST program. Five scholars received between 4 to 5 years of scholarships. Of the $450,000 meant for scholarships, $433,018.25 was dispersed. Several challenges occurred during the grant period that impacted the number of scholars served. The first was that the COVID-19 pandemic occurred during the first and second years of the program closing the university temporarily, moving all courses online, and hampering recruiting efforts at high schools. In addition, it took several years to develop the best mechanism for identifying and recruiting low-income students. Originally, students needed to apply to be a part of the WEST program by writing an essay, obtaining letters of recommendation, and submitting a video. However, the leadership team determined after conducting focus groups with students that the application process was too cumbersome. In addition, the marketing of the scholarship through teachers, social media, and the website was not recruiting enough students. The more crucial challenge was that even when students were aware of the program and applied, not all students had financial need as determined by FAFSA criteria. Therefore, in the last two years of the grant, students were identified for the program by first having college advisors identify STEM majors and then having financial aid officers identify which of those students had financial need.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Graduation and Retention:&nbsp;</strong>As of Fall 2024, of the 66 scholars who received at least one semester of scholarship money, 36% (n=24) have graduated.

The remaining 23% (n=15) of scholars have left the program or university or are not registered for the Fall 2024 semester. It is important to note that given that this was a 5-year grant, depending on how many credit hours scholars had when they first started the WEST program, only scholars in the first 3 cohorts had the possibility of graduating within a 5-year period. Scholars receiving a scholarship within the last two years of the grant, are unlikely to have been able to graduate unless they were already seniors. These factors impact the calculation of graduation and retention rates.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Creation of cohorts:&nbsp;</strong>The challenge of the creation of cohorts became apparent within the first two years of the grant.

In addition, due to the small number of WEST Scholars, they were enrolled in a combined STEM seminar. The purpose of the seminar was to build a community among students and faculty in a welcoming environment and a way to create social connections among the students.
