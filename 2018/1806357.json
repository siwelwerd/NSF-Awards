 "awd_abstract_narration": "The quantum mechanical behavior of individual particles (such as atoms, molecules, or photons) is well understood.  The collective behavior of many such particles, however, is more complicated.  The latest generation of Atomic, Molecular, and Optical experiments have revealed a number of open questions about such \"emergent\" physics. This theoretical physics project aims to answer some of these questions.  In particular, it asks: \"Can noise be used as a tool to control the behavior of quantum systems?\"  and  \"How does order develop in quantum systems?\"  Answering these fundamental questions would have wide impact on the development of materials, novel electronic devices, and quantum information processing technology, all of which rely on the behavior of collections of particles.\r\n\r\nThere are two primary systems considered in these studies:  (a)  Light confined in optical cavities and (b) neutral atoms trapped in magnetic or optical potentials.  The former system is ideal for exploring questions involving quantum dissipation:  the central noise source, photon loss, is under experimental control.  The broad question of using dissipation for quantum control will be addressed by systematically developing protocols which produce ever more complicated non-classical optical states. The neutral atom systems are ideal for studying ordering and kinetics.  The project involves developing new computational tools (a generalization of the Density Matrix Renormalization Group), and combining these with the traditional tools of many-body physics to explore dynamics, equilibration, and ordering in isolated quantum systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit:\n\nSimple laws often emerge from collective behavior:  For example, to understand the motion of a stream one can use fluid dynamics, which is much simpler than following the motion of each individual water molecule.  This project studied a series of quantum systems in order to understand their collective behavior.  The results were published in 12 papers, and discussed at a number of scientific conferences.  \n\nSome of the most important results involved the origins of resistivity.  Resistivity is a collective phenomenon which quantifies how easily electrons move through a metal.  The resistivity of all metals grow with temperature:  Conventionally, the electron motion is converted into heat when electrons bounce off of out-of-place atoms.  At higher temperatures, where the atoms are jiggling around more, resistivity is higher because there are more opportunities for the electrons to scatter.  These ideas can be quantified, and the temperature dependence of resistivity follows well understood laws.  There are, however, materials which do not obey these laws.  These \"strange metals\" also display unusual low temperature behavior, such as superconductivity -- the sudden vanishing of resistivity below some critical temperature.  Understanding the origin of their unusual temperature dependent resistivity is expected to provide clues to technological advances, such as room temperature superconductivity or new forms of electronics.\n\nElectrons are very small, and move very fast -- so in order to probe the underlying microscopic physics, experimentalists at Princeton created a scaled model where lithium atoms play the role of electrons. In this artificial material they saw a temperature dependent resistivity which was identical to that seen in strange metals.   Mueller's team modeled these experiments, and were able to give a quantitative explanation of the strange metal behavior.\n\nBroader Impact:\n\nThis research has direct impact in Atomic Physics, Condensed Matter Physics, and Quantum Information.  It also could have implications for cosmology and the formation of structure in the early universe.  Three graduate students and five undergraduate students participated in the studies, developing important skills.  The PI coached a middle-school math club for girls, and conducted some preliminary research on measuring educational achievements in the classroom.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/13/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Erich J Mueller"
