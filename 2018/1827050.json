 "awd_abstract_narration": "As a small private university, Arcadia's existing computing infrastructure constrains the productivity of faculty in Bioinformatics, Computer Science, Chemistry, and Physics who are conducting data-intensive research. Specifically, the current infrastructure impedes researchers' ability to efficiently and securely access, share, or analyze large-data sets with collaborators at other institutions. To address these research and education needs, a collaborative team representing key university faculty and technologists at Arcadia is creating a Science DMZ with a data transmission network capable of 10Gbps connectivity (more than 10 times faster than current speeds) to the Keystone Initiative for Network Based Education and Research's (KINBER) PennREN network.\r\n\r\nProject's objectives are to: (1) provide high performance, secure Science DMZ network capabilities for sharing of large datasets and cloud-based education; (2) eliminate technical barriers for faculty engaged in data-intensive projects through a dedicated, friction-free path to Internet2, PennREN, and other high performance computing and data resources; (3) leverage authentication and authorization mechanisms to support our faculty through the InCommon Federation; and (4) enable future scientific possibilities and unleash innovation for students and faculty researchers. \r\n\r\nArcadia is currently considering to incorporate a data analytics requirement into its general curriculum and leverage the newly developed cyberinfrastructure to enable cloud-based opportunities, distance learning and researching on a global scale. This opportunity is supporting greater faculty and student analytical scholarship by forming a frictionless environment built to innovate and thrive in our technology-drive world.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
