 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nearly all of what is understood about how animals control their movement comes from studies of skeletal muscle under the control of the somatic motor branch of the nervous system - the same kinds of structures that allow humans to walk, grasp objects, and speak.  In addition to these systems, animals also control movement with smooth muscle, under the control of the autonomic motor branch of the nervous system - these are the muscles that allow people to sweat, blush, get goosebumps, and move food through the gut.  While these are generally considered \"low-level\" tasks that do not require complex control, birds use autonomic control of smooth muscle in the skin to position feathers for display, and even to control the position of wing feathers in flight.   Both of these tasks demand complex integration with other movements.  This Rules of Life proposal tests whether there are evolutionarily convergent control systems for smooth muscle and skeletal muscle motor control in bird.  The major obstacle to understanding how smooth muscles work in birds is technical.  The existing techniques to measure and control skeletal muscle activity cannot be used on smooth muscles.  This project will test the use of fiber-optic technology and drug interventions to measure and manipulate smooth muscle function in awake, behaving birds.  Investigating the control of smooth muscle in birds can provide a new window into muscle activity.  The broader implications of the work extend to the design of control systems, for example those of unmanned autonomous vehicles.  In addition to basic research, this project includes teacher training workshops that bring the biology and technology involved into high-school classrooms.\r\n\r\nThe overall objective of this project is to develop methods for recording and manipulating feather muscle activation in vivo.  The rationale is that the ability to assess feather muscle activity will open an entirely untapped pool of complex smooth-muscle motor behaviors for comparison to striated-muscle systems.  The overall objective will be attained by pursuing two specific aims. First, fiber-optic approaches to record feather muscle activity will be tested in vivo. Smooth muscle activity can currently only be measured reliably in vitro.  This set of studies tests the feasibility of fiber photometry with Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dyes to record the intracellular Ca2+ signaling events that drive muscle contraction in vivo. Second, the molecular basis for modulation and manipulation of feather muscles will be evaluated. Visceral smooth muscles (e.g., wall of gastrointestinal tract) exhibit several pathways that control contractile state, some of which are known to be shared with feather muscles.  This set of studies will use expression proteomics to determine the extent of differences in control pathways between feather musculature and visceral smooth muscle, then test indicated control pathway inhibitors to reveal which pathways can be used for targeted manipulation of feather muscle function in vivo.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFlight requires the highest power output of any form of animal locomotion, and this produces enormous heat loads in birds and bats.  This heat presents challenges to these animals, yet mechanisms for unloading this heat are not well understood in relation to animal flight.  The ability of birds to elevate and depress their body feathers should affect heat regulation.  Also, variation in feather elevation and depression should affect the aerodynamic forces (lift and drag) experienced by a bird\u2019s body during flight.  We undertook the present study to improve understanding of the role of body feathers upon thermoregulation in birds.  We tested the effects of ambient temperature upon thermoregulation after flights in pigeons.  We also experimentally manipulated the ability of the birds to control the elevation of the small feathers that cover their body.  We measured core body temperature using passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags inserted in the abdominal cavity and surface temperature using an infrared (IR) imaging video camera. Birds flew 10 times between perches in an environmental chamber at temperatures varying from -8 to 40 degrees C (17-104 degrees F). We measured temperatures pre and post flight. We temporarily stopped sympathetic (\"fight or flight\") neural activity supplying smooth muscles of the ventral feather tracts adjacent to the sternum using injections into the skill of a chemical that blocks neurotransmitter release (6-OHDA).  Intellectual merit emerges from our novel measures of thermoregulation, body posture and feather elevation.  Core temperatures in the birds varied from 39-45 degrees Celsius (102-113 degrees F) and the core body temperatures were affected by ambient temperature.  Flight activity significantly raised core temperatures at when ambient temperatures were at or above 23 degrees C (73 degrees F).  Treatment with 6-OHDA increased feather elevation at all ambient temperatures.  At moderate ambient temperature, treatment completely eliminated the heat dissipation area (HDA) over the ventral pectoralis, which is the primary flight muscle of birds.  In response, birds shifted heat dissipation to their beak and anterior head.  At an ambient temperature of 40 degrees C (104 degrees F), treated birds were incapable of dissipating body heat post flight.  These results provide new insight into the vital role of body feathers upon thermoregulation in flying birds and control of HDA\u2019s.  Our method for manipulating the activity of smooth muscles in the dermis may be useful for inducing changes to body and wing shape in future studies of the aerodynamics of bird flight.
