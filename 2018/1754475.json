 "awd_abstract_narration": "The influences of climate, soil types and topography on the distributions of plant species, communities and vegetation types are topics of long-standing interest in ecology. These topics have taken on renewed urgency in the context of changing environmental conditions and their impacts on conservation priorities. The type of plants and forests found in an area is largely determined by the amount of rainfall the area receives, its average temperature and its associated soils.  As the climate of an area changes, it is expected that the plants that make up a forest will change as it becomes more hospitable for some species and is no longer appropriate for the survival of others. This project uses a well-studied mountain system in coastal Northern California to examine how climate variability, extreme climate events, and changes in rainfall and temperature may influence the current and future structure of forests. The goal of this work is to determine which types of plant communities will undergo a more rapid change in the species that make up its members and which forests may be most resilient to change. This work will contribute to the conservation of forests through its work with a local nature preserve, as well as with resource management and conservation agencies.  This project will train community college students in a forestry program and will facilitate their transfer to four-year Universities.\r\n \r\n\r\nUsing well surveyed sites along a coastal mountain system, high resolution climate and vegetation layers, and species modeling approaches across large geographic ranges, this project examines the role that inter-annual climate variability, extreme events, and changing temperature and rainfall patterns have on current and future plant distribution patterns. The use of sites along north and south facing elevation gradients provides an opportunity to examine the relative effect of these changing environmental conditions on forests that vary in rainfall and temperature. This work will test the following three hypotheses to explain species turnover and changing distribution patterns: 1) the local refugia hypothesis which posits that cool/moist locations will buffer communities from changing climatic conditions, 2) the trailing/leading edge hypothesis which predicts that impacts will be greater in cool/moist locations, as these will be occupied by species that are approaching the edges of their climatic tolerances, and 3) the asymmetric propagule availability hypothesis which predicts that dispersal strategies associated with hot/dry and cool/moist areas will facilitate or limit the rate of change found in an area. This work addresses the critical linkages between individual species dynamics and community change in forest communities and will the inform how researchers and land managers understand the dynamic responses of ecosystems to rapid environmental change.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
