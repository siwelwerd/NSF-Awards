 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cosmic rays constantly bombard the atmosphere, yet key information regarding the processes of cosmic ray creation, acceleration, and propagation is lacking. However, candidate theoretical models have been developed to make testable predictions about cosmic ray parameters that are observable at Earth.  In order to test these models, precise experimental measurements of multiple elemental spectra of cosmic rays are needed from a single experiment across the full energy range.  Using the IceCube Neutrino Observatory (ICNO), the IceCube group at Marquette University will provide the cosmic ray community with the first measurement of the elemental spectra from four distinct mass groups from the 'knee' to the 'ankle' in the cosmic ray energy spectrum using six years of IceCube data, new post-LHC simulations, novel methods for event selection, reduced systematic errors, new software algorithms, and new composition-sensitive parameters.  The group will share their research with the broader Milwaukee community to help bridge the racial and socio-economic divide in one of the most highly segregated cities in the United States.  Under this award, they will go out into the community to inspire the diverse local high school student population with fun and interactive \"household physics\" projects and bring diverse high school students back to Marquette to expose them to \"big science\" job opportunities through an IceCube Master Class.  In order to increase awareness among high school students of physics as a strong and viable career path for students from all backgrounds, this work will be framed by an intercultural competency program to train Marquette students to interact and connect with their local community empathetically, increase their own intercultural competency, and to build a culture of compassion within the physics department to sustain the participation of women and underrepresented minorities in physics.\r\n\r\nThe ICNO is the only detector that can presently perform this highly sought measurement that includes an entire decade in energy where four elemental spectra have never been measured. This will provide a new and coherent picture across the entire transition region from galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays.  Further, the Marquette IceCube group will simulate and fully optimize the detector response and array layout for a new prototype scintillator array being partially deployed at the South Pole this season (2018-19) to maximize its effectiveness for the cosmic ray analyses.  This new array is designed to mitigate the problem of snow drift and accumulation that threatens the effectiveness of the current ICNO surface array (IceTop).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOverview:\n\nThe IceCube Neutrino Observatory (ICNO) at the geographic South Pole is capable of detecting cosmic rays, which constantly bombard us from outer space.  By measuring the energy and composition of these cosmic rays we can begin to determine where they come from and how they reach us on Earth. \n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit:\n\nThrough this award, we measured the energy and composition of cosmic rays using the first three years of the ICNO data across three decades in energy (PeV to EeV).  This energy range is theorized to cover the transition from galactic to extra galactic sources of cosmic rays and therefore is particularly interesting.  We then developed the necessary framework to analyze the next ten years of data.  Additionally, we worked to finalize the design for new scintillator detectors as part of the next generation surface array at the ICNO.  Finally, we recorded four years of data with new air Cherenkov telescope prototypes (IceAct) at the South Pole, which we will use to increase the precision and extend the energy range of the next composition measurements.  Due to our work, the ICNO will be able to measure cosmic ray composition across an unprecedented five decades in energy.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts:\n\nThis award reached several hundred members of the general public through public outreach talks, high school visits, hosting a masterclass, and participation in virtual after-school internship programs during the COVID-19 pandemic.  This award also allowed us to train two research associates and several undergraduate students: more than 50% of these trainees were from groups historically underrepresented in physics, and all them have successfully risen to the next level.  This award is changing the face of the field.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/19/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Karen Andeen"
