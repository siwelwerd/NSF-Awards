 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project at the University of Wyoming will engage multi-disciplinary teams of undergraduate STEM and STEM education majors in designing meteorological experiments.  They will then launch these experiments into near space on high-altitude balloons in collaboration with K-12 teachers and students in Wyoming. The undergraduate students will be in their second and third years of college, when students are most likely to leave STEM.  It is expected that providing them with authentic, hands-on experiences will build the skills and confidence of both STEM and STEM education majors in their chosen field. Students will work in teams on a real project, effectively bringing together education and practice for both groups of students. The project integrates interdisciplinary teams of undergraduates and postdoctoral fellows to develop activities that will engage K-12 students in authentic meteorological research. The project has the potential to be transformative for the participating students, since they will be engaged in active learning, will learn by teaching one another and younger students, and will work in teams made up of scientists, engineers, and educators. \r\n\r\nA project strength is its combination of project-based learning, citizen science, entrepreneurial or experiential learning, and peer teaching. Through this project, students will learn team building skills, problem-solving skills, and STEM collaboration and communication skills by interacting with K-12 teachers and students. The project team will assess undergraduate student learning through a combination of proven and new assessment tools, compare student learning gains to a control group, and track students longitudinally as they progress through their degree and into the workforce. The project will also work with K-12 teachers and students across Wyoming, including those from schools on the Wind River Reservation. A large part of this project involves the development of scientific payloads that will be designed, built, and sent into near space by undergraduate students working closely with postdoctoral research fellows. The possibility exists that something developed in this process might have patent or technology transfer potential. Therefore, each year the postdoctoral research fellows and undergraduate students will participate in a workshop with University of Wyoming's Business Resource Network, which includes the Wyoming Technology Transfer & Research Products Center, to learn about entrepreneurship, resources, and competitions on campus.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Using a high-altitude balloon satellite platform, <strong>23 undergraduate students worked in interdisciplinary teams to create both scientific experiments and STEM curriculum, while including engineering design methods.</strong> This gave students the opportunity to apply fundamental knowledge from coursework toward authentic STEM projects, improving the depth and breadth of their undergraduate student education and building career-readiness skills.

However, the education majors had the unique opportunity to create authentic STEM activities and lesson plans related to their team's science topic, with consideration given to the practical limitations of a balloon launch, as well as national and state science standards. Science topics that were explored during the project included cosmic radiation, the speed of sound, cellphone signals, GPS radio occultation, weather, microbes, and stratospheric ozone. <strong>The project directly involved more than 150 K-12 students from seven different schools in Wyoming, including one school on the Wind River Reservation. </strong></p>\n<p>Ongoing results from Project LIFT have already been published in peer-reviewed science education journals and presented at several professional science and education conferences. Final results will also be published and presented.&nbsp; Many of the student teams also had the opportunity to present their work at conferences and publish the contents of their experiments and curriculum in an online, peer-reviewed engineering education repository, <em>Teach Engineering</em>. Thus, the students practiced not only real-world science and engineering, but scientific communication, a critical component of the scientific process. Feedback from the students following their experience with the project provides additional insight into the project's success. One student described LIFT as, \"<em>the best way to actually get to do some engineering as an undergraduate that wasn't something that an instructor or lab TA knew the outcome of. We had to figure it out ourselves which was both really frustrating, but also really cool.\"</em>&nbsp; Students gained STEM content knowledge, <em>\"You don't really know something until you know how to explain in ways an 8<sup>th</sup> grader can understand\"</em>, communication skills, <em>\"I never realized how much technical words I used until I had to talk to kids.&nbsp; I liked having the other two [members of their group] who could tell me what they didn't understand since we weren't in the same field\"</em>, and insight into future career paths, <em>\"I think that again you get a lot of hands-on experience; you get to pick your own project and you get to work with a group of other students all of which I think really kinda foreshadow what the workplace will be like when we graduate.\"</em> Perhaps most telling, when asked if they would encourage other students to participate in the LIFT Project, 100% of students gave a resounding yes. As one student put it, <em>\"[The LIFT Project] adds to experience not only as a scientist, but also as an educator. It doesn't matter which side you are on, you are going to gain an unbelievable amount of knowledge and experience by participating - from your team members, the teachers, and the [K-12] students.\"</em></p>\n<p>Project LIFT provided a new and unique approach for engaging both STEM and education majors in a collaborative active learning experience.&nbsp;It serves as a model for

knowledge and skills learned in the classroom to a real-world challenge, while also teaching students to communicate their science in a manner accessible to the general public.&nbsp; Through the LIFT Project, students significantly increased their content knowledge in the physical sciences, while decreasing their science misconceptions.&nbsp; They showed increased confidence in their STEM abilities and in their communication skills.&nbsp; For the education majors, participating in LIFT made them more confident and excited about teaching science and introducing multidisciplinary projects in the classroom.&nbsp; For the STEM majors, participating in LIFT confirmed and strengthened their interest in STEM and opened their eyes to the many career possibilities available in STEM fields. &nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/27/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Shawna&nbsp;Mcbride</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div
