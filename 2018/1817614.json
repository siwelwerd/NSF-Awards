 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new workshop series, called the Controversies Colloquium, is aimed at providing a venue where thought leaders and subject matter experts can gather to discuss long-standing or new \"controversies\" in scientific fields, where gaps in knowledge exist that prevent the full understanding of critical scientific phenomena. The first of these workshops is on the subject of the Stability of Nanostructures, and is scheduled to occur February 1-2, 2018, at the University of California-Irvine, in Irvine, CA. This award supports participation by early career scientists and  researchers in the Colloquium. The non-traditional small-group presentation and discussion formats will encourage and promote free-flowing scientific dialogue and critical debates, and participation by a diverse group of attendees will provide broad perspective. The structure is intended to inspire a highly active meeting where all participants are constantly engaged. This workshop will move the field closer to achieving truly stable nanomaterials, providing a service to the materials community and broad impact to a number of industries where high strength, lightweight, damage-tolerant materials are needed, including aerospace, automotive, and energy sectors.\r\n\r\nNanostructured materials exhibit extreme strength, wear-resistance, fatigue-life and other mechanical properties, but are often limited by the instability of their microstructures.  A recent point of focus in the community has been the stabilization of nanoscale grain structures through a variety of techniques that invoke both thermodynamic and kinetic approaches.  However, the field is relatively scattered and there is disagreement about the best approaches and the fundamental scientific mechanisms.  This workshop aims to help guide the community to close the book on old issues in the field and identify new outstanding problems, using an informal format.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This workshop aimed to help guide our community to close the book on old issues in the field and identify new outstanding problems, using an informal and unusual format with a small group of leaders, where ideas freely flowed and friendly arguments were had.\n\n \n\nThe Broader Impacts of this workshop came from both the industrial importance of the topic as well as the dissemination of knowledge.  Nanostructured materials are very relevant to industrial applications, where extremely strong and damage-tolerant materials are desired.  In fact, thermal stability is itself a very practical consideration, as the nanoscale grain structure must survive typical industrial processing routes or even service conditions to actually be useful.  This workshop moves our field noticeably closer to achieving truly stable nanomaterials, providing a service to the materials community.  In addition, advancement was also made in the dissemination of knowledge and the formation of new collaborations.  We had a very mixed group of attendees, coming from all of the world and from a variety of different backgrounds, joining forces at UCI to tackle a complex problem.  We also made efforts to ensure that early-career researchers (loosely defined as those within 10 years of receiving their Ph.D.) were strongly represented.
