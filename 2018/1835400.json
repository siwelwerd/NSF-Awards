 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support operations of the Long Wavelength Array (LWA) which provides access to the little explored part of the electromagnetic spectrum below 100 MHz.  This region includes the recently detected sky-averaged absorption feature at 78 MHz from cosmic dawn when the first stars began to shine and the Universe was only 180 million years old.  The LWA, operated by the University of New Mexico, is one of the last remaining University Radio Observatories.  Such facilities are essential training grounds for the next generation of instrument builders.  Students and post-docs, both at UNM and other US Universities, play an essential role as developers and users.\r\n\r\nWith this project the highly successful first station of the Long Wavelength Array (LWA1) will be converted to a multi-site observatory by combining LWA1 with the new LWA station at Sevilleta (LWA-SV), and the new low-frequency capability on the Very Large Array (VLA).  This expanded LWA (ELWA) will overcome the primary limitation of LWA1 -- angular resolution -- and make the observatory competitive with any other instrument in the world operating in this frequency range.  This new capability will be offered to the community in regular calls for proposals.  At the same time the existing LWA1 and LWA-SV stations will also be open to the community either separately or together.  The LWA stations consist of 256 dual-polarization dipoles, which are digitized and combined into beams, or cross-correlated to form all-sky images.  With its high temporal (50 nanoseconds), and high spectral (1 Hz) resolution the LWA is making major contributions to established fields (Jupiter and Solar bursts, pulsars, ionosphere), and opening up new areas of study (radio bursts from fireballs, pulsar environments, and detections or limits on new transients such as gravitational wave sources).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Over 20 graduate and undergraduate students have learned how to build and operate low frequency arrays, and many of these are also engaged in scientific studies. Five graduate students at UNM used the LWA for their PhD thesis completed during this award.

Stock et al. (2023) demonstrates some of the capabilities that the array brings to the study of lightning. Once 32 or more LWA antennas are used to image lightning radio sources, virtually every integration period includes at least one identifiable emitter from along the lightning stroke. The use of many antennas also allows multiple simultaneous lightning radio sources to be imaged at sub-microsecond timescales; for the flash examined, 51% of the images contained more than one lightning source. Finally, by using many antennas to image lightning sources, the array is capable of locating sources fainter than the galactic background radio noise level, yielding possibly the most sensitive radio maps of lightning to date. This incredible sensitivity enables, for the first time, the emissions originating from the positive leader tips of natural in-cloud lightning to be detected and located. The tip emission is most likely due to positive breakdown in the atmosphere as the lightning stroke advances (see Figure).<br />Pulsars:&nbsp;<br />One of the most interesting results so far from the ELWA was the discovery of a pulsar wind nebula around the bright pulsar B0950+08.&nbsp; This came as a surpise since B0950+08 is an old pulsar with an estimated age of 17 Myr, much older than any previously known pulsar wind nebula.&nbsp; The paper reporting this discovery was written by UNM undergraduate Dilys Ruan (Ruan et al. 2020).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /></p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/06/2023<br>\nModified by: Gregory&nbsp;B&nbsp;Taylor</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1835400/1835400_10571102_1699289870761_LWA_NA--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1835400/1835400_10571102_1699289870761_LWA_NA--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"LWA-NA construction\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1835400/1835400_10571102_1699289870761_LWA_NA--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"LWA-NA construction\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Photo of Professor Tim Dolch (Hillsdale) and students from UNM and Hillsdale college working on the LWA-NA station in September 2023.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Greg Taylor</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Gregory&nbsp;B&nbsp;Taylor\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">LWA-NA construction</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1835400/1835400_10571102_1699292669974_lightning--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1835400/1835400_10571102_1699292669974_lightning--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Lightning over the LWA-SV station\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1835400/1835400_10571102_1699292669974_lightning--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Lightning over the LWA-SV station\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(a) Interferometric map of a lightning flash over the LWA-SV station colored by time.
