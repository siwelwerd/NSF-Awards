 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to maximize the quality of life of patients currently suffering from Parkinson?s Disease (PD).  Over 1 million Americans have been diagnosed with PD and this number is expected to double by 2040.  PD is a neurodegenerative disorder without a cure ? once the first Parkinsonian tremor has been detected, over 80% of the brain cells associated with creating dopamine through natural processes have already died. Dopamine is a chemical released by neurons to communicate with other nerve cells and is essential to enable the basal ganglia network to control the body?s movements. By engaging the PD patient with novel, highly-cognitive mobility exercises designed by physical therapists (PTs), automaticity can be reprogrammed to utilize different regions of the brain to control movement. Ultimately, this rewiring will slow (neuroprotection) or possibly reverse the degenerative process.  Although the current technology development will focus on this one disease (PD), the technology may be applicable to other sister diseases (e.g., Alzheimer?s and Dementia) or even other conditions (traumatic brain injury, stroke, concussions, and so on). This computer-adaptive platform may eventually enable researchers to identify a biomarker that may lead to a cure for this idiopathic condition. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will produce a prototype for an automated physical-therapy (PT) treatment for patients suffering from Parkinson?s Disease (PD). This automated prototype will act as a virtual coach encouraging patients to perform daily mobility exercises in the comfort and privacy of their own homes. This unique, automated technology will help rewire the brain of the PD patient by engaging both the mind and body which will slow the neurodegeneration inherent to PD. The system will automatically adjust the treatment protocol in terms of duration and difficulty based on the patient?s unique situation including current medication levels. Objective, technology-based outcome measures will be summarized for caregivers working with the PD patient (primary care provider, physical therapists, neurologists, and so on).  In addition, this technology platform will be designed to enable community interaction among PD patients as well as facilitate tele-health communications between the PD patient and his/her healthcare provider.  The overall objective is to develop a PD-specific electronic system that directs PT treatment by developing hardware/software to test the feasibility of the adaptive assessment and the automated PT treatment system.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

PD is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder that results from inefficient or ineffective dopamine production; as time passes, the disease worsens. PD has devastating realities for those diagnosed in regards to both motor symptoms (the noticeable tremor, stiffness, small shuffling steps, and so on) and non-motor symptoms (depression, anxiety, irritability, and so on).  Over time, as neurodegeneration progresses, the person with PD loses independence which places a tremendous burden on the nuclear family, the healthcare system, and overall society.  Average life expectancy for someone diagnosed with PD is 8-10 years less than a person without the disease of the same age!  The direct economic burden placed on the U.S. economy as a result of PD is estimated to be $25B annually.  Research suggests that if neurodegeneration could be slowed by 50%, the societal economic burden would be reduced by about $9B annually.  In addition, such success would enable PD sufferers to live longer, be more independent, and have more productive lives.\n\nThe most natural form of treatment for PD is regular, ongoing exercise.  As the brain is producing less dopamine in this new reality, the body as a whole must re-learn how to perform correct movements (functional mobility).  This re-education process requires external guidance to direct/correct movement.  To achieve this, many PD sufferers take up an exercise they had not really participated in before the diagnosis (no muscle memory):  dancing, swimming, boxing, cycling, karate, and so on.  Research shows that ongoing, regular exercise treatment statistically slows neurodegeneration (and anecdotally for some participants reverses neurodegeneration).  A few important factors seem to drive success:  ongoing and regular frequency, moderate heart-rate elevation, dual-tasking (cognitive and motor), and corrective feedback.\n\nWe (Active Therapy Systems) are trying to implement a virtual assistant (a COACH) to integrate these important factors into a technology platform, which we call Xela.  As others have developed intelligent assistants for personal use (Alexa, Cortana, Siri), we are developing Xela to help direct proper exercise sessions for PD sufferers.  The SBIR project was to assess the technical feasibility of this ambition.  That is, we are developing an automated treatment platform that provides unlimited access to adaptive, physical therapy treatments specifically designed for Parkinson?s Disease to be performed in the comfort and privacy of a person?s home. This exercise platform tasks a user cognitively and physically through a unique collection of external cues and sensors. Real-time biofeedback is provided to ensure correctness and quality of motion, objective data is collected with every movement, and the complexity of treatment adapts to meet the users time specific capabilities.\n\nDuring Phase I, we explored various technology configurations to design into a universal platform that could become ubiquitous to the user, easy to use, and be affordable.  We have developed patent-pending proprietary technology that can achieve these design goals.  The purpose of Phase II is to get the early technology off the bench and into a more refined alpha- and beta- prototype.  We also see opportunities to spin-off components of the primary system outlined herein (XelaHome) to provide other solutions.  For example, XelaFit will use fewer sensors and focus on the boxing domain of exercise protocols to fight back against adversity: Punching Parkinson?s!\n\nAlthough we are developing this treatment platform to directly help the person suffering from Parkinson?s, we anticipate being able to contribute significant human performance data to the research community.
