 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computers are inherently vulnerable to so-called side-channel security attacks that correlate their operating characteristics (e.g., power consumption) with secret information stored in them (e.g., cryptographic keys).  Previous approaches aimed at addressing this vulnerability are hampered by prohibitively-high power, area, and performance overheads. This research project explores technologies for designing secure computers, using technologies that have the potential to yield computing devices that are significantly more secure than conventional computing hardware with little-or-no sacrifice in performance, area, and energy efficiency.  This research effort also includes the development of projects for advanced undergraduate-level design courses, and the engagement of high-school students through a variety of outreach programs.\r\n\r\nThis project will explore novel hardware design technologies that are inherently resistant to side-channel attacks while achieving performance, area, and power levels that compare favorably with mainstream design technologies.  Specifically, it will explore circuit topologies that recycle the energy used for their operation, yielding superior energy efficiency and a flat power consumption profile that is immune to side-channel attacks.  It will also explore pipeline architectures with area-efficient logic families and a flat power consumption profile that can resist side-channel attacks.  The proposed technologies will be evaluated through the design, fabrication, and experimental evaluation of silicon prototypes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project explores technologies for protecting high-performance processors from security threats. It focuses on a family of threats known as side-channel attacks, which leak private information by exploiting data-dependent behavior or interrupting normal program execution. High-performance processors are particularly susceptible to such attacks, due to the added complexity of the features they rely on to achieve high performance operation (e.g., pipelines, superscalar execution, multi-level memory systems).\r\n\n\nA key outcome of this project is a novel methodology for designing high-performance cache memories that can resist side-channel attacks. Cache memories are essential components of high-performance processors, speeding up memory accesses by keeping frequently-used data near the processor. In high-performance processors with multiple processing cores and multilevel memory systems, cache memories are typically shared across multiple cores at the higher levels of the memory hierarchy. Differences in the behavior of these caches can be exploited by side-channel attacks launched from one of these cores to infer information on execution patterns and reveal private information used by another core. Previous cache designs that guard against such attacks suffer from slower operating speeds, increased area overheads, and poor scalability. In contrast, our proposed cache design can be scaled up to memory sizes of practical significance while incurring no performance and minimal area overheads.\r\n\n\nBy enhancing the security of the computer chips at the heart of data centers and mobile devices, our work contributes to the safe and broad deployment of our ever-expanding computing capabilities in virtually every human endeavor.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/31/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MariosPapaefthymiou\n"
