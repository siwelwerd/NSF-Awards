For example, in the data-rich intensive care unit (ICU) environment, vitals and other medical tests, measured for different patients at sequential time points, form a sequence of 2nd-order tensors in the form of (patient x measurement). In international trades, the monthly import-export volumes of different commodities among countries naturally form a dynamic sequence of 3rd order tensors in the form of (source x destination x commodity). In cyber security surveillance, various measurements of internet traffic are also inherently multidimensional and create hourly observations of 4th order tensors in the form of (Host x Program x Library x Activity). This project addresses the compelling needs of theoretically-guaranteed and interpretable analytical tools for such multidimensional tensor data (examples illustrated in Figure 1). It results in several new systematic methods that improve the current state-of-arts.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>Matrix time series is the most widely observed and arguably the simplest version of tensor time series, however its theoretical research and empirical applications are still lacking. In Chen and Fan (2021), the PI proposed a novel estimation framework called $\\alpha$-PCA that aggregates the first moment (mean) as well as the second moment (contemporary covariance) through a hyper-parameter $\\alpha$, while preserving the multidimensional structure of the matrix time series. It found that, surprisingly, for some kinds of data such as images, the conventional practice of removing means does not work well. Figure 2 shows a comparison of performances with different values of $\\alpha$'s on the ORL face image data set. Note that the second row, which uses $\\alpha = -1$ and corresponds to the common practice of removing the mean and estimating with only the covariance, performs much worse than the procedure that aggregates a certain amount of first moment information.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To accommodate practical needs of more interpretable statistical learning, Chen et al, 2019 established a general framework for incorporating domain and prior knowledge in the matrix factor model through linear constraints. The proposed framework is shown to be useful in achieving parsimonious parameterization, facilitating interpretation of the latent matrix factor, and identifying specific factors of interest. Fully utilizing the prior-knowledge-induced constraints results in more efficient and accurate modeling, inference, dimension reduction as well as a clear and better interpretation of the results. Constrained, multi-term, and partially constrained factor models for matrix-variate time series are developed, with efficient estimation procedures and their asymptotic properties. Motivated by the fact that economy often presents different business cycles in expansion and contraction, Liu and Chen, 2022 generalized the linear matrix factor models to a non-linear setting where the factor loadings are allowed to switch between different regimes. Several interesting discoveries are made under this nonlinear setting: when the thresholding in two directions and factors across regimes have different levels of strength, we found that estimators for loadings and threshold value experience ?helping? effects against the curse of dimensionality. We also discover that even when the numbers of factors are overestimated, the estimators are still consistent.</p>\n<p>Based on the aforementioned theoretical works, Chen and Chen, 2022 further proposed an empirical framework for analyzing the evolution of patterns of international trade over time. The analytical tool is based on a variant of the matrix factor model and is applied to analyze the international trade flows over 30 years from 1985 to 2015 among 24 countries in North America, Asian, Europe and Oceania. This is the first attempt to model the international trade data by tensor time series and the result is encouraging.

The proposed algorithm of Iteratively Projected SVD (IP-SVD) is both theoretically and empirically proven to yield more accurate estimators with a faster convergence rate than the vanilla tensor factor models. We apply the STEFA model and IP-SVD algorithm on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset that consists of brain structural networks collected from 136&nbsp; individuals. Each brain network is represented as a 68 x 68 binary matrix, each entry of which encodes the presence or absence of a fiber connection between 68 brain regions. Associated with 136 individuals, there are 573 features including ages, genders, and various measurements of their brains. Figure 4 shows the clustering of brain connectivities based on the top four latent factors associated with different auxiliary features, that is global, female, Age 22-25 and Age 31+ effects, respectively.
