 "awd_abstract_narration": "Planets and stars form at the same time in warm, dusty disks surrounding the stars.  Using 80 hours of observing time on the 8-meter telescope Gemini South in Chile with the Gemini Planet Imager instrument, these investigators will image the structure in a dust disk with very high resolution.  As planets form and grow, disks develop spiral arms, gaps, and eventually hollow cavities -- signposts of planet formation.  The investigators will study a sample of 30 dust disks covering all stages of the formation of planets. They will follow-up with telescopic instruments covering other observable traits of the stars and disks.  The basic stages of planet formation can be determined structurally within the dust disks around the sample stars.  This project supports the mission of the NSF by promoting our understanding of the stages of planet formation within dust disks around other stars.  The lead investigator will continue his partnership with the Ann Arbor Hands-on Museum to reach out to the often-overlooked rural population of Michigan through traveling astronomical science exhibits.\r\n\r\nThe Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) instrument can image dust structure with spatial resolution as small as 6 AU by exploiting extreme adaptive optics, coronagraphy, and a differential polarization mode.  The proposed observational survey of 30 disks draws evenly from a sample of intermediate-mass young stellar objects spanning all the known stages of planet formation.   Follow-up using the mm-wave and other visible/IR high-contrast instruments will be pursued as part of the proposed research plan.  By linking newly discovered disk structures with stellar ages, spectral types, and the disk spectral energy distributions for a statistically-significant number of objects, the fundamental stages of planet formation can be determined both morphologically and then quantitatively through the proposed radiative transfer and hydrodynamical modeling to estimate disk masses, disk scale heights, dust sizes, and the radii of gaps and other structures.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAstronomers are discovering more and more exoplanets of different masses, sizes, densities, orbital distances, and chemical makeup.  The unexpected patterns found do not match our solar system and we seek explanations by looking at nearby star-forming regions where we can literally watch planets form in real-time.  This NSF project analyzed a large survey of protoplanetary disks using the NSF's Gemini South Telescope outfitted with the extreme adaptive optics system called the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI).  GPI allows us to block light from the young star directly yet see the star's light scattering off nearby dust.  In an open access article in the Astronomical Journal, we present our full results along with publically-available imaging data for download (Rich et al. 2022).  \n\nWe find that the presence of even a small companion star or brown dwarf can drastically change the disk properities, and thus any planets that might form there.  Also the imaging data allows us to measure the 3-dimensional shape of the dust and compare it to the gas measured by the ALMA interferometer.  The disk thicknesses tell us how the dust is sinking or settling down into the midplane of the disk, which can have profound implications on how planets forms.\n\nLastly, this work funding a collaboration with a local musuem to develop hands-on space-themed activities that were shared at mass-attended public eventsl ike NASCAR races or air shows.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/08/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John D Monnier"
