 "awd_abstract_narration": "People often have trouble regulating their behavior according to their professed long-term goals. Many people enthusiastically want to meet broad goals, such as health and fitness, but have trouble enacting the effortful, resource-consuming actions that are required to do so. For example, many people who are strongly committed to increasing their physical fitness may plan with all earnestness on getting to the gym every morning or taking the stairs instead of the elevator, but ultimately fail to do so. These kinds of self-control failures are common and have wide-scale consequences for mental and physical health. Psychological science has shown that to understand self-control, it is not enough to merely measure what people say they think and feel about a goal and the actions needed to get to that goal. Instead, it is necessary to also measure people's spontaneous and uncontrollable thoughts and feelings about goals and the means for achieving those goals. This type of implicit cognition can predict who will and who may not end up successfully enacting the difficult activities required to reach their goals. Laboratory experiments and a field study with high school students will improve our understanding of how people frame, strengthen, and bolster their behaviors in self-control dilemmas. The research will ultimately have applications in understanding health, education, and personal finances.\r\n\r\nThis project examines a neglected aspect of the psychology of self-control: people's implicit beliefs about the importance of means. In addition to knowing how much someone desires a broad goal, it is also necessary to know a person's beliefs about the importance of the actions needed to reach that goal. For example, one might greatly desire to be fit, but unless they regard the difficult actions required to become fit as important and critical, they may not enact those behaviors. The hypothesis tested across the studies in this project is that people's implicit beliefs about the importance of means will uniquely predict their success at self-control. Some of the studies use an established measure of implicit importance. Other studies develop an innovative new measure that captures people's nonconscious beliefs about the importance of goal-relevant actions. The studies also examine the self-control domains of physical fitness and academic performance among college and high school students. A final study includes high school students in underserved communities who are trying to get into college. This study follows these students across a school year, measures the students' implicit beliefs about the importance of school-related actions (using two different measures), and predicts critical outcomes such as grades and college entry. The fields of self-control and goal-pursuit might be transformed by introducing the role of implicit importance. By focusing on evidence that implicit importance predicts behavioral outcomes, this project offers the potential to advance an underdeveloped topic in the research literature on self-control. This project is supported by a partnership between the National Science Foundation and the U.S.-Israel Binational Science Foundation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
