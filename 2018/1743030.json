 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will develop and provide a new SuperMAG project capability for organizing, storing, and disseminating high time resolution data from world-wide arrays of fluxgate and induction coil magnetometer for magnetospheric ultralow frequency (ULF) waves and substorm-related investigations. SuperMAG is a worldwide collaboration of organizations and national agencies that currently operate >300 ground-based magnetometers. This research effort will gather and organize high-time resolution data, write software packages to pre-process and process high time resolution fluxgate and induction coil magnetometers data, and disseminate them to the community on the SuperMAG website. The resulting data product will enable studies of global ULF activity by allowing easy access to high time resolution measurement (<5sec), derived data products, plots and other tools. Availability of the new data product will provide new opportunities of research to students. The project will also foster education and public outreach activities, which are already a key component of SuperMAG.\r\n\r\nThis research will enhance the current SuperMAG capabilities by expanding its ground-based magnetometer data holdings from 1-minute cadence to higher sampling rates (< 5 sec) of both fluxgate and induction coil arrays and by developing additional data products that will make observations of ULF waves and substorm-related variations in these high-cadence data more easily accessed and understood by the wider geospace science community. The high time-resolution magnetometer dataset will enhance studies of substorm-related processes because of the availability of data on Pi1b wave activity (higher frequency than Pi2, but also generated in association with nightside magnetic field dipolarizations), and studies of radiation belt enhancement and loss processes because of the availability of the full range of ULF waves, including in particular electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves generated in the middle and inner magnetosphere. The implementation of high time-resolution data, along with the new addition of satellite footpoints to SuperMAG, will foster collaborations between the satellite community and the ground community for new scientific areas such as ULF waves. The project will foster education and public outreach (EPO) activities, which are already a key component of SuperMAG.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary objective of the this proposal is to utilize the measurements of the Earth magnetic field made around the world from some 500 scientific stations.  Over the last decade or so these instruments have become capable of measuring the magnetic field at a cadence of 1-sec in contrast to the 1-min which was used in the past.  This new dataset allow studies of waves propagation between Earth and the surrounding space, so-called Ultra Low Frequency waves or ULF.  The overarching goal of this project was to:\n\nEnable global ULF studies \n\nwhich was submitted in response to a recommendation made by the US ground based magnetometer community.  This new dataset was included in the existing SuperMAG service which previously only included 1-min data and by including data from around the world studies of global wave activity was enabled.  \n\nThe Intellectual Merit\n1)    In response to a community request SuperMAG now obtain, clean, ingest, store, and serve 1-sec data.\n2)    The overall project is in excellent agreement with the NSF Magnetospheric Physics Program objective.\n3)    The implementation of high time-resolution data, along with the new addition of satellite footpoints to SuperMAG, fostered collaborations between the satellite community and the ground community for new scientific areas such as ULF waves.\n4)    The project was highly cost-efficient since SuperMAG was already operational.\n\n2) Broader Impacts\n   While no explicit support is requested for education and public outreach activities, the SuperMAG site has already proven to be useful in outreach activities.  Beyond the research community, SuperMAG targets the general public, in particular, teachers and students. SuperMAG\u2019s Web service is designed to be intuitive with easily accessible tools and products.  In fact the importance of the SuperMAG database for student activities has already been proven through many student projects, thesis works, and 130,000 downloads in 2016.\n1)    The proposed implementation of high time-resolution (&le; 5 s) ground magnetometer data will lead to a new level of usage of this underutilized dataset.\n2)    The project will foster education and public outreach (EPO) activities, which are already a key component of SuperMAG.\n3)    Historically, a long list of student and teachers have been involved in SuperMAG and the proposed study will enable a new area of research and thus more students.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/01/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jesper W Gjerloev"
