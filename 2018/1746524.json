 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ethnic political parties - i.e., parties that advocate for the interests of a particular identity group - are a pervasive and often problematic feature of democracies around the world. The politicization of ethnicity can deepen identity-based divisions, cause interethnic conflict, and undermine government accountability. Given these significant negative consequences, it is important to ask: Why do some ethnic parties succeed in mobilizing their target co-ethnic population, whereas others fail? This project tackles this question through studying the case of Karachi, Pakistan - one of the world's largest and most diverse megacities, and a site of endemic ethnic conflict. In particular, it will compare the political behavior of the two largest ethnic groups in Karachi - the Muhajirs and the Pashtuns - in order to develop and test a theory of ethnic party success and failure. In contrast to existing approaches, this approach takes seriously the idea that group-specific beliefs and norms are an important driver of the politicization of identity.\r\n\r\nBased upon extensive qualitative data collected through three field trips to Karachi, this project conceptualizes bloc-voting for an ethnic party as a coordination problem. This coordination problem is solved when co-ethnics come to share -- often as a result of suffering a common shock - - the belief that (1) their political fates are 'linked' and (2) their ethnic party is best able to serve these linked interests. By contrast, existing theories of ethnic politics are heavily focused on instrumental explanations of ethnic voting that, while useful, are incomplete for both theoretical and empirical reasons. Theoretically, dominant accounts of ethnic voting do not take seriously differences between ethnic groups, in effect disregarding a longstanding social psychology literature on the development of group norms and social incentive structures, and a small incipient literature \" limited so far to American Politics \" that recognizes the importance of heterogeneity in political understandings and behaviors across ethnic. Empirically, this work moves existing debates beyond an almost exclusive focus on Africa and India. The cases social scientists choose affect the answers they get, which makes extending the literature beyond the study of particular regions a critical undertaking . Finally, this project corrects the literature's tendency to focus empirically on rural areas: as the world rapidly urbanizes, the study of identity politics must pay special attention to how ethnicity manifests politically in diverse metropolises.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

To answer this question, this project takes a deep-dive into the differing political behavior of Karachi's two largest ethnic groups: the Muhajirs and the Pashtuns. While the Muhajirs have historically tended to vote as a bloc for their respective ethnic party, the Pashtuns have not. This has led to the Pashtuns being under-represented in city politics. To explain why these two groups behave differently, I first conducted over 200 in-depth interviews with Pashtun and Muhajir respondents between 2016 and 2019. These conversations indicated that the different migration histories of each group may affect their current political incorporation into city life. To test this hypothesis, a survey instrument was developed and will eventually be fielded (in May 2022, pandemic permitting) with NSF support. This instrument was pre-tested with a vaccinated sample of 30 individuals in January 2022. Pre-testing revealed that the hypothesized relationship between migration reason/history and expectations from/ownership over city life holds. In particular, Pashtuns -- who primarily migrated for economic reasons -- held lower expectations from and lower ownership over the city, and hence are less susceptible to ethnic mobilization. In contrast, Muhajirs -- who primarily migrated for political/ideological reasons -- held higher expectations from and higher ownership over the city, and hence are more susceptible to ethnic mobilization. These preliminary results highlight the theory's usefulness in explaining across-ethnic group, intra-urban variation in ethnic political mobilization. These results may also have important implications for understanding the political incorporation of migrant and immigrant populations.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/11/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Mashail&nbsp;Malik</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
