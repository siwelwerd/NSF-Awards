 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many cities across the globe are facing difficult challenges managing their food, water and energy systems. The challenges stem from the fact that the issues of food, water and energy are often tightly connected with each other, not only locally but also globally. This is known as the Food-Water-Energy (FWE) nexus.  An effective solution to a local water problem may cause new local problems with food or energy, or cause new water problems at the global level. On a local scale, it is difficult to anticipate whether solutions to one issue in the nexus are sustainable across food, water and energy systems, both at the local and the global scale.  Innovative solutions that encompass the nexus are particularly important to enable cities to better manage their food, water and energy systems and understand the benefits and tradeoffs for different solutions.  \r\n\r\nThis award supports U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a 29-country initiative through the joint Belmont Forum- Joint Programming Initiative (JPI) Urban Europe.  The Sustainable Urbanization Global Initiative (SUGI)/Food-Water-Energy Nexus is a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that bring together the fragmented research and expertise across the globe to find innovative solutions to the Food-Water-Energy Nexus challenge.  The call seeks to develop more resilient, applied urban solutions to benefit a much wider range of stakeholders. The rapid urbanization of the world's population underscores the importance of this focus. International partners were invited to develop solutions for this challenge.  The funds requested will be used to support U.S. participants to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries and that bring together natural scientists, social scientists and research users (e.g., civil society, NGOs, and industry).  Participants from other countries are funded through their national funding organizations. \r\n\r\nThis project seeks to develop a novel approach to produce innovative solutions to FWE challenges that are both locally and globally sustainable, through experiments in Urban Living Labs in Austria, Brazil, Germany Netherlands, South Africa, Sweden and the USA.  Urban Living Labs are a forum for innovation, applied to the development of new products, systems, services and processes, employing working methods to integrate people into the entire development process as users and co-creator, to explore, examine, experiment, test and evaluate new ideas, scenarios, processes, systems, concepts and creative solutions in complex and real contexts. The project will involve a range of urban stakeholders early in the creative and evaluative processes of innovation, and the solutions produced will be tested for environmental soundness and economic viability and social acceptability and robustness.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Urban living labs (ULL) are collaborations between public, private, civil, and higher education sectors who work together towards sustainable transformation of an urban area. The Phoenix area ULL was a partnership between staff from the neighboring cities of Phoenix and Tempe, researchers and students from the Sustainable Food Economies Lab at Arizona State University, and Local First Arizona (LFAZ), a non-profit supporting small businesses in Arizona. The goal was to accelerate the local transformation to a sustainable food economy through the selection, design, and implementation of strategic pilot projects.</p>\n<p>The pilot projects aimed to enhance the necessary support and conditions to inspire, stimulate, and enable businesses and other stakeholders to take more direct action, such as adopt sustainable business practices, start sustainable businesses, or provide services to support sustainable businesses. While four primary pilot projects were conducted by the ULL, we focused on one project: developing solutions to make land available for long-term sustainable farming in the Phoenix area.</p>\n<p>Intellectual outcomes were an indirect outcome of our participation in the ULL. Participation enabled the Arizona State University partner to observe a ULL at first hand and to gain knowledge and understanding of how ULLs work, and especially how they can achieve more sustainable results around food, water, and energy. Our primary focus in the project, however, was in achieving broader outcomes.</p>\n<p>The broader outcomes of the project are upstream ?interventions? rather than actual, concrete changes to the sustainable food economy, such as business startups, jobs created, money kept in the local economy, food miles, or local consumption of healthy, local produce. The upstream interventions aim to influence the factors that enable or support such direct changes to occur, and include capacities (knowledge and skills), resources, rules and regulations, political support, public opinion, and so forth. The interventions not only affect business owners and workers, but entrepreneurs, community groups, business development providers, elected officials, the general public and other stakeholders. The broader outcomes are described below.</p>\n<p>As a partner in the Phoenix area ULL, the project has developed the capacity of LFAZ staff and of other partner organizations to organize, coordinate and collaborate in such a coalition towards a common goal, to select and develop strategic interventions (?experiments?) with local stakeholders, and to transfer and scale the results of these pilot projects for broader impact. The capacities built within the partnering organizations and individuals within them will enhance their ability to lead and participate in similar future ULLs beyond the GLOCULL project. The project has also developed capacities of these participants specific to developing the sustainable food economy in Arizona such as furthering understanding of the structure of the food economy, the breadth of enterprise types that should be part of it, what makes it sustainable, the interconnections between food, water, and energy, and promoting diversity and inclusion.</p>\n<p>The sustainable urban farmland pilot project has achieved outcomes making significant progress in tackling the problem of farmland loss to urban development. It has built capacity in farmers, urban farming organizations, community development organizations, and other stakeholders around the concept of community land trusts and other solutions to support sustainable farming in the Greater Phoenix area. The pilot project team, including staff and students from other ULL partners, has performed research, invited experts, formed links with regional and national organizations specializing in land trusts for sustainable agriculture, conducted numerous meetings and participatory workshops with these stakeholders, worked on an exemplary land acquisition opportunity, conducted direct action campaigns related to immediate farmland loss cases, and conducted a broad, public awareness raising media campaign and production of a short film. The outcomes have been: 1) raised awareness of the problem and support for urban farmland preservation solutions with the general public through widespread media publicity; 2) created knowledge and skills and plans in a specific urban farming community to transition their leased land into a community land trust for sustainable urban farming; 3) elevated the urban farmland issue and solution to a higher priority with local politicians and city staff; and 4) established a new organization (Urban Farmland Coalition) with broad-based, multi-stakeholder membership that are committed to the goal, and secured funding to recruit a fulltime coordinator, thus ensuring that the work will continue.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/27/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kimber&nbsp;Lanning</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1832203/1832203_10583666_1638066878924_Maya'sFarm--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1832203/1832203_10583666_1638066878924_Maya'sFarm--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Maya's Farm\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1832203/1832203_10583666_1638066878924_Maya'sFarm--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Maya's Farm\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Maya's Farm will be the first urban farm in Phoenix to be placed in an agricultural easement to enable the transfer of land ownership to the farmer, Maya.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Local First Arizona</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kimber&nbsp;Lanning</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Maya's Farm</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1832203/1832203_10583666_1638070042289_Machokotofamilyfarms--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1832203/1832203_10583666_1638070042289_Machokotofamilyfarms--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Machokoto Farms\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1832203/1832203_10583666_1638070042289_Machokotofamilyfarms--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Machokoto Farms\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Machokoto family is part of a farming collaborative, called Spaces of Opportunity.
