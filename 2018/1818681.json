This project at Johnson C. Smith University provides a strategic approach to enhance the computer science curriculum in the area of data science to increase student recruitment, retention and success.  \r\n\r\nThe project seeks to develop curricula and co-curricular activities for an undergraduate minor in data science. It is envisioned that these approaches will improve the retention and graduation rates of STEM majors at the university. The curriculum will be developed with collaborative input from an advisory committee comprised of industry and academic representatives. Five new courses will be developed and one existing course will be enhanced. Special consideration will be made to support the inclusion of interested students with little or no prior computing experience. The project is guided by formative and summative evaluation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
