 "awd_abstract_narration": "The propagation of electromagnetic waves has enabled modern technology and communication systems. In many practical applications, it is required that these waves propagate through nonreciprocal channels/devices able to exhibit different responses when source and observation points are interchanged. This is the case of isolators that protect sources and antennas from high-power reflections, circulators able to distribute signals to different outputs, or Faraday rotators that control the polarization of light. These components are fundamental building blocks for telecommunications, defense, health care, and space industries. Unfortunately, breaking reciprocity usually requires bulky and costly magnetic materials that are not compatible with integrated circuits. This project proposes novel approaches to break and engineer reciprocity at the micro/nano-scale by exploiting exciting properties of two-dimensional materials without requiring external magnetic fields. The findings will be applied to develop low-cost, compact, and highly-efficient nonreciprocal platforms that enable novel functionalities and are compatible with integrated circuits and other optoelectronic components. The main goal is to establish a new paradigm for nonreciprocal devices, lessening the dependence on magnetic materials and exploiting unusual responses to reshape many areas of the coming technology. The educational and outreach efforts will focus on engaging Hispanic students, ranging from K-12 to college, in science, technology, engineering and math. Summer fellowships will foster the participation of undergraduate Hispanic students in a research project about nonreciprocal antennas, allowing graduate, undergraduate, and high school students to interact and share knowledge and experiences learnt by implementing similar concepts at different frequencies. The organization of a workshop about reciprocity will bring together top experts in the field with graduate and Hispanic undergraduate and high-school students, enabling technical discussions and broadening the impact of this exciting topic on all society.\r\n  \r\nThis project combines and exploits unique properties of two-dimensional materials to break and manipulate time-reversal symmetry in the absence of magnetic bias. First, nonreciprocal responses far beyond what is currently attainable using magneto-optics effects will be realized by pumping two-dimensional materials subjected to uniform strain with circularly-polarized light. This platform will permit to investigate the response of many systems under effective magnetic bias much larger than those attained in common laboratories and will enable the practical development of strain engineering. Such responses will be applied to realize Faraday rotators and nonreciprocal hyperbolic/phase profile metasurfaces, enabling functionalities such as one way giant optical forces and nonreciprocal beam steering/lensing. Second, the ultrafast field effect of two-dimensional materials will be exploited to judiciously modulate in space and time their electric properties. Spatiotemporal modulations will be applied to realize low-loss, efficient, and integrated nonreciprocal photonic and plasmonic platforms able to enhance the spectrum efficiency and data-rate in the telecommunication industry. The technology proposed in this project is low-cost, compatible with integrated circuits, and aims to significantly advance the current frontiers in the field of nonreciprocity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We showed that simply applying a voltage to graphene allows to obtain extremely asymmetric in-plane modal dispersion over a broadband frequency band. We also demonstrated that such devices exhibit unique responses, for instance canalization and deeply subwavelength resolution - i.e., the ability to resolve sources that are located very close to each other. Finally, we applied drifting electrons over graphene to construct terahertz and infrared sources exploiting the so-called Cherenkov radiation.</p>\n<p>Second, we investigated the response of optical forces acting on nanoparticles located near nonreciprocal surfaces (Fig. 2). &nbsp;We showed that the properties of such surfaces lead to a dominant lateral recoil force component that determines the system performance. We then applied our theory to put together tunable optical traps to manipulate the particle position with extremely sub-wavelength resolution. Our work confirms that nonreciprocal metasurfaces open new possibilities to trap, assemble and manipulate nanoparticles and overcome many challenges faced by conventional optical tweezers while dealing with nanoscale objects.</p>\n<p>Third, we studied how time-modulation can be applied to graphene to construct nonreciprocal photonic components such as isolators (Fig. 3). To this purpose, we integrated this 2D material with optical waveguides and exploited its tunable response to modulate in space and time the properties of the resulting device.

However, it requires a relatively complex fabrication process.</p>\n<p>Finally, we applied time-modulation using varactors at microwaves in devices beyond common circulators. For instance, we put forward isolating bandpass filters (Fig. 4) able to behave as filter for waves propagating from port 1 to 2 and as an isolator for waves traveling from port 2 to port 1. We have also demonstrated nonreciprocal phased-array antennas (Fig. 5) able to independently control their transmission and reception radiation patterns at the same operation frequency, and nonreciprocal time-modulated gradient metasurfaces. We also applied time-modulation to construct other magnetless, nonreciprocal, microwave devices, like filter antennas, power dividers, and diplexers.</p>\n<p>This project has partially supported 3 PhD students - 2 of them have already graduated - and involved 4 MS students.
