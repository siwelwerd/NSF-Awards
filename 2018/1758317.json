 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Noyce Track 3 project at Mercy College, a Hispanic Serving Institution, will respond to the critical need for developing highly effective K-12 mathematics and science teacher leaders in the greater New York City area. Mercy College will partner with Sarah Lawrence College Center for the Urban River at Beczak and New York University's Tandon School of Engineering. The project will have an impact on students in high-need partner school districts in New York (Elmsford, New Rochelle, Ossining and Yonkers), who will benefit by having highly-qualified mathematics and science teacher leaders from underrepresented groups. Over a six-year period, the Track 3 project will prepare 14 in-service K-12 teachers of mathematics and science to become leaders in their school and district. The project's goals are to develop K-12 teacher leaders, with a focus on groups who are underrepresented in STEM; improve K-12 STEM instruction; increase understanding of teacher development for STEM pedagogy; and enhance understanding of Professional Learning Communities for STEM Faculty. The project will prepare STEM teacher leaders skilled in student-centered learning tied to real-world STEM issues and grounded in best practices. As a result, Fellows will be ready to support student achievement and interest in STEM and lead other teachers in improving STEM teaching and learning in their classrooms and schools. \r\n\r\nMercy Fellows will engage in an intensive professional development program that includes STEM education coursework and professional experiences with partner institutions who have demonstrated excellence in teacher professional development. Project partners include the Sarah Lawrence College Center for the Urban River at Beczak, a nonprofit focused on environmental education and local connections. Partners will contribute enrichment activities and faculty expertise to the Mercy Noyce project. Fellows will benefit from faculty mentoring, bi-monthly meetings, funding for leadership projects, and receipt of salary supplements. These supports will prepare Fellows to implement high-quality STEM education practices in their high-need school and school district.  The project will enhance teachers' ability to take on STEM leadership roles within their schools. With frequent contact and mentoring by STEM and education faculty at Mercy College, project leaders will guide Fellows through STEM education coursework, leadership projects, and professional presentations of their work. Project activities will be well-aligned with hallmarks of effective professional development and experiences to retain teachers in high-need school districts. A major component of the project is the vertical Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) that will support standards-based instruction. Data collected will inform the impacts of STEM pedagogy training using these communities to develop best practices, including those designed to recruit and engage traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM. Faculty collaboration across STEM and education departments and participation in PLCs will be examined to determine how they can best support STEM education coursework.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Teachers engaged in an intensive program of STEM education experiences that prepared them to support and implement high-quality STEM education in their high-need schools, with the ultimate outcome of improving student achievement in STEM and enhancing their ability to take on leadership roles within their schools. The program emphasized frequent contact and mentoring, including graduate STEM education coursework, annual leadership projects, monthly meetings, and professional presentations of their work during their five-year fellowship.</p>\r\n<p>As part of the professional learning, Mercy University partnered with the CURB in Yonkers, NY and New York University&rsquo;s Tandon School of Engineering. Faculty from all three institutions collaborated to form a professional learning community to improve the STEM pedagogy courses and support implementation.</p>\r\n<p>Ultimately, the program resulted in 14 master STEM teacher leaders skilled in student-centered instruction tied to real-world STEM issues and grounded in best practices in STEM education, to support student achievement and interest in these areas. Many of their leadership projects were developed and supported through the program at first and then taken over by the schools for sustainability. &nbsp;The Master Teacher Fellows led other teachers in improving STEM teaching and learning in their high-need schools through these projects and in some cases engaged students' families and the community. All Fellows presented their work at local conferences and half also presented at national conferences. This project&rsquo;s submissions were included in the NSF STEM for All Video Showcase for three years. Project leaders performed research throughout the project, resulting in three publications (two peer-reviewed) and 15 research presentations. &nbsp;Additional publications are currently in development.</p>\r\n<p>The greatest outcome from the work of the participating teacher leaders was the implementation of leadership projects, largely by their own design and planned to help develop STEM teaching growth in other teachers or to support expanded STEM learning by K-12 students. Teacher leadership projects are generally listed below, under overarching categories:</p>\r\n<p><strong>STEM Professional Development for Teachers Led by Fellows on These Topics:</strong> implementing Culturally Relevant Pedagogy; using new educational technology; implementing the Next Generation Science Standards; planning an interdisciplinary middle school unit, planning and implementing 5E inquiry lessons through the development of a professional learning community; and included mentoring of other teachers to improve STEM teaching</p>\r\n<p><strong>Fellows Developed and Implemented After-school STEM Experiences for Students including: </strong>robotics clubs; a coding club; STEM enrichment for English-language learners; a lunchtime STEM club for girls; a math club; and implemented FLORES program (Family Learning and Outreach for Research and Education in STEM), which offered STEM activities for families</p>\r\n<p><strong>Fellows Created Co-curricular Projects:</strong> organized and led a teacher team to create take-home science kits for students during the pandemic; interdisciplinary field trips; school garden creation and development; curriculum for other teachers to use in conjunction with the school garden; creation of an ocean literacy unit; interactive virtual STEM career fair; across-grades engineering design project<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Fellows Garnered New Resources for STEM Education:</strong> grant writing; earning new school designations such as STEM School and USA Blue School; obtaining new fellowship opportunities such as NYS Smart Start and Wipro Science Education Fellowship</p>\r\n<p>It is important to note that the majority of this project was conducted during the Covid-19 pandemic, and the Fellows overcame great adversity to persevere and be successful, as demonstrated by their leadership projects.</p>\r\n<p>This program was made in coordination with Mercy University's Center for STEM Education, an academic center that creates opportunities for groups typically underrepresented in STEM to engage in enrichment activities for learning, career readiness, enjoyment, and personal and community growth, which may not be available through schools.&nbsp; This center is co-directed by the PI and a co-PI of this project.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/29/2025<br>\nModified by: Amanda&nbsp;M&nbsp;Gunning</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1758317/1758317_10549052_1738099134162_Bioengineering_lab_using_Green_Fluorescent_Protein_1--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1758317/1758317_10549052_1738099134162_Bioengineering_lab_using_Green_Fluorescent_Protein_1--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Fellows Experience a Bioengineering Lab\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1758317/1758317_10549052_1738099134162_Bioengineering_lab_using_Green_Fluorescent_Protein_1--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Fellows Experience a Bioengineering Lab\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">STEM Master Teacher Fellows experience bioengineering in the Mercy University labs during their graduate course EDUC 553: Engineering for the K-12 Classroom.

Two cohorts were selected comprised of the following demographics:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nBlack or African   American\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nHispanic / Latinx\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nWhite (not   Hispanic)\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nMultiple Races\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nNot identified\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nFemale\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n2\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n5\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n1\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nMale\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n0\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n0\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n1\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n0\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nElementary\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nMS\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nHS Math\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nHS Science\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nHS Computer   Science\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nFemale\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n6\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n3\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n1\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n1\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nMale\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n0\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n1\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n1\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n0\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nMercy University supported this program through nearly half a million dollars of cost sharing, primarily supporting faculty as they prepared participants as teacher leaders. Teachers engaged in an intensive program of STEM education experiences that prepared them to support and implement high-quality STEM education in their high-need schools, with the ultimate outcome of improving student achievement in STEM and enhancing their ability to take on leadership roles within their schools. The program emphasized frequent contact and mentoring, including graduate STEM education coursework, annual leadership projects, monthly meetings, and professional presentations of their work during their five-year fellowship.\r\n\n\nAs part of the professional learning, Mercy University partnered with the CURB in Yonkers, NY and New York Universitys Tandon School of Engineering. Faculty from all three institutions collaborated to form a professional learning community to improve the STEM pedagogy courses and support implementation.\r\n\n\nUltimately, the program resulted in 14 master STEM teacher leaders skilled in student-centered instruction tied to real-world STEM issues and grounded in best practices in STEM education, to support student achievement and interest in these areas. Many of their leadership projects were developed and supported through the program at first and then taken over by the schools for sustainability. The Master Teacher Fellows led other teachers in improving STEM teaching and learning in their high-need schools through these projects and in some cases engaged students' families and the community. All Fellows presented their work at local conferences and half also presented at national conferences. This projects submissions were included in the NSF STEM for All Video Showcase for three years. Project leaders performed research throughout the project, resulting in three publications (two peer-reviewed) and 15 research presentations. Additional publications are currently in development.\r\n\n\nThe greatest outcome from the work of the participating teacher leaders was the implementation of leadership projects, largely by their own design and planned to help develop STEM teaching growth in other teachers or to support expanded STEM learning by K-12 students. Teacher leadership projects are generally listed below, under overarching categories:\r\n\n\nSTEM Professional Development for Teachers Led by Fellows on These Topics: implementing Culturally Relevant Pedagogy; using new educational technology; implementing the Next Generation Science Standards; planning an interdisciplinary middle school unit, planning and implementing 5E inquiry lessons through the development of a professional learning community; and included mentoring of other teachers to improve STEM teaching\r\n\n\nFellows Developed and Implemented After-school STEM Experiences for Students including: robotics clubs; a coding club; STEM enrichment for English-language learners; a lunchtime STEM club for girls; a math club; and implemented FLORES program (Family Learning and Outreach for Research and Education in STEM), which offered STEM activities for families\r\n\n\nFellows Created Co-curricular Projects: organized and led a teacher team to create take-home science kits for students during the pandemic; interdisciplinary field trips; school garden creation and development; curriculum for other teachers to use in conjunction with the school garden; creation of an ocean literacy unit; interactive virtual STEM career fair; across-grades engineering design project\r\n\n\nFellows Garnered New Resources for STEM Education: grant writing; earning new school designations such as STEM School and USA Blue School; obtaining new fellowship opportunities such as NYS Smart Start and Wipro Science Education Fellowship\r\n\n\nIt is important to note that the majority of this project was conducted during the Covid-19 pandemic, and the Fellows overcame great adversity to persevere and be successful, as demonstrated by their leadership projects.\r\n\n\nThis program was made in coordination with Mercy University's Center for STEM Education, an academic center that creates opportunities for groups typically underrepresented in STEM to engage in enrichment activities for learning, career readiness, enjoyment, and personal and community growth, which may not be available through schools. This center is co-directed by the PI and a co-PI of this project.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/29/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: AmandaMGunning\n"
