 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nationally, mechanical air conditioning accounts for ~40% of energy use in all buildings, and over 50% in residential buildings. This project focuses on creating industrially-relevant, immediately applicable solutions for transforming non-mechanical,\r\npassive heating and cooling system design and delivery throughout the U.S. Effective passive heating and cooling strategies are virtually absent from U.S. buildings for several reasons, including existing passive design tools are unwieldy and time-consuming to use, and effective, responsive control strategies are unavailable. These problems are particularly acute in affordable housing, where extra designer time and typical green design measures (e.g. superinsulation, triple-pane windows, PV arrays) are too costly. To alleviate these problems, this project targets the following advances: (Task 1) A set of new, visual metrics to express a location's unique combination of useful climatic resources for passive heating and cooling, as well as their respective values, enabling rapid prioritization in early design stages; (Task 2) A set of customizable residential dwelling prototypes for simulation to allow designers to estimate energy benefits of passive system adoption in a climate of interest before investing in project-specific simulation, accompanied by cost implications, along with a rigorous estimate of the extent to which optimally-controlled passive heating and cooling systems can reduce mechanical conditioning needs and diminish GHG emissions in multi-family dwellings in the major climate zones of the U.S.; and (Task 3) A field-tested intelligent control system for operating combined passive systems optimally and responding continuously to weather, forecasts, and user input.\r\n\r\nAs a GOALI project, a primary broader impact will be the exchange of expertise between industry (Mithun, Inc., a leading national sustainable design firm) and academia (the University of Oregon and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute), connecting with industrial research, providing industrially-relevant results, and educating students through research fellowships and in-office internships. The work will advance national carbon-neutral building design by (a) the dissemination of climate metrics, customizable passive system prototype models, and control approaches through national channels, and (b) the construction of built products, to be realized as experimental elements within Mithun projects, that will then serve as precedents for others to study and further improve upon. An additional targeted impact is the enhancement of social inclusiveness in green design, which typically offers better air quality and lower utility bills to residents; this work will facilitate green building strategies for affordable buildings that rarely offer such advantages. The project  will also support and expand the team's outreach work with the University of Oregon Sustainable City Year Program, in which city planners and community members work with students to realize effective environmental designs, increasing public engagement with science and technology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Although building energy efficiency and renewable electricity supplies are growing, built area and electricity demands are growing comparably, causing space conditioning emissions to resist decline. The extraordinary potential of dynamic passive heating and cooling strategies, however, is virtually untapped. Passive strategies use windows, shades, night insulation, and fans to capture climatic resources to meet some or all of a space's thermal comfort needs.

However, visible light carries substantial energy and passes readily through skylights, creating a potentially valuable heating resource. People often notice this resource by opening a car on a cloudy day and finding the interior unexpectedly warm. Across the U.S., we found that the total residential direct solar heating resource exceeds one-third of the annual need. This resource is greatest in cool climates with long winters (the Northeast, Great Lakes, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Pacific Northwest) and in cold climates with sunny winters (the Mountain West); nationally, the levelized cost of direct solar heating is $0.11-0.18 per kWh, comparable to that of other renewable energy technologies. Detailed investigations in San Francisco and Chicago confirmed these estimates, showing that direct solar heating can reduce typical residential space heating needs by about 50% in each climate.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Passive cooling also has enormous untapped potential, we found. In every U.S. climate, well-designed window shading, operated to maximize cooling, showed the ability to reduce window solar heat gain (a leading summer heat source in residences) by 50-80%. To accomplish this operation, we developed a method to sense heat flow through windows directly and to interpret and respond to the noisy signals produced. This method is now publicly available. Additionally, we found that well-controlled shading and night ventilation in the Pacific Northwest have the potential to reduce residential air-conditioning loads by up to 80% during normal weather and up to 70% during extreme heat, due to the climate's cool summer nights that persist, to some extent, even during heatwaves. In homes without air-conditioning, which are common regionally, passive cooling resources are also strong enough to eliminate dangerous heat index levels indoors, even during extreme heat. This has important policy implications: the passive survivability of affordable housing could be improved immediately by requiring secure operable windows, well-designed window shading, and public service messaging to guide their operation.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The studies above showed the value of controlling operable elements in response to changing outdoor conditions; however, the ideal thresholds for opening and closing these elements are not intuitive. To improve human abilities to operate manual passive systems, we applied reinforcement learning (RL), a form of artificial intelligence, to this problem in a new way. Using prior knowledge, we derived a set of ?expert? rules; initialized an RL agent with this knowledge; and trained climate-specific agents in several major U.S. climates. Unexpectedly, these agents greatly reduced heating and cooling loads (by 50-99%) in related yet unfamiliar climates, showing that RL agents can be pre-trained regionally, avoiding lengthy training in specific cities. Further, these agents remained highly effective in dwellings that varied in orientation, window glass properties, internal heat gain, and air leakage, showing that lengthy training in specific dwellings is also avoidable.

These dwellings will allow us to quantify passive system performance and to develop human-in-the-loop control systems, supporting further progress. Additionally, we have worked with Dunes City, Silverton, and La Pine, Oregon, as well as the transitional housing community Opportunity Village Eugene, to develop passive heating and cooling strategies for city buildings and shelters, promoting citizen engagement in science and working to benefit people in marginalized communities.

Further, these agents remained highly effective in dwellings that varied in orientation, window glass properties, internal heat gain, and air leakage, showing that lengthy training in specific dwellings is also avoidable. These findings remove a key barrier to the use of intelligent controls in passive systems.\nThese findings will soon be tested in a new experimental apartment dwelling and its conventional twin at the University of Oregon, designed by our industrial partner Mithun. These dwellings will allow us to quantify passive system performance and to develop human-in-the-loop control systems, supporting further progress. Additionally, we have worked with Dunes City, Silverton, and La Pine, Oregon, as well as the transitional housing community Opportunity Village Eugene, to develop passive heating and cooling strategies for city buildings and shelters, promoting citizen engagement in science and working to benefit people in marginalized communities. These investigations have also trained seven women and three students of color, promoting much-needed diversity in the STEM workforce.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/22/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alexandra R Rempel"
