 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions Program (HSI Program) aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge about how to achieve these aims.  This project at Saint Xavier University will advance the aims of the HSI Program by increasing retention and graduation rates of undergraduates in STEM fields.  To this end, the project will create a STEM Studio that will provide students with ongoing community, social, and academic supports.  The STEM Studio will also serve as the hub for experiential learning opportunities and systemic faculty and peer mentoring of undergraduate students. Many high-impact educational experiences designed to broaden participation in STEM are directed at high-achieving and/or lower-achieving students.  In contrast, this project will connect all students to high-impact educational experiences from which they are likely to show direct, measurable benefits. By addressing major challenges faced by many undergraduates majoring in STEM, Saint Xavier University expects to increase retention and graduation rates, which in turn will open doors to graduate level work and careers in STEM fields.\r\n \r\nTo achieve the overarching goal of improving retention and graduation rates, the project will implement four objectives: (1) create the STEM Studio to provide a gathering place for a community of Saint Xavier University scientific scholars; (2) centralize targeted academic support strategies for undergraduates in science courses at critical transition points; (3) provide opportunities for student-faculty collaborative research and for other high-impact learning experiences such as short-term field research; and (4) provide networking opportunities and curriculum enhancements that connect academic coursework to the workplace. Success of this program will be evaluated in terms of both persistence to degree and assessment of the institutional climate for inclusivity. The project will apply a multivariate statistical analysis to the collected data to identify correlations between the objectives, student perceptions of validation and belonging, and academic outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\nIntellectual Merit:\n\n\n\n\nSXU proposed to evaluate the program's success by assessing both persistence to degree and the institutional climate for inclusivity. This work focused on \"average\" students (those receiving a C in first-year biology/chemistry coursework) in order to connect these students to high-impact educational experiences, measure their persistence to a STEM degree, and track their post-graduation education and occupation plans. \n\n\n\n\nTo improve inclusivity and sense of belonging, the STEM studio was created. The STEM studio symbolized the institutions commitment to STEM and served as a hub for STEM students to gather, socialize, and study. It also served as a central location for peer-to-peer learning, tutoring, and mentoring. A peer mentor leading study groups led to other students helping their peers, creating a chain of learning facilitated by the STEM Studio, extending the benefits of mentoring to more students.\n\n\n\n\nThis work also aimed to provide high-impact educational experiences for students, especially those who may not normally have the access or opportunity to participate.  The majority of our students are commuter students and live at home. Due to busy work schedules, students are often unable to participate in high-impact experiences on campus. The following high-impact experiences were offered over the course of the grant, at no cost to the students and many with stipends: Research fellowships during the summer and academic year in which students were paired with an SXU faculty or local industrial partner as a mentor (100 students total); Field Experience trip to Yellowstone National Park in collaboration with Yellowstone Forever (74 students total, some of which had never traveled without family or been on an airplane); Natural History of the Vertebrates Field Experience to Missouri (17 students total); GRE preparation class and financial support for the test (32 students); STEM Careers course (52 students total). \n\n\n\n\nFor the STEM careers course, students visited local industrial companies to learn about potential job and career opportunities. Self-reported data demonstrated that before the class, students knew little about STEM careers available to them, the application process and specific jobs and internships, but were much more knowledgeable after the class. Students were able to effectively communicate their future career goals, plan the rest of their academic career, write a tailored cover letter, construct a resume, conduct themselves professionally in a formal mock interview, and utilize SXUs Career Services for further support. \n\n\n\n\nInstitutional Research was able to correlate participation in the grant with persistence and retention. For example, in 2019, students who participated in the grant in at least one activity had higher re-enrollment rates than students who did not participate. In 2020, Students who participated in the grant were more likely to persist to the following year, replicating the 2019 trends. Among chemistry majors, 100% of participants were registered for fall 2020 compared with 83.3% of non-participants. Similarly, 94.1% of Biology majors who participated in the grant were registered for fall 2020 compared with 89.8% of non-participants. These trends continued in 2021 and 2022: students who participated in grant activities  either in person or virtual  were more likely to continue into the next academic year. These trends were replicated when examining only the Latin-X students. In 2023, preliminary data shows similar trends. Retention of STEM students in their first year increased from 85.2% in 2021 to 89.1% in 2022, a significant increase compared to their non-STEM counterparts who had a retention rate of 86.7% for the fall 2022 semester.\n\n\n\n\nBroader Impacts:\n\n\n\n\nThe original hypothesis was that that retention/persistence will improve as well as validation of belonging among undergraduates who participate in the STEM studio, which will lead to an increase in Hispanics in STEM related occupations and/or graduate work in a STEM field.  The STEM Studio hosted programs aimed at helping students cultivate their identities as scientists from the beginning, integrating preparation for graduate school and career mentoring into its academic support services. In 2022, over 65% of visits were accounted for by first year students showing an increase in awareness of grant activities and resources from the onset of the school year. Additionally, during the final year of the grant, Latin-X students accounted for over 60% of STEM studio visits (compared to overall SXU 2024 demographic profile of 51.7% Latin-X).The increased usage of the STEM studio by first-year studentsdemonstrated that we are making progress to help students identify as scientists early in their academic careers. The strong participation of Latin-X students in the STEM studio and activities demonstrates that we have helped this group of students prepare for scientific careers. Since the STEM studio has been institutionalized, it will continue to serve at least 100 students each year. Although most data on graduate school and careers right after college is still preliminary, many students who participated in the grant have started graduate programs or jobs in STEM. \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/29/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Julia BinghamWiester\n"
