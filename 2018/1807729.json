 "awd_abstract_narration": "The efficiency and selectivity of chemical processes in biological systems often stem from the localization of reactants in highly restricted and organized environments.  Some of these processes (e.g., photosynthesis) harness light as the source of energy for driving the reactions.  The research program of Prof. Vaidhyanathan Ramamurthy at University of Miami focuses on fundamental understanding of the properties of molecules in confined space and exploring the use of light to initiate reactions in water.  The long-term goal is to address the national needs in sustainability by developing efficient methods for capturing and converting sunlight (a sustainable source of energy) into chemical energy through transformations in water (that avoids environmental issues associated with the use of organic solvents).  This interdisciplinary project involving domestic and international collaborations provides research training to graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. Additionally, Prof. Ramamurthy reaches out to undergraduate and graduate students at universities within and outside USA and motivates young researchers toward becoming successful scientists through his general lectures that highlight the importance of basic science in the context of everyday applications. \r\n\r\nWith the goal of understanding the behavior of molecules in confined environments and enhancing the selectivity and efficacy of reactions in water, Prof. Ramamurthy's group synthesizes water-soluble cavitands that encapsulate organic molecules and serve as reaction vessels with dimensions of a few angstroms.  The research team investigates the generation of reactive organic radical ions in the capsule by photoinduced electron transfer from encapsulated donors across the capsular wall to acceptors (e.g., a water-soluble sensitizer or TiO2) present outside, harnessing solar energy for chemical transformations in water.  The photochemical reactions being studied include the geometric isomerization of olefins and cyclopropanes, cycloaddition reactions to produce energy rich cyclobutanes, valence isomerization to generate highly strained molecules and cycloreversion reactions.  Spectroscopic studies, including ultrafast (ns-fs) experiments, are performed to measure the rates of electron transfer, identify the radical ion intermediates, determine the reactivity of the intermediates, and elucidate the product structures.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\nPlants produce food materials essential for our survival, utilizing the abundantly available light by pre-organizing readily available molecules, via catalytic transformations.  Most important chemistry driving all living-beings, occur in highly organized assemblies (proteins) in water with limited amounts of reagents in a catalytic manner.  In the context of our long-term goal of establishing methodologies to synthesize and manipulate useful molecules under sustainable and environmentally friendly conditions, our research utilizes light energy for reactions in water by pre-organizing the reactant molecules within synthetic nano-reaction vessels. \n\nThe nano-reaction vessel, a protein pocket equivalent that we have explored, is a synthetic organic capsule made up of two molecules of octa acid (OA) with internal space just sufficient to accommodate the reactants.  The rigid framework of the OA capsule limits the motions (dynamics) of molecules during a reaction.  The influence of such restrictions is perhaps most evident for geometric isomerization reactions that result in a large change of molecular structure on the ultrafast time scale (sub-picosecond).  For example, a study of stilbenes, azobenzenes and arylazoisoxazoles has revealed the difference in spatial needs for the geometric isomerization for these systems within OA capsule based on the different mechanisms for isomerization around C=C and N=N bonds.  Since geometric isomerization serves as a switch in a number of biological and material science related events such as vision, molecular-motors etc. the knowledge gained above concerning the dynamics of molecules in restricted spaces is valuable. \n\nNature's strategic pre-organization of molecules improves the energy- and electron transfer efficiency.  Laboratory viability of this approach was tested by monitoring the electron transfer between an OA encapsulated molecule and a free molecule in solution.  Ultrafast time resolved experiments revealed this process to occur undeterred even when the two molecules are separated by a molecular wall.  Close contact and preorganization resulted in higher than diffusion rate constants of electron transfer with the classic Marcus inversion behavior.  Communication was facilitated across capsular wall rather than being curtailed. \n\nCage confinement of two molecules allows probing fast processes, eliminating the need for diffusion.  In the context of fundamental understanding of bimolecular processes, we investigated the photodimerization of anthracene within the OA capsule in water.  Briefly, a combination of molecular modeling, QM calculations, steady state and ultrafast time resolved experiments brought to light the unique features of excimer formation dynamics of aromatic molecules and established that the dynamics in a confined space differs from that in solution.  Suppression of dimerization by reducing reaction space permitted us to gain a better understanding of a fundamental photoprocess, namely excimer formation, an effective competition to the synthetically useful, dimer formation.  Thus, small space confinement of reactive molecules helps override the diffusion needs to bring the reactants together, and affords measurement of faster processes. \n\nTowards finding ways to release small molecules of chemical and physiological relevance in water, on demand upon exposure to light, small photoactive molecules were studied.  The water-soluble OA mediated the transport of water-insoluble photoactive molecules to the water. Recognizing the importance of capsule opening to release the molecule of interest, the dynamics of capsule opening was pursued.  Ultrafast solvation dynamics experiments with coumarin probes revealed the following: (a) capsule opens slightly in picosecond time scale; (b) water molecules then seep and surround the excited chromophore (coumarin) within its lifetime and (c) the extent of capsule opening depends on the guest size.  Information obtained on capsule dynamics is exceptionally useful not only in the context of phototriggers but also in interpreting the results of a large number of photochemical and photophysical experiments and planning future studies.  The well-known strategies of Nature, of confinement and control of free space are yet to become routine tools for chemists.  Studies described here affirm the value of space that can be used to modify the behavior of molecules.   \n\nBroader Impact\n\nUsing the above projects as platform, 10 students, were trained.  Over a period of time through funding mainly by NSF the PI has mentored 47 graduate students and ~15 postdocs and ~10 undergraduate students.  The Covid-19 pandemic gave an opportunity to explore new ways to pass on one?s knowledge gained over time. The PI led weekly seminar program titled 'Light as Reagent and Product' that began during the difficult times of the pandemic to keep the students and faculty in USA and other countries engaged in scholarship continues till date with an average of attendance of ~50.  The PI took yet another advantage of the covid disruption to teach an online course on photochemistry in spring 2021 which in a total of 40 lectures covered the textbook 'Principles of Molecular Photochemistry: An Introduction' co-authored by the PI.  Videos and PowerPoint files of all the lectures available at the PI's website should be a welcome resource for students with little access to a regular course on photochemistry.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/20/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Vaidhyanathan Ramamurthy"
