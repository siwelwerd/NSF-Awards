 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2018 Workshop in Analysis and Probability, to be held at Texas A&M University from July 2 to August 19, 2018, will bring together senior and junior researchers and advanced graduate students in analysis and probability and related fields in order to broaden the education of the younger participants and to promote interaction among researchers working in different areas. It will provide support to many researchers not on sponsored research grants who will benefit from being in an environment that is research friendly and from contact with participants who are leaders in the field. An emphasis is put on the support of junior researchers, minorities, women, and graduate students. The main session of the Workshop will take place during the period from July 2 to August 19.Activities sponsored by the Workshop include the three-day general conference SUMIRFAS (Informal Regional Functional Analysis Seminar)to be held from August 17 to 19, the Concentration Week \"Noncommutative Geometry and Index Theory for Group Actions and Singular Spaces\" to be held from May 21 to 25, and the Concentration Week \"Random Walks in Correlated and Dynamic Environments\" to be held from August 13 to 17. \r\n\r\nThe Workshop activities have a wide impact by providing intellectual stimulation for all participants as well as giving an opportunity to a diverse group of junior participants to increase the breadth and depth of knowledge and to interact with senior researchers in several areas of mathematics. There is also significant outreach to applied mathematics and computer science, and indeed an important aspect of the Workshop is to promote cooperation among researchers in different fields. The Concentration Weeks will include introductory lecture series designed to acquaint junior researchers and non-experts with the basics of an area. All Workshop participants will be invited to disseminate their work through seminars. More details are available at http://www.math.tamu.edu/~kerr/workshop/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
