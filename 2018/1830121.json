 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference project will bring together a diverse group of scholars and practitioners interested in studying the connections between abstract algebra as studied at the university level and the abstract algebra used by teachers in K-12 mathematics. Recent policy documents advocate for including advanced topics such as abstract algebra as a fundamental part of secondary teacher preparation, and a large majority of schools require students to take abstract algebra. Understanding the implications of such a requirement is imperative to improving secondary mathematics education. This conference will gather together people interested in this topic by providing a common space that cuts across communities (e.g., teaching institutions, research institutions, teacher educators), an opportunity not typically offered by established conferences and meetings. Through the dedicated working groups at the conference, all attendees will make progress on research and professional development that will directly contribute to advancing knowledge around the role of connections between advanced and secondary mathematics (particularly abstract algebra) in the preparation of teachers.\r\n\r\nThe conference will meet three objectives. The first objective will be to share current research on mathematical connections between advanced and secondary mathematics, focusing specifically on abstract algebra. The second objective will be to develop plans for research and/or professional development to expand current knowledge on connections between advanced and school mathematics, so that attendees can take concrete steps to move research forward. The third objective will be to provide a space for mathematicians, mathematics educators, and other stakeholders to discuss their work and develop a common vision for future directions. In particular, opportunities will be provided to look across research and practice, name common goals, and elaborate a trajectory for researching and supporting the needs of secondary school teachers to understand and use abstract algebra in their teaching.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
