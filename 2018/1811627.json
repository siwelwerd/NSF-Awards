 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2018, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. This research explores the relationship between form and function, a classic problem in biology. The fellow will investigate this problem by studying the mammalian lumbar spine (lower back). The nature of the form-function relationship varies across organisms, sizes, and structures, and is especially difficult to understand for extreme or unique structures. Extra bony reinforcements have evolved in the spine of anteaters, armadillo, and several shrews, but it is unclear if these reinforcements serve similar functions because their extreme and unusual shapes make them difficult to compare. The fellow will use specialized imaging techniques to analyze the internal structure of the vertebrae in shrews, anteaters, and armadillos. Internal bone structure is indicative of adaptation in response to forces applied to a bone, so this analysis will determine possible functional similarities between these structures that is difficult to detect using external bone structure. This project will promote understanding of how natural selection works to shape morphology; further, it provides an exciting example to demonstrate to the public that scientific understanding of evolution is constantly growing, and collections-based research is critical for facilitating that growth.\r\n\r\nThe fellow will quantify trabecular bone morphology of the lumbar spine in shrews and xenarthrans to test the following hypotheses: 1) convergent evolution of supplementary intervertebral articulations in shrews and xenarthrans reflects adaptation to similar in-vivo loading schemes; 2) a greater degree of external modification corresponds to a vertebral column that is more robust to bearing high in-vivo loads; and 3) vertebral function varies across shrews and xenarthrans according to locomotor type rather than size or phylogeny. The fellow will receive training in micro-CT imaging techniques, quantitative analysis of 3D morphological data, and phylogenetic comparative methods; 3D data collected during this project will be made publicly available for use by future researchers. The fellow will engage the public in the study of convergent evolution and extreme morphologies through education and outreach programs, including the Field Museum of Natural History?s YouTube series The Brain Scoop. The fellow will collaborate on videos for The Brain Scoop highlighting this project and collections-based biological research generally, aiming to increasing scientific literacy and critical thinking skills by encouraging audience members to become engaged with natural history.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Smith has completed a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology (Research Using Biological Collections) at the Field Museum of Natural History with primary mentor K.D. Angielczyk. Additional mentorship was provided by L.R. Heaney and J.C. Kerbis Peterhans of the Field Museum, and Z-X. Luo of the University of Chicago. The research executed during this fellowship investigated the functional morphology of trabecular bone (the spongy bone tissue inside vertebrae, some cranial bones, and limb bones of vertebrates). This work investigated the utility of using trabecular bone morphology to understand the ecology and function of unusual skeletal morphologies in rare or hard-to-study animals, specifically the enigmatic African hero shrew (genus <em>Scutisorex</em>). This shrew has a robustly reinforced spinal column unlike that of any other mammal. Smith and colleagues sought to uncover how the hero shrew uses this spine via inspection of its trabecular bone structure, which can provide clues about in-vivo function and mechanical adaptation.</p>\n<p>The investigations conducted during this fellowship yielded several new and important discoveries.</p>\n<p>First, X-ray &mu;CT inspection of the highly unusual spine of the hero shrew, and comparison with that of more common shrew morphologies, showed that the hero shrew is better equipped than other shrews to withstand compressive forces on its spine. We also found that the internal structure of hero shrew vertebrae is likely related to their external shape, and that both have distinct morphological regions along the spinal column; the disparity of function among those regions is being investigated further with other collaborators.</p>\n<p>Second, our work revealed that trabecular bone in small mammals can be morphologically disparate and diverse even within a single mammalian subfamily. More research is necessary to understand the phylogenetic, ecological, and functional influences on trabecular bone morphology and plasticity. This discovery, and the experience and training PI Smith gained during the fellowship, resulted in a second postdoctoral fellowship at the Field Museum to research the trabecular bone of several rodent groups, as well as proposals for new funding to investigate trabecular bone across a larger variety of mammals.</p>\n<p>Third, through collaboration with an undergraduate researcher (E.H. Zack, University of Chicago), we showed that captive animals (specifically captive xenarthrans: armadillos, anteaters, and sloths) have quantitatively different trabecular bone morphology from their wild counterparts. Although they are common in museum collections, and often serve to widen the phylogenetic breadth of morphological studies, captive specimens should not be used in studies investigating trabecular bone morphology, as they may result in incorrect inferences about how trabecular bone morphology relates to ecology and function.</p>\n<p>Results from this work have been featured in National Geographic and Smithsonian Magazine, as well as the Field Museum Member Magazine.
