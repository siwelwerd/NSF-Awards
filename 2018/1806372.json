 "awd_abstract_narration": "Complexity science is one of the deep outstanding problems of the 21st century.  What are the origins of complexity generally?  Does it appear at the quantum level?  If so, how can it be quantified and what exactly does it imply?  This work will address these questions in three concrete experimental contexts in quantum simulator platforms, promoting national interests through the progress of science.  This work will expand atomic, molecular, and optical physics and quantum information science further into complexity science, providing a concrete way to quantify complexity of quantum states.  It will provide an interdisciplinary connection to statistical physics and complex network science, applied up till now mainly at the classical level.  The semiconductor technological revolution is based heavily on single-particle quantum mechanics, from band theory to quantum tunneling; the next step in quantum technology will certainly involve entanglement.  This proposal will explore complexity science as a key component of that next revolution, by determining the complexity of entanglement.\r\n\r\nThis team will explore the complexity of quantum critical phenomena by applying complex network measures to quantum mutual information, bounded from below by all two-point correlators.  What is the role of finite temperature and disorder in complexity?  How does complexity depend on different universality classes?  Second, this team will study the emergence of complexity in quantum cellular automata, in particular in Goldilocks rules, which exhibit robust dynamical features and persistent entropy fluctuations.  What are the dynamical properties of complexity?  Does it decohere easily?  How sensitive is it to gate fidelity in quantum operations, or precision of a Hamiltonian realized in a quantum simulator?  Third, this team will apply complex network measures to higher order phase correlators in atom interferometry.  Does complexity depend on the order of the correlator?  What new features might be unlocked in the high-dimensional spaces of such correlators with a complexity perspective?  Moreover, this grant supports the training of undergraduate and graduate students in critical analysis for scientific problem solving and rigorous numerical techniques for high-performance parallel computing, which are key to success in a number of arenas in society, from the materials genome initiative to the space program to quantum computing and the next stage of quantum technology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit:\n\n \n\nThis project has made significant contributions to our understanding of complex networks and physical complexity in quantum systems.  Physical complexity arises from many parts with simple interactions leading to emergent mathematically identifiable behavior, and is distinct from computational complexity, which treats the hardness of computational problems.  Physical complexity has not been widely recognized in quantum systems until recently, and in this grant we took many steps to establish that with increasing number of qubits and interactions between them (entanglement), mathematically identifiable complexity can arise.  Common measures we used included those drawn directly from neuroscience, such as mutual information.  Outcomes included identifying critical points of phase transitions in quantum matter, identifying small world networks emerging in quantum computers, and establishing the various facets of complexity writ large in a wide variety of quantum information contexts.  Our focus was on atomic, molecular, and optical platforms, but the results are widely applicable to many quantum information systems, including demonstrating new possibilities in quantum computing.\n\n \n\nBroader impact:\n\nComplexity science courses were developed and taught throughout the grant, including during the pandemic incorporating mathematical modeling for the Covid-19 outbreak as presented in public media such as newspapers.  Complexity methods were used to establish the benefits of student collaboration in education research including exploration of the effects of the pandemic and the hybrid and remote learning environments.  Public lectures were presented to non-STEM audiences ranging from science comedy to the Foreign Service Institute.\n\nThe PI served as a senior advisor to the publishing board of the new Journal of Physics: Complexity, as a Jefferson Science Fellow of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to the US Dept of State working on our quantum relationships with a number of like-minded nations, as an Embassy Science Fellow, and as an organizer for the March Meeting of the American Physical Society, among other activities. \n\nUndergraduate, MS, and PhD students were trained throughout the grant and have obtained academic and industry positions contributing to US society including in quantum technologies, where we have severe workforce needs at present. \n\nQuantum information science and engineering roadmaps were developed with national and international impact throughout academia, industry, and government.
