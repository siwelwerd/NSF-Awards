The analysis will address questions of the relative contribution of energy and momentum transfer from different sources. A long-term database of wind profiles will be developed and made available to the community to be used for testing of complex models.\r\n\r\nThis study will advance the understanding of ion-neutral coupling and energy, mass and momentum transfer between the magnetosphere, thermosphere, and atmosphere, and will investigate auroral effects on lower thermospheric winds. Case studies will be used to examine events of strong atmospheric or auroral forcing. The long-term data base will provide information about trends in lower thermospheric winds and which forcing mechanisms are most responsible for long-term variability.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nSummary of Effort:\n\nWe proposed to use a nearly continuously  sampled dataset from the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR)  spanning 10 years (from 2007 to present) to investigate the climatology  and variability of high-latitude E-region thermospheric winds. Of  particular interest are the intermediate driving scenarios, where it is  unclear whether magnetospheric driving from above or atmospheric driving  from below are shaping the observed neutral winds.\n\nWe specifically proposed to address three scientific questions:\n1.  What are the characteristics and range of responses of lower  thermospheric winds to auroral and background atmospheric forcing at  high latitudes? \n\n2. What effect does structure in high-latitude lower thermospheric  winds have on the modulation of energy dissipation through Joule  heating?\n\n3. What are the properties of vertical neutral winds and how common are large vertical winds in the lower thermosphere?\n\nOur methodology is to develop a long-term database of E-region  thermospheric wind profiles and Joule heating, undertake correlation  analysis to categorize background forcing and auroral effects on lower  thermospheric winds, and use case studies to examine events of strong  atmospheric or auroral forcing.  We expect that the primary product to  the community from this study will be a long term data base of E-region  neutral wind profiles that can be used independently or assimilated into  the Horizontal Wind Model, and scientific publications.\n\n \n\nKey Outcomes:\n\nThis investigation produced one of the largest ISR derive database of E-region  neutral winds to date spanning from 2010-2019. These data are posted on Zenodo  (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5781251). The database not  only includes the neutral winds, but also the electric fields,  conductivities, neutral drag terms (Hall and Pedersen), and some  associated forces (Coriolis, Lorentz, centrifugal).\n\nThe outcome of this investigation primarily addressed scientific question #2 and #1.  This investigation produced 2 peer-reviewed publication,  contributions to 1 book chapter, and contributions to Rafael Mesquita's  doctoral disseration.  The peer reviewed publications focused very heavily  on Science Question #2 above.  Our results have also been used by a  number of other investigations, with future publications pending.\n\nThe majority of the effort was data processing and data analysis,  which was accomplished by a postdoctoral research associate and a graduate student.  Two undergraduate students at Clemson University were supported by this effort and gained exposure to incoherent scatter  radar.\n\n \n\n \n\nSignificant Results:\nOne of the key findings from our  investigation was quantifying how seasonal, geomagnetic, and the solar  cycle impacts the E-region Joule heating rate.  This paper, written by postdoc Weijia Zhan, was an example of the kind of investigation that  was very well suited for this investigation using the long-duration database of  PFISR observations.  The most significant result from this  investigation was that the Joule heating rate follows the seasonal  changes of the electric field predominantly.  Although this conclusion  may be somewhat obvious, this paper was one of the first ISR  investigations, and one of the first investigations in general, to  examine seasonal effects on the Joule heating rate.  \n  \nThe other peer reviewed Joule heating paper discussed the technique and we compared our  observations to an appropriate previous investigation, namely, Aikio et al.,  2012 and Cai et al., 2013.  We found some differences in the MLT  occurance of the peak Joule heating rate.  We  found during Fall 2015 which had similar conditions to the interval  investigated by Aikio et al., 2012, we found the peak Joule heating rate  occurred during the evening/dusk sector.  Some of these findings could be attributed to the different geographic location of PFISR relative to the EISCAT ISRs. \n  \nThe book chapter included some results of Joule heating from PFISR  and some of the initial results we had produced.  These results were  illustrative of the Joule heating response we observed at PFISR and  served to help understand the nature of energy transfer through Joule  heating.\n \nPublications:\n\nZhan, W.,  Kaeppler, S.
