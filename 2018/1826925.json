A strong representation of U.S. researchers, particularly students, at the SIGIR conference is essential to maintaining U.S. competitiveness in this important area today and into the future. We recognize the importance of recruiting and engaging students in information retrieval research in early stages of their graduate studies as well as broadening participation of underrepresented students. Support will be provided to 25 US-based graduate students, selected by the SIGIR 2018 Student Sponsorship Committee, on the basis of merit and need. The selection of students receiving the support will also put emphasis on the diversity of the students. Students will be able to present and discuss their research with each other and with senior researchers and help to form future research collaborations.\r\n\r\nSIGIR is the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval. Since 1963, the SIGIR conference has promoted research, development and education in the area of search and other information access technologies. It is the major international forum for the presentation of new research and the demonstration of new systems and techniques in the broad field of information retrieval. It covers all aspects of information retrieval research, including theories and foundations, algorithms and applications, and evaluation and analysis. The SIGIR conference program includes oral and poster presentations of refereed papers as well as panel discussions and invited talks by the leading experts from industry and academia. Information on SIGIR 2018 can be accessed at http://sigir.org/sigir2018/. Proceedings will be made available through the ACM Digital Library.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
