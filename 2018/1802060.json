 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research into algebraic geometry, a subject concerned with the study of systems of polynomial equations in many variables.  The solutions to such systems give rise to algebraic varieties, which are fundamental objects of study in algebraic geometry.  Algebraic topology is the study of systematically attaching algebraic invariants (numbers or abstract algebraic structures) to spaces; such invariants do not depend on the way a space is pulled or twisted (without tearing it).  It is natural to try to analyze algebraic varieties using the tools of algebraic topology.  However, when algebraic varieties do not have obvious \"spatial structure,\" such as when they arise in arithmetic settings, then a new approach is required.  The project under consideration seeks to analyze algebraic invariants of algebraic varieties using a new framework.  This theory allows one to apply the full power of techniques of algebraic topology to objects of interest in algebraic geometry -- one may treat spaces having complicated arithmetic structure, but a priori limited geometric structure, in essentially the same way as more classical spaces.  The current project seeks to analyze certain classical algebraic and arithmetic questions using these new techniques and to provide a better understanding of specific systems of algebraic equations, which is fundamental to many areas of mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe investigator will study questions regarding projective modules over commutative unital algebras over a field, and related topological and arithmetic questions, by means of the Morel-Voevodsky A1-homotopy theory.  Among other topics, the project investigates the following concrete (and classical) questions.  Given a complex algebraic variety, which topological vector bundles admit algebraic structures?  How many algebraic vector bundles are there on a smooth affine variety over a finite field (say with fixed invariants)?  By their very nature, these questions draw together several branches of mathematics and thus illustrate the fundamental unity of the subject.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAlgebraic geometry is a subject, going back to classical civilizations, which analyzes the geometric structure of simultaneous solutions to systems of polynomial equations.  Typically such objects are viewed as quite ``rigid\".  Algebraic topology is a subject, invented roughly at the beginning of the last century, giving tools to analyze the ``soft\" structure of geometric objects, e.g., those aspects of that are insensitive to bending and twisting.  Typically it keeps track of ``flexible\" information, e.g., the number of holes.  Motivic homotopy theory is a framework that allows one to apply the ``flexible\" ideas of algebraic topology to analyze ``rigid\" structures that appear in algebraic geometry.  \n\nThis project was focused on analyzing applications of motivic homotopy theory to topological questions.  For example, what sort of restrictions are there on the topological structures underlying objects of algebro-geometric origin.  In the course of the project, a number of fundamental new tools were built to study such problems: the foundations of A^1-homotopy theory were clarified and generalized in work of the PI making the theory more explicitly applicable to classical problems in algebra.  In particular, these new tools were leveraged to shed light on and partially resolve several decades-old problems.  The PI, in collaboration, established a tool allowing one to pass from ``unstable\" to ``stable\" motivic homotopy theory; this discovery is transformative as it makes a host of classical problems computationally accessible.  Among other things, the PI used this to essentially completely resolve a conjecture from the late 80s of M.P. Murthy.\n\nThe project also provided resources to broaden participation of early career researchers and underrepresented groups in mathematics.  In this direction, the PI (co-)organized various conferences and summer schools.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/07/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Aravind Asok"
