 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable autonomous vehicles to make risk-aware decisions at high-speed, by reasoning about the uncertain movements of the people and cars around them to anticipate risks and react defensively. This technology will make new technical approaches to safety and risk viable for the first time. It will enable autonomous cars to drive at regular speeds in dense, highly populated urban environments while reducing the likelihood of accidents - thereby resulting in faster, safer urban autonomous driving. This will increase public trust in autonomous cars and accelerate the development of a new industry which could reshape transportation, freeing people from the need to drive their own cars and increasing their free time and productivity.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a specialized processor for risk-aware motion planning for autonomous vehicles. Motion planning is a critical problem for autonomous cars, which must decide how to move through space to reach a designated goal without colliding with a static obstacle, another vehicle, or a pedestrian. Existing approaches can only construct a few plans per second, and assume that the other road-users will continue on their current trajectories. This is acceptable for highways but not for urban driving, where distances are short and other road-users can change behavior suddenly. This project aims to develop a prototype of a specialized motion planning processor that plans in milliseconds, enabling it to consider all likely future movements of other road-users to anticipate risks and react defensively. This proposal aims to evaluate the feasibility of the processor by designing a prototype, demonstrating that it results in safer driving at normal speeds in urban environments, and quantifying its performance improvements over existing solutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These customers include personal car\nmanufacturers (Tesla, Toyota, Ford, etc.), existing and future car\nsharing services (Uber, Lyft, Zoox, Ford, etc), and companies that\nfocus specifically on technology for autonomy (e.g., Google, Samsung,\nIntel, etc). All of these companies are striving to achieve the goal\nof fully autonomous vehicles--driving at normal speeds, with lower\npower and minimal risk of accidents--and a key remaining hurdle is\nlow-power, risk-aware motion planning.  Motion planning is the process\nof computing the movements that the vehicle should take in order to\nreach its goals while minimizing the risk of collisions.\n\nCurrent autonomous vehicles perform motion planning through the use of\nhigh-performance commodity processors, including graphics processing\nunits (GPUs). These processors consume kilowatts of power, yet cannot\nplan fast enough to accommodate uncertain behaviors in other agents\n(cars, bicycles, and pedestrians).  Autonomous cars currently employ\nsub-optimal schemes to work around their inability to perform\nlow-power, risk-aware motion planning, such as driving abnormally\nslowly.\n\nWe have developed a novel processor design that performs low-power,\nextremely high-speed motion planning for autonomous vehicles. All\nexisting solutions rely on writing software to run on commodity\nprocessors, an approach that is fundamentally insufficient for\nembedding risk awareness in the motion planning process. Our project\nis the very first special-purpose motion processor for autonomous\nvehicles. To achieve our goals, our design has to incorporate\nprobabilistic knowledge about agents, model and assess the compound\nrisk of each candidate motion plan, and choose the lowest risk path at\nsufficiently high frequency.  If ultimately successful, our technology\nwill positively disrupt the entire transportation market by enabling\nrapid adoption of autonomous vehicles, since they will be thus able to\nbehave like and safely co-exist with human driven vehicles.\n\nThis project has led to one very important outcome: we have\ndemonstrated that our high-speed motion planning technology can\nindeed reduce accidents in urban scenarios.  We have developed a\nsophisticated simulator that models an urban environment--complete\nwith other cars, bicyclists, and pedestrians--and the behaviors of an\nautonomous vehicle both with and without our technology.  The\nsimulator convincingly shows that our motion planner avoids accidents\nin two ways.  First, its sheer speed enables it to re-plan more\nquickly when unexpected events occur.  Second, its ability to plan\nfast enough to accommodate multiple possible behaviors from all of the\nother agents enables it to proactively identify motion plans that will\navoid accidents.\n\nThis project succeeded in demonstrating that our motion planning\nprocessor design can avoid accidents and save lives.  This project now\nserves as the basis for the next phase of this project: implementing\nour processor design in hardware.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/10/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter M Howard"
