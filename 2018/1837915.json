This project will help overcome this problem, by providing fellowship opportunities to faculty, postdocs, research scientist, graduate student, and senior undergraduates to carry out research in data science priority areas within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  Participant will be co-located with DHS mentors and staff. The program broadly benefits the data ecosystem by serving as a backbone for research collaboration on pressing United states safety and security concerns.\r\n\r\nThe goals of this program are to support academics in developing industry and government relationships for research collaboration and career success; prepare students for the workforce landscape in data science, computing, and Big Data research; and create a diverse Big Data pipeline from university research through to real-world impact in government service.  The proposed program is modeled after the innovative and successful Big Data Regional Innovation South Hub's Program to Empower Partnerships with Industry and Government (PEPI-G) program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
