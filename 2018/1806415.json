 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major scientific achievement of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model of particle physics. The Standard Model is a successful theory, agreeing with decades of experimental observations involving weak, electromagnetic, and strong interactions. The Higgs boson discovery at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN completes the suite of predicted Standard Model particles and provides a mechanism for generating elementary particle masses. However, the current formulation of the Standard Model does not account for the observed value of the Higgs boson mass, making discovery of physics beyond the Standard Model a primary goal of the LHC experiments, including those being carried out in this project involving the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS).\r\n\r\nThis work will focus on searches for new physics, as well as upgrade developments toward the silicon-based outer tracker for the CMS experiment during the High-Luminosity LHC run in the mid-2020s. This research will also engage undergraduate students in CMS data analysis and detector hardware projects at Bethel University, Fermilab, and CERN. The primary analysis goal is to search for vector-like quark (VLQ) pair production with the record-breaking CMS dataset. Several deep machine learning algorithms will be developed to identify hadronic decays of bottom quarks, top quarks, W, Z, and Higgs bosons, which are all reconstructed as jets with unique internal structure. With these deep learning techniques, VLQ pair production searches can be dramatically improved to include identification and mass reconstruction. Specifically, this work will use image recognition machine learning techniques to develop jet identification algorithms for HL-LHC studies. Additionally, extensive development will be made on design features and assembly procedures for upgraded silicon tracker modules. The Bethel CMS group will characterize silicon sensors with updates to an existing probe station and will participate in module production tests at Fermilab. The Bethel group is also engaged with several outreach and education activities, reaching high school students and the general public through tours of detector exhibits and preparing new students and collaborators for CMS analysis via an annual Data Analysis School and hands-on summer tutorials. The Bethel group will also develop inquiry-based Open Data analysis exercises appropriate for upper-level modern physics courses and/or advanced laboratory courses to be shared with other universities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The group's primary physics goal has been searching for \"vector-like quarks\" in high-energy proton collision data collected during 2016 -- 2018. Vector-like quarks are an example of massive particles that could be added to the standard model of particle physics to reduce the amount of fine tuning required to explain the observed mass of the Higgs boson particle. This search engaged students in comparing deep machine learning algorithms that identify different particle decays within the detector, as well as training a new deep network to separate events with and without vector-like quark signatures. These new methods provided the best-ever chance to find vector-like quarks in the mass range from 0.9 -- 1.8 TeV/c<sup>2</sup>, but the data showed no evidence of their presence for masses below approximately 1.5 TeV/c<sup>2</sup>. This paper has been submitted to the Journal of High Energy Physcs for review and publication. In tandem, students studied new analysis techniques based on dataframes and columnar processing to make data analysis lighter and faster in future searches.</p>\n<p>The Bethel group supported the operation and upgrades of the outer tracking detector within CMS. Two students ran monitoring shifts to certify the quality of 2016 data after it had been reprocessed, and they developed new monitoring graphics that have been integrated into the experiment's central toolkit for use during future data certification. Other students joined the team at Fermilab's Silicon Detector Laboratory to prepare assembly procedures for silicon sensor modules. They built a sensor probing station at Bethel for training, and then performed quality control tests on an early batch of sensors at Fermilab. Dr. Hogan also supported the upgrade project by validating simulations of the future detector and organizing the production of over four billion simulated events for technical design reports and physics studies. One research student explored methods for particle identification with deep learning in the future collider environment, and went on to present his work to the Swedish Federation of Young Scientists at Nobel week in 2019.</p>\n<p>Also at Fermilab, Dr. Hogan facilitated several CMS \"school\" exercises for graduate students. The Bethel group enlivened the summer 2019 tutorial sessions by rendering a proton collision event into LEGO bricks in order to teach graduate students about the \"particle flow\" algorithm used to reconstruct collisions in CMS. To promote education outside the experiment, the Bethel group developed code, websites, and class exercises to help the public engage with CMS data hosted on the CERN Open Data Portal. Two students prepared code examples and a user's guide to support Dr. Hogan's lessons at CMS Open Data Workshops for Theorists in 2020 and 2021. Second-year students in Bethel's Modern Physics course were introduced to Open Data via a three-week lab MATLAB exercise designed by Dr. Hogan, in which they reconstruct particles decaying to two muons and learn the basics of statistical analysis. A research student translated this exercise into interactive Python notebooks that students access online. The \"Particle Discovery Lab\" was presented to faculty members from other universities in an Advanced Physics Lab Association immersion in 2021.</p>\n<p>Most of the 15 undergraduates who participated in this research have now graduated, and alumni have gone on to jobs in STEM industries or graduate study in physics, math, and data science. Seven students completed an undergraduate thesis on their research, and many students shared their accomplishments in talks or posters at American Physical Society meetings. Travel to CERN and Fermilab before the COVID-19 pandemic gave students the unique opportunity to immerse themselves in the high-energy physics community, including a rare chance to visit the CMS detector itself.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/22/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Julie&nbsp;Hogan</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1806415/1806415_10569862_1663858489366_IMG_20191002_161727719(1)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1806415/1806415_10569862_1663858489366_IMG_20191002_161727719(1)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Bethel LEGO Particle Flow model\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1806415/1806415_10569862_1663858489366_IMG_20191002_161727719(1)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Bethel LEGO Particle Flow model\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Dr. Julie Hogan (left) and students Evan Scharnick (middle) and Cody Holz (right) with the LEGO Particle Flow model.
