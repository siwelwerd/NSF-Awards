 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that the project device has the potential to become the next generation of ultra-low power devices. Tunnel Field Effect Transistors (TFETs), especially those with type III-V heterostructures, are excellent candidates to overcome both size and power scaling issue of Silicon metal?oxide?semiconductor field-effect transistor (Si MOSFET). III-V heterojunction TFET can easily achieve low power consumption by having high on-current and low off-current within a very short range of applied voltage. One of the bottlenecks for III-V materials to become mainstream is the lack of integration with current silicon manufacturing technology. The proposed device demonstrates technology that is compatible with silicon manufacturing technology which has the most commercial impact compared to any other III-V materials devices as it does not require any changes in the existing manufacturing process. By realizing this device, it will open the opportunity to replace the current existing FinFET technology in cellphone and computers, making a new generation of portable devices for logic applications and enabling ever-connected internet of things applications.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project proposes to create a low power tunneling field effect transistor (TFET) on a silicon substrate using novel fabrication techniques. The device employs InAs/AlSb/GaSb junction as the tunneling junction. This unique junction produces effective modulation of electron tunneling under control of the applied gate bias. The tunneling barrier AlSb layer is sandwiched between InAs and GaSb. This configuration allows the free band movements between InAs and GaSb. This unique junction is combined with a fin type channel structure to allow effective control over the active channel region by the surrounding gate metals. The fin device architecture will allow excellent gate electro-static control, and combining it with the tunneling mechanism will enable the fabricated devices to achieve a subthreshold slope much smaller than 60mV/dec. Another unique aspect of the proposed design is the use of elevated asymmetric T-shaped source and drain.",

After customer discovery, we found out that our high speed transistors, including InP/GaAsSb heterojunction bipolar transistors and InAlN/GaN high electron mobility transistors on silicon substrate, instead of the tunneling field effect transistors, have higher potential to be commercialized. Following the story of superacid treatment on InAs fin field effect transistors, we found that our invented superacid treatment has a great impact on the performances of InAs finfets, which includes enhancing device on-currrent and reducing device subthreshold slope. The on-current improvement is beneficial for high frequency applications and the subthreshold slope is beneficial for low power applications. The underlying physical and chemical mechanisms are still under investigation. The hypothesis is that such as treatment reduces the In oxide in the InAs layer and such a treatment reduces the InAs/oxide interface traps, induces surface passivation and therefore improves the electron mobility of InAs. The superacid treatment can be further extended to any semiconductor that contains Indium.

We are in the progress of making the prototype of this type of transistors. Since the epitaxial heterojunctions of InP/GaAsSb transistors contains InGaAs layers which consists of Indium, we plan to apply the superacid treatment prior to InGaAs contact metal stack, expecting the contact resistance to be drastically reduced. In terms of the research progress, we firstly designed and ordered the epitaxial layer from Intelli-epi semiconductor company.

The fabrications of these transistors are in progress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As for the other type of transistor, GaN high electron mobility transistors, we developed GaN high electron mobility transistors on silicon substrate with record high performances. We demonstrated InAlN/GaN on silicon transistors with record high DC and RF performances (i.e. record high on-current, record high on/off ratio and record high current gain cut-off frequency). For transistors with large gate lengths, it is beneficial for high power applications; for transistors with small gate lengths, it is beneficial for high speed applications. Here we used a dielectric free passivation method to reduce the leakage current at the gate and we also adopted back barrier layer to prevent leakage current through the buffer. The mechanisms behind for reducing the leakage current is still under investigation. Since the InAlN layer in the barrier layer of the HEMTs contains Indium, we plan to apply the superacid treatment method prior to the InAlN contact metal stack, expecting to further reduce the contact resistivity, which plays an important role on the RF performances, especially for aggressively down-scaled devices.

Our developed technology for integration of InP/GaAsSb heterojunction bipolar transistors with InP/GaAsSb photodiode can be used to construct optical receivers.
