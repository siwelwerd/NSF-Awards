 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technological advances have enabled scientists to develop complete understanding of the genomes of many crop species.  However, there are continued challenges in linking the differences in plant genomes to specific traits.  The lack of tools to study epigenetic variation, heritable variation that is not due to changes in DNA sequence, limits our ability to predict plant traits such as seed size and yield.  This project is developing novel tools and approaches for studying the role of epigenetic variation in corn.  These tools require developing a system for targeted editing of genes that regulate epigenetic variation in plants, enabling insights into the role of epigenetic variation in crop development.  The outcomes of this project will provide breakthrough technologies to improve corn and other crops.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research is focused on development of biological materials to study the role of DNA methylation in maize.  Prior work has suggested that DNA methylation is required for proper development of maize.  This project will characterize the genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation in callus of maize in order to document any changes in this cell type.  Genome editing approaches will be utilized to create loss-of-function mutations in three key DNA methylation pathways in cell culture.  These cell lines can then be used to document changes in gene or transposable element expression to provide insights into the roles of DNA methylation in regulation of expression.  Several enzymes known to play roles in demethylation of DNA will also be over-expressed in callus tissue in an attempt to generate partial, or locus-specific, reductions in DNA methylation.  Attempts will be made to recover plants containing the loss-of-function mutations or over-expressing DNA demethylases that would be used to study the effects of these changes in vegetative plant tissues.  The materials generated by this project may provide novel resources for understanding the role of DNA methylation in a species with a large, complex crop genome.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

DNA methylation is a chromatin modification that plays an important role in regulating genome stability.  The goal of this proposal was to develop tools to study the functions of DNA methylation in maize (Zea mays), an important agronomic crop species.  Over 85% of the maize genome is composed of transposable elements.  These transposable elements are often highly methylated and are heavily interspersed with genes.  Prior work in model plant species, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, suggest that DNA methylation plays important roles in keeping transposons repressed and may also play roles in regulating expression of some genes including imprinted expression. \n\nIn order to study the role of DNA methylation in maize we developed tools for increasing or decreasing genomic DNA methylation levels.  Many of the approaches in this proposal required targeted modification of DNA methyltransferase activities and therefore we initially developed a high quality methylome for transformable genotypes of maize and documented the changes in methylation during tissue culture.
