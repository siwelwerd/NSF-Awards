 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants. The three-year project, Montana Models: Connecting Local and Disciplinary Practices through University-Community Partnerships, focuses on creating, implementing, and studying several learning outcomes associated with youth engagement in mathematical modeling contexts. The project builds on existing partnerships between the state's two research universities and Montana 4-H to target outreach to rural youth and bring them into a network of people who can inspire, support, and sustain STEM learning. Middle school and high school students from rural communities will be invited to a university campus for a residential modeling-based summer program l focused on mathematics and mathematical modeling. Activities at the summer program are designed to engage them in problems relevant to their own backgrounds and experiences and to honor their local funds of knowledge. \r\n\r\nThe primary goal of Montana Models is to use mathematical modeling as a mechanism for bringing everyday mathematical practices already present in rural communities into contact with disciplinary practices. The project focuses on the following research questions: (1) What are the everyday mathematical practices in Montana communities? (2) How can everyday mathematical practices be leveraged and brought into contact with disciplinary practices in service of mathematizing meaningful questions within the community? (3) How do youth identify and get identified with respect to mathematics and with respect to their role in the world? (4) How does participation in project activities affect participants' knowledge of mathematical practices and content? The project uses social design experimentation, a hybrid research methodology which combines the traditions of design-based research with forms of inquiry that involve collaboration among participants, researchers, and other stakeholders, such as critical ethnography. Data sources include field notes from ethnographic observations, interviews, videos of students engaging in modeling activities, artifacts that show their  mathematical work, and results from the Attitudes Towards Mathematics Inventory. Through its collaboration with 4-H, Montana Models targets outreach to rural youth across the state, especially those from groups that are typically underrepresented in STEM fields. The project is poised to impact ways in which formal and informal educators understand the knowledge bases that are already present in rural communities and how those bases may inform, support, and sustain STEM learning. Findings and deliverables will be disseminated through a public-facing website and through the 4-H infrastructure. This infrastructure includes Montana 4-H's Clover Communication Contest that will allow participating youth to showcase their projects. Research findings will be shared through local and national conferences and peer-reviewed publications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In this work, we adopted the stance that each and every student possesses practices, skills, and dispositions that make them problem solvers, and we examined their perceptions of who they are and what they are capable of. Our project had three components: (1) Community engagement to learn about local problem-solving practices. We spent time in rural and Indigenous communities, getting to know community members and how they navigated the problems that came up in their daily lives. (2) Youth partnerships to address a local issue. We partnered with youth to address issues that came up in their communities, using local problem-solving practices and mathematical modeling. The issues we addressed ranged from making a crosswalk safer to understanding the prevalence and spread of noxious weeds community land. (3) Summer camp. Youth and community members attended a free summer camp at Montana State University, where they learned about mathematical modeling by building on their local problem-solving strategies, and worked alongside university and government professionals&#8239;to address their community-based issue.\n\n\nMontana Models was funded from 2017-2024. We worked with 59 youth and 15 adult mentors from9 communities. We also supported 4 graduate students and 13 undergraduate students, all of whom gained valuable experience working with rural youth.\n\n\n\n\nWe made multiple discoveries. From our community engagement work, we identified five community-based problem-solving practices that were prevalent across the communities we worked in. The practices are: Find and use resources, Provide and accept care, Try something and adjust, Show self-reliance, and Use practical wisdom. In our engagement with youth, we found that in an environment where these practices are encouraged in problem solving, youth can develop positive identities as community members and mathematicians. From our summer camp, we learned that youths local, community-based problem-solving strategies can be resources for learning mathematics.\n\n\nWe created resources that can improve mathematics teaching across the country. First, we developed strategies that teachers and informal mathematics educators can use to leverage students community-based problem-solving practices to strengthen mathematical learning. Second, we incorporated these strategies into 4 classroom-ready activities designed to help educators create engaging classroom experiences where students learn mathematics by tackling relevant problems using their local problem-solving approaches.\n\n\nThroughout our project, we were active in sharing our results locally, regionally, and nationally. Of note, we worked with youth who participated in our summer camp to identify and share their learning with local stakeholders. Youth reported solutions to problems that originated in their communities to local business leaders, school boards, representatives from the state transportation department, and their tribal council. The projects leadership team was also active in sharing project findings through local and national conferences and publications. Finally, our project provided valuable research experiences to undergraduate and graduate scholars. Montana Models supported students in carrying out local and national presentations, a masters thesis, and a doctoral dissertation. \n\n\nOur findings reveal ways that youth bring powerful, community-based problem-solving strategies into the mathematics classroom. Teachers can build upon these strengths to deepen students mathematical understandings develop students positive identities as mathematicians, and illuminate students ties to their communities. Our resources empower teachers with classroom-ready strategies and activities to unlock this transformative potential.\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/20/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MaryACarlson\n"
