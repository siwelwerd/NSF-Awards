 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biologists have used a well accepted classification system to identify regional areas by the major or predominant vegetation biomes. This largely land-based classification system has been very useful in conducting research and understanding the environmental, geological, and biological features of those regions. These factors influence how ecological systems within the biome are structured and how they function. The classification scheme provides a framework for site- specific research to be understood in a larger regional context and scale the results to the larger region. A weakness or missing part of this framework is streams and rivers. Most maps or lists of biomes of the world would suggest that flowing waters are so similar to one another that all streams can be lumped into a single category. They are generally lumped together regardless of the regional geology, watershed vegetation, or climatic factors. This research will develop a biome classification system for streams to better understand how streams function and provide an ability to predict how streams will change from human and environmental factors.\r\n\r\nThis continental scale project will address the deceptively simple question: is there such a thing as a stream biome? From an ecosystem perspective we now know that inland waters play critical roles in both global carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling. The physical diversity of lotic waters as well as their tendency is more temporally dynamic than terrestrial systems. Ultimately the phenology of stream ecosystem energetics will be a function of energy supply (light and fixed terrestrial carbon) and fixed carbon removal (via hydrologic disturbance). Watershed structure determines the route and rate at which water enters stream channels while watershed vegetation determines the magnitude and timing of fixed carbon inputs and the degree and temporal patterning of light availability. This research effort will increase the measurements of annual metabolism by nearly two orders of magnitude. At the present time there exist only two streams for which annual metabolic rates have been calculated using continuous dissolved oxygen measurements. By the conclusion of this project 55 years of high quality metabolism data will have been generated for a total of 35 streams, and the project PIs will have acquired (via leveraged funds and collaborations) metabolism data for at least 196 additional streams. Metabolism metrics from all of these streams will be used to build the first hierarchical classification of stream ecosystems based on their seasonal and annual patterns of primary productivity and ecosystem respiration. Stream biome delineation will facilitate estimation of stream metabolic rates at timescales of days to years for spatial scales from reaches to river networks. Simulation models, developed from first principles and refined with empirical data specific to each biome, will forecast changes in metabolic rates in response to likely climate and land use change scenarios. The data management plan has been designed in collaboration with informatics staff of the USGS Center for Integrated Data Analytics and USGS has agreed to host and help develop a public data repository, modeling, and data visualization platform specifically designed to collate long-term or high-resolution metabolism and dissolved oxygen datasets for streams. By building, refining and activating a community data platform this research program will change the way individual streams are studied and will facilitate and encourage near instantaneous cross-site synthesis. In addition to capacity building, this project will directly support seven graduate students and 7 postdoctoral associates over the funding period.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDefining Stream Biomes to Better Understand and Forecast Stream Ecosystem Change\n\nPrimary production is the fixation of atmospheric carbon dioxide and release of oxygen by plants while respiration is  the breakdown of that organic carbon and consumption of oxygen by all organisms. Together, primary production and respiration constitute globally large flows with respect to the global carbon cycle.  Streams and rivers contribute to these carbon flows, but ecologists did not know amounts of carbon fixation and respiration in streams due to a lack of long term, multisite syntheses.\n\nOur work addressed this knowledge gap by 1.  Developing computational methods to estimate primary production and respiration from riverine oxygen data collected originally for the purpose of water quality monitoring.   Our new methods enabled us to estimate daily rates of primary production for hundreds of rivers for  up to thousands of days in any one river and we turned this method into software to enable others to do this same work.  2.  Storing and making publicly available these production and respiration estimates.  3.  Collecting new oxygen data in a range of streams, and 4.  Estimating how watershed attributes such as stream flows and land use enable us to predict variation in riverine primary production both through time in one stream and across all streams.  We found that, across 211 rivers across the US, light inputs and flow regimes control variation in primary production.  Higher variability flow lowers rivers primary production and respiration, presumably by exporting algae biomass and organic matter that supports respiration.  We find this pattern when we examined annual time series of production and respiration, floods lowered rates of primary production, but these rates could bounce back quickly following floods.  Models that incorporated population dynamics of photosynthetic algae gave more accurate predictions than models that simply a function of light and stream flow suggest that knowledge of instream biological dynamics are important to understand patterns of overall carbon flow.\n\nThis research will enable better inclusion of the role of streams in rivers in global carbon cycling and will facilitate using estimates of primary production and respiration to assess the health of rivers.\n\nBroader impacts of this work include a web portal (https://data.streampulse.org)  that achieves 2 goals.  1.  Is a site where anyone can upload their oxygen data and use the sites internal software to estimate rates of riverine ecosystem metabolism from their data.  2.  Provide a publicly available clearinghouse for riverine metabolism data. As of the end of this project there are data from 668 sites around the world. \n\nBroader impacts also included the training of scientists.  The University of Montana component of this project trained 3 undergraduate students, and 3 postdoctoral scientists.  In addition the modeling approach developed here is used in undergraduate field classes in stream ecology.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/25/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert O Hall"
