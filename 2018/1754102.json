 "awd_abstract_narration": "How does a plant species persist, grow, and reproduce across a wide range of climates? What is the genetic basis of plant tolerance to climate variation? Addressing these questions is critical for foresters and crop scientists seeking to select appropriate varieties for high yield in different climates and assuring the nation's food supply.  The answers are also important for predicting whether threatened plant populations can persist in the face of environmental change, or whether introduced species will become invasive in their new range.  Understanding mechanisms of adaptation to variable environments is, moreover, a fundamental problem in evolutionary biology.  The genetic model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (common name: thale cress) provides a unique opportunity to address this problem by synthesizing field measurements, genomic data, and geographic information, as outlined in this project. The results will be valuable to a wide range of scientists, from plant developmental biologists and population geneticists to plant ecologists and foresters.  The project will provide novel interdisciplinary research training for a graduate student, and all of the data will be publicly released to provide a community resource for further analysis and synthesis. \r\n\r\nThe research project will leverage data from field experiments with A. thaliana in which hundreds of genotypes originating in diverse climates across the native Eurasian range were grown together in common gardens in six sites across Eurasia and North America, along with known mutants in flowering time pathways.  These unique phenotypic data will be integrated with newly available genomic data to investigate the genetic basis and adaptive evolution of complex life history traits such as flowering and phenotypic plasticity (the range of trait values expressed by the same genotype across different environments). The project will have three objectives: 1) Elucidate the genomic basis of complex life history traits and their plasticity in different natural seasonal environments.  2) Estimate natural selection on life history traits to understand how phenotypic plasticity contributes to plant performance in different climates. 3) Combine quantitative genetic and population genomic data to test for a signature of past adaptive divergence and climate adaptation in plastic life history traits. These synthetic analyses will be published in several interrelated scientific papers.  Resulting insights will be further integrated with results of previous research in two major conceptual review papers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merit:\n\nHow do plant populations adapt to different climates across a species' geographic range? Timing is critical: to persist and thrive, plants must time life cycle events (such as seed germination and reproduction) to coincide with favorable local seasonal conditions.  To this end plants integrate information from several environmental cues, such as day length, soil moisture, winter chilling, and temperature.  The optimal seasonal timing of germination and flowering, and thus the optimal response to seasonal environmental cues, differs across different climates and seasonal environments.  Natural selection may act on both seasonal timing and on responses to environmental cues (plasticity) to create genetic differences among populations across the landscape.  Understanding this process of local adaptation to climate requires 1) measuring natural selection on seasonal timing traits and plasticity in different climates; 2) quantifying genetic differences among populations in these traits and identifying the underlying genes; and 3) testing for a signature of past adaptation to climate by examining gene-environment associations.   \n\nThis project addressed those goals with data from the widespread model annual plant species Arabidopsis thaliana (a close relative of Brassica crops such as mustard, kale, and broccoli). This species spans a wide range of climates across its range- from Mediterranean to subarctic- and natural populations exhibit remarkable variation in seasonal timing of germination and flowering and their response to seasonal environmental cues.  Here the investigators analyzed observations of life cycle traits from previous common garden experiments, in which hundreds of genotypes were replicated into natural seasonal conditions in five field sites spanning the European climate range, as well as multiple controlled growth chamber environments.  These observations were synthesized with recently available genomic sequence data from thousands of genotypes collected across the species range to dissect the genetic basis of life cycle variation and climate adaptation.    \n\nThe field experiments revealed differences in natural selection on flowering across sites and seasons in patterns of selection on flowering time and plasticity. This is one of the first studies of natural selection on flowering time plasticity in natural seasonal environments.  Further, the experiments revealed environment-specific effects of mutations in known flowering time genes on flowering time and fitness, providing new insights into how major functional mutations persist in the wild.  The growth chamber experiments identified a novel dimension of natural variation in seed germination strategies- induction vs release of dormancy by cold- which was correlated with flowering time to create a spectrum of seasonal timing strategies across the species range.

The genetic variants identified with GWAS also were significantly associated with several climatic factors, a signature of past adaptation to climate across the species range.\n\nBroader impacts:\n\nThe results are highly relevant for understanding the potential for natural populations to evolve and persist in the face of rapidly changing climate, and for designing strategies for conservation and assisted migration.  Two Ph.D. students and a postdoctoral researcher directly received research training from this project. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/23/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Johanna M Schmitt"
