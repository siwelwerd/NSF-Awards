 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions Program (HSI Program) aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims. This collaborative project at New Mexico State University, Dona Ana Community College, and California State University, Northridge, will advance the aims of the HSI Program by establishing the NSF National Resource Hub for STEM Education at Hispanic-Serving Institutions.  This HSI Resource Hub will help HSIs develop the strategies and processes to obtain the resources needed to improve the quality and outcomes of undergraduate STEM education.  It will also support efforts to build institutional capacity for advancing the STEM careers of students and faculty at HSIs. The HSI Resource Hub aims to achieve these goals by building a national network of all HSIs; providing training, mentorship, and peer review to improve grant-writing practices; enabling institutions to identify and fill gaps in their capacity to obtain funding, and to develop administrative tools for conducting STEM research; providing training on diversity, equity, and inclusion issues relevant to STEM education; and disseminating resources that support evidence-based, inclusive teaching practices that increase student retention and graduation.  This project has the potential to advance knowledge about how to enhance undergraduate STEM education, how to build research capacity, and how to obtain resources for these efforts, at HSIs and other institutions.\r\n\r\nThe HSI Resource Hub aspires to reach the more than 450 HSIs in the US, with special focus on including those institutions that have received little or no prior NSF support. The project aims to build HSI collaborations that can support existing STEM research, increase STEM research capacity, and encourage implementation of leading-edge pedagogy in STEM education. Regional conferences, workshops, online networking platforms, certifications, and a mini-grant program for junior faculty will support broad participation and enhance professional expertise in writing effective grant proposals.  Gap analysis and collaborations will help HSIs identify and develop the infrastructure needed to manage successful STEM research and education projects.  Evaluation of the HSI Resource Hub will use quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methodologies to provide data that will guide and refine the project throughout the funding period. The HSI Resource Hub activities and outcomes will be disseminated through a dedicated website, conference presentations, workshops, newsletters, publications, and social media. By uniting HSIs across the nation, the HSI Resource Hub is expected to have positive impacts on increasing the degree completion rates of students pursuing STEM degrees, thus enhancing the diversity of the US STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This inaugural Hub was tasked with supporting the grantsmanship needs of HSIs, particularly those with little or no prior NSF funding, by providing professional development and strengthening networks and collaborations among HSIs. Hub goals were accomplished through a partnership between NMSU (main campus; Dona Ana Community College) and California State University, Northridge. The Hub leadership team comprised HSI scientists and engineers with active research programs that engage diverse students as research mentees, who have experience leading undergraduate STEM training programs, offer undergraduate courses in their discipline for STEM majors and non-majors, and have a track record of successful grantsmanship. Key personnel included faculty with expertise in communications, languages, STEM education, and media production whose perspectives enriched Hub offerings and supported culturally responsive content. Activities were evaluated annually by the UC Denver Evaluation Center; evaluation was essential for identifying improvement areas and programmatic strengths for successive year planning.&nbsp; Initial plans for in-person community networking and training were disrupted during the COVID pandemic that emerged during the second project year. The Hub adapted plans and transitioned to virtual spaces and online collaborations to provide community support for HSI faculty and staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Project goals were achieved through activities that targeted elements essential for successful STEM education and research grants: institutional capacity, grantsmanship, networking, STEM disciplinary knowledge, awareness of students' cultures and backgrounds, and STEM pedagogy.&nbsp; The Hub created multi-level entry to grantsmanship training through virtual workshops focused on pre- and post-award grantsmanship. A mentored program for faculty new to grantsmanship (<em>Semillas</em>) provided a 6-month intensive training experience. Monthly webinars featured the expertise of HSI STEM faculty, national leaders, and NSF program officers. Half-day STEM disciplinary workshops (<em>Sembrador</em>) expanded faculty expertise in areas such as data science, genetics, computation, generative AI, and research ethics.&nbsp; The Hub's website provided access to webinars and workshops, showcased HSI Program awards, and provided resources for STEM student engagement, program evaluation, and STEM pedagogy. Hub leaders hosted virtual networking events with NSF HSI Program awardees (<em>Cafecitos</em>).&nbsp; Leadership also developed and published an assessment tool for HSIs to identify grantsmanship resources and gaps within their institutions. A culminating 2024 conference,&nbsp; \"<em>Adelante! Charting the Path Forward for STEM Faculty and Students at HSIs\"</em>,&nbsp; served as a platform for recognizing the achievements of HSIs and HSI STEM educators nationwide, fostering collaborations, and envisioning the future of the HSI community. A media production team prepared videos of attendee interviews that describe professional journeys and share experiences promoting student success.&nbsp; A final evaluation survey administered to ~1500 Hub participants showed that ~41% of Hub users who submitted proposals secured awards, and that success rates for community college submissions were similar to those from research-intensive institutions; 42% of respondents reported their institution increased grant capacity since they joined the Hub.&nbsp; &nbsp;Respondents noted outcomes related to networking and collaboration, grant writing and funding opportunities, and expanding their careers as the significant impacts of Hub participation. Taken together, findings indicate the Hub fulfilled program expectations and highlight the need to use a variety of interventions to foster the professional development of HSI faculty and staff. Results are focused on HSIs but will have relevance for all higher education.</p>\r\n<p>The multiple Hub offerings enabled participation by faculty and staff from HSIs and other institutions nationwide. Between 6000-8000 users accessed the web page yearly; ~ 1000 individuals followed the Hub on LinkedIn; 300-600 participants attended Hub workshops and webinars yearly; a curated email list disseminated information about NSF opportunities and Hub offerings to over 2000 university administrators and Hub members. The Hub's YouTube channel and Spotify podcasts disseminated knowledge about grantsmanship, institutional capacity, and promoting HSI student success that will persist long-term.&nbsp; Hub training and dissemination incorporated and elevated the voices and expertise of HSI faculty and staff across the entire higher education landscape, from community college to research-intensive. The Hub broadened programmatic impact through partnerships with national initiatives (Texas HSI Consortium;West Big Data Innovation Hub;Neuroscience Gateway) and conference dissemination (SACNAS;HACU;SFN).&nbsp; An estimated 30-40% of NSF HSI Program awardees participated yearly in Hub activities, primarily from HSIs in California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Illinois, New York, and Puerto Rico.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;After award completion the leadership team will continue efforts to migrate training materials to archival open access repositories that assign DOIs to content. Manuscripts under development will disseminate tools and approaches for designing STEM-focused professional development that enhances grantsmanship and student success. This work includes strategies that engage diverse HSI constituencies with multifaceted programming, foster productive collaborative networks, and produce dynamic conference frameworks. Manuscripts aim to build institutional capacity, offering tactics for creating transformative centralized Hubs that support national initiatives. While devised for HSIs, outcomes will benefit other institutions, especially those that serve heterogenous student populations and first-generation college students.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/30/2024<br>\nModified by: Elba&nbsp;E&nbsp;Serrano</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1832338/1832338_10566823_1735599126797_HubParticipantsMap--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1832338/1832338_10566823_1735599126797_HubParticipantsMap--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"HSI STEM Hub Participant Map\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1832338/1832338_10566823_1735599126797_HubParticipantsMap--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"HSI STEM Hub Participant Map\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Bubble representation map showing national distribution of Hub participants.
