 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Texas Austin (UT Austin) proposes a research-practitioner partnership (RPP) between and across six New York City public school districts to examine the degree to which co-design of curriculum, instructional practices, and teacher supports can build organizational capacity to support equitable computer science (CS) teaching and learning as called for by the CSforAll national movement. The project builds on the prior work of the UTeach Computer Science Program) which included creation of the UTeach CS Principle course and associated teacher professional development (PD). This work focuses on remaining questions about the organizational conditions and instructional practices that encourage broad student participation in CS, looking at underrepresented urban youth in particular.\r\n\r\nThe project team of New York City public school administrators and classroom teachers will collaborate with researchers, curriculum developers, and professional learning and support specialists with the goal of improving Black and Latino/a student participation, learning, and engagement in CS. Methodologically, a Design-Based Implementation Research (DBIR) approach will be employed to address three overarching research questions:\r\n \r\n1. What organizational conditions, processes, and supports are associated with improved participation by Black and Latino/a students in CS, as measured by the diversity of students enrolling in CS courses? \r\n\r\n2. What kinds of project-based instructional strategies, materials, and interventions are associated with improved student learning in UTeach CS Principles among Black and Latino/a students, as measured by student scores on projects according to standard project rubrics and unit and Advanced Placement (AP) exam scores?\r\n\r\n3. What kinds of non-cognitive approaches (e.g., teacher messaging, classroom routines, recruitment strategies, etc.) are associated with improved engagement and motivation by Black and Latino/a students in UTeach CS Principles and retention in CS based on enrollment in following CS courses?\r\n \r\nThis project will advance will contribute to knowledge about  effective organizational conditions, as well as instructional interventions to promote participation, engagement, and learning across diverse groups of students in AP CS Principles, the professional learning and support necessary to prepare teachers with diverse content backgrounds to teach CS, and the strategies employed to address problems of practice through collaborative, iterative design.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

For three years, our RPP team of New York City DOE CSforAll staff and classroom teachers collaborated with UTeach CS researchers, curriculum developers, and professional learning and support specialists located at The University of Texas at Austin. Together, we worked to identify (1) effective organizational conditions and supports, as well as (2) project-based instructional and (3) non-cognitive approaches, and accompanying teacher supports and student and teacher materials that improve student participation, learning, and engagement in computer science. In the final two years of the project, we expanded teacher participation nationwide.</p>\n<p><strong>Outcomes</strong></p>\n<p><strong>High Quality Teacher Professional Development.</strong> Over the course of this project, a total of 175 teachers working at 164 schools in 30 states received intensive teacher professional development and support to implement the UTeach CS Principles curriculum. A significant number of teachers trained had no CS background or teacher experience. We successfully prepared these teachers to engage more students in CS. Teachers were overwhelmingly satisfied with the development and support they received.</p>\n<p>An external evaluation found that most teachers implemented the UTeach curriculum or incorporated the materials into their lesson plans as designed. Teachers predominately praised the curriculum and noted that continuity with teacher PD supported their own understanding of the curriculum, as well as their ability to support students&rsquo; CS understanding and interest. The one-on-one support provided by the PD facilitator staff was also highlighted. They commented on the &ldquo;open-door&rdquo; communication with the facilitator, the sense of community among teacher partners, and feeling supported and empowered. Teachers also noted the curriculum engaged students and allowed them to be creative and have fun while learning new concepts.</p>\n<p><strong>Uniquely Project-Based, Equity-Centered Curriculum and Instructional Support.</strong> We worked intensively with a core group of 44 NYC public school teachers over a multiyear period to provide feedback on the efficacy of project-based and equity-centered curricular elements to engage students and support their learning. This work was carried out during a particularly challenging period that included the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath. Despite the challenges faced by participating educators and their students, this work resulted in significant improvements to the UTeach CS Principles curriculum and teacher and student support materials. Curriculum improvements included strengthening formative assessments; adding options for teachers to create additional custom Scratch, Python, and Java coding assignments for students; improved accessibility of course content for students with disabilities and for ELL students; and strengthening teacher development support around culturally responsive instructional strategies to engage all learners.</p>\n<p>What teachers have to say about the UTeach CS Principles curriculum:</p>\n<p><em>The teacher materials are great!
