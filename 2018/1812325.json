 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory in Switzerland is being upgraded to increase the number of beam collisions by a factor of ten beyond the LHC's design value. The increased radiation will damage many of the existing detectors, so new detectors have to be designed and built.  This award supports the development of different prototype designs and, after extensive testing, the best design will become the common design for both the ATLAS and CMS experiments.  The ATLAS and CMS experiments are the two largest experiments currently mounted at the LHC.  The prototypes will be tested at the Soreq Nuclear Research Center in Israel and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois.  The project has a robust plan in place to engage undergraduate students from a diverse community to participate in the development of these new detectors.  The technology developed in the proposed activities may have applications in other areas of science such as radiation oncology and space science.\r\n\r\nTo take full advantage of the LHC, with its unique access to high energy photons caused by the electromagnetic fields of the passing hadrons, and unprecedented access to low-x partons probed by these photons, the experiments need Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDCs).  The ZDCs are destined to be used at the LHC during the high luminosity era which starts after the next Long Shutdown. Luminosities will exceed 7x10^34 /cm^2/sec in the high luminosity era and so the ZDCs must be extraordinarily radiation hard.  ZDCs are needed to identify the reaction plane orientation in a heavy ion collision and are an essential detector for measuring ultra-peripheral collisions in heavy ion and p-p collisions.   The photon-photon and photon-nucleus interactions allow observations of extremely rare processes, such as light-by-light scattering, which are potentially sensitive to new unobserved physics processes and provide a clean penetrating probe of the nucleus.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The QGP is hot quark matter in which nuclear matter, for example, protons and neutrons, melt down to their quark constitutents. QGP was present in the first few micro seconds of the early universe and exists today at the core of high mass neutron stars. Exploring the Physics of the QGP is an important corner stone to understanding nuclear forces in nature. Pb+Pb collisions are measured with the ATLAS, CMS and ALICE detectors at the LHC. The QGP forms in the overlap region of the colliding Pb-nuclei, it rapidly expands, cools down and creates thousands of elementary particles including pions, protons, electrons and many other exotic particles. The detectors measure particle trajectories, momenta and energies and can determine particle identies. From this information the properties of the QGP can be constrained.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As input for these measurements it is important to determine the collision geometry of the colliding system of Pb-ions. Events in which the colliding Pb-ions overlap fully are referred to as central events. Events with partial overlap are designated as peripheral events. The ATLAS experiemnt uses for this purpose a so-called Zero Degree Calorimeter, ZDC. It detects neutrons from the surviving nuclear fragments that do not particpate in the overlap region of the Pb+Pb collision. These neutrons continue travelling straight and 140 meters from the collision point are stopped in the ZDC. The ZDC is a sandwich of alternating tungsten plates and layers of fused quartz rods. The neutrons undergo nuclear reactions with the tungsten nuclei, creating showers of charged particles. These traverse the fused quarts rods and, in these, create so-called Cherenkov light (similar to the blue light emitted from the core of light water nuclear reactors). The Cherenkov light is measured with photo-sensitive detectors. Measuring the amount of Cherenkov light produced makes it possible to determine the energy of the neutrons and to count the number of neutrons. This in turn is related to the overlap between the colliding lead nuclei.</p>\n<p>The radiation levels at the location of the ZDC are very high. The image \"GE124 fused quartz irradiated vs new\" shows the impact of a dose rate of 10 MGy, the fused quartz looses its ability to transmit light and turns opaque. 10 MGy is a dose about 2 million times larger than the dose leathal to humans. Even smaller doses lead to significant loss in light transmittance. The figure \"Transmission in GE124 after irradiation in the ATLAS ZDC\" show the transmission as function of the wavelength of the transmitted light after the exposure to 10 MGy (Rod 1) and after 0.3 Gy (Rod 2). Rod 1 was irradiated in run-1 of the LHC with Pb-Pb and p+p collisions. Rod 2 was irradiated with Pb-Pb collisions only during run 2. The degradation of the fused quartz rods is highly damaging to the operations of the ZDC. It was necessary to open the ATLAS ZDC between runs 1 and 2 and to replace the fused quartz at significant expense in material and labor.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>LHC has been undergoing upgrades of intensity and energy, leading to even higher radiation environments in run-3, starting in 2022, and run-4, starting in 2029. We have studied different technologies to design a more radiation tolerant ZDC. After initial attempts with liquid radiators we finally identified highly pure (no contamination with elements like aluminum) fused silica doped with hydrogen and OH as the correct choice of materials for the ATLAS ZDC in run 3. We irradiated fused silica materials with different levels of OH and hydrogen doping and measured the resulting optical transmission. The group of most radiation resistant materials all have high OH content. The figure \"Transmission of Cherenkov Radiators\" shows a comparison of the optical transmission vs radiation does for three differnt fused silica materials: Suprasil 2000 with high OH but different levels of hydrogen doping. The materials with the highes OH and hydrogen levels allows the use of the fused silica to radiation doses of 2 MGy without loss of optical transmission. This compares to an expected radiation does of 1.3 MGy during the LHC run-3 running of Pb+Pb (2022-2025) for the ATLAS ZDC.&nbsp; Irradiation studies were carried out at the LHC and at Soreq in Israel. Material studies have been carried out at the Frederick Seitz Material Research Laboratory at UIUC and at Ben Gurion University. The groups at Ben Gurion and UIUC have upgraded the ATLAS ZDC with Suprasil 2000 fused silica rods for LHC run-3. Radiation resistant materials find applications outside nuclear and particle physics in the nuclear power industry, medical and industrial imaging, radiation oncology, and UV laser cutting and welding.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/06/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Matthias&nbsp;Perdekamp</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1812325/1812325_10575857_1654514149229_transmission-3a--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1812325/1812325_10575857_1654514149229_transmission-3a--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Transmission of Cherenkov Radiators\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1812325/1812325_10575857_1654514149229_transmission-3a--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Transmission of Cherenkov Radiators\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The optical transmission in fused silica materials with different levels of OH and Hydrogen doping.
