 "awd_abstract_narration": "Efficient Parallel Testing and Tuning of Beamforming MIMO Wireless Systems\r\n\r\nThere has been a revolution in the use of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems over the last decade. It is expected that mobile data traffic will increase by up to 1000X by 2020 as compared to 2010. Future 5G wireless systems (communication data rates > 50Gbps) will deploy massive MIMO systems with large numbers of transmit and receive antennas and novel RF transceiver architectures that admit RF beamforming. Research on 5G massive MIMO systems is moving forward at an electrifying pace. It will be possible to point electromagnetic beams towards moving targets while simultaneously communicating at extremely high speeds and minimizing interference with other users. Downloading a high definition film will be possible in less than a second. However, with the dramatically increasing levels of circuit complexity and higher operating speeds, the underlying electronics will be highly susceptible to manufacturing process variations, electrical degradation and defects. At high data rates of communication, the effects of device non-idealities on RF system performance can be dramatic. Power consumption will be a major issue since a large number of transmitter and receiver chains will be involved. Such massive MIMO systems will need to be tested extensively and tuned for quality prior to sale.  In the extreme, such systems will need to possess built-in self-testing and self-tuning capability to automatically compensate for field wear and tear due to electrical, thermal and mechanical stress.\r\n\r\nThe first problem to solve is efficient low-cost manufacturing production test of a range of MIMO systems with the capacity to handle 5G systems with 10-100 RF chains. State of the art test methods require that test signals to individual RF chains have frequency separation for the individual RF chain non-linearities to be assessed independent of nonlinearities in other chains. Conversely, given a set of frequencies that can be generated, only a certain maximum number of RF chains can be tested in parallel. A key goal is to design \"frequency-efficient\" tests and back-end response analysis algorithms that do not require such frequency separation allowing large numbers of RF chains to be tested in parallel.  A second key goal is parallel gain and phase tuning of as many RF chains as possible using intelligent testing and response-analysis algorithms. One way to speed up the tuning procedure is to use the parallel testing procedure described above, to perform parallel tuning of the MIMO system well. Such parallel tuning can be supported by machine learning algorithms that predict the best tuning knob configurations for each chain based on specific time and frequency domain response features extracted from parallel testing techniques. To enable testing and tuning, high-speed signals need to be captured and analyzed for signal fidelity. To this end, the use of proposed incoherent undersampling for acquisition of test response signals provides a significant avenue for reducing testing costs by significantly simplifying the hardware required for high-speed device testing and characterization. Overall, the use of the proposed techniques will allow massive MIMO systems to be tested and tuned, post-manufacture and in the field, without the need for complex test instrumentation in 10s of ms test time, significantly reducing test cost while increasing product yield and field reliability.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The underlying communications systems operate at high frequencies (up to 75 GHz) and are vulnerable to manufacturing process variations. Such variations can affect their ability to communicate with other systems such as between vehicles on the road in V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) communication. Hence, testing such systems after manufacturing and prior to deployment to qualify them for field reliability is very important for applications in which such communication capability is paramount. Further, after deployment, the communication systems may be designed with the capability to self-test and self-tune. This allows them to adjust their electronic subsystems to maintain low power consumption while compensating for field electrical degradation due to wear and tear and thermal degradation. One final aspect is that of designing systems that adapt to their operating environment for low power consumption. This automatically reduces heat dissipation and implicitly improves system reliability. The key out comes of this project were in three domains: parallel testing and tuning of MIMO systems,&nbsp; environment-adaptive MIMO transceiver circuitry and environment-adaptive antenna-array systems.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Testing and tuning of MIMO antenna arrays on a per-transceiver (connected to each antenna) basis is expensive and can be expedited through the use of parallel testing and tuning techniques that stimulate the entire phase array transceiver and antenna array system concurrently. State of the art parallel testing techniques require frequency separation between the tones applied to individual RF chains because of RF signal combining before down-conversion in analog beamforming MIMO systems. Test schemes that allow some frequency overlap are limited to testing only third order distortion. To address these issues, a fast parallel testing and tuning procedure for RF MIMO arrays which employs phased array RF chains for wireless communications with beamforming capabilities was developed. Frequency-efficient and parallel test methods for gain, phase and upto 5th order nonlinearity of RF chains were developed in this research. To speed up testing and tuning costs, an implicit reward metric was used for tuning that is easy to evaluate in relation to prior techniques allowing a 4X4 receiver array to be tested in 0.2sec - 2sec depending on whether tuning information from neighboring die is used or not. The method does not require explicit tests and thereby avoids tester costs while reducing test time.</p>\n<p>With regard to environment-adaptive MIMO transceiver circuitry, A reinforcement learning based approach was developed to introduce adaptability into beamforming RF MIMO arrays which employ antenna arrays for wireless communication. The system is optimized in terms of its performance and power consumption by varying the biases of circuits involved, word size and the transmission coding parameters while considering the manufacturing process variations of devices involved. The algorithm can run on a baseband processor without disturbing the actual operation of the system. Power comnsumption can be reduced from 90mW to 65mW (about 30%) using on-line learning across all beam-steering angles. Alternatively, throughput per Watt can be modulated from 3.7Mbps/Watt to 2Mbps/Watt&nbsp; across diverse channel conditions representing throughput improvements of 1.6X over static worst-case channel based system designs.</p>\n<p>With regard to environment-adaptive antenna-array systems, a quadratic cost minimization problem is formulated that maximizes the transmitted power from the antenna array towards the vehicle with which communication is to be established while minimizing the power of side lobes to minimize interference with the communication systems of other vehicles. We assume that a multiplexing architecture exists on baseband processing side that enables switching and processing of data streams across different radio frequency (RF) chains (each connected to an antenna element) and that the locations of other vehicle are tracked by an onboard sensor based tracking system. Instead of solving for the optimal antenna array assignment for different vehicle environments in dynamically changing traffic environments we were able to bootstrap the solver from prior solutions to similar vehicular traffic environments using transfer learning.&nbsp; This is solved by data (vehicular traffic environment) clustering and mapping the current vehicular environment to a cluster using a similarity measure. The solution corresponding to the cluster mediod is then used to bootstrap the quadratic solver achieving significant speedups in solution time. The proposed approach shows the feasibility of extending to any number of vehicles and any antenna array size. It is seen that the method offers upto 32X savings in power consumption over prior techniques that use fixed-size sub-arrays of antennas for communication with a fixed number (4) of vehicles on the road. An 8 by 8 antenna array was used for this study. The fixed size communication system used four&nbsp; 4 by 4 antenna subarrays to communicate with 4 vehicles.<br /><br /><br /></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/01/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Abhijit&nbsp;Chatterjee</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1815653/1815653_10571543_1682957505052_PP6--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1815653/1815653_10571543_1682957505052_PP6--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"V2V Communication Results\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1815653/1815653_10571543_1682957505052_PP6--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"V2V Communication Results\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The reinforcement learning is seen to maximimize lobes towards communicating vehicles while minimizing interference with other vehicles.
