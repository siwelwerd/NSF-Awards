 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).\r\n\r\nSocial scientists who study the aftermath of civil war have found that \"post-war\" does not necessarily mean \"post-conflict.\" While official reconciliation processes move forward, conflict may be pursued covertly as former adversaries jockey for position in post-war landscapes. The research supported by this award asks if this phenomenon is inevitable: is the persistence of antagonism an example of path dependency? Path dependency is the theory that the past lays down institutional, technological, and cognitive structures and patterns that act as constraints on future behaviors. But questions remain about how this happens, how  these constrained behaviors emerge, the feedback mechanisms that reinforce them, and the degree to which they can be interrupted and redirected. Post-conflict societies provide a unique opportunity to address these questions because efforts at social change, resistance to these efforts, and outcomes can be tracked in the micro-processes of daily life. Findings from this research will be important for theorists studying barriers to policy implementation and for policy makers who want their policies to succeed.\r\n \r\nThe research will be conducted by legal anthropologist, Dr. Robert Hayden (University of Pittsburgh). The researcher has identified post-conflict Bosnia-Herzegovina as an appropriate site to conduct the research.  After the civil war (1992-1995), the territory was divided constitutionally into regions, in each of which one of the three competing ethno-religious communities is dominant demographically although multiple communities are present. The basic science research question is whether there is evidence of path dependence in newly emerging intergroup relationships. The researcher will collect data on claims of heritage rights and the recreation of destroyed landscapes to test the hypothesis that reconstruction and replacement have been strategic rather than neutral and that they reinforce pre-war relationships rather than creating new ones. The researcher and his team will collect data on site destruction and rebuilding; quantitative measures of site importance and dominance, including centrality and size; and community interactions. They will employ a mixed-methods approach including archival research, analysis of official records, stakeholder interviews, and geo-spatial mappings. The primary focus will be historically antagonistic communities but the sample also will include a neutral control group. The research will support international research collaborations and opportunities for students. The results of the research will enrich social science theory of constraints on behavioral modifications in post-conflict contexts, and will serve interests of national security through better understanding of conflict persistence in multi-ethnic societies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nCOMPETITION IN A POST-CONFLICT LANDSCAPE: \r\n\n\nBOSNIA & HERZEGOVINA\r\n\n\nPremise and predictions: \"Post-war\" does not necessarily mean \"post-conflict,\" since former adversaries may jockey for advantage in rebuilding post-war social =and physical landscapes. This project focussed on the (re)building of cultural heritage that had been destroyed in the 1992-95 war, as demonstrating one ethno-religious community's control over localities after the armed conflict. Rather than presume that the goal was to restore that which had been destroyed, this project utilized concepts developed in earlier NSF-funded research (# 0719677) on \"antagonistic tolerance,\" the competitive sharing of religious sites and wider spaces between ethno-religious communities. We predicted that much post-war (re)building would be strategic, primarily driven by efforts of Bosniaks (Muslims), Croats (Roman Catholics) and Serbs (Orthodox Christians) to demonstrate their dominance in settlements and wider spaces by (re)building, or building anew, centrally located sacral structures and memorials more prominent (e.g. higher and /or larger) than those of the other communities.\r\n\n\nResearch team: Multidisciplinary: cultural anthropology, geography, history, religious studies. International: USA, Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia; multi-ethnic: American, Bosniak, Croat, Serb.\r\n\n\nMethods: (Fig 1). 2018-24 fieldwork throughout all regions of Bosnia & Herzegovina, more than 10,000 miles by road, comparable to non-intrusive survey research in archaeology. We surveyed religious sites, documenting locations of buildings, cemeteries and other relevant features. The Antagonistic Tolerance project had identified two primary indicators of dominance where different religioscapes interface: centrality in a settlement (at varying scales); and perceptibility: features that heighten the visibility of a site (e.g. height, color, sheer massive size) or audibility (bells, call to prayer). Religioscapes and the physical attributes of structures were evaluated as well as their spatial relationships to each other.\r\n\n\nFindings: Bosnia-Herzegovina is almost totally divided into ethno-national territories, on varying scales. In any locality, dominance of a national community is generally indicated by sacral structures and by the central memorial to the soldiers killed in the 1992-95 war:\r\n\n\nEthno-religious territorialization: (Figs 2, 3). Almost all municipalities have large majorities of one community, and minorities within municipalities are often clustered into smaller settlements.\r\n\n\nWar memorials as key indicators of local dominance: (Fig 4). The central memorial to those killed in the 1992-95 war is the most critical indicator of which community is dominant in any location. Such monuments are linked to only one of the ethno-religious communities of BiH. Monuments to killed soldiers of the Army of Bosnia & Herzegovina use references to the Koran and frequently refer to them as \"martyrs of Islam.\"  Monuments of the Croatian Defense Council refer to \"defenders\" of the Croat Homeland, with Roman Catholic imagery. Monuments of the Bosnian Serb Army memorialize \"fighters\" for the Serb Fatherland, with imagery of Orthodox Christianity.\r\n\n\nStrategic (Re)building Sacral Structures: (Fig 5) As predicted, post war construction of mosques and churches was strategic. Not all destroyed in the 1992-95 war were reconstructed, while some that had been destroyed earlier in the 20th century were rebuilt, and some large sacral structures were raised in places where there had not been such buildings. Also as predicted, the newly (re)built structures followed the principles of centrality and perceptibility described above.\r\n\n\nSeparated communities linked by practical infrastructures: (Fig. 6) we analyze these separated communities as \"land archipelagoes,\" linked by practical infrastructures that faciltiate trade and travel, shared highway network, electric grid, separate erthnic cell phone companies in single grid.\r\n\n\nConceptual/ Theoretical advances:\r\n\n\nViscous identities: Models of \"fluid\" identities are insufficient, since the distinctions between the communities are recognizeably robust over at least 150 years. We analyze them as viscous, not simply fluid.\r\n\n\nCultural sedimentations and erosions: Changing configurations of communities in locations are reflected in changes in built environments through time; there is no single heritage horizon.\r\n\n\nIntellectual merit: Concepts developed in this project can explain changing elations between ethno-religious communities in parts of Asia and Africa as well as Europe. Thus useful in anthropology, geography, history and sociology, and policy studies.\r\n\n\nWider impact: Our findings are relevant for foreign policy and security assessments of ethno-religious violence and post-conflict developments.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/21/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RobertMHayden\n"
