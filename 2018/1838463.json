 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical description: This project aims to create ultra-thin materials for producing quantum bits - qubits - the basic building blocks for quantum computers. The materials of interest are truly two-dimensional in that they are only a single atom thick and are made from oxidized transition metals. These materials are of significant interest for qubits since they are expected to absorb light and store that energy for long periods of time, where each quantum of absorbed light functions as a single qubit. This project involves a close collaboration between experimenters who fabricate and characterize materials and theorists who design and model them. The project evaluates whether ultra-thin TMOs satisfy all the key scientific and technological properties needed for realizing high fidelity qubits.  The project also provides significant educational and training impact. Two graduate students are expertly trained in the requisite science and methodology, working in a collaborative environment that brings together theory and experiment.  In addition, two summer undergraduate students are mentored each year as part of collaborative research teams working on the key scientific questions.  \r\n\r\nTechnical description: The proposed activities for this project involve collaboration between theory and experiment to design and study a new class of two-dimensional transition metal oxides (2DTMOs) that can host strongly bound excitons for use as quantum information platforms. First principles theory screens multiple 2DTMOs for their energetic stability, structure, and electronic and optical properties by using many-body Green's function methods.  The most promising candidate materials are then grown using molecular beam epitaxy and their structure and optical properties characterized using synchrotron and photoluminescence methods.  While the growth of 2DTMOs is challenging, they have advantages over other 2D materials such as graphene or transition metal dichalcogenides in that 2DTMOs have widely tunable chemistries, can be produced in a scalable manner, and are generally environmentally stable in typical operating and device processing environments that expose the 2D materials to oxygen and water. The broader impacts of this project are: (i) two graduate students are being trained to become experts in materials physics for quantum information, (ii) two undergraduate summer students participate in the work as part of collaborative research teams, and (iii) the successful design of 2DTMOs that host long-lived qubits mark a milestone in materials design for quantum computation and are of significant interest to materials physicists and quantum device researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nThe prospect of being able to use quantum phenomena for information processing, computation, and highly-sensitive sensing has galvanized a great deal of research and technological efforts.  Research in quantum computation aims to design and use devices that harness the unusual and unique effects of quantum mechanics to process information in a manner far more efficient than current computational paradigms permit.  The range of problems includes cryptography, molecular design, and optimization of complex systems.  The basic building block of any quantum computer is a quantum bit (qubit) where the bit can be in a quantum superposition of two different states at once, as opposed to being in one state or the other (the standard behavior of digital bits in modern electronics).  Qubits can be realized in many different physical forms: three popular present day examples are isolated atoms or ions suspended in a vacuum chamber, electrical circuits made from superconductors, or small assemblies of semiconductors called quantum dots.  \n\n \nThis exploratory research project aimed to investigate the possibility of engineering ultra-thin (two dimensional) materials to create a novel platform for realizing qubits.  In this type of material, the qubits are realized by exciting electrons using light.  For these optical quantum bits, each quantum of absorbed light can act as a quantum bit.  The work in this project had experimenters and theorists collaborate closely to see if very thin layers of metal oxide materials could serve as an appropriate materials systems for realizing such optical qubits.  The collaborative work discovered that an extremely thin layer, on the order of 1 nm thick, of the metal oxide Mg2TiO4 grown on the insulator MgO can serve well for these purposes.  The structure of this overlayer was carefully characterized, using advanced x-ray techniques, down to the individual atomic layers comprising the material, and the effect of the interface between the two materials on the atomic bonds of the metal oxide was measured and quantified.  The theoretical work found that these bond distortions are both a signature of the interface formation as well as important for ensuring that the electronic states of the overlayer have the necessary spatial distributions for optical qubit applications.  The theory work then further described these electronic states and found that upon light absorption, the electronic excitation should be quite long-lived and thus can form a stable quantum bit.  Future work can build on this project to perform detailed optical measurements of these or similar thin overlayers and measure directly the electronic excited states. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/07/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sohrab Ismail-Beigi"
