 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve the literacy of blind people by enabling improved access to digital content. Currently blind people rely heavily on text-to-speech software and audiobooks to digest digital context. However, listening does not delivery the same sense of immediacy and literacy as reading braille. Also, audio technology and single line displays cannot deliver spatial information, e.g. mathematical equations, diagrams, and graphs, which are critical to literacy in science, technology, and math-related subjects.  Commercial electronic tactile displays exist, but due to the complexity and cost of the underlying technology, the devices are prohibitively expensive and are limited to a single line of braille. An affordable full-page tactile display delivering multiple lines of braille and tactile graphics would significantly improve blind people's access to digital technology. New technology can improve literacy rates, education outcomes and overall lifestyle of blind people. \r\n\r\nThe I-Corps project will assess the commercial viability of using a patented microfluidic technology for developing a full-page tactile display. Based on the technology, a microfluidic chip can reduce the complexity and cost of controlling a large number of densely-packed pneumatic actuators. A large array of thousands of individually controllable features is possible. The pneumatic actuators are integrated directly into the microfluidic chip using large-scale integration, making the device low-cost and highly scalable. Pressure-based actuation ensures that even tightly placed features will maintain relatively high force outputs. These are all essential features for building dense-array tactile displays, particularly ones that are low-cost and suitable for rendering braille and tactile graphics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nIntellectual Merit\nInformation literacy is a key skill in today\u2019s digital environment.\nHowever, for blind computer users, lack of access to a refreshable\ndisplay that can deliver on-demand content of a spatial nature such as\ngraphs and charts has meant that they cannot participate fully in the\ndata revolution.  The merit of this project lies in the fact that,\nthrough over 150 interviews with teachers of the visually impaired, and\nwith suppliers of products and services, we have begun to quantify the\nsize of the gap blind students face in entering STEM careers in part\nbecause of lack of appropriate access to scientific material.  We have\nalso identified strategic partners who can help us bring a product to\nmarket that meets the needs of these students at every level from our\nmanufacturing pipeline, to technology partners who might integrate our\nproduct to producers of content for text books and testing, to the\nteachers and students who anxiously await the outcome of our work.\n\n\nBroader Impact\nResults from this project have the potential to facilitate a\ntechnological revolution for blind individuals, one that will, quite\nliterally, place the information age at their fingertips. Access to an\ninteractive tactile surface will make it possible for BVI individuals to\ngain meaningful employment in fields that require a level of literacy in\nmanipulating non-textual data, thereby opening up new educational and\nemployment opportunities in fields such as STEM, finance and data\nmanagement.  Being able to access a much broader range of employment\nopportunities will ultimately contribute to the greater independence and\nwell-being of people who are blind and visually impaired.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/16/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sile O'modhrain"
