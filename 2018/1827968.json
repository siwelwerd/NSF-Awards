 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Professor Todd Harrop from University of Georgia and colleague Michael Johnson are acquiring a continuous-wave electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer. This instrument allows research in a variety of fields such as those that provide insight on how biologically relevant species with unpaired electrons behave. In general, an EPR spectrometer yields detailed information on the geometric and electronic structure of molecular and solid-state materials. It is also used to obtain information about the lifetimes of free radicals, short-lived, highly reactive species involved in valuable chemical transformations as well as the initiation of possible pathological growth. These studies impact many areas, from the synthesis of inorganic and organic molecules to the development of new solid-state materials to compounds of magnetic and biological interest. Employing examples inspired from ongoing research, this instrument is an integral part of research and teaching at the undergraduate and graduate levels at the University of Georgia. Additionally, the investigators are sharing the spectrometer with a significant number of interested users from the area outside of this institution. The spectrometer is utilized by students from primarily undergraduate institutions in the North Georgia area (University of North Georgia, Dahlonega exemplifies one example of regional impact) free of charge with online access to the spectrometer and its programs to extend the research experience beyond campus.\r\n\r\nThe award of the EPR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts studies characterizing important metal-containing biomolecules such as those having Fe-S clusters, cobalamin, heme. The instrumentation is also used for investigating and developing metal-based catalytic systems such as nitrite reduction and cycloadditions. In addition, it benefits environmental studies of speciation of metal complexes (iron-natural organic matter in soils and sediments). The spectrometer benefits characterization of nanomaterials during the study of charge-transfer in organic semiconductors, organic spin valves, and spin-labeling in nanostructured soft materials. Finally, the spectrometer aids in understanding the electronic characteristics of inorganic compounds while studying metal-NO bond activation, dithiolene radicals and metal-metal bonds.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
