 "awd_abstract_narration": "In January 2014, Georgia's governor announced the High Demand Career Initiative, which convened discussions between the private sector, Georgia's postsecondary stakeholders, and Georgia's Department of Economic Development to explore Georgia's future job needs.  From these discussions across the state, a renewed appreciation emerged of the critical need for a well-trained and educated workforce for industry growth and expansion. Because Albany Technical College (ATC) is one of the institutions responsible for educating Georgia's workforce, it is obligated to help plan and deliver educational programs that meet industry needs. This project will support changes to increase the effectiveness of the ATC Civil, Electrical and Computer, and Electromechanical Engineering Technology programs in educating highly skilled technical workers for industry.\r\n\r\nThis project will address the growing demand for skilled technicians and a diversified labor force. As a Predominately Black Institution, ATC has the potential to increase the participation of individuals from a group that has been underrepresented in many technical workforce areas.  Working with industry partners, ATC aims to educate students who can meet the demands of these partners for highly skilled employees.  Industry will assist faculty in placing students in internships and in evaluating student projects. Project-Based Learning and paid internships will be integrated into three engineering technology programs: 1) Civil Engineering Technology; 2) Electrical and Computer Technology (Telecommunications); and 3) Electromechanical Engineering Technology. The internships will enable students to apply classroom knowledge to the hands-on experiences.  In addition, students will work on real-world projects early in their program of study.  This strategy is expected to foster a climate in which they can see and achieve the \"end goal.\" The project will address the following goals: (1) Increase enrollment, retention, and placement rates for Civil, Telecommunications, and Electromechanical Engineering Technology programs and (2) Strengthen existing partnerships with local employers. The project will also be disseminated to the secondary school program, \"Move On When Ready,\" and the ATC Engineering Prep Academy. Students in these programs will be supported to complete high school, continue their post-secondary education, and interact with local employers who will be looking to fill high demand technician positions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Achieving this through incorporating Project-Based Learning (PBL) into the curriculum and paid internships with local employers. The real-world scenarios and hands-on learning opportunities build students' confidence and give them practical experience in solving technical problems. The project aims to develop standards for implementing PBL. The end goal was to prepare students for successful careers in the workforce. The project aimed to increase the representation of African American students in these programs.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Through the PBL approach, students demonstrated an understanding of fundamental engineering concepts and principles and an ability to use engineering graphics software to create technical drawings and designs. These skills, along with their ability to work effectively in teams and communicate technical information clearly, are essential for success in the field of engineering. Furthermore, the project-based learning activities provided students real-world experience and increased their engagement in engineering concepts. This approach inspired and motivated students to pursue careers in engineering, contributing to developing a well-trained and diverse engineering workforce. Overall, the project-based learning approach effectively supported student learning and the development of essential skills in engineering.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Due to the COVID-19 restrictions, we could not obtain outside internships for our students, so we hired students internally as Lab Assistants who supported our Engineering Labs and assisted with the Mobile STEM Lab. The Mobile STEM lab aims to expose current and prospective students to the different facets of engineering technology by providing instruction and demonstrating the usage of engineering-associated equipment and tools. The lab enables the college to provide students with information on engineering fields based on the lab's resources and provides ATC the opportunity to offer instructional engineering classes within the mobile lab. This opportunity gave our current students hands-on experience educating potential students and community leaders about engineering through project-based experiments.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Overall, we were successful in building new project-based learning courses, recruiting new students through the Mobile STEM Lab, and giving our students hands-on experience that they can use to obtain employment.<span>&nbsp;</span></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/29/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Laquata&nbsp;Sumter</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1800885/1800885_10570611_1675036494369_LeadershipAlbany5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1800885/1800885_10570611_1675036494369_LeadershipAlbany5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Community Partners\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1800885/1800885_10570611_1675036494369_LeadershipAlbany5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Community Partners\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Introducing Drone Technology to Albany Community Partners.
