 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an Early-Stage Design and Development collaborative effort submitted to the assessment strand of the Discovery Research PreK-12 (DRK-12) Program. Its main goal is to better understand how to build and sustain the capacity of elementary science teachers in grades 3-5 to instruct and formatively assess students in ways that are aligned with contemporary science education frameworks and standards. To achieve this goal, the project will use classroom-based science assessment as a focus around which to build teacher capacity in science instruction and three-dimensional learning in science. The three dimensions will include disciplinary core ideas, science and engineering practices, and crosscutting concepts. These dimensions are described in the Framework for K-12 Science Education (National Research Council; NRC, 2012), and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS; NGSS Lead States, 2013). The project will work closely with teachers to co-develop usable assessments and rubrics and help them to learn about three-dimensional assessment and instruction. Also, the project will work with teachers to test the developed assessments in diverse settings, and to create an active, online community of practice. \r\n\r\nThe two research questions will be: (1) How well do these assessments function with respect to aspects of validity for classroom use, particularly in terms of indicators of student proficiency, and tools to support teacher instructional practice?; and (2) In what ways do providing these assessment tasks and rubrics, and supporting teachers in their use, advance teachers' formative assessment practices to support multi-dimensional science instruction? The research and development components of this project will produce assessments and rubrics, which can directly impact students and teachers in the districts and states that have adopted the NGSS, as well as those that have embraced the vision of science teaching and learning embodied in the NRC Framework. The project will consist of five major tasks. First, the effort will iteratively develop assessments and rubrics for formative use, using an evidence-centered design approach. Second, it will collect data from evidence-based revision and redesign of the assessments from teachers piloting the assessments and rubrics, project cognitive laboratory studies with students, and an external review of the assessments design products. Third, it will study teachers' classroom use of assessments to understand and document how they blend assessment and instruction. The project will use pre/post questionnaires, video recordings, observation field notes, and pre/post interviews. Fourth, the study will build the capacity of participating teachers. Teacher Collaborators (n=9) will engage in participatory design of the assessment tasks and act as technical assistants to the overall implementation process. Teacher Implementers (n=15) will use the assessments formatively as part of their instructional practice. Finally, the work will develop a community of learners through the development of a technical assistance infrastructure, and leveraging teacher expertise to formatively assess students' work, using the assessments designed to be diagnostic and instructionally informative. External reviewers and an advisory board will provide formative feedback on the project's processes and summative evaluation of the project's results. The main outcomes of this endeavor will be prototypes of elementary science multi-dimensional assessments and new knowledge for the field on the underlying theory for developing teachers' capacity for engaging in multi-dimensional science instruction, learning, and assessment.\r\n\r\nThe DRK-12 Program seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

(DRK-12; #1813737; $1,650,521; 7/1/2018-6/30/2024; PI: James W. Pellegrino; Co-PI: Brian Gane). This project involved a multiyear partnership between University STEM education researchers and upper elementary teachers from two Illinois districts. The partnership&rsquo;s goal was to build the capacity of elementary teachers to implement ambitious and equitable science instruction and assessment aligned with the National Research Council&rsquo;s 2012 <em>Framework for K-12 Science Education</em> and the <em>Next Generation Science Standards</em> (2013). The partnership involved staff from the University of Illinois Chicago and the University of Chicago with district science education leadership and elementary teachers (Grades 3-5) from the Chicago and Indian Prairie Public School districts. Over six years, the partnership focused on the design, implementation, and interpretation of classroom assessments of multidimensional science knowledge and proficiency. The professional learning community &ndash; in person and virtual -- that was established focused on understanding the <em>NGSS</em> and its implications for classroom teaching with emphasis on the design, use, and interpretation of classroom assessments of student learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong>: The Project worked to identify challenges associated with developing assessment tasks for classroom formative use with students in grades 3-5 given the need for those tasks to be age and grade level appropriate and aligned with multidimensional performance standards. By working collaboratively with teachers in the design process we were able to demonstrate how a principled design method focused on evidence of specific scientific reasoning outcomes could be used to help overcome such challenges. The collaborative work with teachers and their feedback as they implemented the tasks in their classrooms and evaluated responses from their students provided significant insight into how upper elementary grade teachers can connect standards-aligned but curriculum-agnostic assessment tasks with their district and school curriculum and instruction resources, as well as how their judgements of student successes and challenges with the assessment tasks were integrated into their instructional practice as part of following a formative assessment model.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong>: The project produced 48 multidimensional assessment tasks (and interpretive rubrics) which are publicly available for use by educators and researchers. All tasks and associated interpretive resources are housed in a web portal that also includes over 170 middle school assessment tasks; the portal has about 11,000 registered teachers and 85,000 registered students -- https://ngss-assessment.portal.concord.org. When used by other educators and researchers, these tasks and resources can potentially impact the science learning of students in all states that have adopted the <em>Next Generation Science Standards</em>, as well as those that have embraced the underlying vision of multidimensional science learning elucidated in the 2012 National Research Council&rsquo;s <em>Framework for K-12 Science Education</em>. Additionally, the project developed a Virtual Learning Community (VLC) website with resources to support science instruction and classroom assessment -- https://www.upinscience.org. The VLC website is designed to support teachers in understanding and implementing formative assessment in the classroom, with particular guidance and resources for formative use of the tasks developed by the project and available on the assessment task portal. Development of the VLC resources and professional learning activities associated with use of these resources directly influenced the instructional practices of the participating educators (N = 29) and their students&rsquo; science learning. With regard to the impact on teachers, empirical evidence from surveys revealed that teachers' general confidence and understanding of three-dimensional science teaching, learning, and assessment significantly improved from project initiation to project conclusion, as well as their sense of preparedness for multidimensional science teaching and assessment. With regard to assessment knowledge and practice, a number of specific changes were observed including increases in Preparedness to use formative assessment practices to monitor student learning, as well as Preparedness to support classroom discussions drawing on student ideas. Additionally, there were significant improvements in teachers&rsquo; sense of overall preparedness for teaching the DCI domains.
