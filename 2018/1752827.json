 "awd_abstract_narration": "Determining the exact mechanisms that heat the corona and accelerate the solar wind are two of the most important problems in solar-heliospheric physics, as well as one of the top priority goals of the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission.  This mission, which is scheduled to launch in the summer of 2018, will visit the near-Sun regions never explored before by any spacecraft, providing groundbreaking in-situ and close-by remote sensing measurements of the inner heliosphere between 9.5 and 55 solar radii (measured from the center of the Sun), reaching up to six times closer than the Helios mission.  This five-year CAREER project is aimed at improving present understanding of the evolution and structure of turbulence close to the Sun.  The project will also help elucidate how energy is transported from the solar surface to its upper atmosphere and how this energy is dissipated to heat the solar corona and accelerate the solar wind.  One of the main broader impacts of this project is that it will enhance the scientific return of the PSP mission by laying the theoretical foundations for interpretation of PSP measurements, which will have repercussions in a number of other outstanding questions in heliospheric physics.  The project team will introduce a novel and user friendly software tool that will allow students to use numerical simulations, with minimal knowledge of scientific computing, to enhance learning of introductory space plasma physics.  The role that numerical simulations will play in the introductory courses will closely mirror the role that simulations play in modern plasma research, i.e., to facilitate understanding of the underlying physics when analytical progress is no longer possible.  The software interface will allow students to quickly solve numerical problems to gain intuition from the numerical solution to help reinforce understanding of the underlying concepts.  Another main broader impact of this project is that, at its conclusion, a fully tested and working version of this tool will be made available online under the GNU open-source license, to allow for the expansion of its plasma physics problems base and use in other research institutions.  This software tool will also be adapted to disseminate with the general public the research outcomes of this project, and inform them on the relevance of space plasma research and the revolutionary discoveries that the PSP will enable in the decades to come.  The research and EPO agenda of this CAREER project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.\r\n\r\nThis CAREER is expected to provide an improved understanding of the origin and evolution of turbulence in the near-Sun environment, from the Alfven waves observed in the low corona to turbulent fluctuations in the upper corona and the solar wind.  This investigation will combine theory, high-resolution numerical simulations and existing observations to lay the groundwork for the interpretation of the unprecedented measurements by the PSP.  The project aims to accomplish the following specific science goals: (i) Investigate how turbulence evolves from AW motions in the solar corona to fully developed AW turbulence at larger heliocentric distances; (ii) identify scaling laws governing the inertial-range power spectrum, the role of cross- helicity and residual energy in the turbulence and how such properties depend on the heliocentric distance; (iii) investigate the role that this turbulence plays in power laws of the magnetic energy spectrum of fluctuations observed by Helios measurements between 0.3 AU and 0.4 AU; and, (iv) establish predictions of the properties of turbulent fluctuations that the PSP will measure.  This CAREER investigation is also timely, because it will lay the theoretical and numerical framework needed for interpretation of the PSP signals before the first measurements become available at the end of 2018.  The outcome of this research combined with the future PSP observations will not only contribute to expand our knowledge of the fundamentals of Alfvenic turbulence in this region, but will lead to transformative advances towards determining the viability of Alfvenic turbulence as a major mechanism for the heating of the corona and the acceleration of the solar wind.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\nThis CAREER project supportedscientific and broader educational goals. The scientific goals were devoted to fundamental research advancingour physical understanding of the evolution and structure of turbulence in the inner heliosphere and help to elucidate how energy is transported from the solar corona into interplanetary space, and how it can dissipate to heat and accelerate the solar corona to produce the solar wind.  Understanding the physics underlying the heating and acceleration of the solar wind is oneof the most fundamental problems in heliospheric physics, which has eluded scientists for decades. The educational goals involvedthe development of a user-friendly interactive software interface to allow students to learn introductory space plasma physics through computer simulations, with little to zero knowledge of scientific computing. The goal is to make this innovative teaching tool a permanent component in the instruction of plasma physics at Florida Tech, as well as to promote and encourage its use beyond the institution at peer universities. In the following, we briefly summarize the main outcomes of the research and educational components of this project.\n\n\n\n\nResearch. \n\n\n\n\nFunding for this project allowed us to achieve fivemain accomplishments in understanding the fundamental properties of turbulence in the inner heliosphere and its role in the heating and acceleration of the solar wind. 1) We used high-resolution numerical simulations of Reflection-Driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence to show that most of the power in the Alfven Waves originating in the lower corona, between 50% and 70%, is dissipated into heat, while only between 15% and 30% is converted to work. These simulations showed for the first time that reflection-driven MHD turbulence is a viable mechanism to explain how the solar wind is heated. 2) We used a combination of theoretical modeling and numerical simulation tests to develop a new methodology to interpret PSP measurements without invoking the Taylor's Hypothesis (TH). The TH has been a cornerstone in the analysis of spacecraft data far away from the Sun. However, this TH is known to become invalid during close solar encounters by the PSP mission. Our methodology allowed us to successfully reconstruct the energy spectrum of magnetic fluctuations in the solar wind during PSP perihelia. 3) Using numerical simulations and spacecraft data we showed for the first time that probability distribution functions associated with turbulent fluctuations are well described by a family of well-known functions (Generalized Hyperbolic Distributions). These distributions also exhibit universal scaling properties that may provide additional constraints from simulations and observations to future theoretical models of intermittency in the solar wind. 4) We also use PSP observations and measurements of the near-Earth solar wind to establish a commonorigin of the so-called magnetic field line reversals, which was one of the most important early findings by PSP, with previously observed reversals far from the Sun. 5) We also used measurements of the near-Eart solar wind to conclusively establish that slow solar wind streams dominated by Alfven wave turbulence exhibit a 1/f spectrum, while those streams that are dominated by compressible turbulence do not.\n\n\n\n\nEducation.\n\n\n\n\nThe main societal broader impact of this project was the development of a user-friendly interactive software interface to allow students to learn introductory space plasma physics through computer simulations, with little to zero knowledge of scientific computing. These innovative teaching tools served two main purposes: 1) The use of numerical simulations in the classroom and in homework assignments to help students understand important physical concepts without being obscured by complex mathematical derivations that are often unfamiliar to students; and 2) Students learn plasma physics much in the same way that research in this field is conducted. The role that the numerical solution to plasma physics problems plays in the students learning process is analogous to the role numerical simulations play in modern plasma research. For instance, in plasma research, simulations are needed when one given problem is not amenable to analytical solution, while in the student case, the simulations are needed because the student lacks the mathematical maturity necessary to find the solution. The software interfacehides all the sophistication associated with the numerical codes, allowing students to quickly solve numerical problems with minimal knowledge of scientific computing, while gaining intuition from the numerical solution to help reinforce understanding of the underlying concepts.\n\n\n\n\nThese interactive tools to assist in lectures can also be converted to fully functional websites with all the numerical codes running in a remote serverto share with students foruse outside lectures and integrated with some homework assignments. These numerical tools will continue to be used for instruction at Florida Tech, and the PI will continue to maintain and improve them each time the PI teaches plasma physics. The PI will also share these interactive notebooks progressively with colleagues at other institutions until eventually they are made publicly available under an open-source license.\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/30/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JeanCPerez\n"
