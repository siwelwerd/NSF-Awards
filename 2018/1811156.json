 "awd_abstract_narration": "Topology is the study of objects up to elastic stretching, and geometry the study of rigid bodies. The goal of this project is to understand certain fundamental problems in these areas by combining surprising relationships between them with deep connections to other areas of mathematics and computer science. Both topology and geometry are becoming more important to applications such as data mining, and this National Science Foundation funded project includes collaboration with computer scientists as well as developing software for exploring aspects of these problems which will be freely available to other researchers via the web.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on four topics concerning the topology and geometry of three-dimensional manifolds.  The first topic is effective Mostow rigidity and torsion growth, in particular understanding how topological and geometric invariants behave under towers of finite covers and other geometric limits. The second topic is to elucidate the relationships between Heegaard Floer homology, group orderability, and taut foliations for three-manifolds. The third topic is the construction of a Casson-Lin-Herald invariant for some noncompact Lie groups. The fourth topic is developing new computational methods for exploring a variety of questions about three-manifolds.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
