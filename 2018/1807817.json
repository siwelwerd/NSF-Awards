 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Abstract: Future quantum computers and quantum devices will likely be based on materials that are protected from noise by their intrinsic features, making the operation of these devices robust against environmental perturbations. The fundamental physical nature of these complex materials and their phases, however, is just starting to be revealed. The research team focuses on two such phases: the chiral edge states found in the junction between a superconductor and a magnetic topological insulator, and on the surface of a slightly magnetized topological Kondo insulator, both holding promise for constructing robust quantum computers. In this project, the PI and his team use a set of experimental tools including precision magneto-optic imaging to investigate these two chiral edge states. The results could provide a knowledge base for topologically protected information processing, potentially operating at room temperature. The science and education components provide integrated and rigorous scientific training for graduate and undergraduate students, so including students from underrepresented groups. Through an outreach program, the excitement of science could be conveyed to minority and female middle school students. \r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract: Chiral edge states are intricate topological structures that are potentially useful for quantum devices. However, much of their physics remains unknown. In this project, the PI and the research team utilize a newly developed mK-Sagnac interferometer-microscope in their group to image and investigate two such topological structures: the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) state and the related Majorana chiral modes in a superconductor/QAH junction, and the magnetic chiral edge states on the surface of the topological Kondo insulator SmB6. As surface and bulk often have distinctively different physics properties in topological materials, in this project, the research team performs simultaneous Sagnac, torque magnetometry, and transport measurements to clearly distinguish the contributions from bulk and surface states down to unprecedented low temperatures. These measurements could resolve the intricate spin and magnetization structures on the edge and bulk states of QAH states, chiral Majorana edge mode, and SmB6 surface magnetic structure. This project can potentially address important questions in the field of topological materials and devices: 1. Can we stabilize QAH effect at temperatures close to ambient temperature for practical device applications? 2. What are the spin structures of the chiral Majorana edge mode? 3. What is the nature of the quantized conductance found in the surface state of topological Kondo insulator? The science and education components provide integrated and rigorous scientific training for graduate and undergraduate students, so including students from underrepresented groups. Through an outreach program, the excitement of science could be conveyed to minority and female middle school students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The first example is the&nbsp;<em>n</em>-type LaAlO<span>3</span>/SrTiO<span>3&nbsp;</span>interface, where coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity have been reported. Our Sagnac imaging (Fig1) has revealed strong in- homogeneities in both optical reflectivity and magnetization suggesting a similar yet unknown underlying mechanism. The second example is the quantum anomalous Hall system, in which we have perform simultaneous Kerr and transport measurements (Fig2) in Cr-doped (BiSb)<span>2</span>Te<span>3&nbsp;</span>and show that the low occurring temperature of quantum anomalous Hall effect in current material system is a combined result of weak ferromagnetism and trivial band involvement. Fe-chalcogenide FeTeSe has been a promising platform to host exotic particles for quantum computing. Indications of TRS breaking have been reported with ARPES spectra. We use combined Sagnac imaging and bulk magnetometry (Fg3) to show that the TRSB arises from surface ferromagnetism that is a competing order to SC. It is highly sensitive to the exact chemical composition, thereby providing a means for optimizing the conditions for Majorana particles that are useful for robust quantum computing. Recent experiments have pointed to a chiral p-wave-like superconductivity in epitaxial Bi/Ni bilayers that are spontaneously TRSB. Quite intriguingly, single crystals of NiBi3 have been reported to host coexisting ferromagnetic and superconducting orders at the surface. We use Sagnac interferometer to show that single crystals of NiBi3 does not break TRS (Fig4). As such, the previously reported ferromagnetism in NiBi3 is due to Ni impurities and is not the cause for TRSB in Bi/Ni bilayers. In SmB6, we have introduced a method for performing thermal transport measurement on single crystals under strain. Magnetic-field-independent residual linear terms were found in flux-grown SmB6 at nominal zero strain, and they grew under a tensile strain (Fig5), which is known to modify Sm valence, and explains the previous inconsistences between reports. During the time of the project, we have hosted several outreach activities with visitors from local middle school. The participants of this project have shown various scientific demonstrations (Fig6) involving low temperature, superconductivity, magnetism, and optics.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/10/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jing&nbsp;Xia</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1807817/1807817_10560346_1668116112292_Fig3KerrFeTeSe--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1807817/1807817_10560346_1668116112292_Fig3KerrFeTeSe--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Surface Ferromagnetism in Superconducting and Non-superconducting Fe-chalcogenide\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1807817/1807817_10560346_1668116112292_Fig3KerrFeTeSe--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Surface Ferromagnetism in Superconducting and Non-superconducting Fe-chalcogenide\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Sagnac setup and Scanning images of reflected optical power &#119875; and Kerr signal of a FeTe0.55Se0.45 sample at 1.8 &#119870; and zero magnetic field.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jing Xia</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jing&nbsp;Xia</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Surface Ferromagnetism in Superconducting and Non-superconducting Fe-chalcogenide</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1807817/1807817_10560346_1668116024200_Fig2KerrQAHEmK--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1807817/1807817_10560346_1668116024200_Fig2KerrQAHEmK--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Concurrent magneto-optic Kerr effect and transport measurements of QAHE down to 70 mK\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1807817/1807817_10560346_1668116024200_Fig2KerrQAHEmK--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Concurrent magneto-optic Kerr effect and transport measurements of QAHE down to 70 mK\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A, C, E are Sagnac Kerr measurements of QAHE, B, D, F are transports measured at the same time.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jing Xia</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jing&nbsp;Xia</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Concurrent magneto-optic Kerr effect and transport measurements of QAHE down to 70 mK</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1807817/1807817_10560346_1668115837005_Fig1KerrLAOSTO--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1807817/1807817_10560346_1668115837005_Fig1KerrLAOSTO--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Kerr image of n-type LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1807817/1807817_10560346_1668115837005_Fig1KerrLAOSTO--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Kerr image of n-type LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Polar Kerr magnetometry.
