 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sinclair Community College (SCC; OH), Brookdale Community College (BCC; NJ) and Moraine Valley Community College (MVCC; IL) propose to increase the placement of highly qualified cybersecurity professionals in government positions for the Community College Cyber Pilot Program (C3P). This proposed project is in alignment with the National Defense Authorization Act of 2018. Through cohort-based learning, SFS scholars at each of the four-partner colleges will collaborate on activities and events, including student skills competitions, certification preparation workshops, visits to local federal agencies, and participation in job fairs. Experiential learning will allow students to gain skills from real cybersecurity vulnerabilities and attacks experienced by businesses and organizations. SCC is designated as a National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense 2-Year Education (CAE-2Y) and MVCC is an Advanced Technical Education (ATE) National Resource Center.\r\n\r\nThe program will be based on several successful adult learning practices: cohort learning, experiential learning, competency-based education, and one-on-one, holistic student support. The objectives are to: 1) research, develop, and document new strategic roles community colleges can play in increasing the number of cybersecurity professionals employed in government sectors; 2) build effective collaborations between educational institutions, business, industry, and government; 3) prepare 24 Scholars For Service (SFS) to help meet government need for highly qualified cybersecurity professionals; 4) disseminate best practice models designed for replication by other colleges across the country, including: new protocols for conducting prior learning assessments to assist veterans in applying their education and experience to cybersecurity disciplines; and best practices for recruiting, selecting, and supporting non-cybersecurity Bachelor degree students through cybersecurity education programs (cohort models and success coaching).\r\n\r\nCo-funding for this project is provided from the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) and NSF Scholarships in STEM (S-STEM) programs, reflecting alignment of the project with major emphases of the ATE program on involvement of community colleges and the S-STEM program on financial and co-curricular support for high-achieving students with demonstrated financial need.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Through this novel program, students selected as &ldquo;Scholars&rdquo; received scholarships that covered their academic costs. Scholars were required to obtain a federal job that met the broader NSF SFS&rsquo;s service requirements within two years of program completion to avoid repaying scholarship monies.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong><br /></strong></span>The C3P program was effective in meeting many of its goals.<span>&nbsp; </span>Over four years, the program successfully recruited and supported two cohorts of cybersecurity Scholars, all of whom demonstrated significant personal and professional growth. Despite challenges related to job placement and systemic barriers (see Figure 1 for key contextual factors impacting student placement rates), the program achieved high satisfaction among Scholars and employers, culminating in the development of a toolkit for future project proposals (see Figure 2). By the end of the C3P component of the project in 2022, 22 scholars had graduated from the program, five of whom were veterans of the United States Armed Forces. Nearly all the Scholars supported by the program graduated on time, partnerships with federal agencies were strengthened to establish pathways to eligible employment, and most of the Scholars successfully secured an internship or special project. Further, nineteen Scholars obtained SFS-approved employment, and five fulfilled their service commitments by the end of 2023.

Low completion rates among the 1,138 initial applicants at various stages of the certification process indicated a need for additional time and funding to promote the program and regularly communicate with existing and potential applicants. In total, 236 students qualified for the SEC275 course, and 181 individuals enrolled.
