Subsequent symposia will be held in February 2019 at Southern Nazarene University and February 2020 at Cameron University. TORUS is an annual one-day conference that has been held since 2005 at different universities in the Texas and Oklahoma Region. It provides opportunities for undergraduates interested in the study of mathematics to participate in scholarly and social activities in mathematics with other colleges and universities with the goal of encouraging students to pursue graduate study and careers in mathematics. TORUS also helps strengthen connections between undergraduate-focused universities in the Texas/Oklahoma region and encourage faculty at these universities to pursue research projects with undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nEach symposium includes two invited talks, student presentations, a panel discussion, and Math Jeopardy. In addition, students will have the opportunity to share the results of their research (for example, a paper or poster) with a broader audience on the conference website. The conference website is http://homepages.se.edu/torus/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
