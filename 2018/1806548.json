 "awd_abstract_narration": "New technologies are being developed that use quantum mechanical phenomena to process, store, and securely transmit information in ways that are not possible with classical devices. A key ingredient in the performance of quantum technologies is the presence of entanglement, which can be thought of as a kind of connection between spatially separated objects that does not exist in the everyday classical world. This project will advance the progress of science by deepening understanding of entanglement between atoms and between atoms and light. Gaining a better understanding of entanglement and how to accurately prepare entanglement of atoms and light will promote the development of useful quantum information processing technologies. In addition research and education activities supported by this NSF award will contribute to workforce training for future commercialization of quantum technologies.\r\n\r\nThe research project will study the fidelity of entanglement prepared in multi-atom ensembles as well as between atomic ensembles and optical fields. Long range atomic interactions mediated by highly excited Rydberg states will be used to create deterministic entanglement between multi-atom ensembles and between ensembles and light. The fidelity of Rydberg state mediated entanglement will be compared in 1D and 2D ensembles and in spatially disordered and ordered ensembles. The comparison will elucidate the robustness of Rydberg blockade in the presence of complex short range interactions. Spatially ordered ensembles that exhibit collective resonances due to dipolar interactions will be combined with strong, long range Rydberg interactions to generate single photon wavepackets with controlled directionality that will enable entanglement of spatially separated atomic arrays.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
