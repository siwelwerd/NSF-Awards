 "awd_abstract_narration": "The millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies and other bands above 6 GHz are a new and promising frontier for cellular wireless communications and the focus of the fifth-generation (5G) standardization efforts.  Due to the massive available bandwidths, the mmWave frequencies offer the possibility of orders of magnitude greater capacity than current cellular systems in the highly congested bands below 3 GHz.  However, a key challenge in realizing mmWave mobile cellular networks is energy consumption. Mobile devices and small-cell access points must operate under highly-constrained power budgets, and developing mmWave systems within these power limits is a formidable task.  This project will investigate energy consumption from a system's perspective to address the issues in an integrated and coherent manner.  The project will develop mathematical models for understanding energy and performance tradeoffs.  New technologies for the radio frequency (RF) circuits, antenna array system, signal processing, and network protocols will be jointly developed to optimize performance and deliver energy-efficient mmWave devices.\r\n\r\nThe research work will pursue four key thrusts: Thrust 1 will seek to understand the fundamental relation between throughput, processing power, and spectral emission constraints, and optimizes this tradeoff by dynamically controlling key energy drivers including bandwidth, quantization resolution, antenna architecture, and waveform selection. This is combined with novel energy-aware scheduling policies and signal processing techniques.  Thrust 2 will focus on idle mode power savings and associated problems of energy-efficient directional channel estimation and delay in dynamic environments.  Thrust 3 will develop fundamental circuits technologies that enable Thrusts 1 and 2, in particular the novel techniques for both high-efficiency power amplifiers and low-power fully digital RF transceivers.  Thrust 4 will obtain the necessary channel models and build circuit prototypes to validate the concepts in Thrusts 1 to 3.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPower efficiency is one of the key goals in designing any wireless communications system, particularly in handheld and portable setting such as smartphones and embedded devices that must operate off battery power.  The power consumption problem has becoming particularly pressing for devices operating with latest fifth generation (5G) wireless systems that uses the so-called millimeter wave (mmWave) bands.  The mmWave bands enable enormous throughput, but require exhorbitant power level to support very bandwidths of communications and large numbers of antenna elements.  This project seeks to broadly two basic questions:  What are are the limits of commuications in power-constrained mmWave systems?  And, what circuits, signal processing methods and protocols best optimize the power and performance tradeoffs within these limits?  The project teams brought together experts in circuits (Buckwalter, UCSB), informations and communication theory (Erkip, NYU) and wireless communication design (Rangan, NYU).\n\nThe project advanced the understanding and design of power efficient mmWave systems considerably.  A general mathematical framework was developed to enable designers to quantify the performance of communication systems with nonlinearites that are introduced for power savings.  Importantly, the framework captured many important phenomena that were previously under-appreciated including the role of the mixer, interference, and filtering.  The model was used to optimize circuits designs in the upper mmWave bands at 140 GHz, and these designs led to 70 to 80% power savings.  A second set of achievements led to efficient algorithms for beam search, a key procedure in mmWave systems.  These works leveraged ideas from state-of-the-art electronics and machine learning.  Protocols were also developed including new methods of large scale random access and discontinuous reception modes, where the receiver is intermittently turned off to reduce power.  The methods were evaluated with industry standard detailed simulations and considerable effort was also placed on developing channel models and simulation tools to assist in this evaluation.\n\nFor broader impacts, the academic work was coupled with close collaboration with industry to ensure technology transfer.  NYU hosted an annual Brooklyn 6G Summit where power consumption and sustainability were widely discussed.  A new NYU WIreless Workshop was also developed.  The material was added to several courses and much of this material has been made completely open source for other instructors to use.  The students also developed a highly successful teaching program for high school teachers as part ofthe COSMOS project.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/07/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sundeep Rangan"
