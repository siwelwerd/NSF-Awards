 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental goal in biology is to understand the genes and developmental processes that affect ecological success and adaptation of organisms in natural environments. Historically, a mechanistic understanding of ecologically important phenotypes has been limited to a small number of genes in very few model organisms. The research will improve genetic tools in the wildflower genus Mimulus (monkeyflowers), a system that exhibits rich diversity in form, physiology, and life history. By connecting this diversity with functional genetic analysis and field experiments, the research will enable molecular genetic investigations of previously unexplored of phenotypic variation. With the tools proposed here, the growing Mimulus scientific community will be in an excellent position to identify the causal genetic mechanisms underlying ecologically important traits. The research will provide hands-on learning opportunities for two different undergraduate laboratory courses taught at University of Georgia and University of California, Riverside. In addition, the research will offer training experiences for local high school teachers in Georgia to develop and refine lab activities for dissemination in the high school classroom. Furthermore, the plant materials generated in this research will be incorporated into live plant outreach activities at the University of Connecticut for student and public education. Finally, the actives will be broadly disseminated via the Plant Biology section on the \"Learn.Genetics\" website as online educational resources.\r\n\r\nIdentifying the genetic and developmental determinants of natural phenotypic variation is fundamentally important for understanding organismal biology and the processes that generate biodiversity. The genus Mimulus is an exceptionally diverse group of approximately 200 wildflower species with abundant natural populations that is ideally suited for linking naturally occurring genotypes to their ecologically important phenotypes. The research will enable Mimulus as a powerful new model for ecological functional genomics and plant developmental genetics. The specific scientific objectives are as follows: 1) Optimize genetic transformation protocols in seven Mimulus species that are actively studied by many researchers and represent a wide range of phylogenetic diversity. 2) Generate large-scale chemical and transposon insertion mutant libraries for three of the most actively studied species. Additionally, a major goal of the research is to enable Mimulus researchers to take full advantage of the newly developed functional genomics protocols and resources in their own labs. This project includes an annual, weeklong summer lab short course that will rotate between the University of Connecticut and the University of Georgia. The project will also include a website to disseminate detailed instructions and video tutorials of protocols, as well as a searchable database with information on plant lines, seed stocks, and other important tools generated from this work.\r\n\r\nThis award was co-funded by funds from Enabling Discovery through GEnomic Tools (EDGE) Program and the Evolutionary Process Program within the Division of Environmental Biology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
