 "awd_abstract_narration": "The area of study of this project lies within algebraic geometry, the\r\nbranch of mathematics devoted to geometric shapes called algebraic\r\nvarieties, defined by polynomial equations. Algebraic geometry\r\nhas significant applications in theoretical physics, where physicists consider\r\nalgebraic varieties as a piece of the fine structure of our\r\nuniverse. This is especially true with the first topic, moduli\r\ntheory. This theory studies a remarkable phenomenon in which the\r\ncollection of all algebraic varieties of the same type is often\r\nmanifested as an algebraic variety, called a moduli space, in its own\r\nright. Thus in algebraic geometry, the metaphor of thinking about a\r\ncommunity of \"organisms\" as itself being an \"organism\" is not just a\r\nmetaphor but a rigorous and quite useful fact. The other topic studied in\r\nthis project is birational geometry, focusing here on resolution of  \r\nsingularities, applied in this project to families of varieties.  \r\nResolution of singularities is a fundamental procedure where \"bad\"  \r\npoints of an algebraic variety are removed and replaced by \"good\"  \r\npoints.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbramovich will continue studying problems in birational geometry,  \r\nspecifically the problem of functorial semistable reduction. Here  \r\nAbramovich and collaborators will build on Hironaka's method of  \r\nresolution of singularities in order to resolve singularities of  \r\nfamilies of varieties. Long term goals include extending this effort  \r\nto other geometric categories and to singular foliations. In addition,  \r\nAbramovich will continue to study moduli spaces. The main foci are  \r\nModuli and arithmetic of K3 surfaces, where one wishes to find  \r\nsituations where K3 moduli spaces are algebraically hyperbolic;  \r\nrepresentability of logarithmic moduli, where an analogue of Artin's  \r\ncriteria is sought; a quest to describe explicit moduli of certain  \r\nstable surfaces; and completion of a long-term project on the  \r\nlogarithmic degeneration formula.\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
