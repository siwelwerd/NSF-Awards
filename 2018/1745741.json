 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Eastern Pacific Ocean in the Northern Hemisphere is one of the most prolific regions on Earth in terms of generation of intense tropical cyclones that make landfall on the coasts of arid southwestern North America and dramatically enhance runoff, flooding, and associated erosion and sedimentation.  Recent research indicates that these large-scale events have altered the hydrological and ecosystem balances over historical and geological timescales (decades to thousands of years). This project will assess how far north along the coast of southwestern North America these storms have occurred in the geologic past, and how far inland they controlled geomorphic change events through rain and erosion. The specific goal is to determine if previously documented periods when tropical cyclones dominated runoff and sediment deposition across large alluvial fan systems of the southern Baja California peninsula can be detected in central Baja California, the southern California deserts, and even as far north as the southern Arizona Sonoran Desert. Data will test whether dissipating cyclones were drivers of alluvial fan sedimentation over thousands of years, and if a temporal correlation can be established to a period of transition between a milder, humid paleoclimate to the current arid climate. For the first time, a tropical cyclone landfall chronology covering the last few millennia will be developed for the Pacific coast of southwestern North America. This research has the potential to inform large-storm prediction scenarios for southern California and northwestern Mexico, which is relevant to hazards management for communities in need of risk assessment of rare and extreme events. The project will contribute to the training of the next generation of earth scientists using a tiered approach, with field-based collaboration of postdoctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate students. This approach has been proven successful for inclusion of underrepresented minorities, enhanced also with planned research alongside Mexican collaborators and students. The project will provide unique broader educational experiences for grade-school students in Indiana and Arizona, through the use of technology to connect fieldwork and classrooms.\r\n\r\nThis project will compare a recently established alluvial fan chronology in southern Baja California, with newly-obtained alluvial fan and paleotempestological records. A Holocene paleotempestological record of overwash deposits in the Pacific coastal Vizcaino Desert will be developed for the first time. The inferred tropical storm activity will be compared with inland alluvial fan deposition in this area and in the northern Sonoran Desert, enabling discrimination of signals from different moisture sources, based on observed coastal and alluvial sedimentology, stratigraphy, and specific proxy records. Effects of different sources of moisture that drive sedimentation will be assessed by probing different time periods, and compared to independent paleoclimatic proxies. Bayesian analysis of luminescence, cosmogenic, and radiocarbon geochronology will improve age control precision. The coupled alluvial and coastal record at orbital timescales will help to understand linkages between Quaternary alluvial sedimentation and hydroclimatic variability in the region, and will increase our understanding of basic principles of alluvial fan aggradation in response to change in arid hydroclimates. The project will test effects of millennial- and orbital-scale shifts in tropical circulation on landscape evolution of the region, which are, in turn, critical to test models of occurrence and effects of hydrological extremes and associated landscape changing events.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe primary objective of this project is to develop a Holocene paleotempestological record from Baja California Sur, Mexico, to understand the role of tropical cyclones and other geomorphic events in controlling coastal landform evolution and ecosystem changes in arid southwestern North America. Two small coastal lagoons were cored from the west shore of Baha Concepcin near Muleg and the cores were analyzed for multiple paleoenvironmental proxies including sediment stratigraphy (loss-on-ignition), geochemistry (X-ray fluorescence), and palynology (pollen and spores). At Laguna Los Cocos (26o4435.73N, 111o5404.75W), the multi-proxy dataset reveals the occurrence of a tsunami event at ~530 cal yr BP and four hurricane events at ~770, ~600, ~280, and ~0 cal yr BP (Yao et al., 2021). The tsunami deposit was characterized by a marine-dominated layer at the bottom representing the run-up process bringing in broken shells and marine sediments from offshore, which is overlain by a backwash layer with a mixed assemblage of materials derived from both terrestrial and marine environments. The hurricane events are marked by terrestrial deposits indicating that surficial runoff and hillslope erosion are the major geomorphic processes associated with hurricane passage in this arid coastal environment. At Laguna Santispac (26o45'44.50\"N, 111o53'34.24\"W), the multi-proxy record confirms the occurrence of a tsunami event that impacted both sites around 530 years ago (about a century before Spanish colonization of this region), but also reveals the occurrence of four hurricane events at ~430, 330, 260, and 170 cal yr BP. The hurricane events were evidenced by the predominance of either marine incursion processes (storm surges) or terrestrial processes (slopewash, fluvial flooding), or a combination of both. At both sites the tsunami event transformed a tidal flat into a backbarrier lagoon, which created a favorable habitat for the proliferation of mangroves around the lagoon. However, after their initial establishment, mangrove populations expanded only gradually for another 100-200 years before they proliferated 450-350 years ago. The delay in proliferation after initial colonization was probably due to the slow process of landform stabilization, sediment accumulation, and soil development after the tsunami event. \n\n\nThis project has impacted the fields of Quaternary paleoclimatology and paleoecology by producing the first multi-proxy records of late-Holocene hurricane activity, tsunami event, and coastal ecosystem development for the coastal desert region of Baja California Sur. Our research findings are of great societal relevance because they reveal that five major extreme events, from both tsunami and hurricanes, impacted each site over the last six centuries, suggesting that these coastal hazards have a return period of ~100 years for the Bahia Concepcion region of Baja California Sur. This study offers a long-term perspective on the frequency, magnitude, and possible mechanisms of these extreme events in Baja California, which is vital for risk assessment and disaster prevention for this arid coastal region.\n\n\nThis project has resulted in the publication of a research paper in a premier scientific journal Science of the Total Environment in 2021 (Yao et al., 2021). It has also contributed to the training of two postdocs, a PhD student at LSU, and a visiting graduate student/scholar from Brazil.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/26/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kam-BiuLiu\n"
