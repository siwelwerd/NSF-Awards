 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Summary\r\nThe development of biodegradable materials represents a revolution in science and has led to significant biotechnological advancements in drug delivery, biomaterials, tissue engineering, and medical devices. Hybrid materials, composed of both organic and inorganic components, illustrate a new field of basic research that has attracted a great deal of attention for designing novel biodegradable and biocompatible composites. In particular, hybrid systems that can efficiently transport and release photosensitizing agents can make a tremendous impact in novel alternatives to treat diseases such as photodynamic therapy. The overall goal of this EAGER project is to develop novel biodegradable multifunctional hybrid polysilsesquioxane nanoparticles to carry photosensitizing agents. By fine tuning the chemical features of polysilsesquioxane nanoparticles, the degradability of these materials under specific conditions and their interaction with mammalian cells can be controlled. The success of the proposed work will open new synthetic avenues to fabricate biodegradable hybrid polysilsesquioxane materials for transporting photosensitizing agents. The fundamental knowledge developed by the proposed research will provide a deeper understanding of the interaction and photochemistry of polysilsesquioxane nanoparticles inside mammalian cells. The multidisciplinary research involving chemistry, materials science, cell biology and nanomedicine provides ample opportunities to train and educate students at undergraduate and graduate levels. Moreover, the -Think Big, Do Nano- outreach program is designed to foster public awareness, engagement, and understanding of nanoscale science and nanotechnology in the Charlotte community at all levels. \r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Summary\r\nThe development of biodegradable hybrid materials represents a revolution in medicine that led to significant biotechnological advancements in biomaterials and tissue engineering. Despite the impressive success of composite-based platforms, the need for smarter, more precise and optimally tuned carriers is critical. Therefore, the development of alternative nanoparticle-based strategies to conventional composite systems is imperative. Hybrid platforms offer optimized structural, chemical, optical and mechanical features, besides other suitable characteristics such as biodegradability and biocompatibility for their application as biomaterials. This EAGER award supported by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to the University of North Carolina Charlotte focuses on developing biodegradable multifunctional polysilsesquioxane (PSilQ) nanoparticles (NPs) for carrying photosensitizing agents. The specific aims of this proposal include: I) Design, synthesize and characterize biodegradable PSilQ NPs that undergo degradation upon encountering a high reducing environment or acidic pH; II) Test the photophysical and photochemical properties of PSilQ NPs in solution and in vitro; and III) Study the mechanisms of endocytosis, intracellular transportation, and degradation of PSilQ NPs. Exposure of underrepresented minority students to this research is expected to engage students in new and exciting ways, and advance NSFs goal to broaden participation among underrepresented populations in STEM and STEM research. In addition, this project integrates an outreach program, -Think Big, Do Nano-, designed to foster public awareness, engagement, and understanding of nanoscale science and nanotechnology in the Charlotte community at all levels.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It is hypothesized that hybrid PSilQ NPs, which can incorporate established photosensitizers (PSs) and feature stimuli-responsive and target-specific properties can be designed by introducing degradable alkoxysilane-based PS-loaded building units to the PSilQ framework. The main application of these PSilQ NPs is to enhance the photodynamic therapy (PDT) outcome against cancer. We fabricated PSilQ NPs containing protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) as PS agent with redox-responsive features. The PSilQ NPs are quickly biodegraded under high reducing environments as those found in cancer cells and tissues. Using this platform, we have developed multifunctional systems for the co-delivery of PpIX, a chemotherapeutic agent (curcumin) and siRNA (Figure 1). We demonstrated the effective therapeutic efficacy of this nanoparticles in triplet-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. We further investigated the biodegradability and PDT efficacy of this PpIX-PSilQ NPs in solution and in vivo using an orthotopic mouse model of TNBC. Our data showed that the addition of a redox-responsive linker as part of the PpIX-silane precursor, the degradability of the PSilQ platform is dramatically increased. Moreover, the PDT outcome in the orthotopic TNBC mouse model is also improve as compared with the parent PpIX (Figure 2). Interestingly, our PpIX-PSilQ platform also showed fewer toxic side-effects. These results will certainly pave the way for the future clinical evaluation of this PSilQ nanoplatform. The last part of the project dealt with the pathways of intracellular transportation and alternative cell death mechanisms of PSilQ NPs in cancer cells. We studied the impact of ferroptosis and autophagy as alternative cell death mechanisms to eliminate cancer cells using PSilQ materials. A melanoma cell line, A375, was used to investigate the role of ferroptosis in the phototoxicity of the PSilQ nanoparticles. Our data demonstrated that ferroptosis is an important cell death mechanism associated to the PDT performance of PSilQ NPs. We also studied the impact of autophagy in the PDT effect of PSilQ materials in colon cancer using the HT29 cell line. Our results showed that autophagy is an important cell death mechanism related to the PDT induced oxidative stress mainly linked to PSilQ nanoparticles localized in the lysosomes. Overall, these results can provide alternative approaches in designing PSilQ NPs for PDT to enhance the therapeutic response in conditions stymied by apoptosis resistance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/31/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Juan&nbsp;L&nbsp;Vivero-Escoto</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1835688/1835688_10567022_1640971281232_Scheme1_new--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1835688/1835688_10567022_1640971281232_Scheme1_new--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Schematic representation of the multifunctional PpIX-PSilQ platform.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1835688/1835688_10567022_1640971281232_Scheme1_new--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Schematic representation of the multifunctional PpIX-PSilQ platform.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Multifunctional PSilQ nanoparticles that carry PpIX as part of the framework chemically bound through disulfide and silica bonds; curcumin, which is encapsulated during the microemulsion reaction; and siRNA electrostatically attached to the surface of the nanoparticles.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Juan L.
