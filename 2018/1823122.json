 "awd_abstract_narration": "Volcanic eruptions pose one of the principal hazards at tectonically active continental margins, such as the Pacific northwestern United States, which are of ever increasing economic and existential importance to expanding populations. The project will enhance knowledge of the conditions that lead to eruptions of silica-rich magmas, which can be large and impactful. It will boost understanding of the fundamental processes that determine the progression of volcanic eruptions, from inception to cessation, which remains difficult to forecast. Consequently, the project transcends the purely academic and is societally relevant by advancing natural hazard assessment capabilities. The project supports education by enabling the interdisciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students as well as a postdoctoral scholar, thus contributing to the development of a diverse and globally competitive workforce.\r\n\r\nThe project's objective is to advance fundamental knowledge of how volcanoes work by simulating a volcanic eruption from initial explosive activity through lava effusion, to termination of the eruption and post-eruptive inflation, using the 2011/12 Cordon Caulle eruption in Chile as a case study. For this eruption the run-up, the syn-eruptive evolution, and the post-eruptive reconfiguration of the volcanic system were documented in unprecedented detail. The project is multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional. It encompasses geochemistry, petrology and geodesy, in addition to numerical simulation of magma storage and eruption. At the University of Nevada, Reno, the focus will be on constraining magma ascent rates and volatile budgets for the 2011/12 Cordon Caulle eruption using mineral and melt-based techniques. Furthermore, the contribution of mafic recharge to the eruptive activity will be explored with respect to the volatile budget. The geochemical data will be integrated with existing data, additional geodetic observations and numerical simulations in collaboration with the other institutions. The eruption was initially explosive and over time eruption rates decreased with activity shifting from purely explosive to effusive, resulting in the formation of a large lava flow and shallow laccolith. The current view about these types of eruptions is that effusive or explosive activity is possible under otherwise identical conditions and with potentially rapid transitions from one to the other. A goal of the project is the assessment of conditions resulting in transitions in eruptive activity in order to test this explosive-effusive bistability hypothesis. Rapid post-eruptive inflation was observed and a further goal is to assess the extent to which the system has been driven back toward a critical state. These goals will be achieved by integrating the different observational data within extensive physics-based model simulations that will lead to improvements in model reliability and further our understanding of underlying processes at Cordon Caulle and similar hazardous volcanic systems elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

They often produce eruptions with high SiO2 content that is explosive with ash columns transporting volcanic material for thousands of kilometers along prevailing winds. These volcanic plumes impact human infrastructure both locally and regionally. At the same time, some of these eruptions transition into calm lava effusion of viscous slow moving rhyolite. How these magmas form and erupt was the focus of this project. Specifically, the project studied the erupted products of the 2011-12 eruption of the Cord&oacute;n Caulle volcanic complex in Southern Chile that started out with violent explosive deposits carried across South America, and then transitioned into a similarly large outpouring of about 1 km3 of rhyolite. Only a handful of such eruptions have occurred in the last century and thus this system serves as a unique research site where processes at depth and near the surface are recorded and have not yet been lost or modified by time and exposure of erupted products to the surface. One significant new finding was the presence of magmatic blobs, called mafic or basaltic enclaves, in the rhyolitic lavas that have retained a strong deeper-earth character with unobscured links to the regions of magma generation in the mantle. By studying these basaltic enclaves we could demonstrate important new insights in magma storage and generation prior to the eruption of such rhyolitic volcanoes. First, we demonstrated that even in continental crust magmas from the mantle can rise to the upper crust and feed directly a large (10s of km3) magmatic storage system that may respond with surface deformation. Secondly, in this process of rapid ascent and accumulation in the crust we showed that basaltic magmas may develop a crystal-rich mush within the top 8 km of the crust that produces rhyolite directly from basalt by fractionation. In the past such processes have been considered to be protracted. We showed that Cord&oacute;n Caulle is likely an important global end-member in this context, that builds this large shallow magma system because of water-poor magmas (&lt;2 wt% H2O) that are rare in arc generally. Nonetheless, the effective crystallization enriches the water in the remaining rhyolitic liquid that when segregated from the mush remains highly explosive. Thirdly, we developed a new technique (Mg diffusion in plagioclase in contact with clinopyroxene) to establish temperature-time histories for arc magmas that contain basaltic enclaves. Moreover, we conducted similarly a crystal-zoning study in these basaltic enclaves to corroborate these time-temperature histories with Fe-Mg diffusion in olivine (another chronometer for magmatic systems). Here, we employed Fe and Mg isotope analysis of these olivine grains that more definitively show that zoning is produced by elemental diffusion at high temperatures and the Fe isotopic signature further supported that these enclaves are nearly-closed basaltic systems that crystallize directly to rhyolite. This supports the main findings of this work regarding rhyolite formation being a direct product of basalts. Finally, we combined these mineral-based studies with fluid dynamics and remote sensing studies of the 2011-12 eruption to develop a model of rhyolite formation at Cord&oacute;n Caulle consistent with several different, independent datasets.
