 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principal Investigator will study aspects of the theory of Shimura varieties. These are particular kinds of higher-dimensional surfaces whose rich geometry and arithmetic puts them among the central objects of study in modern mathematics.  The goal is to find new relations between geometrically defined quantities such as volumes and intersection multiplicities, and quantities that come from other branches of mathematics, like representation theory, that have no a priori geometric meaning.  In addition to their importance in pure mathematics, Shimura varieties play an essential role in the Langlands program, which is of increasing interest in theoretical physics, and are important tools for understanding elliptic curves and abelian varieties, which now play a major role in cryptography.   More broadly, the project concerns the theory of numbers and arithmetic geometry. This is an area of research which has applications to cyber security, through cryptography, and to some aspects of coding theory.  \r\n\r\nThe primary goal of the Principal Investigator's research on Shimura varieties is to prove new relations between their geometric invariants and L-functions.  For example, the Principal Investigator will use recent advances in the theory of Borcherds products and integral models to express the arithmetic volumes of Shimura varieties of unitary and orthogonal type as special values of L-functions.  The  Principal Investigator will also prove new examples of generalized Gross-Zagier formulas, for example by expressing the intersection multiplicities of Shimura curves embedded into the Siegel threefold in terms of the central derivative of a Langlands L-function attached to a cuspidal representation of GSp(4).  Similar higher dimensional formulas are also expected.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "The Principal Investigator's research lies in the field of arithmetic geometry, which lies at the intersection of number theory and geometry.  At its core, the theory uses geometric methods to study integer or rational solutions to systems of polynomial equations.  The particular kinds of equations studied by the PI define geometric objects called Shimura varieties. \nThese Shimura varieties have a numerical invariant associated to them, called the arithmetic volume.  It is similar in spirit to the naive notions of length, area, and volume in dimension one, two, and three, but is more subtle.  It is less a measure of size than it is a measure of arithmetic complexity.  It was first noticed in the 1980's that for special one-dimensional Shimura varieties, the family of modular curves, the arithmetic volume could be computed explicitly, and can be expressed in terms of Riemann's zeta function.\nThe PI has found new instances of this phenomenon, in which the Shimura curve is replaced by a higher-dimensional Shimura variety, whose arithmetic volume can be expressed in terms of Riemann's zeta function and its cousins, the L-functions of Dirichlet. The methods used to compute these arithmetic volumes turn out to have other applications.  The PI and his coauthors have extended the methods to compute intersection multiplicities of  smaller Shimura varieties sitting inside of larger ones in a variety of contexts.  \nAspects of these projects formed the basis of the finished doctoral theses of two Ph.D. students at Boston College, and will also form the basis of two more doctoral theses now in progress.  The PI has also organized workshops and special semesters devoted to further understanding this topic, and its relation to other branches of number theory and arithmetic geometry.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/28/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Benjamin V Howard"
