 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies show that students who are not able to see themselves as an engineer at an early age are less likely to pursue engineering careers later in life.  This can be especially true of students who may not have easy access to academic and extracurricular activities, including diverse students from rural and urbans populations. Research has shown that incorporating engineering-related educational games into middle school curricula can help students develop an identity as an engineer. This project focuses on fourth grade students because this is a pivotal age where many students from underrepresented groups opt out of an engineering educational trajectory. This project develops and introduces educational games for fourth grade classrooms that demonstrate engineering concepts. The effect of playing these games, which are co-designed with teachers, will be studied in terms students' sense of engineering and how the way they identify with engineering as a result. The study will collect a variety of data from students about their related educational experiences. The data, including notebook entries, interviews, and focus groups, will help researchers investigate and generalize the efficacy of such games for promoting helping middle school students identify with the potential to pursue a career path in engineering. Descriptions of the educational game experiences, their classroom implementations, and assessments on student engineering identity formation will be shared freely.\r\n\r\nRecent studies show large positive effects of small educational interventions when employing integrative frameworks that are culturally-responsive, chronically-salient and identity-congruent.  Additionally, digital game-based learning has demonstrated significant promise in elementary engineering education.  This project will operationalize the identity-based motivation framework via digital game-based learning experiences aimed at enhancing engineering identity formation of diverse elementary students.  Assessment of students' engineering identity will be made using instruments including the \"Draw an Engineer Test\" and the \"Engineering Identity Development Scale.\" The identity-based motivation framework will inform the interventions, which will include students' creation of engineering characters who will interactively solve basic engineering problems.  The interventions will integrate humanitarian engineering applications of math and science, with lesson plans mapped to the Next Generation Science Standards and aligned with Essential Understandings within Montana's Indian Educational for All Act.  Assessment of students' post-intervention engineering identities will augment analyses of interviews, focus groups and game play artifacts in elucidating intervention features effective in enhancing engineering identity formation.  Data collection and analysis will rely on innovative qualitative methods, including effects matrices and network analyses, to determine the influence of the educational intervention experiences on students' engineering identity.  This mixed-method research will result in a deeper understanding of students' attitudes and dispositions toward engineering, and the features of the intervention design, development and/or experiences that influenced them.  This research will also result in adoptable educational interventions designed to encourage engineering identity formation in a diverse group of students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nOverview:\n\n\nThis NSF-RFE Design and Development project combined the identity based motivation (IBM) framework with digital game based learning (DGBL) experiences to foster inclusive engineering identity formation among diverse elementary students.\n\n\nPartnering with distinct and diverse 4th grade classrooms within urban, rural and Native American reservation settings in Montana, baseline assessment of students engineering identity was made using instruments including the Draw an Engineer Test and the Engineering Identity Development Scale. Students were then introduced to engineering concepts via NSF-funded videos before engaging in IBM-informed DGBL interventions. The interventions were facilitated by a puzzle platform video game, Little Big Planet (LBP), and guided by a credentialed video game developer and project consultant versed in customizing LBP educational experiences for elementary students. The IBM framework informed the LBP/DGBL interventions, which included students creation of engineering avatars who will interactively solved basic engineering problems within user-created environments. The problems integrated prosocial engineering applications of math and science, with lesson plans mapped to the Next Generation Science Standards. The interventions also reinforced the Essential Understandings within Montanas Indian Educational for All Act, a Montana Constitutional article committing state educators to support preservation of distinct American Indian cultural heritages. Assessment of students post-intervention engineering identities augmented analyses of interviews, focus groups and game play artifacts in elucidating intervention features effective in enhancing engineering identity formation. The project also initiated longitudinal assessments aimed at connecting early engineering identity formation to engineering career ambitions.  \n\n\nIntellectual Merit: Novel integration of the IBM framework with DGBL experiences for diverse elementary students offers exciting opportunities to better understand the formation of engineering identity and its intersectionality. Baseline and longitudinal assessments of engineering identity of unique urban, rural and reservation student cohorts were collected using validated instruments. Data collection and analysis relied on innovative qualitative methods to determine the influence of the IBM-guided DGBL experiences on students' engineering identity. Interviews and focus groups with teachers and students were analyzed to understand the relationships that exist between emergent identity-related themes. This resulted in a deeper understanding of students' attitudes and dispositions toward engineering, and the features of the DGBL intervention design, development and/or playing experiences that influenced them. \n\n\nBroader Impacts: IBM has significant implications for educational interventions designed to increase diversity and inclusion within the engineering profession. Transferable IBM-guided DGBL experiences were designed and developed to enhance engineering identify formation and multi-cultural awareness; essentially rebranding engineering to emphasize its prosocial nature. This project involved several elementary teachers and dozens of elementary students; however, its impacts were broadened through dissemination of successful interventions to schools and universities interested in engineering identity formation.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/07/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: PaulEGannon\n"
