 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Fourth International Summer School on Advanced Material Systems (AMS) will be held July 1-7, 2018 in Thessaloniki, Greece. This summer school follows the model established by The International Institute for Multifunctional Materials for Energy Conversion (IIMEC), an NSF-funded International Materials Institute, established at Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station, in partnership with US and international research  collaborators. The aim of the summer school  is to familiarize graduate students with the state of the art in advanced composite and multifunctional materials manufacturing, characterization, testing and micro-mechanics, and computational methods modeling.  This award supports travel for US graduate students to participate in the summer school. The participating graduate students and researchers will be exposed to a high-quality, intensive educational experience in the field of advanced material systems. The format of the meeting will allow ample time for formal and informal scientific discussions, with the aim of building collaborations with participants of different countries, institutions and areas of expertise, and building a long-lasting international network with the students' peers as well as senior scholars.\r\n\r\nThe main objectives of the AMS Summer School are to: (1) establish a communication, knowledge-base, and computational-laboratory grid advancing research in manufacturing, characterization, modeling and testing of advanced and multifunctional materials, providing all participants with global research and international leadership experience, and contributing to the transformation and advancement of education on materials science and engineering to all participants; (2) communicate the knowledge of commercialization and promote the connection between research and industry; and (3) attract participants from different countries and research fields in order to foster interaction in an international academic environment,  promoting scholarship and leadership in advanced material systems\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The major challenge hindering their adoption in applications is the resource-intensive nature of the conventional experimentation procedures commonly used to understand the material?s behavior.

This was accomplished through theoretical and hands-on sessions that disseminated the fundamental knowledge regarding materials processing, characterization and testing, constitutive law modeling, micromechanics, failure mechanics, and homogenization methods in a high-level academic, as well as industrial environment. The newly gained knowledge will be used by participants in their future endeavors to efficiently develop new applications using advanced materials, such as composite, porous, and active (such as shape memory alloys, piezoelectric etc.) materials exhibiting targeted properties, by effectively using advanced characterization, modeling, and manufacturing procedures.

During each day of the summer school, the participants were engaged in a combination of activities, covering a wide spectrum of education and knowledge, but also relaxation, socialization, and cultural experience in a city with a history of over 2,300 years that maintains a vibrant character and youthful energy with its over 150,000 students in a melting pot of cultures. A theoretical learning session in the morning, was followed by hands-on materials testing and computer modeling labs in the afternoon. The participants also visited and exchanged ideas with experts from two industrial sites that globally deliver products and services. The industrial visit to Alumil-CFT (composites manufacturer) and the full day training at BETA CAE Systems? on their software packages offered a unique experience to the participants regarding the operation and work environment of two well-established companies related to manufacturing and engineering software development processes. Furthermore, the participants had the opportunity to obtain insights regarding the skills required for a successful career in an industrial environment and to explore research collaborative efforts among industrial and academic partners.
