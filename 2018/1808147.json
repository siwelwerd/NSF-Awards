 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the advent of advanced wireless communications the spectrum at lower frequencies are congested. To overcome this congestion an alternative approach is to develop compact and high efficient communication system using passive devices operating in millimeter-wave frequency band. The materials used at these frequencies are Ba- and Sr hexaferrites. The anisotropy of these ferrites exhibit strong ferromagnetic resonance up to 60 GHz (5 mm in wavelength). The oxygen molecule in the atmosphere exhibit a strong resonance absorption of electromagnetic waves at 60 GHz. Thus makes it a very attractive frequency band for shorter distance communication system. \r\nIn current proposal, the use of self-biased hexagonal ferrite devices is suggested in millimeter wave frequencies. This led to shift from silicon, narrowband gap substrate technology to GaN, wideband gap substrate technology for efficient performance of communication system. The Ba- and Sr- ferrite nano size powders are now readily available from a number of manufacturers.  Recently it has been found that nano-sized hexagonal ferrite powders can be mixed with commercially available photoresist and then sprayed as a layer on to the GaN substrate. It is proposed to use one ultrasonic generator with two ultrasonic spray nozzles with compressed air shaper for spraying. The next step turns out to be curing of the film in an oven up to 600 degrees centigrade for narrowing of the ferromagnetic resonance peak. It also leads to doubling of the resonance intensity. The comprehensive characterization study of deposited nano-ferrite film has been performed by employing a custom made quasi-optical millimeter wave spectrometer, scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction analysis and vibrating sample magnetometer.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a communication system, one would need a high efficient power amplifier, a low noise amplifier and a nano-ferrite circulator. However, the process to manufacture high quality nano-ferrite material with good grain size offer significant challenges. One of the problem is how to deposit self-bias hexagonal ferrite thin film with both good quality and acceptable cost has not been solved yet. Currently available wafers for MMIC design are about 100 mm in diameter with a thickness of about 100m. Typical thicknesses are 98 m of SiC and 2 m of GaN. The development of high purity GaN thick film film on SiC turns out to be big challenge in the near future. A thin film of highly pure wide bandgap semiconductor such as Aluminum Nitride can also be deposited on SiC. It is a new technology and it will be explored during the course of the proposed research period. Originally this work was explored on IBM silicon CMOS substrates. The lower temperature operation restricted the deposition of nano ferrite Ba- ferrite film to porosity and uneven flatness. The work with silicon CMOS substrate will also be continued.  The collaborative partnership with QORVO has led to the use of GaN on SiC wafers routinely. The ultimate goal is to have Ba-ferrite circulator, power amplifier and low noise amplifier build on a single GaN on SiC wafer for operation at 60 GHz.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
