 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fluids often exhibit cyclical motion, either due to external periodic forces (e.g., lunar tides) or due to internal forces that naturally arise through interaction with the environment (e.g., air buffeting through a slightly opened car window or the eddies that develop from a river current interacting with a bridge pillar).  The control of such flows is of great interest since in many cases small changes in a flow profile can produce either dramatic benefits or catastrophic costs.  Stabilizing and tuning cyclic flow patterns to a given frequency can be useful in the design of wind farms and wave energy converters, for example, while in other circumstances eliminating oscillatory motion altogether may help reduce fatigue loads placed on critical support structures.  This project specifically addresses the modeling and control of oscillatory phenomena through the development of new mathematical algorithms for simulation and control that integrate underlying periodic system behavior into the core modeling framework, thus promising both improved accuracy and reduced computational costs.  This research will result in improved understanding of mathematical models of systems with periodic behavior as well as the development of new simulation and modeling tools, which will have an immediate bearing on a wide range of applications found in biology (e.g., circulatory and respiratory systems) and energy (e.g., wind turbines and power grid dynamics).\r\n\r\nSimulation and control of periodic flow structures require methods specialized to the task. The Floquet transformation has long been a theoretical tool for such problems, allowing for a change in system representation that effectively shifts the periodic time dependence out of the internal dynamics into the input/output ports. Only recently has it been practical to use this approach for small to medium scale problems.  The initial focus of this research will be on the development of scalable, numerically effective algorithms for large-scale Floquet transformations, enabling the high-fidelity reduced models for time-varying periodic flow dynamics. By combining operator splitting approaches with optimal model reduction methods for quadratic systems, new capabilities for input-independent model reduction for nonlinear dynamics will be developed and analyzed.  The model reduction framework that is proposed here offers improved numerical efficiency and greater accuracy at modest cost. Fundamental to this approach will be the integration of an accurate representation of dynamics into reduced-order models, better respecting the properties of the underlying optimal control problem.  Robust computational tools aiding the simulation and modeling of large-scale oscillatory dynamics will be developed and provided to the science and engineering community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Indeed, in many cases small changes in a flow profile can produce either dramatic benefits or catastrophic costs in important application settings such as increasing lift and reducing drag on aerodynamic bodies, the enhancement or avoidance of mixing of reactive fluids, and the suppression of flow-related noise.   Our focus has been on the analysis and development of a numerical framework for model reduction of time-periodic and nonlinear problems arising in flow control.   The algorithms and software developed through the course of this project allow for easy implementation of sophisticated control methods for important flow control problems.   The model reduction framework developed in this project leads to input-independent high-fidelity reduced-order models that are typically much more robust than commonly used trajectory-based techniques.  \n\nThe principal goal related to this focus has been to develop new algorithms for control of nonlinear systems, especially those that exhibit time-periodic solutions.  One major accomplishment is the development of an efficient computational algorithm for quadratic-in-state and quadratic-in-cost regulator problems. We can now compute low degree feedback for systems with hundreds of states or higher degree feedback for highly reduced models in less than an hour on a laptop. We have extended our computational framework for computing polynomial approximations to nonlinear optimal feedback control problems to models with bilinear terms. Our tests show that this approach has superior performance over traditional linearization-based methods. We performed a study on finite dimensional models resulting from discretizations of nonlinear partial differential equations and discovered that using cubic or quintic feedback terms in the feedback law in some cases was able to stabilize an equilibrium solution where an optimal linear feedback law was insufficient.  Moreover, for cases where the linear model was linearly stabilizable, the cubic feedback law showed up to a 36% reduction in the quadratic regulator control cost when applied in simulations of those equations.  The software used for these accomplishments is published at https://github.com/jborggaard/QQR.\n\nIn a distinct but related direction, it is often recognized that linearization of flow problems can lead to unstable dynamical systems, calling then for numerically robust techniques for the model reduction of unstable systems. We have developed a new error measure, the H2-gap measure, which introduces a new framework for the computationally efficient reduction of unstable dynamics.\n\nWe have extended the coprime factorization framework from linear to nonlinear dynamical systems, specifically to bilinear dynamical systems.  Using this newly developed coprime framework, we have extended structure-preserving interpolatory model reduction to an important class of nonlinear systems, namely bilinear dynamical systems. This allows retaining important structural properties arising in bilinear dynamical systems.   In particular, for bilinear systems with parametric structure, we have developed a parametric interpolatory model reduction framework tailored for such dynamical systems.   We have also developed a AAA-framework for dynamical systems with quadratic outputs. This framework built upon on our earlier analysis which developed a barycentric form for quadratic-output systems. An efficient numerical algorithm has been produced that allows data-driven modeling of systems with quadratic outputs.\n\n \n\n\nSignificantly, we have established data-driven modeling for balanced truncation, which has long been one of the gold-standard approaches for standard (intrusive) model reduction of linear dynamical systems, but had defied attempts to make the method fully nonintrusive. We have succeeded in accomplishing this and shown how to construct balanced reduced models using only input-output data without access to internal state-space dynamics. \n\nWe have completed an analysis and developed a computational framework for incorporating operator splitting in the model reduction setting. The analysis shows how the error due to operator splitting contributes to overall model reduction error.  We have established a theoretical framework showing how operator splitting error and model reduction error can be incorporated into a truncation error analysis in the numerical solution of nonlinear nonlinear ordinary differential equations.  We also developed a Wavelet-DMD formulation which uses the Wavelet Transform in the setting of Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition to learn nonlinear dynamics from partial state observations.  \n\nWe have also established a framework for partial Floquet transformation built upon a rational Krylov-Arnoldi decomposition.  This allows for the representation of linear time-periodic dynamics in terms of reduced order linear time invariant systems.   \n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/27/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Serkan Gugercin"
