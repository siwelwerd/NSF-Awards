 "awd_abstract_narration": "Strengthening middle school mathematics education is as urgent as any challenge facing STEM education in the United States. Ratios and proportional relationships are a critical foundation for mathematics and science, yet they pose perennial challenges for students and teachers. Investigating Proportional Relationships from Two Perspectives (InPReP2) will examine how future teachers develop understandings of proportional relationships in mathematics courses they take as part of their preparation programs. The project will collect data in teacher preparation courses and through interviews during which future teachers solve problems about proportional relationships. The courses and interviews will be based on a potentially transformative approach to ratio and proportional relationships, which has been overlooked by past research. The project will also conduct a study comparing how preservice middle grades and secondary grades mathematics teachers at the University of Georgia (UGA) and Kennesaw State University (KSU) reason about proportional relationships. Discoveries about what is easier and what is harder for future teachers to learn will be used to identify key targets for instruction that better prepare future teachers to help their students with critical, yet difficult, middle grades mathematics. \r\n\r\nPast research suggests teachers' difficulties with proportional relationships, covariation, and multiplicative relationships are likely to have roots deep in the multiplicative conceptual field, yet this same research has not examined those roots directly. InPReP2 will examine how preservice middle school teachers' capacities to reason about multiplication and division in terms of quantities support and constrain their facility with proportional relationships. InPReP2 will also investigate proportional relationships based on two complementary perspectives, one that makes covariation visually explicit with double number lines and one that makes multiplicative relationships between quantities visually explicit with strip diagrams. The central hypothesis for InPReP2 is that the two perspectives may facilitate both key features of proportional relationships and open new pathways that make subsequent topics more accessible. InPReP2 will investigate methods that coordinate detailed case studies with recent advances surveying multiplicative reasoning in large, national samples. InPReP2 will also examine in both clinical and experimental settings how different initial strengths and weaknesses with multiplicative reasoning affect how future teachers make sense of the two perspectives on proportions and applications. InPReP2 results about multiplicative reasoning will inform improved teacher education and professional development content courses that prepare teachers across the nation for standards that emphasize sense making with quantities. Teachers with an understanding of proportional relationships in terms of quantities will be better prepared to support their students' reasoning about co-variation and multiplicative relationships, which is fundamental to college readiness. InPReP2 methods will advance STEM education research by investigating how Diagnostic Classification Models, in combination with measures of reasoning, can be used to coordinate surveys of large samples with detailed case-studies of small samples. Such methods have broad implications for generating generalizable findings about learning in complex, multi-faceted domains. InPReP2 will integrate training of new mathematics education researchers and teacher educators into all aspects of the project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Such difficulties are of critical concern for mathematics education in the United States for several reasons. First, such topics form a critical swathe of school mathematics that lays the foundation for mathematics used in high school and college courses across STEM disciplines. Second, U.S. students and their teachers in middle grades, the years when many topics related to multiplication are introduced, perform poorly with respect to their counterparts in international comparison studies. Third, various efforts to strengthen mathematics education in the United States (e.g., the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics) have demanded from both students and teachers deeper and more conceptual understandings of school mathematics that go beyond accurate computation.</p>\n<p>The InPReP2 project responded to the critical need outlined above by conducting research in the context of teaching mathematics to cohorts of future middle and secondary grades mathematics teachers over a 4-year period. We conjectured that helping future teachers better understand topics related to multiplication would require disrupting conventional meanings for multiplication (e.g., repeated addition) and for fractions (e.g., 3 out of 4) because such meanings obscure connections important for understanding topics related to multiplication. We replaced conventional meanings for multiplication and for fractions referred to above with meanings grounded in measurement; and, we relied on length-based drawings (e.g., number lines and strip diagrams) to reason about measurement. To illustrate connections between whole-number multiplication and measurement, consider a volume of milk (that happens to be 1 gallon). We could measure that volume in terms of two different units, say cups and pints. Because 8 pints make 1 gallon and 2 cups make 1 pint, we could write the equation below that coordinates measuring the gallon both in pints (8) and in cups (16). Notice that each number in the equation below is accompanied by a question about measurement (i.e., How many of these make that?)</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"19\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"120\" valign=\"top\">\n<p><em>8</em></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"66\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>x</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"154\" valign=\"top\">\n<p><em>2</em></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"56\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>=</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"156\" valign=\"top\">\n<p><em>16</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"139\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>How many pints make   1 gallon?</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"66\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"154\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>How many cups make   1 pint?</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"56\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"156\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>How many cups make   1 gallon?</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr height=\"0\">\n<td width=\"14\"><br /></td>\n<td width=\"90\"><br /></td>\n<td width=\"50\"><br /></td>\n<td width=\"115\"><br /></td>\n<td width=\"42\"><br /></td>\n<td width=\"117\"><br /></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This measurement meaning for multiplication can be extended to division, understood as multiplication with an unknown factor, and to multiplication and division with fractions. The same meaning can also be extended to reason about proportional relationships and linear functions. Figures 1 and 2 show an innovative pathway from proportional relationships into linear functions. Figure 1 shows two parallel strips that could be used to represent blue and red paint mixed in a 3-to-4 ratio. There are always 3 parts of blue paint and 4 parts of red paint. Also, there are always the same number of liters in each of the 7 parts, but those 7 parts can expand to contain more and more liters. Figure 2 shows the same two strips with the red strip parallel to the <em>x</em>-axis and the blue strip parallel to the <em>y</em>-axis. The fact that there are always 3 blue parts and 4 red parts is a new way to explain why the slope of the line is 3/4: That is the answer to the question how many of the red strips make the blue strip?
