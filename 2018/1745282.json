A primary goal of the project is to promote dialogue and greater understanding about the unique Antarctic ecosystem and the role of humans within that ecosystem.\r\n\r\nScarano will conduct formal and informal discussions with researchers and other individuals working at the station and field camps that she visits. During her time in Antarctica, she will maintain a blog on her author website to log her experiences and share her reflections, photos and poems with the public.  Upon returning home, she will compile her poems into a full-length manuscript which will be submitted to several publishers for national distribution.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
