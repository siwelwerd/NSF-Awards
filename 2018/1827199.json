 "awd_abstract_narration": "Navajo Technical University (NTU) is one of the nation's largest tribal colleges and a leader in delivering academic and research programs for Native Americans.  NTU students have access to a plethora of academic programs including strong programs in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM).  However, NTU and the residents of the Navajo Nation are not well connected to the Internet and to the larger research and education community.  Connectivity limitations, especially at Navajo community centers and at their homes, restrict NTU's ability to collaborate and contribute in the ever-growing integrated global research and education environment.  There is a fundamental lack of Internet connectivity with sufficient bandwidth to successfully participate in the ever-increasing distance or online learning courses/programs. \r\n\r\nThis proposal will increase Wide Area Network connectivity by connecting NTU to the Front Range GigaPoP (FRGP) regional network at much higher network speeds with dedicated bandwidth for NTU research and academic projects.  The proposal addresses distance education challenges by implementing an advanced wireless test bed to deliver NTU distance education courses to Chapter Houses, tribal libraries, and other community anchor locations.  This proposal engages the country's largest tribal university and is a collaboration with New Mexico and Arizona Tribal Colleges and Universities.  It leverages a strong existing regional relationship with the FRGP, and it provides an organizational model for other tribal colleges to adopt a similar technology and associated collaborations.  The proposal emphasizes needs and requirements-gathering meetings, followed by design and training workshops, which will benefit regional Native American community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nNilch Bee Naa Alkaa Go Ohooa Doo Eidii Tii (Using Air (Technology) to Learn and Understand New Things). Award #1827199.\n\n\nNavajo Technical University, Crownpoint NM\n\n\nOutcomes Report\n\n\nApril 2024\n\n\nNavajo Technical University (NTU) in collaboration with the Front Range GigaPoP (FRGP) improved campus science-oriented networks by planning and building a campus and regional science-oriented network, expanded NTUs external connectivity to include Internet2 and FRGP, and demonstrated the need to plan and deploy alternative wireless services to students, faculty, and researchers in Crownpoint, NM. NTU completed all project proposed outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nilch Bee Naa Alkaa Go Ohooa Doo Eidii Tii (Using Air (Technology) to Learn and Understand New Things) project delivered new capacities and capabilities to one of the largest and most technologically advanced tribal college or university (TCU) primarily during the COVID-19 pandemic. The improved campus network enables high speed data exchange for the advanced manufacturing and science / computer science programs over an upgraded network through Albuquerque, NM to Denver, CO. The new service enables NTU to add other TCUs and Navajo Nation researchers to collaborate and to engage, collaborate, and accomplish their science initiatives through regional or national collaboration. The new wireless system enables NTU to close the digital divide and support science programs in the community by connecting instruments and other systems in cooperation with local telecommunications collaborators. NTU completed the project during the pandemic when significant supply chain delays and disruptions, Navajo Nation-imposed health regulations meant to slow or reduce the virus impact on a vulnerable community, and the forced isolation of technical and project staff due to the imposition of tribal, local, state, and federal travel restrictions, all impeded project implementation. The delays in equipment delivery required NTU to adapt solutions to available equipment with the support of highly modified vendor technical support operations. The implementation of science-driven networks on tribal lands was further complicated by the influx of federal broadband programs where new right of way, supply chain, reconciliation of federal FCC spectrum requirements, and Navajo Nation project prioritization impeded or distracted the deployment of services and systems. These new and novel (i.e., responses to COVID-19) barriers impeded the project.\n\n\n\n\n\nNTU, with the assistance of FRGP, established a cooperative to educate, integrate, and facilitate tribal colleges and universities for active participation and engagement in regional and national networking. The cooperative includes participation from FRGP, Northern Arizona University (Flagstaff, AZ), Dine College (Tsaile, AZ), Tohono Oodham Community College (Sells, AZ), and A:shiwi College (Zuni, NM). By improving access to national Research and Education (R&E) resources for NTU faculty, researchers, and students, new and innovative use of collaborations expanded campus participation in the NSF Research Engines program (with Arizona State University) and the advanced manufacturing program. The project enabled NTU to contribute to the design and implementation of campus networking for small institutions in support of science and education-driven outcomes and to assist other TCUs to plan and implement a campus/external network design that is sustainable, resilient, and scalable for NTUs needs and requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy improving cyberinfrastructure on the Navajo Nation, NTU continues to expand access to existing and future NSF services and systems, and it enabled new intra-tribal collaboration between other TCUs and the Arizona and New Mexico tribal communities. NTU continues to introduce innovative services to improve tribal education and to advance research on the Navajo Nation. The Using Air cyberinfrastructure project established a new technical and systems foundation for NTU and other TCUs to participate and cooperate with other small or regional institutions, gain access to NSF resources and science services, and improve external connectivity on the Navajo Nation for students, faculty, and researchers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/03/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JasonKArviso\n"
