 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This CAREER project aims to create a completely new class of ceramic oxide materials with advanced charge storage capabilities, opening a door to next-generation batteries with higher energy density, faster charging and a much longer lifetime. These new materials are two-dimensional (2D) oxide-based structures that are built by alternating oxide layers and electronically conductive layers, such as graphene-based compounds or transition metal carbides (MXenes). The resulting structures exhibit characteristics important for battery electrodes: space that allows ion movement, and conductive layers that enable fast transport of electrons. Combining layered metal oxides and carbon-based compounds in high quality layer-by-layer architecture offers an opportunity to discover and investigate new phenomena occurring at interfaces. This fundamental understanding is important for the creation of batteries with improved energy and power capabilities. The materials and methods developed in this work are relevant to a wider range of applications, including energy storage, electrochromics (responsible for reversible changes of colour), sensing, actuation (or control of movement), and water treatment. The interdisciplinary nature of this project attracts diverse undergraduate and graduate students to research. The project integrates synthesis and properties of 2D structures into the engineering curriculum at the PI's institution and enriches outreach programs through the creation of educational videos on synthesis and electrochemical properties of materials. A variation on the gameshow Family Feud focused on electrochemistry is being used to attract more students to STEM fields.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: This research is focused on understanding how face-to-face heterostructured interfaces can be created and controlled in layered materials. The aim is to produce 2D oxide-based heterostructures with high electron and ion transport leading to improved energy storage capabilities in Li-ion, Na-ion and K-ion batteries. Layered transition metal oxides show high redox activity in intercalation reactions and relatively high working potentials, making them especially attractive for use as cathodes in energy storage devices. However, the low electronic conductivity of most oxides limits their performance. To overcome this limitation, layered oxides are combined in unique heterostructured architectures with electronically conductive 2D compounds by controllably alternating atomically thick layers of different individual materials. The 2D heterostructure electrodes are constructed using a sol-gel assisted transition metal oxide synthesis process through (1) chemical pre-intercalation of organic molecules followed by pyrolysis, or (2) addition of solid nanoflakes of conducting phases (graphene or MXene) during the sol-gel process. The improved understanding of the transport of ions and electrons and charge storage mechanisms in layered heterostructured materials achieved in this work is expected to lead to better electrodes and open exciting new research directions. The tailored 2D heterointerfaces make it possible to design new ceramic materials with tunable structures and compositions that exhibit high ion storage capability, rapid electron and ion transport, and enhanced electrochemical stability.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Development of the synthesis approach leading to formation of carbon islands in the interlayer region of layered oxide structures subsequently resulting in enhanced electrochemical stability and superior rate capability attributed to the improved intraparticle electron transport. The approach consists in chemical preintercalation of low concentration organic molecules, such as dopamine, into the layered oxide structure followed by hydrothermal treatment. Our results show that thus obtained &delta;-C<sub>x</sub>V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>&middot;<em>n</em>H<sub>2</sub>O significantly outperforms carbon-free parent bilayered vanadium oxide (&delta;-C<sub>x</sub>V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>&middot;<em>n</em>H<sub>2</sub>O) when cycled in Li-ion cells. The developed approach is versatile and can be applied to other transition metal oxide being synthesized via sol-gel process and a wide library of organic molecules serving as carbon precursor.</p>\n<p>2. Demonstration that increase in organic molecule concentration in the chemical preintercalation synthesis leads to not only increased amount of forming carbon, but also oxide phase transformation caused by transition metal reduction. Due to the occurring phase transformation, the resulting products represent nanocomposites with tight oxide-carbon heterointerface. We showed that at increasing dopamine concentrations preintercalated into bilayered vanadium oxides, H<sub>2</sub>V<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>/C, VO<sub>2</sub>/C and V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/C nanocomposites with excellent charge storage properties form. The insights provided by this investigation open up the possibility of creating new nanocomposite oxide/carbon electrodes for a variety of applications, such as energy storage, sensing, and electrochromic devices.</p>\n<p>3. First transformation of V2CT<em>x</em> MXene nanoflakes into chemically preintercalated (CP) bilayered vanadium oxides and demonstration of superior charge storge behavior of MXene-derived CP BVOs in Li-on cells. Uniquely, MXene-derived CP BVOs exhibit nanoflower-like morphology in which nanoflowers are composed by 2D nanoflakes (&ldquo;petals&rdquo;). The record high for BVO polymorphs electrochemical stability and rate capability demonstrated by MXene-derived CP BVOs is attributed to morphological stabilization. While our study focused on BVOs, the developed synthesis route can be used with other MXenes enabling the production of oxides with different chemistries or mixed oxides. Furthermore, it is possible for new metastable phases with enhanced functionalities that cannot be synthesized using traditional routes to be produced by utilizing MXenes as precursors.</p>\n<p>4. For the first time achieved exfoliation of bilayered vanadium oxide (BVO) leading to the formation of nanoflakes that can be assembled into free-standing films through, for example, vacuum filtration. BVO nanoflakes were produced by probe sonication of the precursor powder in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and water. We discovered that the yield and morphology of the BVO nanoflakes depend on the nature of the solvent used in exfoliation. The significance of this discovery lies in that the produced BVO nanoflakes can be used in layer-by-layer film assembly approaches to create advanced electrode architectures with improved charge storage properties, as it was later demonstrated in this project via cation-driven assembly process.</p>\n<p>5. Development of the versatile approach for the realization of two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures via cation-driven assembly of chemically dissimilar nanoflakes. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach using bilayered vanadium oxide (BVO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanoflakes. The approach consists in addition of highly concentrated salt to the vigorously stirred mixed suspension of BVO and GO nanoflakes. Due to the electrostatic interaction between positively charged Li<sup>+</sup> ions and negatively charged nanoflakes, the 2D heterostructure particles assemble and flocculate from the solution. Our work presents the first demonstration of the success of this approach for the formation of BVO-based 2D heterostructures. The enhanced electrochemical stability and rate capability of the 2D BVO/rGO heterostructure electrodes as compared to the electrodes with the same composition obtained via physical mixing of BVO and rGO nanoflakes is attributed to the encapsulation effect, which consists in structural stabilization of BVO structure through 2D heterointerface formation and suppressed dissolution of BVO in electrolyte during cycling. Additionally, we observed a new phenomenon at the heterointerface &ndash; formation of V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, which likely plays a role in electrochemical stabilization of 2D BVO/rGO heterostructures. The developed methodology can be used to create chemically versatile 2D heterostructures composed of nanoflakes with different chemical compositions and opens horizons to discovering new phenomena at the heterointerface and enhanced functionalities for energy storage technology and beyond.</p>\n<p>6.
