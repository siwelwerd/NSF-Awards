 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Description\r\nThe resolution of traditional optical microscopes is limited to approximately half the wavelength of light. This Major Research Instrumentation project acquires a state-of-the-art, scanning near-field optical microscope that enables the optical investigation of nanomaterials cooled to liquid-helium temperature and mapping of chemical composition at more than ten times this spatial resolution. The microscope operates by focusing a light source onto a metallized tip and enhancing the local electric field by plasmonic excitation. The microscope detects the backscattered light as a function of position to map the optical properties of the sample. The unique instrument capabilities help to establish the University of Arizona as a regional and national hub for the optical characterization of materials that is broadly accessible to users from throughout the United States. The addition of the microscope provides cutting-edge student training, education, and workforce development opportunities and leads to advances in physics, materials science, photonics, life sciences, and planetary sciences. The instrument is also showcased in an annual workshop in conjunction with the spring Materials Research Society meeting in Phoenix, and used in an annual summer training course on scanning probe microscopy for students and other early-career researchers, many of whom come from underrepresented groups in science and engineering. The scanning near-field optical microscope complements a suite of multiuser systems at the University of Arizona for the characterization of nanomaterials over a large spatial and energy scale.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\nThe scanning near-field optical microscope has several unique features such as the ability to reach temperatures less than 10 K, to perform spatially resolved Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with sub-wavelength resolution, to perform near-field mapping using both visible and near-infrared sources, and to perform tip-enhanced photoluminescence measurements. The microscope supports a broad range of research projects, including: (1) excitons and defects in atomically thin materials; (2) plasmonics in carbon nanotubes; (3) degradation processes in organic semiconductors; (4) magneto-optical polymers for magnetic field imaging; (5) nanoparticles for drug delivery; and (6) the composition of meteorites. For all of these projects, the ability to probe the optical response of the materials at the sub-wavelength scale is essential to advance knowledge for materials research and development, and to explore new applications that benefit the society.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "This project funded the acquisition of a cryogenic scanning near-field optical microscope (SNOM) at the University of Arizona (UA) to enable optical investigations of materials at ultrahigh spatial resolution (10 nm) and temperatures from &lt;10 K to room temperature. The instrument is available to users through the W.M. Keck Center for Nano-Scale Imaging.  The new SNOM is coupled to a wide range of laser excitations spanning the visible and mid-infrared wavelength ranges and includes spatially resolved Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (nano-FTIR) capabilities to map chemical composition.  In addition, the SNOM has the cutting-edge capability to perform measurements at cryogenic temperatures which is not available with any instrument available in a user facility in the United States.\nThe acquisition of the SNOM is significantly impacting the UA and the Southwest region's capabilities to perform materials-based research in a wide variety of physical and life sciences areas.  This ranges from understanding the optical properties of atomically thin materials to studying the chemical composition of meteorites.  The SNOM is enhancing the research training of a large number of undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral researchers through their use of the instrument. \nThis project required the design of a new microscope that could operate at cryogenic temperatures while still providing interferometric detection of optical signals.  This was a significant accomplishment as it required nanometer scale stability of the entire instrument and took the majority of the project time to achieve.  Therefore, there are only preliminary research outputs from the instrument so far but it has already demonstrated the ability to acquire images at temperatures, wavelengths and spatial resolution that no other instrument can provide.  Therefore, we soon expect exciting results on a wide variety of materials.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/06/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian J Leroy"
