 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award advances the national health by supporting research that will improve trauma care network design.  Trauma is a leading cause  of death in younger populations.  Trauma care networks include trauma centers, staffed and equipped round the clock to treat the most severely injured cases, community hospitals, equipped to stabilize and transport patients to appropriate trauma centers, and air/ground transport services.  The trauma care network should ensure that severely injured patients receive the right care in the right amount of time, but maldistribution of trauma care facilities can result in undertreatment of severely injured patients as well as expensive overtreatment of less-severely injured patients.  This project will facilitate coordinated network design between state agencies and hospital networks, two key stakeholders in the trauma care system. It will enable trauma policy makers to quantitatively benchmark trauma care regionally and nationally in terms of triage errors and costs.  The research team will collaborate with state officials, hospitals, and emergency care providers to validate the network optimization methods.  The award will support graduate student research and provide experiential learning opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students in operations research related to healthcare policy and management.  Research findings will be widely distributed to both the academic and practitioner communities. \r\n\r\nInnovative optimization methods to coordinate the bilevel decision making process for trauma center location are developed in this project.  The research frames the trauma network design problem as a bilevel biobjective optimization problem to capture the hierarchical interaction between the upper level (regional authority) decisions involving subsidy allocation to improve social wellbeing and minimize public spending, and lower level (hospital networks) decisions involving upgrade or downgrade to maximize revenue. Novel techniques for cross-decomposition to bound the combinatorial lower level problem and adaptive scalarization to approximate the entire Pareto set of nonlinear nonconvex multiobjective bilevel programs will enable efficient problem solution. Robustness will be evaluated in response to spatial variations in on-scene decisions, and temporal deviations in projected trauma demand and transport resource availability. New surrogate modeling-based algorithms will help solve the resultant maximal parameter subspace identification problem. Data from two states will be used to validate the approach.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It continues to be the #1 cause of death, disability, and morbidity for individuals aged 44 and under in the <strong>U.S.</strong> (#3 across all ages) with almost 200,000 deaths. The corresponding economic burden is over $4.2 trillion annually. In response to this mortality and economic burden, many state agencies have established integrated and coordinated trauma care system. However, the remaining challenge involves trauma network redesign under the potential formation of a public-private partnership. In the hierarchical decision framework resulted from the public-private partnership, the government, takes the lead and determines the subsidy on designating each multi-hospital health system in the geographic area of interest. They aim to balance between the expenses of providing the subsidies with the savings from reducing system-wide pre-hospital care disutility (e.g., mistriage of trauma patients). In response to the government&rsquo;s subsidies, each multi-hospital health system decides how to re-designate their non-trauma or low-level trauma centers (NT/LLTCs) and their high-specialized trauma centers (HLTCs). They aim to balance between the revenue gain from upgrading their NT/LLTCs and the revenue loss from downgrading their HLTCs. Instead of addressing a single stakeholder&rsquo;s concerns, we seek a compromising solution for the government with each health system and between the health systems.</p>\n<p>The central theme of this project is to develop location optimization models and numerical optimization techniques to help redesign the trauma care network of any arbitrary geographic area. In addition, we are interested in evaluating the robustness of the network redesign in response to spatial-temporal variations on trauma incidence, EMS availability, and on-scene triage decision-making. Important pre-requisite questions include 1) how assessment-related mistriages during the on-scene injury assessment phase (an operational decision) impact the network of trauma centers (a strategic decision); and 2) what the impact is of not accounting inherent assessment-related mistriages associated with various injury assessment guidelines and statistical models while designing the trauma network. A more detailed follow-up question is how substantial the effects of assessment-related mistriages in the group of moderate injuries are compared to the group of severe injuries on patient safety.</p>\n<p>Under equal and synergetic partnership, the two academic sides of this project worked extremely well. The Purdue team sets its focus on develop bilevel integer programming models and efficient global optimization algorithms for the subsidized location optimization problem. The Wright State University first and then University of Louisville team sets its focus on the above prerequisite questions. They also extended their work to the standard location optimization problem (i.e., lower-level health system question in the bilevel programming framework) with a given subsidy. To maximize the practical relevance of research deliverables, the two teams together develop a GIS-based analysis platform for the trauma network redesign through our collaboration with the Indiana State Department of Health.</p>\n<p>More specifically on the Purdue side, we conduct the corresponding research on bilevel programming with an integer lower-level program. In addition, we expand our research scope to 1) investigating generically alternative formulations of the subsidized discrete facility location optimization problem with multiple competing service organizations, each of which is composed of multiple-class service providers; (2) developing efficient solution methods for one-leader multi-follower bilevel mixed-integer programs; (3) studying various aspects for accelerating community integration of drone technology in EMS operations with focus on on-demand resource management. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With the support from this grant, I led the efforts to prepare 4 referee-reviewed journal manuscripts and 2 referee-reviewed conference proceedings paper (one of which is by invitation) and publish them. These manuscripts are resulted from work directly related to the proposed research. I also led the efforts to publish 7 referee-reviewed journal manuscripts, which are indirect result of the proposed research. At the same time, I participated in the publication of 2 referee-reviewed journal manuscripts with work primarily conducted on the USF PI Parikh&rsquo;s side. The two sides continue to work together on several working papers. Meanwhile, I, my UL colleagues, and the students on both sides gave many research presentations at INFORMS and IISE conferences.
