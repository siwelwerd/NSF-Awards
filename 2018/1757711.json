 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will support the renewal of an REU site at Washington State University that will educate early researchers in atmospheric chemistry, air quality and climate change. Understanding complex atmospheric chemical processes requires simultaneous measurements from numerous instruments, and sophisticated numerical models to bring the data together into a coherent scientific product. New to this REU site is the addition of 'Data Carpentry' components of training. Well established training sessions teach researchers best practices for data-driven research, which is essential for today's researchers employing large datasets (i.e. high frequency time series, remote sensing products, or complex modeling inputs/outputs). This REU site will recruit ten students each summer, over the next 5 years, targeting underrepresented communities in the Pacific Northwest as well as local community colleges. Workshops during the 9.5-week program, will train students in atmospheric chemistry, measurement and modeling techniques, data interpretation, and scientific communication. In parallel with these workshops, students will be trained on the specific research tools required for their individual research projects with faculty and graduate student mentors. The students will showcase their research during a final campus wide poster session for all summer researchers.\r\n\r\nThis REU site will allow participants to explore research on topics such as research foci include: 1) biogenic emissions and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation from forested sites, 2) impacts from natural and prescribed forest and agricultural fires, 3)nitrogen and carbon cycling from agricultural and natural ecosystems, 4) Smart Cities, 5) air quality forecasting and the impacts of climate change on future air quality, and 6) in situ and remote sensing of urban and regional atmospheric chemistry.   The overarching goals of this REU site are to 1) help students develop technical expertise, 2) engage students in authentic research, 3) help students understand the broader context of their research, 4) recruit a diverse cohort of students, 5) facilitate formation of productive and meaningful social interactions with faculty, graduate students, and fellow REU participants, 6) develop positive views about STEM by participants, 7) develop written and oral communication skills, and 8) provide opportunities for graduate school and professional development of participants.  The program elements and activities of the REU site are mapped to the 8 goals demonstrating how each program element contributes to the overarching goals.  Additionally, the evaluation plan is well designed to specifically evaluate the progress on the site goals.  This site will also explore participation by students that are place-bound, which if successful will open up a new model for broader participation in REU opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
