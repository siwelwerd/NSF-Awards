 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a four day 2018 international conference titled \"IISA 2018: From Data to Knowledge, Working for a Better World\"  which will take place at the University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, from May 17 - May 20, 2018. This conference will bring together statisticians from diverse areas of statistics/biostatistics, probability and data science in a collaborative setting to discuss and foster the latest developments of statistical theory, methods and tools for making accurate inference from complex and noisy data sources. The grant funding will be used to cover partial costs of a number of doctoral students and young researchers who will present their research at this conference. \r\n\r\nThe theme of the conference is to discuss and foster the cutting-edge developments of statistical theory, methods and tools for making accurate inference from complex and noisy data sources. Plenary speakers for this conference include Montserrat Fuentes (Virginia Commonwealth University),  Hira Koul (Michigan State University),  and  Cyrus Mehta (Cytel Inc).  In addition, seven  researchers will be giving Special Invited Talks. A number of junior researchers will be given the opportunity to present in invited sessions. Doctoral students will have an opportunity to give oral presentations on a competitive basic. A student poster competition will also be arranged. For further details, please visit the conference web-site:  http://iisa2018.biostat.ufl.edu/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
