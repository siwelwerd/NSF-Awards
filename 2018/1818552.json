 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the \"Workshop to study wintertime urban atmospheric pollution processes\" to be held in Fairbanks Alaska during 2 days in early to mid-May 2018.  The goals of the workshop are to identify fundamental knowledge gaps in the understanding of atmospheric chemical mechanisms occurring under cold and dark conditions, and to develop strategies for evaluating chemical, microphysical, and dynamical processes under polluted wintertime conditions.  The workshop is expected to result in improved regional modeling for better predictions of urban air quality and design of wintertime air pollution mitigation strategies for urban areas.\r\n\r\nCurrently, limited measurements in regions with persistent sub-freezing temperatures result in regional air quality models that do not properly reflect pollutant transformations.  Scientific questions to be addressed in the workshop include the following: (1) What is the role of secondary chemistry in increasing fine particulate pollution under cold and dark conditions? and (2) What are the key wintertime emission sources, and how do these emissions impact processing of pollution?  This workshop will be held as part of the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC)/International Arctic Science Community (IASC) \"Air Pollution in the Arctic: Climate, Environment, and Societies\" (PACES) project.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nForty-four researchers from nine countries recently gathered at the University of Alaska Fairbanks campus in Fairbanks, Alaska, USA, for the \"Alaskan Layered Pollution And Chemical Analysis\" (ALPACA) workshop. The meeting's purpose was to identify and refine the most critical open questions regarding dark wintertime boundary-layer urban air pollution. \n\nThe workshop arose from the IGAC air Pollution in the Arctic: Climate, Environment, and Societies (PACES) activity, which aims to foster new collaborative research on Arctic air pollution at the international level.  PACES recognizes that a number of Arctic urban areas and villages, Fairbanks included, have poor wintertime air quality. Addressing gaps in our understanding regarding sources and impacts of local Arctic air pollution on societies is a key focus of PACES Working Group 2 (WG2). PACES WG2 seeks to carry out observational studies guided by community concerns, investigations of local air quality in Arctic communities, and feedbacks between economic development, air pollution, and environmental change in the Arctic.\n\nThe three-day meeting began with a charge to write a whitepaper for future studies in this research area.  We then reviewed similar high-latitude wintertime air quality problems, and heard concerns from local stakeholders.  Next, we reviewed past work on Fairbanks air pollution problems and began work in four groups.  The \"Modeling/Boundary Layer\" group considered model representation of processes (chemistry / mixing), boundary layer structure, vertical mixing, coupling of chemistry and mixing.  The \"Oxidation\" group considered sulfur and nitrogen oxidation mechanisms, oxidants, oxidation indicators (volatile organic compounds, etc.).  The \"Aerosol\" subgroup discussed aerosol sources, gas-particle interactions, semi-volatile partitioning and chemistry, particulate pH and phase (ice/liquid).  The \"Health, Ecosystems, and Outreach\" group discussed impacts of pollution on health, deposition of pollutants to ecosystem, impacts on ecosystem, and outreach / feedback to the community.  Discussion leaders presented past ideas on these topics on the first day, and these groups met on the second day to refine open questions and design a study to address the most compelling open questions. Each of the four groups then presented summaries to the whole workshop, and we discussed plans for a future study in Fairbanks in the 2020-2021 timeframe.  Other research efforts, including comparison between \"twin\" Arctic cities (Fairbanks and a European city) that have similar environmental conditions but different urban design and pollution were also discussed. Ideas for such a twin city approach are being explored in collaboration with other international bodies, including the WMO GAW Urban Research Meteorology and Environment (GURME) project and the Pan Eurasian Experiment (PEEX) network.    The third day of the meeting involved site visits to air quality monitoring sites around Fairbanks, a tour of a coal-fired power plant, and tours of the Alaska Center for Unmanned Aircraft Systems Integration (ACUASI) research group.\n\nIntellectual Merits: These discussions highlighted the fact that intense local sources of pollution, such as fine particulate matter from home heating wood smoke, exacerbated by poor dispersion conditions, caused by strong meteorological thermal inversions combined to cause this poor air quality.  It was observed that Fairbanks particulate matter differs chemically from lower latitude wintertime particles, with Fairbanks particles having more organic carbon and less inorganic nitrogen mass than the recently studied wintertime pollution in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.  These differences point to differences in both sources and chemical processing.  The colder and darker conditions of Fairbanks (and other Arctic and sub-Arctic cities) likely affects this different chemical processing.  An important outstanding question regarding Fairbanks pollution is that sulfate is nearly a fifth of the particulate matter, but we do not understand what oxidizes sulfur under these dark (less photochemical) conditions.  Another question is how the cold conditions impact the gas-particle partitioning and growth of particulate matter.  Boundary layer meteorology is also very important for trapping this pollution and isolating chemically different layers.  These topics were summarized in the ALPACA whitepaper, which is available online to the community through the project website.  The direct link to the whitepaper is: https://alpaca.community.uaf.edu/files/2018/11/ALPACA-whitepaper-30Nov2018.pdf.  Also, in preparing for the ALPACA workshop, we completed a manuscript on the effects of local pollution on Arctic communities, which was published Schmale, J., Arnold, S. R., Law, K. S., Thorp, T., Anenberg, S., Simpson, W. R., et al. (2018). Local Arctic air pollution: A neglected but serious problem. Earth's Future, 6, 1385?1412. https://doi.org/10.1029/2018EF000952\n\nBroader Impacts: The workshop participants represented a diverse group of researchers from students through senior researchers, with a focus on involving pre-tenure faculty members and underrepresented groups.  Involvement of this diverse group assisted the process and broadened potential participation in the planned field activity.  Members of the steering committee joined an Air Quality Stakeholder's group in Fairbanks that was tasked with suggesting solutions to the problem and connections made during the ALPACA workshop helped this community planning effort.  Further information on the stakeholder's group is available from http://fnsb.us/transportation/Pages/stakeholders.aspx.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/05/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William R Simpson"
