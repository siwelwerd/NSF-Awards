 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Intelligent Energetic Systems Engineering (INTENSE) REU at New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology (NMIMT, New Mexico Tech) will engage undergraduate students in unique research related to robotics, smart materials, explosives, high-speed fluid dynamics, and shock physics.  There is a distinct need for more US citizens with research experience to fill science and engineering positions across the country, particularly for the Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Energy (DOE), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) complexes and associated industrial bases.  Students involved in this REU will complete individual research and design projects directly related to federally-funded research being performed at NMIMT; building skills, knowledge, and exposure to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines relevant to these national hiring needs.  The research projects will investigate the interdisciplinary engineering and science of intelligent and energetic systems, including specific projects to explore human-robot interactions and feedback, and the complex chemical-thermo-fluid-dynamics of reacting energetic material systems.  Participants will be exposed to cutting edge research facilities at NMIMT and at prominent national facilities through tours of Sandia National Laboratories and Kirtland Air Force Base Space Vehicles and Directed Energy Directorates.  Students will be recruited primarily from Southwestern US institutions with limited undergraduate research opportunities.  INTENSE REU will have focused recruitment of under-represented populations of Hispanic, Native American, and Veteran minorities, supporting NMIMT?s Hispanic Serving Institution status. \r\n\r\nThe INTENSE REU objectives and impacts are to increase interest in STEM research and graduate studies, increase technical knowledge of Intelligent and Energetic Systems, increase research skills, increase exposure to STEM career opportunities, engage students in long-term STEM mentoring relationships, and enhance STEM opportunities for minority and under-represented populations.  Each summer, eight students will participate in a nine-week program conducting research in laboratories with faculty and graduate student mentors, exploring intelligent and energetic systems.  Energetic systems topics including explosives, propulsion, shock physics, and high-rate impacts are taught at extremely few universities nationally, with NMIMT being a recognized national leader in the field. INTENSE REU participants will be exposed to unique research involving intelligent and energetic systems that is being performed through a range of federal funding mechanisms, including support from federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs).  Participants will broaden their engineering ?toolbox? through hands-on research and a series of group Toolbox Development Activities covering topics including: library resources, experiment planning, data analysis, and technical communication.  Students will connect with each other and their faculty and graduate-student mentors through weekly social lunch gatherings and by presenting a three-minute speech and technical poster in an end-of-summer technical conference held at NMIMT.  Mentor training for faculty and graduate students will improve relationships, increase research effectiveness, and provide long-term connections with REU students.  Targeted student recruitment will result in under-represented minority students with no access to research at their undergraduate institutions to be exposed to STEM research of national interest, and thus expanding the diversity of the national workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Intelligent Energetic Systems Engineering (INTENSE) Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site was hosted at New Mexico Tech in summer 2019, 2021, and 2022.  The REU Site hosted 25 undergraduate students across the three summers, with approximately 8 students hosted each summer.  The students were recruited from across the nation, from diverse backgrounds, and from colleges with limited or no research opportunities for undergraduates.  The students that participated included 13 females, 6 Hispanic students, and overall 16 students that identified as part of an underrepresented minority.  The students that participated had backgrounds in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, physics, and other similar fields.  The student academic level ranged from freshmen to seniors with GPAs that ranged from 2.6 to 4.0.  The INTENSE REU was a 9-week program where the students worked with faculty and graduate student mentors on an individual research project.  The research project topics spanned mechanical engineering and included projects on additively manufacturing rocket propellant, designing and prototyping autonomous drones for exploring moons of Jupiter, measurement of brain simulant material response to impact, and high-rate tensile testing of materials in a novel configuration.  Each summer the students worked in faculty research laboratories while also participating in group \"Engineering Toolbox Development Activities\" designed to broaden their general skills in areas of library resources and research methods, experiment planning, graduate school applications, and technical communications.  Students took tours of Sandia National Laboratories, White Sands National Park, the Energetic Materials Research and Testing Center, and the National Museum of Nuclear Science and History to explore career opportunities, cultural sites, and the history of New Mexico.  The student growth through the REU was measured by an external evaluator using surveys and interviews before and after the REU experience.  The students generally observed an increase in interest in STEM knowledge, career interest and opportunities, and graduate school.  The students overwhelmingly felt that the REU experience was useful, challenging, and a satisfying experience.  Individual written comments from students demonstrated that the REU had a very positive impact on their education and in some cases changed their interests and opened doors to other opportunities.  One student wrote \"The INTENSE REU was a game changer for me. Not only did it encourage me to re-engage in research, but the REU made me also want to pursue a graduate education.

Two of the students from the INTENSE REU were awarded prestigious NSF Graduate Research Fellowships (GRFP) to pay for their graduate schooling.  Several other students are planning on attending graduate school in the future to pursue MS and PhD degrees in STEM fields.  Students in the 2019 Cohort participated in K-12 STEM outreach at the NM Science Fiesta.  The INTENSE REU had additional imact on faculty through mentor trainings as part of their participation in the program.  The 2021 REU Cohort included 3 teachers from the local Socorro NM Consolidated School District who were funded through a Research Experience for Teachers (RET) Supplement to participate in research and develop of K-12 curriculum modules to incorporate their research learning.  These teachers developed research related to drones, light ray tracing, and additive manufacturing which were implemented into high school, middle school, and elementary school lessons by the teachers.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/28/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael Hargather"
