 "awd_abstract_narration": "National and personal security have become major concerns as we continue to increase our reliance on technological advancements. The growth of innovation must mirror the expansion of trained professionals. The University of Maryland (UMD), a National Security Agency - Center of Academic Excellence in Research (CAE-R), proposes to lead the challenge of educating the next cyber workforce through the creation of the Advanced Cybersecurity Experience for Students (ACES) Program, the first undergraduate honors program in cybersecurity in the United States. The CyberCorps(R): Scholarship for Service (SFS) program at UMD will provide a unique opportunity for 36 ACES students earn their Bachelor's degree with an ACES Minor in cybersecurity, and prepare them to join the cadre of cybersecurity professionals in the government.\r\n\r\nThe ACES program aims to provide a unique, multidisciplinary education for a diverse group of undergraduate students of all majors. The curriculum will allow students to live together, use embedded, state-of-the-art laboratories, and work collaboratively inside and outside the classroom. In addition to fulfilling rigorous, required coursework in topics such as Cyber Policy, Psychology, and Reverse Engineering, ACES strongly emphasizes experiential learning by providing opportunities for individual and group research projects, as well as academic term and summer internships. In local middle and high schools, students will have an opportunity to work in CyberPatriot teams and participate in CyberSTEM summer camps (day and residential) and cybersecurity awareness workshops. The SFS program will enhance the university's goal of training a workforce with a range of talents, backgrounds, and expertise that can meet the cybersecurity needs of the government.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
