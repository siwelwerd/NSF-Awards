 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project from Purdue University that extends its already existing I-Corps Site for the next phase of expansion of their services that support innovation and entrepreneurship. Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors. \r\n\r\nA renewed Purdue I-Corps Site award enables Purdue to build on their accomplishments from their first three years and maintain momentum while: funding 30+ faculty and student teams annually; increasing the number of national I-Corps teams from the College of Engineering; increasing support for and participation by women entrepreneurs; expanding support for selective undergraduate senior design teams; and increasing engagement with State of Indiana's economic development agencies as well as the regional entrepreneurial ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
