 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) program, this project will support high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need at St. John Fisher College (SJFC). Throughout its five years, this project will fund thirteen scholarships for students who are pursuing bachelor's degrees in biology or chemistry. This project aims to develop a distinctive model for developing mindfulness and growth mindset in addition to creating meaningful connections between STEM students and their communities. Specifically, in partnership with six Rochester-based organizations, this project will develop SJFC's infrastructure for integrating mindfulness/mindset training, community engagement, and research support within and across STEM programs of study. With over 60% of SJFC alumni employed in the greater Rochester area, this project will strengthen SJFC's capacity to increase the number of diverse, well-qualified STEM graduates who can meet workforce needs and contribute to the economic recovery of the Finger Lakes region.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to create a supportive community and deliver targeted programming so that at least 85% of the Scholars persist beyond the first year and graduate in STEM within five years. The interventions that will be implemented include mentoring, academic support, cohort-based activities, learning communities, cognitive reframing, career exploration, community-based research, and internships. Scholars will be supported to develop contemplative practices (mindset and mindfulness) that can increase cognitive capacity and release mental anchors (e.g., fixed mindset; stress) that negatively impact learning. The project's research will advance understanding of mindset training, mindfulness pedagogy, and community-based experiences that are designed to create a supportive internal and external community for students. Through dissemination, the project will contribute to the body of research on interventions addressing risk factors for STEM persistence, including Pell and first-generation status, gateway courses, undeveloped STEM identity, and a fixed mindset.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
