 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evolution equations are basic objects in the sciences, describing how natural phenomena change over time.  For instance, the modeling of a wide class of physical phenomena, such as crystal growth and flame propagation, involves tracking fronts that move with curvature-dependent speed. When a surface evolves with speed that is proportional to the curvature, this results in one of the classic degenerate nonlinear differential equations called the mean curvature flow.  For nonlinear equations like this, it is possible that solutions may develop sharp points and corners, so it is natural to ask \"what is the regularity of solutions?''  Optimal regularity for mean curvature flow was recently proven by the PI and Minicozzi.  The proof weaves together analysis and geometry. It is expected that many of the new ingredients and techniques should lead to many other results for a wide range of equations that the PI will investigate in this project.\r\n\r\nThis project has two parts. The main part concerns geometric evolution equations, like mean curvature flow (MCF) and Ricci flow. It deals with optimal regularity and applications.  The PI has, together with Minicozzi, settled a number of long-standing open problems and conjectures for mean curvature flow and expect that the results and ideas developed will have significant applications also to other flows and plan to pursue them.  Rigidity of prevalent singularities and uniqueness of blow-ups has had a wide range of applications for mean curvature flow from optimal regularity of the level set equation to optimal estimates on the singular set of the flow.  The PI plans on investigating similar conjectures for the Ricci flow.  The second part of the project will deal with other (non-geometric) evolution equations that are motivated by questions in social science and engineering.  One particular focus will be on a natural evolution equation that describes how the opinions of a group of people evolve as they are influenced by each other.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGrowth of solutions to PDEs play an important role in many different areas, we will discuss growth of some classical and basic equations on manifolds.  These include harmonic and caloric functions.  That is, functions that are either solutions to the Laplace equation or the heat equation.  More general eigenfunctions of drift equations play an important role as well.  Drift Laplacians are ubiquitous in many areas, including quantum field theory, stochastic PDE and anywhere the heat equation or Gaussian appears such as functional inequalities, parabolic PDEs, geometric flows, and probability. The drift term arises in two different ways.  One is whenever there is a natural scaling or, more generally, a gradient flow.   A second way it arises is when there is a natural measure, and in that case the drift operator is the canonical self-adjoint second order operator.    There is a long history of studying the growth of solutions to differential equations, inequalities, and systems.   These new growth estimates that we have found have direct application to longstanding open questions.    \n\nAnalysis of non-compact manifolds almost always requires some controlled behavior at infinity.     Without such, one neither can show nor expect strong properties.   On the other hand, such assumptions restrict the possible applications and often too severely.    In a wide range of areas non-compact spaces come with a Gaussian weight and a drift Laplacian.  Eigenfunctions are $L^2$ in the weighted space allowing for extremely rapid growth.  Rapid growth would be disastrous for many applications.    Surprisingly, for very general tensors, manifolds and weights, we will see that one has the same polynomial growth bounds that Laplace and Hermite observed for functions on Euclidean space for the standard Gaussian.  This covers all shrinkers for Ricci and mean curvature flows.    \n\nThese results that we have obtained together with Bill Minicozzi open a door for understanding general non-compact spaces.  They provides an analytic framework for doing nonlinear PDE on Gaussianspaces where previously the Gaussian weight allowed wild growth thatmade it impossible to approximate nonlinear by linear.     They are key to bound the growth of diffeomorphisms of non-compact manifolds and are the key for solving the ``gauge problem''.    Many key problems are defined intrinsically without a canonical coordinate system.  In those problems, the infinite dimensional diffeomorphism group (gauge group) becomes a major issue and dealing with it a major  obstacle.   Ricci flow is such an example.   There are many problems where this degeneracy under diffeomorphisms plays a central role, but most techniques rely on compactness or rapid decay which we do not have in the situations that we look at.     \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/28/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Tobias H Colding"
