 "awd_abstract_narration": "The scientific community has experienced an unprecedented shift in the way\r\nresearch is performed and how discoveries are made. Highly sophisticated experimental instruments are\r\ncreating massive datasets for diverse scientific communities and hold the potential for new insights that\r\nwill have long-lasting impacts on society. However, scientists cannot make effective use of this data if\r\nthey are unable to move, store, and analyze it. This project establishes the Research and Science\r\nEngagement Center (ReSEC) as a collaborative focal point for operational expertise and analysis.\r\nThis project will assist scientists in routinely, reliably, and robustly transferring their data.\r\nReSEC will deliver end-to-end user support and network engineering solutions,\r\nand become a central community hub ready to provide personalized expertise and assistance on an ongoing basis.\r\n\r\nReSEC proposes four primary execution thrusts: 1) a Roadside Assistance center to reactively\r\nrespond to immediate problems with science data transfers; 2) proactive network observation\r\nusing tools such as perfSONAR and NetSage; 3) assistance with design & deployment of campus\r\nnetworking assets such as Science DMZs; and 4) training for campus network administrators.\r\nReSEC will scale operations broadly by relying on Regional Network, Infrastructure and Science Community partners.\r\nReSEC will deliver expertise and assistance on a sustainable, ongoing basis, with a particular emphasis\r\non serving educational institutions with relatively limited local network administrative resources.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
