 "awd_abstract_narration": "Today's desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones all contain multiple core processing units. Many people today also use cloud computing services for online shopping, sharing photos, and other conveniences. Multicore computers and cloud computing services are both examples of parallel and distributed computing. Current computer science (CS) curriculum recommendations require every undergraduate CS student to learn about parallel and distributed computing (PDC). To help students master the complexities of PDC, this project will develop software and curricular materials that combine two strategies for making PDC topics tangible and accessible: inexpensive single-board computers and teaching materials that use sight, sound, and touch. By using these teaching materials to explore PDC topics, CS students will be able to see and hear parallel and distributed computations and touch the hardware performing those computations. The project team will also develop a free, interactive, online PDC textbook and a collection of \"unplugged\" exercises for learning PDC concepts without a computer.\r\n\r\nThe project will develop: 1) visual software and teaching materials that use the investigators' Thread-Safe Graphics Library so students can see parallel computations in real-time; 2) audial software and teaching materials for a new Thread-Safe Audial Library so students can hear abstract PDC concepts and computations; 3) manipulative learning systems constructed with inexpensive multi-core single-board computers so PDC systems are concrete and touchable; 4) \"unplugged\" activities that make PDC algorithms accessible to broad audiences; and 5) a free, interactive PDC textbook that will be deployed through a combination of client-side and cloud-based systems. These materials will be accessible through the CSinParallel.org website, a previously-funded NSF project (Awards 1226172; 1225739; 1225796). Broader impacts will include strengthening and diversifying the U.S. cyber-workforce, improving the PDC skills of CS instructors and students nationwide including those at minority-serving institutions, and diversifying the community of PDC educators through faculty-development workshops and new social-networking features on CSinParallel.org.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Instead, ongoing increases in CPU power require that each CPU chip contain multiple cores (circuits for carrying out computer instructions) per chip. This CPU design strategy is called multicore parallelism.At about the same time, cloud computing arose, in which companies sell services that execute on their own computers, available over the Internet to other companies or individuals. Cloud computing is an example of distributed computing, in which multiple networked computers work together to achieve computational objectives.Our CSinParallel project began in 2009, dedicated to helping computer science (CS) undergraduates everywhere to learn the principles and practices of parallel and distributed computing (PDC), a field that includes multicore parallelism, cloud computing, and other forms of computing where multiple executions occur in parallel on individual and/or multiple networked computers. From the outset, CSinParallel produced modular PDC learning materials that other professors could use, emphasizing hands-on active learning for effectiveness, and offered regional training workshops for professors who may not already know PDC, so they could learn the principles hands-on by working through our materials themselves, then teach those same materials to their students.</p>\n<p>Our theme in this third round of NSF funding is to use engagement of the senses to learn PDC better. A major focus of our project was deploying Raspberry Pi single-board computers in our learning materials. We developed inexpensive (about $125) Raspberry Pi kits for use in courses and our faculty workshops, which connect to a user's laptop to provide user interfaces with a Pi (Fig 1); and we developed <a href=\"https://www.learnpdc.org/RaspberryPiHandout/\">online learning materials that explore multicore (shared memory) parallelism</a> (featuring OpenMP) on the Pi hardware platform. The Pi units use our CSinParallel Pi operating system image, consisting of a standard version of Linux together with our CSinParallel system enhancements and code examples. We also developed the Self-Organizing Cluster (SOC) of Raspberry Pi units (about $250-300 for three Pi nodes), which uses commodity components together with networking and PDC software additions incorporated in our CSinParallel Pi operating system image, in order to quickly create and automatically configure a cluster consisting a network Raspberry Pi units or kits - without prior cluster computing experience on the part of students or faculty (Fig 2); and we developed online learning materials that explore distributed computing (with MPI), with programming in <a href=\"https://www.learnpdc.org/RaspberryPi-mpi/\">C language</a> or <a href=\"https://www.learnpdc.org/RaspberryPi-mpi4py/\">Python</a>. Besides these Raspberry Pi systems, the CSinParallel group also explored visualization and \"hearing\" of PDC algorithms using our <a href=\"https://www.learnpdc.org/TSGLVisualizations/\">TSGL</a> and TSAL tools.We also drafted a free online textbook <a href=\"https://www.learnpdc.org/PDCBeginners2e/\">PDC for Beginners</a> intended as a companion text for CS courses in the first two undergraduate years.
