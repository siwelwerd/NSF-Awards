 "awd_abstract_narration": "What impact do military bases have on the social and economic life for the communities near which they are situated? Some studies have demonstrated that military investments can be critical to sustaining robust economies as well as functional and safe societies. Resources allocated for defense can create employment in military and civilian sectors, lead to scientific and technological innovations, and serve an essential public good by ensuring security at both national and international levels. Less studied is the military's role in developing the local economies and societies adjacent to where they are stationed. This project, which trains a student in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, explores what role the military and civilian communities play in the production of militarized development. Further, it would broaden the participation of groups underrepresented in science, build capacity and scientific infrastructure through international scientific cooperation, and enhance public scientific understanding by broadly disseminating findings to organizations engaged in development practice. \r\n\r\nSertac Sen, under the supervision of Dr. Matthew Gutmann of Brown University will investigate how militarized development is socially produced. The study will take place in Corlu, Turkey, which is an ideal laboratory for examining this question because the military has been playing an important role in the city's social and economic life. Not only has Corlu been home to the Fifth Army Corps of the Turkish military for a long time, but the city has also received additional troops after a failed coup attempt in 2016, as part of the government's plan to transfer military units from large Turkish metropoles to smaller Turkish cities to promote development and national security at the same time. It thus provides us with a critical comparative framework through the inclusion of ground-up examination of militarized development in real time (rather than exclusively looking at locales where military presence have long become an enduring part of civic life). The investigators will assess the reception and impacts of the military's long-standing and recently heightened presence in the city from both civilian and military perspectives. They will do so through participant observation, local archival research, and interviews with various populations, including the city's elites, Turkish and Kurdish working-class populations, active and retired military professionals, civilian defense employees, and local contractors as well as shopkeepers serving the military. Findings from this research will provide insights into the role of the military as a development actor, the state of civil-military relations after politically tumultuous events such as coup attempts, and the political economy of warfare.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\"Militarized Development at the Community Level,\" PI-Matthew Gutmann; Co-PI-Serta&ccedil; Sen, Brown University. Award Number 1823701.\n\nBrown University doctoral candidate Serta&ccedil; Sen completed two years of ethnographic fieldwork in &Ccedil;orlu, Turkey, regarding contemporary and historical civil-military relations in this seemingly innocuous garrison town.  Using anthropological methods of investigation and analysis, Sen conducted over 100 interviews with civilians, military personnel, and veterans of all ages, in a variety of settings, including restaurants, private residences, stores, and elsewhere.  By employing participant observation, Sen was able to explore the impact of military spending, employment, and political influence in ways large and small.  He also conducted archival research online and in person in various libraries in Turkey and abroad.  His research has succeeded in shedding new light on the militarization of everyday life in &Ccedil;orlu, and by extension similar military urban centers in various parts of the world.\n\nAmong the many contributions of this study are Sen\u2019s revelations with respect to the gendered aspects of militarization, including conscription of male recruits, job opportunities in the military and in life following military service, and the influence of military mentalities and masculinities in civic life in &Ccedil;orlu.  Tracing the history of the military in that town from the fall of the Ottoman Empire, through the twentieth-century, including World War 2, and up to current events such as the attempted coup in 2016, Sen details the outsized power of military elites on local life, and the development of a military-dependent economy in the region overall.\n\nMost of the limited studies of the military in any country focus on institutional issues and leadership/officer ranks.  Sen\u2019s study is all the more important because it is a bottom-up examination of the military and civil-military relations, and because it provides new data on a non-western country\u2019s military.  Turkey is an especially apt choice of location because of the extraordinary role for much of the last one hundred years of the Turkish military historically in championing liberal democracy.\n\nUsing sophisticated anthropological techniques of ethnography, and drawing on a rich theoretical literature regarding militarization and development, his study should be of wide interest in anthropology, sociology, political science, development studies, Middle East and Turkish studies, and gender studies.  Among its many virtues, Sen\u2019s work breaks down previously impenetrable barriers in our understanding of the intricate ways the military is entangled with a wide range of civilian beliefs and policies.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/04/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew C Gutmann"
