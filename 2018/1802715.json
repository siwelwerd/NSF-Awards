 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traits of organisms that enhance their rates of dispersal can be favored in populations that are rapidly colonizing new habitats. This is especially true if the dispersing individuals mate with similar, highly mobile individuals from surrounding populations. This process, termed \"spatial sorting\", generates offspring that are also rapid dispersers, regardless of how those genes affect the population's fitness in the new habitat. This project will perform the first large-scale field tests of spatial sorting in generating rapid evolution using populations of the red-shouldered soapberry bug (Jadera haematoloma), which has expanded and adapted from native to non-native food plants in the last 60 years. The rare episodic flooding from Hurricane Harvey has provided a unique opportunity to roll back the (short) evolutionary clock on soapberry bug populations by causing some populations to go extinct while others are still intact. Results from this study can be applied to understanding how invasive species colonize new habitats and ultimately displace native populations. This project also will support outreach public education on evolution in colonizing populations. \r\n\r\nOne fundamental question is how could J. haematoloma populations evolve so quickly? The answer to this question may emerge from features of the initial colonizers. Soapberry bugs exhibits a flight polymorphism, where there is a long-winged form that is the main disperser with a larger body, and a short-winged form that does not fly well with a smaller body. Long-wing morphs also have larger mouthparts that are beneficial on the new non-native host plant. This project will test whether the observed rapid adaptation from a native host plant, where smaller mouthparts are favored, to a non-native host plant, where larger mouthparts are favored, was promoted by spatial sorting as opposed to natural selection from standing phenotypic variation. To do this, field observational studies, a manipulative transplant experiment, lab tests of the genetic basis of dispersal phenotypes, as well as genetic tests for reductions in genetic variation within populations will be performed.",

However, recent work from the biology of invasive species has highlighted a distinct evolutionary mechanism that relies on dispersal. Here, traits that enhance rates of dispersal accumulate at the leading edge of an expanding range and assortative mating results between these high dispersing individuals, which then drives an evolutionary increase in dispersal phenotypes in following generations. This process, termed 'spatial sorting', generates novel phenotypes that are rapid dispersers, regardless of how those genes affect an organism's survival or reproductive success in novel habitats. The implications for this evolutionary phenomenon have recently been tested in systems that merit predicting invasion speeds or the pace of range expansions, however the potential role for this mechanism to facilitate or impede rapid adaptive divergence and diversification in natural populations has been overlooked.</p>\n<p>To test the role of spatial sorting, we conducted real-time field surveys of host-associated populations of <em>Jadera haematoloma</em> from two groups: populations that had gone locally extinct due to Hurricane Harvey flooding and those that remained intact. We monitored these populations every two weeks for over a year and measured beak length, wing length, sex and developmental stage. In addition, we surveyed museum specimens from the region to capture the regional phenotypic diversity in this species and sampled the entire known range of <em>J. haematoloma</em> from south Florida north along the Atlantic coast to New York, and west along the Gulf coast to south Texas. We performed phenotypic measurements of all populations, followed by DNA extractions, PCR, and phylogenetic analysis of a mtDNA barcoding region to understand broad-scale connectivity among host-associated populations.</p>\n<p><em>Significant Results and Outcomes</em> - In our field experiment, we observed a clear shift in phenotypes for populations that went extinct and were re-conlonized, but not intact populations, consistent with spatial sorting: larger winged disperser morphs were first to arrive at uncolonized habitats and shifted the historical beak length phenotype to a larger size that was maintained for multiple generations. This shift was adaptive for some host-associated populations and maladapative in others. By combining natural field collections across our region with museum specimens, we also confirmed a large regional pool of phenotypic variation, however there were clear differences among host-associated populations in beak length that matched the fruit size of the host plants. Lastly, we found a large pool of shared genertic variation among sites and host-associated populations, including between our study region in southeast Texas and the commonly studied Florida populations. Moreover, we sampled acros the U.S. Gulf coast and found very little genetic structure associated with geography or host plant. For the purpose of our tests of spatial sorting in southeast Texas, this demonstrates that populations are connected to some degree and not distinct evolutionary lineages.</p>\n<p><em>Broader Impacts</em> - This grant funded the training of a full time PhD student (a U.S. Army veteran) in population biology, microscopy, DNA extraction, PCR, sequencing and sequence alignment, phylogenetic analysis, and statistics. During the full-time PhD student's training, he was given the opportunity to mentor three undergraduate students, in various aspects of the project, including microscopy, handling and measuring museum specimens, DNA extractions and PCR. The full-time PhD student also received professional training in teaching, where he has taken different teaching and pedagogy modules, which will lead to earning a certificate from the Rice Center for Teaching Excellence.</p>\n<p>The results have been disseminated to the communities of interest with presentations at three national meetings by the PhD student: 2017 Entomology (Ent. Soc. Am.) meetings, 2018 Ecology (ESA) meetings, and the 2019 Evolution (SSE) meetings. One of the undergraduate students presented a poster at a local Rice University symposium for undergradutes. The PhD student is preparing one major paper that will document the results of our field test of spatial sorting, and two other research papers that were emergent properties of the funded work here.</p>\n<p>Outreach activities include: (1.) A lab demonstration of adaptation using different length drinking straws and water cups for elementary students. The purpose of the lab was to demonstrate the purpose of different length 'beaks' for the soapberry bugs adapted to different sized fruits of their host plants. This lab was given to 3rd-grade students at a local public elementary school and was very well received. (2.) A DNA extraction and PCR lab for high school students at a local public high school identified for its high diversity of students. A separate grant from the SSE funded the purchase of a small PCR thermocycler and lab supplies taught by the PhD student.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/07/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Scott&nbsp;Egan</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1802715/1802715_10524256_1594155679416_DSC_0674--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1802715/1802715_10524256_1594155679416_DSC_0674--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Jadera haematoloma\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1802715/1802715_10524256_1594155679416_DSC_0674--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Jadera haematoloma\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Jadera haematoloma from Houston, Texas.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Scott P.
