 "awd_abstract_narration": "Around the world, pollinators are in decline. Given that almost 90% of flowering plants rely on animal pollination, there is concern that many plants will decline towards extinction alongside their pollinators. Pollination is important because it ensures that plants can make seeds, grow into new plants and keep the species going. Yet, there are many reasons to think that the link between declining numbers of plants and declining numbers of pollinators is not so simple. For example, although it makes sense that a plant would make fewer seeds when there are fewer pollinators around, fewer seeds do not necessarily mean fewer new plants if, for example, the new plants compete for places to live. Fewer seeds could actually result in less competition among new plants, allowing more of them to survive. Furthermore, plants may use other resources not devoted to making seeds to grow larger and survive longer, thus having more chances to reproduce within their lifetime. These examples illustrate how, despite making fewer seeds, enough new plants could be made to keep the species going. A bigger lesson is that ecology is complex; all sorts of hidden strategies are not apparent until you take a closer look. This project will follow the fates of thousands of plants that are exposed to different numbers of pollinators, thereby helping scientists to identify plant species most at risk from pollinator declines and to understand why others are or are not at risk. In addition to data collection, the scientists on this project will help train the next generation of ecologists and will engage the public through an educational film, a blog, and a permanent interactive exhibit.\r\n \t\r\nIndividual-based population models (integral projection models) will be parameterized with data from a field experiment in which five species of perennial plants receive different pollination treatments: (i) increased pollination, (ii) reduced pollination, (iii) interannually variable pollination, and (iv) an unmanipulated control. All plants will be tagged with a unique identification number and their demographic status assessed annually. Additional germination experiments will be used to parameterize the effect of pollination on recruitment through density-dependent germination and seedling survival. Projections of the population models will show the consequences of pollination for plant population dynamics. Finally, life table response experiments will elucidate specific life history mechanisms by which pollination does or does not affect plant population growth rates (e.g., via trade-offs between growth and reproduction). This project will provide the empirical evidence necessary to bridge conceptual gaps among pollination biology, life history theory, and population dynamics, as well as providing a framework for understanding and predicting the ecological consequences of pollinator declines.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Most plants require animal pollination to make seeds, prompting widespread concern that pollinator declines will lead to losses in plant reproduction and subsequent declines in plant populations. However, we do not know how plant populations will respond to losses in pollination because there have been no experiments to test this. Therefore, we followed the fates of over 5,000 naturally-occurring plants across five species. Our experiment lasted for four years and included three different pollination treatments: decreased pollination, increased pollination, and a control. Our novel findings reveal pervasive effects of altered pollination on plant population dynamics, in not so obvious ways, which will be critical for predicting and understanding the impact of pollinator declines on plant biodiversity.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Plants have various strategies for making a living in nature, and they can reallocate internal resources in a way that might buffer their populations from pollinator declines and the associated loss of seeds. This is especially true for perennial plants, which account for approximately 94% of plant species globally. Such reallocation of resources means that the effects of pollinator declines on plant populations are not straightforward. For example, in response to decreases in pollination, a perennial plant might live for more years but reproduce less often, resulting in no net change to lifetime reproduction. As another example, the addition of new individuals to the population might not be limited by seed inputs but by the number of suitable sites for seedlings to grow, providing another context in which decreases in pollination might not affect population growth. <span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span></p>\n<p>In a groundbreaking field experiment, we decreased pollination by preventing pollinator access to approximately 50% flowers (with pollinator exclusion bags), added pollen to other plants to increase pollination, and additionally followed unmanipulated control plants.

In one species, reduced pollination led to reduced seed production and lower population growth rates. However, the population growth rates of other species were unaffected by reductions in pollination, largely because their populations are much more sensitive to things that affect survival rather than reproduction. In contrast, increased pollination consistently resulted in resources being allocated to higher seed production and away from vegetative growth and/or survival; this is known as a &lsquo;cost of reproduction&rsquo;.&nbsp; For one species, increased pollination even caused the population growth rate to decline, because the cost of making seeds was high &ndash; plants did not grow or survive as well, and the population growth rate was quite sensitive to losses in vegetative growth and survival.

Critically, this does not mean that pollination is unimportant. Here we reduced pollination by approximately 50%, but larger losses to pollination could affect perennial plant populations. Additionally, pollination is necessary for the reproduction of approximately 87% of all flowering plant species worldwide, and without pollinators these plants would be unable to reproduce at all.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span></p>\n<p>In addition to new research findings, this project produced educational outreach activities for the public, an innovative art-science exchange program, and numerous training and professional development opportunities for high school students, college students, recent college graduates, graduate students, K-12 teachers, and volunteers.
