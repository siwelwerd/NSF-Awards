 "awd_abstract_narration": "The biology of iconic megatoothed 'megalodon' shark-the largest shark species to have existed on Earth-and other extinct sharks remain largely unknown. For example, it is unclear whether 'megalodon' was 'cold blooded' or 'warm blooded' and how other fossil shark species compare. Understanding these biological details coupled with environmental reconstructions could help researchers understand what led to the demise of 'megalodon' during the late Pliocene (about 2.6 million years ago), and thus help to better understand the sensitivity of large shark species to ecosystem changes. This project uses isotopic 'fingerprinting' of teeth to reconstruct not only the body temperatures, but also dietary behavior and seawater chemistry of 'megalodon' and other shark species during the past 15 million years. In addition, this work supports a PhD student, a postdoctoral research fellow at a Hispanic Serving Institution, and undergraduate research experiences for under-represented minority (URM) students.  \r\n\r\nShark teeth are the most abundant vertebrate fossil and their resistance to diagenetic alteration provides a substrate for gechemical analysis. This project explores the phylogenetic history of endothermy within lamniform sharks using a coupled paleoecological and geochemical framework. Specifically, this work consists of four objectives: (1) estimate body temperatures of modern and ancestral marine vertebrates using 'clumped' isotope thermometry (i.e., thermodynamic preference of 13C and 18O to form bonds, or 'clump', in the carbonate mineral lattice), and assess foraging behavior using calcium isotopes (44Ca/42Ca) and 3D microwear analysis in bioapatite; (2) reconstruct and compare shark habitats using oxygen isotopes ( 18O) of shark tooth phosphate and carbonate; (3) infer changes in seawater Sr/Ca between the mid-Miocene Climate Optimum (17-15 million years before present) and Pliocene (~5.3-2.6 million years before present) from bioapatite; (4) build a research community of under-represented minority students. Coupling 'clumped' isotope thermometry-a relatively new method to determine body temperature-with other stable isotope and biogeochemical proxies to explore shark paleoecology through geologic time is the first of its kind. In addition, this project coincides with an upsurge of interest in the debate surrounding the rise and extinction of 'megalodon.' This research, therefore, combines paleontological questions with geochemical techniques to bring scientists one step closer to tackling the 'megalodon extinction hypothesis'.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Central questions persist regarding the thermophysiological origins, environmental habitats, and paleodiets of these large predatory sharks and their fossil ancestors. For example, it is unclear if&nbsp;<em>O. megalodon</em>&nbsp;was ectothermic or endothermic and how the thermophysiology of co-occurring shark taxa compare. In addition, while clues about the diet of megatooth sharks can be found in the shape and structure of their fossil teeth, quantitative constraints on their diet and thus position in the marine food web (relative to other sympatric apex predators) have eluded scientists. To address these uncertainties, this project sought&nbsp;to bridge a knowledge gap in paleobiology with isotope geochemistry to reconstruct the body temperatures and dietary behavior of&nbsp;<em>O. megalodon</em>&nbsp;and other shark species since the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago (i.e., the Cenozoic).&nbsp;Addressing these evolutionary details could help elucidate the role of thermophysiology and paleodiet in&nbsp;<em>O. megalodon</em>&nbsp;demise during the late Pliocene.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We quantitatively test the ?<em>O. megalodon</em>&nbsp;endothermy hypothesis? by constraining the absolute body temperatures of this iconic species along with some other common late Neogene sharks in comparison with those of extant marine vertebrates.

This thermodynamic preference for clumped isotopologues in carbonate thus forms the basis for reconstructing mineralization temperatures independent of bulk oxygen isotope composition of the parent fluid. The application of this method has been effective in reconstructing vertebrate body temperatures of reptiles and birds from eggshell carbonate, as well as sharks from carbonates in the bioapatite of teeth. The advantage of utilizing shark teeth is that they mineralize by secretion of biological hydroxyfluoroapatite (i.e., bioapatite) during amelogenesis and dentinogenesis, producing an enameloid structure that has a solubility several orders of magnitude lower than calcite and thus is less susceptible to diagenetic alteration during deposition and fossilization.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To first test the utility of this geochemical tool in reconstructing the body temperature of ancient marine vertebrates, we present novel geochemical constraints on the influence of ocean temperatures on modern shark tooth bioapatite clumped isotope (&Delta;<sub>47</sub>) signatures from wild-caught and aquarium-reared shark species.
