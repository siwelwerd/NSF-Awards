 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interplay between longwave radiation and the vertical transport of sensible and latent heat by convection is a key ingredient of the weather and climate of the earth.  In the absence of convection the cooling effect of longwave radiation produces a vertical temperature profile which is unstable.  The instability leads to convection, which transports sensible and latent heat upward and counteracts the longwave cooling, restabilizing the atmosphere.  This cooperative interaction between radiative cooling and convective heat transport leads to a state known as radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE), which provides a basic explanation for the dependence of air temperature on altitude.  RCE is also fundamental to our understanding of the sensitivity of global temperature to changes in greenhouse gas concentration (referred to as climate sensitivity), the response of the hydrological cycle to changes in global temperature, and the development of large-scale atmospheric circulation.\r\n\r\nEarly simulations of RCE used highly simplified approximations which only captured the bulk effects of convection, but RCE simulations are now performed with more sophisticated models that represent individual convective clouds and their interactions with the surrounding air.  Results of such simulations by the PIs and others suggest that the tendency of convective clouds to aggregate into clusters increases with increasing temperature.  The temperature dependence of convective aggregation could matter for climate sensitivity, as aggregated clouds are concentrated in relatively small regions, leaving clear skies over a larger portion of the earth than disaggregated convection.  Cooling to space is more effective under clear skies, thus an increase in clear sky area due to enhanced aggregation constitutes a negative feedback, counteracting some of the warming that produced increased aggregation.  \r\n\r\nThe possibility of a negative feedback due to convective aggregation has clear implications for understanding climate change and its potential societal impacts.  But the mechanisms of convective aggregation and its temperature dependence, and the extent to which aggregation affects climate sensitivity are not clear.  A further consideration is that the extent of aggregation and its temperature dependence may not be consistent from one model to another, and the PIs have worked to organize an international RCE model intercomparison project (RCEMIP) to address the issue of model dependence.\r\n\r\nHere the PIs use simulations from RCEMIP to explore the physics and dynamics of aggregation and its temperature dependence using a variety of diagnostics to test hypotheses taken from their own prior work and from their collaborators.  Additional simulations are performed using the System for Atmospheric Modeling (SAM), a global cloud resolving model, in specialized configurations designed to promote or suppress aggregation, thereby providing an assessment of its effect on climate sensitivity. The project also includes observational comparisons and the design of a simplified physics package suitable for RCE simulations.\r\n\r\nThe work has broader impacts due to the societal impacts of climate change and the desirability of better estimates of the likely consequences of greenhouse warming.  The interaction of clouds, circulation, and climate sensitivity has been identified as a grand challenge by the World Climate Research Program.  The project builds international scientific collaboration through the PIs' participation in RCEMIP, as well as the related Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project and the Global Atmospheric System Studies effort. In particular the lead PI has established a data portal for RCEMIP on her campus to provide model output, diagnostic analysis software, and documentation, thereby facilitating community engagement in the project. The project also provides support and training for a student and a postdoc, thereby providing workforce development in this research area.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe importance of strong convective storms and systems of clouds in the tropics has been known for decades.  Not only are these systems responsible for some of the rainiest places on Earth but they also provide the building blocks for tropical cyclones, multiple monsoon events, and the atmospheric convective component of El Nino.  In addition to the impact of tropical convection and clouds on regional weather, multiple cloud feedback processes are at the center of our uncertainty as to how strong will be the warming response to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.\n\nObserving and simulating these cloud systems and the thermodynamic processes that underpin them has faced numerous challenges over the past several decades.  Models of Radiative Convective Equilibrium (RCE) simplify the tropical atmosphere to the fundamental interactions between radiative transfers of energy and atmospheric convection.  The balance that is reached between radiation and convection has proven to be a useful conceptual model of the tropics, but simulations with computer models have been shown to be sensitive to the details of the configuration.  The Radiative Convective Equilibrium Model Intercomparison Project (RCEMIP) has provided a consistent framework that includes models that span multiple distinct configurations.  These models range from high resolution large-eddy simulations to global models that are derived from the Earth-like climate model.\n\nInitial results from RCEMIP were both exciting and humbling.  Across the large range of more than 30 participating models, the average atmospheric state can vary widely.  However, the models agree that with warming cloud tops move to higher altitudes and decrease in horizontal extent.  The degree to which the clouds cluster together into large masses also consistently influences the atmospheric state.  Models with large clusters of clouds tend to have drier atmospheres.\n\nIn addition to the large comparison across more than 30 models, we conducted detailed studies of two generations of models from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR; CAM5 and CAM6).  The experiments from RCEMIP allowed us to highlight and study a large difference in the low-clouds that are simulated in CAM6 compared to CAM5.  Results from RCE with CAM5 and CAM6 were put into the context of the comprehensive Earth system models from NCAR that participated in CMIP5 and CMIP6.  RCE experiments with CAM5 and CAM6 have also been officially released as part of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) at NCAR to facilitate the further use of this idealization of tropical convection.  The inclusion of RCEMIP configurations within the public release of CESM allows for broader use of the RCEMIP tools by both researchers and students.\n\nDespite the large range of results that are present in the RCEMIP simulations we have documented the consistent response of the large-scale tropical circulation to warming.  In all of the models an increasing surface temperature leads to a strong increase of atmospheric water vapor.  Most of the models simulate a weaker increase of the average rate of precipitation and this leads to an overall decrease in the intensity of the large-scale circulation.  The models are all also in agreement in their increase of atmospheric stability as the surface warms.  However, the magnitude of the change in stability varies widely across the models.  Another important element of the tropical atmosphere is how much energy the tropics can radiate back to space.  This acts as part of a global temperature regulation.  The RCEMIP models show a wide range in their ability to send energy back to space.\n\nThese results have advanced our understanding of tropical convection, assisted the further development of atmospheric models and paved the way for future research.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/23/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kevin Reed"
