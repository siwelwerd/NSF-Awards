 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students from historically underrepresented minority populations (African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians or Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders) to successfully complete high quality degree programs in STEM.  Louis Stokes Regional Centers of Excellence in Broadening Participation (LSRCEs) are designed to serve as regional testbeds for outreach, knowledge-generating and diffusion activities or other activities that contribute to successful practices in STEM education.  LSRCE activities may also be concentrated in the development of disciplinary research institutes.\r\nNorfolk State University, Tidewater Community College and Pennsylvania State University (lead collaborators) and other partner organizations that include the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Langley Research Center (NASA-LaRC), Jefferson National Research Laboratory Applied Research Center (JLab-ARC), and Eastern Virginia Medical School (EVMS), all active members of the broader nanoscience and engineering research community, will collaborate as part of the Southeastern Coalition for Engagement and Exchange in Nanotechnology Education (SCENE), a regional Louis Stokes Center for Excellence in Broadening Participation. \r\n\r\nSCENE utilizes nanotechnology and its many applications as a conduit for engaging and inspiring talented students from traditionally underrepresented minority populations.  Through guided mentoring and opportunities for research and hands-on training experiences, students will (1) pair student participants with accomplished research professionals to seed and motivate continuing research activities; (2)  sponsor student-centered research and training activities to achieve cohorts of students who are prepared and competitive for opportunities in advanced STEM environments; and, (3)  utilize its unique resources and established collaborative connections to deliver and disseminate a suite of digitally prepared products and services to users.  The program design augments an extensive summer training and internship component, with an aggressive strategy to prepare and mentor talented students as they generate portfolios and generate competitive profiles for research opportunities at national labs and federal research agencies (e.g. NSF GRFP and NASA Graduate Student Fellowship Program (GSFP) applications). \r\n\r\nThe center will be led by multiple institution types including a historically black university, a community college, and a research I institution that houses the Center for Nanotechnology Education and Utilization in addition to federal and private sector organizations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The SCENE served as an effective network for implementation and dissemination of education and training products and services for diverse student populations in STEM disciplines. The coalition members included: two four-year institutions, Norfolk State University (NSU) and Pennsylvania State University (PSU); one community college, Tidewater Community College (TCC); and three Hampton Roads area research institutes, Eastern Virginia Medical School (EVMS), Jefferson National Research Laboratory and Applied Research Center (JLab-ARC), and NASA Langley Research Center (NASA-LaRC). The products and services at The SCENE have supported the goal of increasing participation and contributions of underrepresented populations in nanoscience and engineering.</p>\n<p>Over its three-year existence beginning in the summer of 2019 the SCENE has successfully accomplished the major goals it set out to achieve. The SCENE coalition has provided nanoscience and technology exposure and engagement to a significant number K-12 and undergraduate underrepresented students. The multitude of graduate level opportunities and as well as cutting-edge career options in nanoscience were revealed to these students. In addition, The SCENE has also created and has made available a multitude of educational and outreach materials to help to facilitate continued nanoscience and technology exposure and engagement.</p>\n<p>Year one of the project went off as planned. A cohort of 22 students at NSU and 4 students at PSU attended joint intensive hybrid training, consisting of live stream training as well as both cohorts getting hands-on training in NSU and PSU cleanroom facilities as well as guided research experiences. The PSU cohort consisted of 2 underrepresented STEM students from baccalaureate and 2 underrepresented STEM students from community colleges across the nation. (TX, AL, CA). PSU leveraged the Big TEN Student Research Opportunities Program (SROP). This partnership enabled these students to participate in the multitude of SROP orientation activities, gain real-time research experience as well as gain the accelerated nanotechnology knowledge and skills. It is noteworthy that two of these students (one community college and one baccalaureate) are already in PhD programs (Rice University-Chemistry and Penn State-Mechanical Engineering). A third student matriculated to UCSD and is presently completing her baccalaureate degree in Biochemistry and is also planning to attain a PhD.</p>\n<p>The Covid 19 Pandemic hit in the spring of 2020, causing the PSU-NSU-TCC SCENE Center team to over a three-month period adjust to the new reality and create the three-week intensive Accelerated Nanotechnology Training for Undergraduate Students. This newly designed program changed the format from seven- or eight-week face-to-face (F2F) classroom and lab experiences at PSU and NSU to fully interactive live-streamed lectures and laboratories, online simulations, remote access to equipment, as well as hand-on experience modules using remote experimental kits. The program built a dynamic teaching and interactive studying environment. National outreach resulted in 202 students to fully participate in the 2020 summer which thus enabled The SCENE to far exceed the original Center impact objectives.</p>\n<p>A decision was made in the spring of 2021, due to the continued uncertainty of Covid 19 at that time, to again offer the three-week intensive Accelerated Nanotechnology Training for Undergraduate Students in the summer of 2021. This program was again very successful in that it reached due to a national outreach effort. Forty-seven students from 26 institutions representing 13 states fully participated in this 3-week virtual experience. Seventy four percent of the summer 2021 cohort self-identified as URM students.</p>\n<p>Other SCENE activities included ongoing outreach to URM communities in the Tidewater region by the joint PSU, NCC and TCC collaborative to URM schools within the region using understanding of and educational and career opportunities in nanoscience. Highly regarded Professional Development Symposiums and Technical Conferences (both virtual) were also held during the summers of 2020 as well as 2021 involving industry as well as renowned academicians from across the country.
