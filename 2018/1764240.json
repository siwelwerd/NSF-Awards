 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded by the Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division.  Dr. John L. Wood of Baylor University is developing new methods and strategies for transforming readily accessible chemicals into complex molecules that are similar, and sometimes identical, to those that have been discovered in nature. These molecules are being studied because of their complex structure and important physiological properties. The new methods and strategies being developed are applicable to the preparation of molecules used in the discovery of new medicines, agrochemicals, insecticides, materials, flavors, and fragrances. The broader impacts of this research include advancing our ability to prepare complex molecules. Students are engaged in research and acquire skills that enable them to pursue STEM careers in both academics and industry. Dr. Wood's research team continues to be comprised of individuals with varied educational levels, ethnicities and genders who move on to positions where they continue to have a strong positive impact on science and society.\r\n\r\nDr. Wood is developing new methods and strategies for the synthesis of physiologically important natural products. The natural products targeted in this study possess complex structures and include congeners of the naturally occurring alkaloids tetrapetalone A and aspergilline A and the naturally occurring antifungal agent hippolachnin A. Within the context of these synthetic efforts, strategies are being pursued that advance understanding and expand the scope of intramolecular furan Diels-Alder reactions, and the cycloaddition chemistry of cyclopropenone and quadricyclane. The latter strained ring systems hold promise as cycloaddition substrates capable of delivering a variety of stereochemically rich aliphatic and heterocyclic products. Nitrogen- and oxygen-containing heterocycles are ubiquitous among molecules useful in the development of new materials, medicines, agrochemicals, insecticides, flavors and fragrances. Dr. Wood has continually assembled a research team comprised of individuals with varied educational levels, ethnicities and genders and pursues outreach endeavors designed to foster STEM education among middle and high school level youth groups. The training and skillsets developed in the students involved this project will enable them to have a lasting impact on science and society during the pursuit of their respective STEM careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMost modern medicines are small molecules that are either derived directly from nature or prepared by chemists.  Inspiration for the design and preparation of drugs in the latter classs is often inspired by natural products.  The funding provided by this grant was utilized to develop new chemical methods and synthesis strategies that can be employed for the laboratory preparation of molecules found in nature, their derivatives, or analogs.  \n\n \n\nThe funding provided from this grant enabled the completion of seven natural product total syntheses.  These efforts in synthesis resulted in the development of new methods and strategies that can be utilized in preparing a wide range of small molecules and are not limited to only compounds resembling the completed targets.  In addition to the new chemistry that was developed, these funds supported the matriculation of four graduate students to the Ph.D. degree.  Although one student is still in residence, three students have moved on, two to positions in the pharmaceutical industry and one in crop protection.  \n\n \n\nWhile both major outcomes of this product can be seen as beneficial, it is often difficult to predict or envision how the advances in synthetic strategies and methods will impact the field.  The approach, which targets molecules with very complex structures, results in advances for which broad applications have yet to be defined.   In contrast, the benefit regarding the students is more immediate and obvious.  In the course of their research the students develop skillsets applicable to a wide range of industries, including but not limited to, those that develop and manufacture pharmaceuticals, insecticides, herbicides, flavors, fragrances, and fine chemicals.  Employment of students possessing these skills is typically 100%.
