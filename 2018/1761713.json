 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pyroclastic density currents, mixtures of volcanic ash and pumice (also known as pyroclasts) and gas that move at high rates of speed, are some of the most destructive forces in nature. The Campanian Ignimbrite, which erupted from the Campi Flegrei near Naples, Italy, 40,000 years ago, is the deposit from one of the youngest truly large pyroclastic density currents on Earth. The currents reached over 80 km from the vent and devastated an area currently occupied by more than 4 million people. Traditional models for these currents assume they are tens to perhaps 100 meters thick, but our past work shows the Campanian current moved as a kilometer-thick flow across the landscape, overtopping ridges 1.5 times that height.  This great mobility makes this sort of \"expanded\" pyroclastic density current much more hazardous and the damage less predictable. This dilute current required an enormous amount of gas, more than can be explained by the amount dissolved in the magma prior to eruption.  Two other possible sources are the entrainment of air and the involvement of water from a hot hydrothermal system within the volcano. This project will determine the amounts of gas from the magma, air, and hydrothermal system involved in the current. This information will be used to make better predictions of which volcanoes might produce highly mobile currents and design hazards maps that take this mobility into account. Two undergraduate students, two graduate students, a post-doctoral researcher, and a professor will work on this project at Northern Arizona University and a graduate student and a professor will work at Oxford University. Three Italian researchers will also collaborate in this project. The results may be used for hazards assessments and response plans, including for the US Naval Support Activity in Naples.\r\n\r\nA recent thermal magnetization study of the Campanian Ignimbrite (CI) found the temperature of emplacement was above 580 oC even at 80 km from the vent. This limits how much air could have been incorporated, but, to calculate precise quantities, a better knowledge of the magmatic temperature and whether other sources of gas, such as magmatic gas and hydrothermal fluids, were significant, is needed. This project will include 1) field investigations to better characterize the CI stratigraphy and link distal and proximal deposits and define the relative timing of volcanic events; 2) complete volatile analysis (H2O, CO2, S, F and Cl) of melt inclusions and apatite microphenocrysts via Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, ion probe, and electron microprobe. Back-calculating volatile concentrations during open-system degassing is a new technique that should reveal much about the Campanian Ignimbrite magma history; and 3) a study of the glass transition temperature at varying strain rates and residual water contents to better define the emplacement temperature. Current models and interpretations of datasets may need to be modified to include the potential role of hydrothermal fluids in \"supercharging\" an eruption, as hydrothermal water does not appear in many petrologic measurements of gases. A model for explosive eruptions that includes the potential contribution of erupted hydrothermal systems will help define volcanic hazards more accurately and may elucidate a possible cause for paroxysmal pyroclastic density current-producing eruptions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We used field and many types of laboratory techniques to carry this out. Through careful mapping and correlation of stratigraphic sequences, we found that the near-vent deposits only record a small portion of the eruption and the distal deposits, although they record more of the eruption, do not record the parts represented by the near-vent deposits. The very high-energy current passed over the near-vent areas, either eroding deposits or simply not depositing, before losing energy farther out and depositing there. Only the least energetic portions of the eruption produced proximal deposits. The full record requires having both sets of deposits. We also mapped the over-thickened parts of the deposit near the Apennine Mountains and used this to determine how much of the current was blocked by the first ridge. From this, we calculated a density profile through the current and find it to have been very dilute, with much of its mass many hundreds of meters above its base. Thermomagnetic and rock-heating studies show the ignimbrite was deposited at 600-700 &ordm;C and thus did not cool much due to air incorporation. Studies of the alteration of the ignimbrite that occurred immediately after emplacement show that seawater or geothermal fluids were not needed to introduce ions into the system. We thus minimize the importance of incorporation of atmosphere, geothermal fluids, or seawater to provide the gas for the pyroclastic current. This leaves magmatic gas as the likely source of gas in the current. To understand this source, we studied melt inclusions &ndash; tiny bits of magma trapped in growing crystals when a crystal defect forms and the crystal heals around it &ndash; and apatite crystals, which sample the dissolved gas in the magma. We found that there were two different magmas that mixed before eruption, each providing significant quantities of gas. Then, prior to eruption, magma ascended to depths of 1-3 km below the surface. There, it exsolved gases, especially water, in large quantities. This shallow intrusion level was unstable &ndash; the overlying rocks would have soon collapsed into the magma &ndash; and the magma erupted before the gas could escape to the atmosphere. Thus, the eruption was very rich in gas from its start and the current immediately expanded to a dilute, thick (&gt;1 km) current rather than expanding more slowly through incorporation of air or exsolution of gas from pumice fragments. This current flowed out across the sea, Campanian Plain, and Apennine Mountains to produce the Campanian Ignimbrite, and the very dilute portion eventually rose into the sky and blew downwind, depositing material in central Asia. In the course of this project, three students carried out MS theses, one PhD student graduated, one post-doctoral researcher developed new skills and was mentored in teaching and guiding the MS students, and one early-career researcher mentored all the students while developing her own mentoring skills. The work has been presented in many meetings, one paper was published, another is in review, and a third is about to be submitted for review, with three others in preparation currently.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/30/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michael&nbsp;H&nbsp;Ort</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
