 "awd_abstract_narration": "A high demand for information technology (IT) technicians and professionals, coupled with the expected retirements in the field over the next five years, requires a new approach to identify and train the IT workforce. To ensure sufficient numbers of highly qualified IT technicians are available, Sinclair College will collaborate with industry to modify computer information systems (CIS) curriculum to reduce content redundancies, a frequent problem in courses built around industry certifications. The CIS programs will expand the depth of associate degree and certificate curricula, to make graduates more competitive. This project will also investigate the impact of competency-based, flex-paced curriculum and the role of a Navigator to assist students through credential completion. (A Navigator is a person who assists students across multiple areas, including enrollment issues, financial planning, academic advising, and career planning.)  Information about how the project identified and remediated content redundancies, along with evidence-based practices related to accelerated coursework and student supports, will be disseminated to IT/CIS faculty at secondary and post-secondary institutions. The project aims to address the need for a strong and diverse IT workforce in southwest Ohio.\r\n\r\nThis project has three primary objectives: (1) to increase the success of postsecondary students pursuing one of five enhanced IT degrees; (2) to increase educational opportunities for rehabilitating prisoners to meet technician demand; and (3) to determine the efficacy of educational material dissemination for regional high schools. The project will enhance IT curricula to meet current and emerging workforce needs in network engineering, secure system administration, user support, cyber investigation, and data analytics. Seven core CIS courses based on industry certifications will be enhanced to reduce content redundancies. Faculty will employ the principles of spiral curriculum pedagogy and Bloom's Taxonomy to develop technician preparation pathways. Course modules will use competency-based, flex-paced modalities, allowing students to complete coursework at their own pace. It will also integrate content from industry certifications, modules developed by the Center for Occupational Research and Development and the NSF Center for Systems Security and Information Assurance, and Necessary Skills Now content to complement IT fundamentals with employability skills. The project will reach high school students, with emphasis on female high school students through Women in STEM events. To further meet technician demand and increase educational opportunities for rehabilitating inmates nearing reentry, the project will deliver two IT Certificates, IT Fundamentals and User Support, to inmates in seven correctional facilities.  These Certificates are aligned with in-demand entry-level positions. Inmates will access online CIS coursework through secure JPay's Lantern tablet computers. A strong dissemination plan through the Miami Valley Tech Prep Consortium will ensure the communication of project deliverables and outcomes to others, including secondary school faculty for use with high school students pursuing a dual enrollment IT career pathway. New CIS curriculum will impact over 1,400 postsecondary students in five IT degree programs. This number includes 400 inmates in the Advanced Job Training prison program. Inclusion of this relatively untapped inmate population will contribute to reduced recidivism as well as promote diversity in the IT workforce. Additionally, 300 high school students will be exposed to new curriculum through established dual-enrollment programs, providing these students a pathway to college careers in this in-demand field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nobjectives:\n\n1. Increase the success of post-secondary students pursuing one of five enhanced IT degrees through curriculum redesign and improved student support model for postsecondary students.\nDuring the life cycle of the grant the role of Navigator was investigated.  The Navigator role was initially designed with a different set task.  After investigating other responsibilities, the team discovered the best assignment for the navigator was to be embedded into the specific course sections covered in this grant.  As a result, the Navigator role could more closely monitor student engagement with the course material, attendance, and performance on assessments.  In an earlier stage, students were identified for appropriate interventions and academic assistance.  As a result, the Navigator was able to focus more efforts on student assistance\nCloser connection to courses and faculty resulted in a higher level of awareness of the Navigator role by faculty, so they could refer students in need of support services provided by the Navigator.\nDuring the Enhance IT Grant, the team was able to identify areas of difficulty in the Introduction to Computer Programming course.  Working with a tutor of the course the team implemented a total of 23 tutorial videos for the course.  This course historically exhibited a low student success rate; consequently, the tutorial videos were designed and professionally produced for additional learning resources for students.  The videos cover a variety of programming topics and were embedded in all modalities and sections of the CIS-1111 course beginning with the fall term of 2021.  The videos have been shared through the videos and are designed to follow the content sequence of the course curriculum.  The videos are accessible through the course shell as well as through a public YouTube page, so they may be reviewed/studied throughout course term.  Student comments and survey feedback have been favorable. To view these videos search for ?Complex Concepts, Simply Put?.\n\n2. Increase educational opportunities for rehabilitating prisoners to meet technician demand.  This will be accomplished by creating two new, for credit, online postsecondary certificates.\nPrior to the advent of the COVID pandemic faculty were working with the Ohio Corrections Facilities (OCF) to implement the new course work.  The COVID pandemic had significant impacts on higher education but has also had a severe negative impact on Sinclair College?s ability to provide the developed IT course materials to Ohio Correctional Facilities (OCF).  As of the writing of this report, parties outside of the OCF do not have access to these facilities, the grants team is in contact with project directors and is hopeful that in the near future, implementation will begin.  When the opportunity is available several innovations have been incorporated into these courses that will provide students with a comprehensive learning experience while also meeting OCF requirements for a secure environment.  These innovations also include integration of course materials with Sinclair College Learning Management System (LMS).  \n\n 3. Determine the efficacy of the educational material dissemination process for regional high schools and incorporate new learning activities to enhance High School IT curriculum.\nRelationships with Secondary schools are a major objective of this grant, and the Grants Team continues to distribute updated content to area High schools. Every year during the grant area Secondary teachers attended a one day training and were provided the recourses created by the grant. The grant resources where shared at the National Gifted conference in 2021. \n\n \nDuring the fourth year of the Enhance IT Grant, the team continued to monitor the traffic and usage of the YouTubechannel containing the video tutorials developed for Introduction to Programming.  This distribution channel is a publicly available resource, not only for students at Sinclair College but also to other learning communities. At this time the 23 videos have been viewed 16,000 times collectively.\nThe grants team presented at the HI-TEC conference 2020, 2021, and 2022.  The presentation highlighted the purpose and scope of the Grant as well as course content enhancements, lessons learned, etc.  The presentation will be attached to this report.\nMembers of the Grants Team attended the ATE PI conference from 2019-2021.  While not formally presenting, it is anticipated that informal discussions will aid dissemination of materials and content developed under this grant.\nEnhance IT Grant saw continued efforts to survey students enrolled in the seven core IT courses in the Fall 2021 term as well as in the Spring and Summer terms of 2022.  These results were tabulated and analyzed in comparison to the baseline and more recent response data by the Grant?s external evaluator.  Survey questions concerning student attitudes and perceptions of course formats (changed due to COVID) were retained from prior terms.  Based on the results of the External Evaluator, Sinclair students feel satisfied and engaged in their CS/IT courses and despite the disruptions caused by COVID, feel they will be able to complete their degree.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/27/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric B Renegar"
