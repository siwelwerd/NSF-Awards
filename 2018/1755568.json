 "awd_abstract_narration": "Applications for unmanned aerial and ground vehicles requiring autonomous navigation in unknown, cluttered, and dynamically changing environments are increasing in fields such as transportation, delivery, agriculture, environmental monitoring, and construction. To achieve safe, resilient, and self-improving autonomous navigation, this project focuses on the design of adaptive online environment understanding that guarantees stable and collision-free operation in challenging conditions. The proposed research is important because current practices rely on prior maps or hand-crafted online mapping that attempt to capture the whole environment, even if parts are irrelevant for specific navigation tasks. This increases memory and computation requirements, spreads the effects of noise, and makes current approaches brittle, particularly in conditions involving dynamic obstacles, unreliable localization, or illumination variation.\r\n\r\nThe proposal offers two technical innovations to achieve safe autonomous navigation. First, it develops a learnable neural map based on 3-D convolution over hierarchical (octree) partitioning of space to extract navigation-specific features and on differentiable memory to infer long-term dependence among the features. The neural map parameters are trained from navigation experience not to produce accurate maps but to quantify the collision probabilities of intended motion trajectories accurately. The second innovation is a Lyapunov-theoretic control approach that uses the total energy of an autonomous system with respect to a virtual kinematic system (that can stop immediately) to derive conditions that guarantee stable and collision-free tracking of the trajectories proposed by the neural network. The proposed learnable neural map significantly increases the robustness of collision prediction, while the Lyapunov-theoretic control guarantees stable and safe navigation in new, unpredictable, and cluttered environments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Specifying safety constraints for autonomous navigation by hand, in terms of a mathematical cost function, is very challenging due to the various conditions that need to be captured. The project developed inverse reinforcement learning techniques that allow learning such cost functions from expert demonstrations. An expert is an experienced human user or an optimized algorithm that can demonstrate safe navigation and implicitly satisfy the safety constraints. The contributions of the project include an online mapping approach that recognizes semantically meaningful regions (road lanes, sidewalks, buildings), a cost model that associates these regions with navigation costs, and a model of the expert user's behavior that allows approximating the costs from the expert demonstrations. Once optimized, these models allow planning autonomous robot behavior in previously unseen environments by estimating the semantics, predicting the navigation costs, and generating a navigation plan that minimizes the costs. To ensure that the planned behavior is actually executed safely, our work also proposed techniques for closed-loop robot control with theoretical safety and stability guarantees. We defined a notion of local safety, called dynamic safety margin, based on the system's kinetic energy (related to the speed of motion), potential energy (related to the distance from the desired trajectory), and distance to obstacles. We designed an adaptive controller for trajectory tracking, whose tracking speed is determined by the size of the dynamic safety margin. For example, if the dynamic safety margin is large, the system is safe and can move quickly, while if the dynamic safety margin is small, the system may be in danger of collision and may need to stop. Assuming that obstacles are detected reliably, our work shows theoretically that the adaptive controller guarantees system stability and safety. These techniques were demonstrated in the CARLA Autonomous Driving simulator to achieve autonomous lane following from demonstration as well as in physical experiments with a small wheeled autonomous robot. The outcomes of this project have the potential to allow humans to demonstrate desirable operation by example and improve the safety of autonomous systems in transportation and delivery services.<br /><br />The project provided training and professional development opportunities to two PhD students and eleven undergraduate students in the ECE department at UC San Diego. The PhD students contributed to the research activities in inverse reinforcement learning and system control with safety and stability guarantees. The project allowed the PhD students to participate in and present their work at premier conferences on robotics (ICRA) and control (L4DC) and to prepare journal articles for the International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR) and Automatica. The project enabled outreach and research initiation activities for undergraduate students through several programs at UC San Diego: the Regents Scholar Research Initiative (RSRI), the ENLACE bi-national summer research program, the Summer Training Academy for Research Success (STARS) program, and the International Summer Research Program (ISRP), and the ECE department's Summer Research Internship Program (SRIP).
