 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electrospinning is a nanomanufacturing process that enables the single step processing of self-supported, three-dimensional, and/or hierarchical networks of nanofibers, typically of polymers and their composites. This process has been exploited in recent years for the synthesis of nanoscale ceramics.  However, the amount and quality of the electrospun mats produced are still close to a laboratory-scale. The focus of this award is to advance ceramic nanofiber electrospinning to ensure high process yield, process and product repeatability and reproducibility, along with optimized quality control. The anticipated result is a commercially-viable, high-throughput, nanomanufacturing process that produces functional nano-ceramics in large volumes and at a low cost. Processing of advanced photocatalysts for solar energy conversion to hydrogen fuel through water splitting is one of the targeted applications for the electrospun oxides addressed by this award. There are multiple anticipated benefits to the US economy and the welfare of the society, in terms of material availability and it's use in harvesting energy from the sun. This multidisciplinary project brings together expertise in materials manufacturing, nanomaterials synthesis, electrochemistry, mechanical engineering, and computational modeling. This award will add to the skilled workforce that will guide the growth of new industries for nanomaterials manufacturing based on ceramic electrospinning, thus creating more jobs. \r\n\r\nThis award addresses fundamental issues related to the mechanism of formation of large-scale 3D mats, comprised of self-supported, high surface area, ceramic oxide nanostructures. It spans several disciplines, and it is the joint effort between four collaborators with complementary expertise in nanofibrous materials processing, structural and mechanical property characterization and modeling, and photocatalytic property assessment. The structural features of the as-spun and calcined nanofibrous mats will be modeled to enable the fine-tuning of their processing conditions and to optimize the final design of the high-throughput process. The measurement of the mechanical properties of the electrospun mats will determine how they will perform as photocatalytic blankets. Assessment of the photoelectrochemical properties of the mats will guide their tailored synthesis. The methods and techniques employed in this work are expected to revolutionize industrial processes for the nanomanufacturing of self-supported / non-dispersed ceramic nanofibrous mats for energy-related applications.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Engineering Directorate and the Division of Materials Research in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.",

Beyond the one of-a-kind infrastructure development, there have been innovative tools demonstrated and employed for modeling the mechanical properties of self-supported fibrous mats manufactured, which are based on transformative computational codes. Furthermore, there have been demonstrated sunlight-activated nanostructured materials with the best reported photocatalytic activity for cleaning up water and other media and for producing hydrogen and oxygen fuels via water splitting. Many students (high school, undergraduate, graduate) and researchers (post-doctoral, research scientists and faculty colleagues from various disciplines) have been exposed to the convergent interdisciplinary approach used to conduct this research. There have been Master's and PhD theses produced, scientific publications, presentations, videos, press-releases, which disseminated the products of this project across the globe. There have been important scientific and engineering questions answered and new research fields that have emerged. It has been elucidated how electrospinning affects the morphological, structural, and chemical features of materials, leading to unexpected but highly desirable new functionalities. The impact of this project continues to spread across disciplines and the results produced here have guided and made possible numerous emerging projects in various areas (energy, biosensing, regenerative medicine, agriculture, to name a few). The project consistently maintained a focus on training a diverse population as the future workforce and several of the students who worked in this project are exploring the translation of the project?s results to the marketplace through start-up formation, IP generation, and product development.
