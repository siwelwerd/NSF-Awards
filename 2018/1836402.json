This cross-disciplinary emphasis makes it well-suited as a target for student participation, and the important topics addressed in these conferences encourage student research and collaboration in critical areas of\r\nadvanced computing. The support requested in this proposal will enable the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend the conference, and extends the impact of research presented to a broad audience of young researchers from across the country.\r\n\r\nTo help increase the representation and participation of these students, this proposal requests funding to assist approximately 20-25 US-based graduate students to attend each of the following events:\r\n \r\n15th USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI 2018).\r\n\r\nUSENIX Annual Technical Conference (ATC 2018). \r\n\r\nUSENIX Security Symposium (Security 2018).\r\n\r\n13th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI 2018). \r\n\r\nThe knowledge shared and advanced at these conferences has practical and meaningful applications to a broad variety of things used in daily life such as household appliances, cars, cell phones, airplanes and public transit, as well as to the ethical, cultural, and social ramifications of computing technology\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
