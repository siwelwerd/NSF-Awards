 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will review and synthesize existing literature on factors that impact the interest, participation, retention and success of women of color in computing and technology fields.  This type of project informs areas for future research and helps to identify promising practices that others can implement.  The project will result in a report to help inform those who are practitioners in STEM education, STEM employers, and STEM policy makers.   \r\n\r\nThis project is a mixed-methods meta-synthesis that will analyze and integrate the findings from empirical research on the factors that affect the retention of women of color in technology and computing higher education and careers. Focusing on literature produced since 2000, this synthesis will address the main research question: According to the existing empirical literature, what factors affect the experiences, participation, and advancement of women of color in technology and computing from the stages of early college education through their careers?  The goals of the project are to: (1) build new knowledge and understanding of the factors affecting the retention of women of color in technology and computing; (2) identify gaps in research; (3) inform leaders in the field about promising policies and practices that retain women of color in technology and computing; and (4) make methodological contributions through the testing and refinement of meta-synthesis tools and processes.  This project is supported by the Education and Human Resources Core Research Program, which funds fundamental research in STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The intellectual merit of the project stems from the contribution to the existing knowledge base through identification of barriers and supports that influence the persistence of women of color in computing higher education and careers. Some of these factors are described below.  \nBarriers for Women of Color in Computing Higher Education: \n\nSeveral studies described computing departments as environments that had a culture of hostility and exclusion against women of color at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.  \nMajority male professors and peers were main contributors to this hostile culture through reinforcing negative stereotypes about groups to which women of color belonged and committing acts of racial and gender discrimination and harassment against them.  \n\nBarriers for Women of Color in Computing Careers: \n\nMultiple studies reported on women of color computing professionals experiencing hyper-masculine, \"bro\" cultures within the workplace. Women often felt isolation and exclusion and were also victims of sexism and sexual harassment.\nWomen of color in computing reported impostor syndrome and having to modify their behaviors (such as how they spoke or dressed) to blend into the workplace and avoid instances of racialized and/or gendered discrimination.   \n\nSupports for Women of Color in Computing Higher Education: \n\nNumerous studies found that student STEM organizations, like Latinas in Computing, served as counterspaces for women of color. These groups provided social support and resources, such as access to mentors.  \nA common factor of persistence was women of color wanting to serve as mentors and role models in computing for future generations of students of color, particularly girls of color.\nHistorically Black colleges and universities created unique cultures of support for both undergraduate and graduate women who pursued computing.\n\nSupports for Women of Color in Computing Careers: \n\nSeveral studies revealed giving back as a motivator for women of color to persist in the workplace.
