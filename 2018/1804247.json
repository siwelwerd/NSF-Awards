 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will generate fundamental knowledge and identify design principles for developing improved battery anodes based on lithium metal. This knowledge is critical for enabling rechargeable high energy density lithium electrode batteries for electric vehicle-based transportation and for compact storage of renewably generated electricity. This work will advance understanding of how this active material forms beneficial, ionically-conductive material films that have the potential to impart improved stability, cycling efficiency and lifetime. The insights developed in this work can be used to design new fabrication procedures and improved interfaces for lithium anodes with higher degrees of stability, which is currently a key issue with this technology. This work could lead to lighter, longer-lasting and more compact transportation batteries, which supports improved national energy sustainability, reduced air pollution, and a potential path to more widespread electric vehicle adoption. The educational and outreach plans will leverage and add to existing programs at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to benefit K-12 students and improve public literacy related to energy storage, batteries and electrochemistry within the Cambridge and Greater Boston areas. This project specifically entails development of new educational materials and teaching modules to support public school science teachers in teaching energy conversion and storage concepts, and workshops to be hosted on MIT campus in collaboration with the MIT Edgerton Center and MIT Museum. The PI also plans inclusion of Greater Boston community college students in summer research.\r\n\r\nThe rechargeable Li electrode is an essential element of the most promising, \"beyond Li-ion\" advanced battery chemistries. However, Li electrodes do not currently cycle with acceptable Coulombic efficiency, safety, or lifetime. This project investigates how oxide and fluoride gases interact with Li metal, and impart chemical, morphological, and electrochemical properties favorable to formation of an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). This research includes systematic studies of Li reactions with gases that yield ionic compounds on the Li surface, allowing for independent tuning and study of the formed inorganic interface. By exploring three gases that are projected to yield a comprehensive set of distinct inorganic-layer compositions, this work will contribute new fundamental understanding of how the SEI chemical, structural and electronic properties govern performance, and identify optimized inorganic-layer chemistries that can drive future additive development and optimization. The major tasks that comprise the research plan are: (1) Determine the chemical and structural properties of films formed when fresh Li reacts in gas environments, using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, electron microscopy and thermal/microstructural modeling; (2) Perform cycling measurements and quantify key electrochemical metrics of Coulombic efficiency, cycle life, and short-circuit time; (3) Measure the physical and electrochemical properties of the reactant gas, including reaction kinetics, transport parameters, and electrochemical activity within battery environments, which are relevant to SEI-healing processes; (4) Probe the feasibility and mechanisms of healing reactions using these gases. This effort will contribute new knowledge of how gas molecules decompose in far-from-equilibrium reactions at the surface of a Li electrode, and how this reactivity can be exploited to develop optimized interphases for improved efficiency and cycle life.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Such performance gain is essential to enable electric vehicles to drive farther on a single charge and help to incentivize their widespread adoption as the U.S. seeks increasing degrees of transportation electrification. However, in contrast to graphite, Li electrodes do not currently cycle with acceptable Coulombic efficiency, safety, or lifetime. The origin of these challenges arises from the chemically heterogeneous, mechanically weak and unstable/reactive solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) that forms due to parasitic reactivity of freshly plated Li metal with organic electrolytes. It is well-known that the SEI is strongly influenced by electrolyte, and that at a granular level, the Li SEI consists of both ionic and organic Li phases, with ionic phases typically enriched closest to the Li metal interface. However, the composition, properties and function of common SEI phases remain poorly understood, hindering attempts to rationally improve the SEI through use of better electrolytes and/or additives.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To address a need for improved information about the Li interface, this work created new methodologies to experimentally measure properties of its constituent phases. A central approach involved development of a synthesis method using oxide or fluoride gases to grow model interfaces on Li that consisted of individual ionic phases of tens of nanometer thickness. These interfaces were ionically conductive but electronically and chemically blocking, making such&nbsp;<em>ex situ</em>&nbsp;SEI comparable in key aspects to a native (electrolyte-derived) SEI. In a first study, we critically investigated the function of lithium fluoride (LiF) in the SEI given that LiF is hypothesized by some studies in literature to be a desirable SEI component. Cycling studies and post-mortem analysis revealed that LiF was, in fact, highly susceptible to being plated through by Li given its high resistivity to Li<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;transport, which invites instabilities, heterogeneous deposition and SEI breakage. This in turn was found to necessitate rapid SEI repair, consuming electrolyte and shortening cycle life. It was further observed that the electrolyte chemistry, and thus the outer/organic component of the SEI, is a stronger determinant of long Li cycle life than ionic LiF enrichment in the interface, suggesting that&nbsp;such phases are more important to target in future design strategies&nbsp;to improve Li anodes. In a second effort, we fabricated and studied model single-component Li<sub>2</sub>O interfaces on Li and developed an impedance-based method to measure the Li<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;transport properties (<em>i.e</em>., conductivity, charge carrier concentration and diffusivity), which were compared with LiF interfaces formed in a similar manner. Given the difficulty of handling the fragile, reactive native SEI,&nbsp;these properties have never been measured on Li prior to our work. This study revealed that ?SEI? Li<sub>2</sub>O has an ionic conductivity up to 3 orders of magnitude higher that of a bulk stoichiometric phase, and also that Li<sub>2</sub>O conductivity in the SEI is two times higher than that of LiF SEI with similar thickness, suggesting that nanoscopic and defective Li<sub>2</sub>O may better-facilitate ion transport. In a third aspect of the work, we examined the chemical stability and reactivity of Li<sub>2</sub>O and LiF in contact with various electrolytes using impedance analysis and X-ray spectroscopy. It was found that Li<sub>2</sub>O is particularly chemically unstable in contact with LiPF<sub>6</sub>-containing carbonate electrolytes, leading to evolution of organofluorine-rich interfaces that impede ion transport. This work showed that ionic SEI phases should not be considered chemically inert and that it is important to consider the compatibility of such phases with electrolyte solvent and salt to design an improved SEI. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Broadly, this work contributes to research and technology development in the battery, materials science and energy storage fields by revealing&nbsp;new fundamental insights about&nbsp;the Li interface, which inform powerful strategies to improve it&nbsp;through future electrolyte engineering. Besides Li-ion batteries, findings of this work are envisioned relevant to ongoing research efforts on Li-oxygen, Li-sulfur and other advanced Li-based battery chemistries in the field.&nbsp;This research also developed fundamental understanding of how gases react at a Li interface to nucleate and grow nanoscale ionic interfaces, and how such interfaces influence the quality and stability of the resulting films. Educational aspects of this research involved development of educational materials in partnership with the MIT Edgerton Center based on LEGO lessons to teach middle-school students about batteries and electrochemistry; direct mentorship of both middle-school girls and undergraduate MIT students, including students from underrepresented backgrounds; and participation in seminar and workshop activities for advancement of women in the engineering and science fields.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/01/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Betar&nbsp;M&nbsp;Gallant</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1804247/1804247_10574757_1635796210643_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1804247/1804247_10574757_1635796210643_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1804247/1804247_10574757_1635796210643_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(Left) Native, multi-phasic and complex SEI on Li.
