 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports student travel to and participation in the 57th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC), to be held in Miami, FL, December 17-19, 2018. The IEEE CDC has been the world's leading annual forum for engineers and researchers with an interest in systems and control theory as well as control technology. As in previous years, the 57th CDC will feature the presentation of contributed and invited papers, tutorial sessions, plenary and semi-plenary sessions, and workshops. It is anticipated that the conference will draw over 1500 participants, including more than 500 students. Recognizing the importance of students to the present and future of the Control Systems Society (CSS), this award will support CSS in providing funding for students traveling to attend CDC-18.\r\n\r\nThe research topics covered every year by CDC presentations is very broad: this reflects the multitude of applications of controls and systems theory. Control systems have enabled the development of many technologies and infrastructures present in everyday life, from printers to power systems to self-driving cars. Systems and control theoretic tools are central in the design, operation, and security of cyber-physical systems, where they can inform researchers about ways to make large networks (e.g., power, communication, computer, traffic) robust to deliberate and accidental disturbances.\r\n\r\nStudents receiving travel funds from this award to attend CDC will have many opportunities to interact with members of the professional community in a stimulating setting, and to exchange ideas with a broad group of colleagues. The large number of workshops before the conference and the interactive format of many of the presentations will allow additional opportunity for training and learning. Specific outreach effort will be devoted to advertising the conference and the student travel award program to under-represented minorities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
