 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most basic concepts in mathematics is the notion of distance. In different contexts, different notions of distance are relevant. For example, when parallel parking, the goal is to move a car horizontally into a parking space, but this takes a lot more time than driving the car the same distance forwards or backwards. It is natural, therefore, to treat such a horizontal distance in parking as being further than the comparable distance in driving straight forward. Distance measures of this type are known as \"sub-Riemannian\" distances and have played a decisive role in several areas of mathematics. This project concerns generalizations of such distances and their applications to open questions. The principal investigator will consider two important questions in harmonic analysis where such distances are a key component, with the goal of using a deeper understanding of these distances to make progress on open questions. The tools to study these generalized sub-Riemannian distances are borrowed from several different areas of mathematics: differential equations, geometry, and harmonic analysis. They are then applied to questions from other areas of mathematics: several complex variables and singular integrals. The project thus brings together ideas from several areas of mathematics to attack important open questions.\r\n\r\nBy defining a generalized notion of a sub-Riemannian metric, this project introduces two primary areas of inquiry where geometric methods can be applied. The first area is the study of the Bergman and Szego projections on a class of domains of finite type. To study this, the principal investigator plans to develop a generalized notion of scaling in the holomorphic category. This is presented as a quantitative version of the Newlander-Nirenberg theorem. This is the holomorphic analog of the quantitative theory of sub-Riemannian geometry, which has proven to be useful in many areas of analysis and geometry. The second area of study is providing a measure-theoretic approach to singular Radon transforms. Singular Radon transforms have been an active area of research for fifty years, though work has mostly focused on results where the underlying surfaces are smooth. This project introduces a geometry that is intrinsic to a singular Radon transform, through which one can study these operators from a purely measure-theoretic standpoint. The project aims to use this framework to address questions regarding curves where certain types of curvature vanish to infinite order, a topic which has proven unamenable to current methods. The project also explores a new kind of differential equation that arises in inverse problems. In some settings, this differential equation exhibits existence but not uniqueness, while in others it exhibits uniqueness but not existence. Study of this differential equation will be the topic of an undergraduate research project and will use methods developed to study a special case.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOne of the most basic concepts in mathematics is the notion of distance.  In different contexts, different notions of distance are relevant.  For example, when parallel parking, the goal is to move a car horizontally into a parking space, but this takes a lot more time than moving a car forward or backward.  We, therefore, treat such horizontal distances as further than distances when moving forward or backward.  Distances of this type are known as \"sub-Riemannian\" distances and have played a decisive role in several areas of mathematics.\n \n In this project, the PI developed an abstract, quantitative, and general version of scaling with respect to these metrics; while not the first such notion of scaling, this is the sharpest and most general version to date.  A quantitative notion of scaling is particularly important in mathematical analysis.  This is because classical techniques from analysis (e.g., the standard results from calculus) work well on the unit scale.  Thus, if one has a good notion of scaling, then classical techniques can be used to understand results at every scale.  Historically, this has been used in settings where the standard dilation maps on Euclidean space appropriately rescale the problem; this is true, for example, in the setting of elliptic partial differential equations (PDE) and the classical Calderon-Zygmund theory of singular integrals.\n \n However, there are many problems in analysis where the standard dilation maps do not rescale the problem appropriately.  One important setting is when the problem is controlled by a sub-Riemannian distance.  There, one requires scaling adapted to the sub-Riemannian metric, instead of the usual Euclidean (Riemannian) distance.  This arises, for example, in several complex variables and the study of so-called sub-elliptic PDE.\n \n In this project, the investigator applied the above scaling maps to questions from several complex variables and PDE.  One important wrinkle comes in the applications to several complex variables.  Here the scaling maps must respect the complex structure:  they must be holomorphic.  Previous general theories of scaling used maps were not holomorphic, and this makes them inappropriate for applications to several complex variables.  When faced with this difficulty, previous work has introduced ad hoc scaling maps adapted to the particular question, and with no attempt at a general theory.  In this project the PI developed a general theory of holomorphic scaling maps associated to these complex situations and dubbed the corresponding geometries sub-Hermitian.\n \n Another important application is to maximally subelliptic PDE.  These are a far-reaching generalization of elliptic PDE introduced in the 1960s and 1970s.  As is now well-known, these maximally subelliptic PDE are controlled by a sub-Riemannian geometry much as elliptic PDE are controlled by Riemannian geometry.  This makes the above described scaling maps extremely useful for studying maximally subelliptic PDE, and may pave the way for a general theory for maximally subelliptic PDE which is on par with the important theory of elliptic PDE.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/03/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian Street"
