 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this work is to explore the career development and professional identity trajectories of a marginalized group to pursue a career in engineering. Degrees in engineering are an established pathway to a stable, well-paying career, but engineering has historically been predominantly a white, heterosexual, male dominated field. Thus, in order to develop a diverse and well-prepared engineering workforce, there is a critical need for additional research into educational experiences, as well as the professional and academic outcomes of marginalized students as they strive to become competent professionals in the workforce of tomorrow. Companies also stand to benefit from more inclusive environments, as diverse environments contribute significantly to improved engineering outcomes by promoting innovation.\r\n\r\nThrough a series of quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews, this project will first assess the prevalence of engineering disciplines as a career path for marginalized students (e.g., LGBTQ students), and investigate their personal and professional development trajectories across disciplines. In subsequent surveys, the researchers will explore in greater depth the professional and personal identity development experiences of the marginalized students, with specific focus on perceptions of inclusiveness vs. experiences of alienation/marginalization and barriers vs. supports for career development in engineering. This study will grow the knowledge in multiple fields, particularly psychology, engineering education, and various engineering disciplines. The results of this work will be shared with educators and engineers through professional societies, scholarly publications, and participation at conferences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
