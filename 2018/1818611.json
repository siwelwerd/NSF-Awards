 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will fund continued development of methods to process huge volumes of seismic waveform data. This will lead to a great increase in the number of located and characterized seismic events of various kinds and will potentially identify patterns in earthquake occurrence that could inform hazard and near-term rupture forecasting. The initial \"Mining Seismic Wavefields\" NSF Geoinformatics grant has led to significant progress dealing with data volumes that would have been impossible to process when the project began. This award will fund an additional year of that effort and will maintain this momentum in technique development to complete the analysis of proof-of-concept projects on vast waveform data sets, and to deploy the cyberinfrastructure for wider use by the seismological community.\r\n\r\nThe premise of the research is that continuous and/or densely recorded data coupled with high performance computing and scalable algorithms can enable a network-based approach to earthquake detection that greatly improves the detection of weak and unusual events that would be difficult or impossible to detect using traditional approaches. Numerous seismological observations confirm that proximal earthquake sources generate similar signals. Exploiting the discriminative power of this similarity has led to many fundamental discoveries; however, most similarity-based detection methods require prior knowledge of the source waveform, or template. Blind/uninformed search for signals having unknown signatures based on pair-wise or multiple matches has seen some success, but na\u00efve implementations of this approach suffer from quadratic scaling of computation with time such that problems of interest are inaccessible  even for the most capable computers. Similarly, for dense networks, the availability of continuous waveform data motivates alternative detection schemes based on waveform similarity at adjacent stations. This project will further develop efficient data-mining techniques to enable scalable similarity search of seismic wavefields. Technical challenges to be addressed as part of the research for spatially sparse recording are to develop improved similarity-preserving compression for repeating signals detected over a network, and to improve post-processing of search output that will both isolate signals of seismological interest and minimize false detections. For spatially dense recording, this would extend recently developed wavefield matching techniques to similarity across adjacent stations, which would enable similarity search across unaliased elastic wavefields in four dimensions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The key concept for event detection is based on the similarities between different earthquakes recorded at the same station, and the similarities between adjacent stations generated by the same event.</p>\n<p>Our group efforts in the past few years have been focusing on the following directions: We developed a novel method for seismic event detection that can be applied to large?N arrays (Li et al., Sci. Rep. 2018). The method is based on a new detection function named local similarity, which quantifies the signal coherence between the examined station and its nearest neighbors. Using the 5200?station Long Beach nodal array, we demonstrated that stacked local similarity functions can be used to detect very weak events below noise levels with high confidence. We also applied the same method to the 2016 IRIS community nodal wavefield experiment (Li et al., SRL, 2018), and found many long-duration, long-period events during the one-month deployment that were likely associated with nearby train activities.</p>\n<p>In the section direction, we applied the GPU?based waveform matching methods around the occurrence times of several large earthquakes to detect foreshocks, early aftershocks and remotely triggered seismicity (Li et al., GJI, 2018; Peng et al., BSSA, 2018; Jia et al., EPSL, 2020; Daniels et al., SRL, 2020; Yao et al., JGR, 2020, EPSL, 2021). These newly detected earthquakes helped to better understand the underlying physical mechanisms of earthquake interaction and nucleation. In addition to detecting microseismicity, we also measure differential arrival times based on waveform cross?correlations and perform detailed relocations to better understand spatio?temporal evolutions of microseismicity. For example, Figure 1 shows that we the template matching method, we detected about ten times more foreshocks than listed in the standard catalog preceding the 2010 M7.2 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake (Yao et al., JGR, 2020). These newly detected events showed both migration and cascade-triggering behaviors, suggesting that combined effects of aseismic slip and cascading failure likely drive this foreshock sequences.</p>\n<p>Finally, we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) for seismic phase detection and phase picking (Zhu et al., PEPI, 2019). The CNN model was trained from ~900 aftershocks of the 2008 M7.9 Wenchuan, China earthquake, and recorded by 14 stations made available during a Seismolympics competition for phase detection. We regard the seismic phase detection problem as a classification process, and use 20-second three-component waveform as input of the CNN, and probability of P/S/Noise as output labels (Figure 2). When applying to one-month of continuous waveform, CPIC detects 97.5% of the manually picked phases in the standard catalog and predicts their arrival times with a five-times improvement over other standard phase picker. When tested on a small dataset from a different region (Oklahoma, US), the model achieves 97% accuracy after fine tuning only the fully connected layer of the model. This result suggests that the CNN model developed in this study can be used to identify and pick P/S arrivals in other regions with no or minimum labeled phases.</p>\n<p>This project provided full or partial supports for 4 graduate students at Georgia Tech.
