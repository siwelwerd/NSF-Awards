 "awd_abstract_narration": "To avoid major global food disruptions by 2050, crop productions rates must improve. One way to help improve crop production rates is to provide farmers with real-time data on soil health so they can make better-informed agricultural decisions, particularly during the growing season. Soil data is crucial, but extremely difficult to obtain. Researchers and farmers often rely of soil sampling methods that are not representative of overall field health. This project will use sensors powered by microbes to measure soil moisture and soil nutrients. These sensors will detect these soil variables using radio waves, and, along with detailed mathematical models of the sensors and their surroundings, extract comprehensive information on soil health.  The rate at which the microbes generate power for these sensors will also provide data on soil activity. More importantly, the radio waves used for measurement will sense overall conditions rather than just single points in a field, thus eliminating the need for constant manual soil sampling.  This unique combination of sensors and mathematical models will thus collect hard to obtain soil information that can help farmers make more informed decisions about agricultural practices. If successful, this research could help improve crop production rates and ensure the Nation's food security through 2050 demands.\r\n\r\nThis proposal uses multidisciplinary methods to create a fused sensor for soil microbial activity and non-point monitoring of soil moisture, multi-ion nitrogen cycling, and nutrient availability. The project is based on three ideas. The first idea is to use subsurface microbial fuel cells (MFCs) to power an impedance spectroscopy sensor (ISS) operating from 0.04 to 1.0 megahertz. Because water and various single-ion solutions have electromagnetic permittivities that differentially vary with frequency, appropriate signal processing will be able to disambiguate ionic concentrations in the soil water mixture. This is not possible with normal soil conductivity sensors. As a bulk volumetric measurement, ISS ameliorates the problem of soil variability that cannot be adequately captured by point sensors.  For the second idea, the MFC will sense soil microbial activity. Metal anodes at different depths and redox potentials will be dip-coated with a protective polymer coating doped with enzymes that exclude endogenous soil microbes from the anode biofilm and create anaerobic conditions at the point of power generation. In these anaerobic conditions, organic acids will be produced to fuel the MFC. At each point in time, the power generated by the MFC will reflect the soil microbes as they metabolize soil carbon and nutrients near the sensor. In addition, the ISS will periodically monitor internal properties of the MFC. For the third idea, the project will develop a continuous-time, partial differential equation model linking soil solute movement, thermal dynamics, soil chemical kinetics, electrical redox processes, microbial activity, and basic root/shoot growth. This model will yield the desired data on soil moisture, ionic concentrations, and microbial activity based on the measured values of multi-frequency permittivities and the MFC output currents. In addition to this research, the principle investigators will collaborate with the local Manhattan Sunset Zoo and Manhattan high school teachers to develop classroom lessons on soil sensing technologies and soil processes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Wheat, this project\u2019s focus, accounts for 20% of all calories consumed by humanity either directly, or indirectly via its use as animal feed.  But its yield increase rates are only 25 pct. of those needed.  It is thus essential to better monitor and manage soil water, nutrients, and soil microbial health to increase crop productivity.  Doing so requires intellectually meritorious innovations in sensors, data science and modeling, along with computational infrastructure from farm to fork, but nowhere more so than where all crop plants live, namely, in the soil.  This connects to three of NSF\u2019s Ten Big Ideas (\"Understanding the Rules of Life\", \"Harnessing the Data Revolution\", and \"The Future of Work\" in agriculture) plus two National Academy of Engineering Grand Challenges (\"Managing the Global Nitrogen Cycle\", and \"Engineering the Tools of Scientific Discovery\").  Such efforts will have broad impacts beyond wheat on the digital agricultural management of many grain and non-grain crops.\n\nThis project had three objectives.  The first concerned soil microbial fuel cells (MFCs).  Just like fuel cells in cars, MFCs produce electricity but exploit the chemical reactions that energize soil-dwelling microbial species.  The more nutrients (e.g., dissolved organic carbons and nitrogen compounds) there are in the soil solution, the greater the microbial activity and, therefore, power generation.  Thus, MFC voltages are potential proxies for microbial activity.  Extensive amounts of data were collected on MFC outputs given different soil types, nutrients, etc.  The testing was done by grad student, Manjot Rekhi and Research Associate Ruwandi Kumarasinghe, both in the Agronomy Dept. under the supervision of Dr. Ganga Hettiarachchi. Fig. 1, shows several MFCs being tested.\n\nThe soil microbiome, however, includes many microbial forms.  In addition, the electrogenic microbes (i.e., involved in power generation) function best under anaerobic conditions.  Thus, protective coatings were designed to encapsulate biofilms of desired bacteria (Fig.2).  The coatings consisted of polyethylene glycol-based hydrogels that were formulated to be stable under acidic and basic environments while enabling transport of nutrients necessary for microbial function. Coating formulation was contributed to by Suna Jo and Niloufar Fattahi, Chemical Engineering grad students under the supervision of Dr. Ryan Hansen.

Hansen and Parameswaran\u2019s teams also successfully tested the coating\u2019s ability to protect biofilms against harsh chemical environments, specifically ammonia shocks.   \n\nA second objective was to use an MFC to power a specialized sensor to gather more data on soil nutrients.  The soil\u2019s ability to \"conduct\" (or, taking the opposite view, \"impede\") electrical current depends on the amount of moisture present, the mix and concentrations of dissolved chemicals (like plant nutrients), and the electronic frequency of the applied current.  Importantly, these all vary in ways that are not proportional to each other, especially to frequency.  Moreover, electronic impedance has two effects &ndash; the first reduces the amount of current flow and, for currents alternating at some frequency (e.g., 60 cycle wall current), and the second changes the current\u2019s \"phase\", i.e. the arrival times of its maximums and minimums.  Therefore, the possibility exists that by measuring soil impedance at many different frequencies, one might be able to mathematically disentangle all these effects to back out the amounts of moisture and various nutrients present.  Measuring the effects of different frequencies is called \"spectroscopy\" and so we sought to design and build an \"impedance spectroscopy sensor\" (ISS).  This entailed evaluating a range of possible electrode materials (Fig. 3) to find a substance providing adequate contact to a wide variety of soils, developing multifrequency scanning protocols, and testing numerous nutrient concentrations to provide the raw data needed (Fig. 4).  This work was done by a team consisting of Civil Engineering grad students Saikat Kuili and Kyle Parr under the direction of Dr. Stacey Kulesza.\n\nThe third objective was to create a dynamic, soil/sensor system model to estimate soil data by inversion from logged variables like MFC voltages.  A large ensemble of physics-based and empirical models was initially envisioned but this now seems to be an overly complex procedure, in some cases requiring extensive prior data about the sensor\u2019s emplacement point (e.g, texture, porosity, pH).  We now look toward installing the sensors and, during a burn-in phase, using onboard neural ordinary equation networks (Fig. 5) to machine learn site particulars along with the relationships between raw sensor outputs and the variables of interest.  Despite the covid-generated delays that accumulated during the project, we have now, at its close, formulated plausible AI models and will carry their testing forward with other support.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/03/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stephen M Welch"
