 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to improve the paleoclimate record and the broader scientific understanding of past and future hydrologic variability in the South Atlantic Gulf Basin (AGB) and Southeastern (SE) United States by carrying out a three-year research program to investigate pre-instrumental streamflow and associated climate variability in this region. \r\n\r\nThe principle goals of the research program are to develop quantitative, multi-century, tree-ring reconstructions and to assess the risk of future streamflow in the SE and AGB.  The specific aims of this project are to 1) develop streamflow reconstructions for eight major, coastal, interstate rivers; 2) conduct inter-basin comparisons to identify spatial and temporal patterns of common and disparate streamflow variability across the region; 3) provide novel insights on how the dynamical modes of climate variability (e.g., El Nino-Southern Oscillation, the North Atlantic Sub-tropical High, and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation) force regional expressions of climate change, hydrological variability, extreme drought and pluvial events, and potential regime shifts over the past 500-1,000 years and 4) characterize the risk of future streamflow and extreme events in these watersheds.\r\n\r\nThis research will provide insight into not only the long-term variability of streamflow, but will also shed light on the associated physical, social, economic and ecological impacts this variability has on coastal watersheds in the AGB and SE US.  Improved understanding of streamflow variability will directly benefit the development of water policy in SE, by informing a variety of socially and economically relevant areas related to water withdrawals, streamflow forecasts, drought and flood mitigation.\r\n\r\nRecent work on the Suwannee River (Florida) provides a successful example of how streamflow in the Southeast can be reconstructed over multiple centuries with high variance explained (R2=0.68) and robust validation statistics (RE, 0.71; CE, 0.81), in addition to providing novel insight into the controls of past hydroclimate to characterize and manage the risk of future streamflow in the AGB and SE.\r\n\r\nThe potential Broader Impacts include the potential for enhanced understanding of both the history of hydroclimate variability (especially extreme low flow events) and the role of regional and large-scale climate forcing mechanisms that drive streamflow variability.  This project seeks to provide information useful for applied risk management around hydrologic extremes in the South Atlantic Gulf Basin (AGB) and Southeastern (SE) United States region. Understanding the timing and magnitude of past events and having accurate future forecasting is crucial for public and private stakeholders to prepare for the future and increase resiliency.  In addition, by characterizing past, present and future streamflow and the risk of extreme events in the AGB and SE watersheds, this research will advance knowledge of how to protect and sustain riparian zones, coastal watersheds and surrounding lands now and into the future.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Because tree growth is sensitive to soil moisture changes in a similar way as streamflow, we were able to use tree rings to estimate past streamflow, for several centuries in the past. We found that when expanding these streamflow records, we were able to detect long-term changes in streamflow behavior. In South Carolina, we found that high levels of streamflow have become more common and has resulted in more flooding than has been experienced in almost 1000 years. This increase in flooding is the result of atmospheric circulation patterns, steering more moisture into the Atlantic Southeast of the US.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In northwestern Florida, we used&nbsp;28 trees from two sites located adjacent to the Choctawhatchee River to develop a false ring record extending from 1881 to 2014. Twenty false ring events were recorded during the available instrumental era (1931?2014). All 20 of the false-ring events recorded during the instrumental period occurred during years in which greatly increased streamflow occurred late in the growing season. Many of these wet events appear to be the result of rainfall resulting from landfalling tropical cyclones. We also found that the intra-annual position of false rings within growth rings reflects streamflow variability and combining the false-ring record with tree ring width chronologies improves the estimation of overall summer streamflow by 14%.</p>\n<p>For heavily litigated, interstate rivers of the Southeast, we&nbsp;used streamflow data from five gages near the Alabama-Florida border and centuries-long tree-ring chronologies to create and analyze seasonal flow reconstructions.&nbsp;The long-term streamflow variability was analyzed for the Choctawhatchee, Conecuh, Escambia, and Perdido Rivers, and the recent (2000s) drought was identified as being the most severe in the instrumental record. The 2000s drought was also identified as being one of the most severe droughts throughout the entire reconstructed paleo-record developed for all five rivers.</p>\n<p>We were able to examine different aspects of streamflow across the Southeast to determine what tree growth is responding to. Stormflow represents the increase in streamflow from storms. Baseflow represent fluctuations in streamflow from changes in groundwater. We found that streamflow in South Carolina was most sensitive to baseflow. This allows streamflow reconstruction to better connect with models that water managers examine and use in their planning for flooding and drought. In a study of false ring formation in relation to flow variability, we found that false-ring events recorded during the instrumental period occurred during years in which greatly increased streamflow occurred late in the growing season. Many of these wet events appeared to be the result of rainfall resulting from landfalling tropical cyclones. We also found that the intra-annual position of false rings within growth rings reflects streamflow variability and combining the false-ring record with tree-ring width chronologies statistically improved the estimation of overall summer streamflow. In the case of the Alabama-Florida interstate rivers,&nbsp;knowledge of previous years? droughts and pluvial events is critical when making water policy decisions. With the combined stressors of population growth, interstate water wars, and climate change, it is imperative for Florida water managers and planners to have a full understanding of hydrologic parameters in the region. The 2000s drought was also identified as being one of the most severe droughts throughout the entire reconstructed paleo-record developed for all five rivers, and this information is vital for the consideration of present and future conditions within the systems.&nbsp;Further, this project provided several opportunities for education. A total of three graduate students and one undergraduate student from the University of Idaho were able to learn the techniques of sampling trees, preparation of samples, and the statistical analyses associated with reconstructing streamflow using tree rings.
