 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Description\r\n\r\nThis project aims to develop improved controls strategies that can aid in reducing the cost of energy for floating offshore wind farms.  The primary purpose of wind turbine controls is for regulating power production as the wind environment changes.  However, control strategies that best harness wind energy for floating wind farms have yet to be investigated.  Improving the cost-competitiveness of floating offshore wind turbine technology is essential for meeting the U.S. Department of Energy?s Wind Vision target of harnessing 86 GW of wind energy by 2050.  In particular, nearly 60% of the U.S. offshore wind resource resides in water deeper than 60 meters, which requires floating, rather than fixed-bottom, wind turbine technology.   This project will yield several important benefits, including improvements to publicly available floating wind turbine farm simulation tools and models that are used by numerous researchers in the U.S. and around the world.  In addition, the curriculum for the University of Maine Mechanical Engineering program will be strengthened in the areas of control systems and renewable energy as a result this project.  In turn, these curriculum enhancements will better prepare University of Maine mechanical engineering graduates with STEM skills needed to advance cost effective offshore wind energy production.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this project is to formulate, implement and quantify the performance of advanced floating wind offshore turbine farm control methodologies integrating multiple inputs and control actions through using comprehensive numerical simulations.  This project will improve the powerful, open-source computer-aided-engineering tool FAST.Farm for the simulation of floating wind turbine farms currently being developed at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  This tool is of high interest to offshore wind researchers and designers as it is robust, computationally efficient, and permits the analysis of entire wind farms.  With this improved tool, the proposed research will explore several novel active wind turbine blade pitch, generator torque, nacelle yaw and fluid-structure coupling control architectures that seek to maximize energy capture and minimize structural loads for a floating wind farm.  New nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) schemes will be tested that incorporate feedforward LiDAR wind measurements and critical floating platform degrees of freedom.  These NMPC techniques will be extended to permit individual blade control that minimize asymmetric rotor loading resulting from wind shear, atmospheric turbulence and nacelle yaw error.   Farm-level wake steering algorithms will be enhanced to account for the significant lateral movement floating wind turbines can undergo due to mean environmental loads.  The influence of low-cost, active fluid-structure coupling tuned mass systems employing existing hull water ballast on the improvements in floating wind turbine global performance will also be investigated.  The proposed research will ultimately pioneer active control methodologies that can significantly reduce the cost of energy for a floating wind farm.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe overarching outcome of this project was the development of a novel floating wind turbine controller that is effective for a variety of floating wind turbine platform types.  Wind turbine controllers continuously adjust the rotor speed and angular position of the rotor blades to smoothly regulate electric power production, however, standard control methods do not work for floating wind turbines.  These standard control schemes cause excessive motions and structural loads for wind turbines mounted to floating platforms which move significantly more than their land-based counterparts when subjected to environmental loads from winds, waves and currents.  The developed controller, which incorporates feedback from motion of the floating wind turbine, provides smooth power production similar to that achieved on a standard land-based wind turbine while also mitigating the excessive motions that a standard controller would cause.  Mid-fidelity simulations were performed that demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed controller for a variety of floating platforms types, this being important as many floating platform concepts are viable for floating wind turbine technology.  In addition to the development of the novel floating wind turbine controller, strategies for controlling the motion of the floating platform ballast water were investigated that minimize floating wind turbine motions and loads, permitting smaller, more cost-effective systems that reduce the cost to produce electricity.  Finally, a module was created for the University of Maine\u2019s Wind Energy Engineering course which provides instruction on wind turbine control theory and techniques employing modern software tools.  This course is offered once every two years and typically has 50 to 70 students enrolled.\n\nAs a result of this project, financial support and training for a faculty member and three graduate students at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory was provided.  Two of these students currently work as engineers in the wind industry, with the third employed in the aerospace industry.  The connections and technologies that grew out of this effort have led to new funding and projects generated with National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  These new projects focus on generating public data sets of floating wind turbine dynamic behavior including modern control techniques, as well as the development of new structural hull control methods.  These projects total several million dollars and have generated commercially-viable technology that can advance the floating wind industry.\n\nThe results of this project pertaining to the novel wind turbine controller have been documented in two peer-reviewed conference papers.  These conferences comprise the two largest marine engineering-related conferences in the world, one being sponsored by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the other by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers.  Manuscript covering more recent work involving the use of floating wind turbine platform ballast water for reducing motions of the floating wind turbine structure are in preparation.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/30/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew Goupee"
