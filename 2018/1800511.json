 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organic synthetic chemistry is driven by the ongoing need to find efficient ways to construct carbon-based molecules from readily available starting materials. With this award, Professor Brian Stoltz at Caltech is synthesizing two complex naturally occurring molecules using novel approaches that have not been previously utilized for this purpose. These classes of molecules can be of benefit to society, particularly as medicinal agents in the treatment of debilitating and life-threatening diseases such as cancer. The research team is also studying new methods for making other important carbon-based molecules. Professor Stoltz strongly supports a variety of outreach programs with the intent of teaching and inspiring future scientists. With this award he is offering summer undergraduate research positions in his laboratory for exceptional students and providing science demonstrations at local elementary schools. Outreach programs such as these encourage participation from groups that are otherwise underrepresented in the sciences.\r\n\r\nProfessor Stoltz is exploring various strategies for the syntheses of two structurally intriguing natural products, namely scabrolide A and curcusone C. The total syntheses of these targets have not yet been reported. Although distinct, these compounds have several common structural features that relate the project at an intellectual level. Most notably, both targets contain a carbon-based polycyclic framework possessing either a peripherally-fused or centrally-fused cycloheptane ring, respectively. The [5,6,7]-tricyclic framework of scabrolide A is being constructed via a ring-closing metathesis (RCM) and transannular Diels-Alder strategy, whereas the [5,7,6] core of curcusone C is being synthesized by means of a cross-electrophile coupling and Michael-type annulation. Professor Stoltz and his students are currently engaged in various outreach activities in order to encourage talented young scientists to explore similar projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe science of synthesis and the evolution of new fundamental reactions are invaluable to many scientific endeavors.  For example, the fields of medicinal chemistry, bioorganic chemistry, molecular biology, inorganic chemistry, organometallic chemistry, and physical organic chemistry depend greatly on the basic ability to synthesize new compounds.  Fundamentally, chemistry possesses the power to manipulate the elements for the preparation of specific arrays of atoms in a predictable and reliable fashion.  As synthetic chemists, our capacity to construct molecules with exquisite precision is unique in the sciences.  Any development that enhances our ability to assemble compounds more efficiently will have a direct impact on the aforementioned disciplines in a meaningful and quantitative manner.  In a broader sense, innovative chemical synthesis continues to profoundly benefit biology and human medicine, largely through medicinal chemistry and process research and development.  We have been deeply engaged in a multifaceted and integrated program in organic synthesis that encompasses the areas of multistep total synthesis design and tactical implementation.  Advances toward the research goals of these projects has furthered our understanding of organic reactivity and increased our technological capabilities in synthesis, which has served as a cornerstone enabling technology and field unto itself.  Of particular interest has been the development of new synthetic strategies and tactics for the synthesis of substituted 7-membered ring containing complex molecules.  Ultimately, the goals of our studies are to increase the synthetic toolbox and develop new processes that will be of broad utility and interest to the synthetic community, and to apply these processes to the synthesis of challenging molecules.  We have completed a convergent, asymmetric total synthesis of Scabrolide A and related norcembranoid natural products and developed an approach to the asymmetric total synthesis of Curcusone C and its structural relatives.  Advances toward these goals has furthered our understanding of organic reactivity and increased our technological capabilities in synthesis, which has served as a cornerstone enabling technology and field unto itself.  Through the course of the project, numerous students and postdoctoral scholars have received valuable training in both accomplishing practical chemistry and in utilization of the scientific method to solve complex problems. These trainees will be better prepared to enter diverse fields in which analytical and critical evaluation of evidence serve as the primary currency.  In addition to the on-site, laboratory science pursued under this award, our research group is also committed to the early scientific training of future generations.  We have continued our ongoing teaching and outreach efforts with the broader community that are envisioned to impact the lives and decisions of the next generation of students.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/17/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian M Stoltz"
