Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Anastasia M. Chavez is \"Stochastic and Classical Matroid Theory\". The host institution for the fellowship is the University of California, Davis, and the sponsoring scientist is Jesus De Loera.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
