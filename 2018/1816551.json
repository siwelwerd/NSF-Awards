 "awd_abstract_narration": "Probabilistic frameworks provide fundamental descriptions of turbulent fluid flows while on the other hand serving as an invaluable basis for quantifying uncertainties in the modeling and measurement of these flows.  While it has long been understood that a probabilistic approach is indispensable, a wealth of basic questions remain unresolved in the analysis and application of probabilistic methodologies. Moreover, the field of probabilistic fluid dynamics has been enlivened by significant recent theoretical and computational developments, the ever-growing torrent of heterogeneous data corrupted by noise and by the ongoing need for refined statistical tools for applications in climate science and in geophysics.\r\n\r\nAgainst this backdrop, this project undertakes a program of research at the intersection of stochastic analysis, nonlinear partial differential equations and fluid dynamics. A diverse collection of mathematical problems concerning turbulent flows addressing both theoretical foundations and the quantification of uncertainties in measurement will be considered. The research program centers around the setting of infinite dimensional Markovian systems and their invariant measures (i.e. statistically steady states) as a means of determining the robust observability of statistical quantities. Here cutting-edge tools from probability, computational statistics, ergodic theory and functional analysis provide a unified basis for tackling challenging open problems and developing novel theoretical foundations in: 1) The ergodic theory of invariant measures for nonlinear Stochastic PDEs. 2) The dependence of invariant measures on physical and numerical parameters. 3) The Bayesian computational setting for incorporating noisy measurements to estimate degrees of uncertainty in fluid flows.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This NSF funded project contributed to this general scientific domain of inquiry by drawing on and developing basic mathematical tools from stochastic processes, partial differential equations (PDEs), computational statistics, numerical analysis and scientific computing. Overall our efforts led to novel computational techniques while setting down rigorous foundations justifying new and/or widely used\nmethodologies.\n\n\nSpecifically our work addressed basic questions organized around the following interconnected research directions:\n\nTime asymptotic behavior of solutions in stochastic models of fluid flow. Over a series of works we developed approaches to quantify the robust observability of statistical quantities in a family of related nonlinear, stochastically driven, partial differential equations. Notably, this family included the Navier-Stokes equations, geophysical and astrophysical variants as well as models of compressible flow. This work provides some important justifications for certain ansatz used to quantify turbulence in fluid flow.\nLong time accuracy under physical or numerical approximations to\nstochastic models in fluid dynamics. We formulated strategies to\nquantify bias over long time horizons when employing approximations\nfor certain models. In this context we qualitatively addressed bias in physical parameter limits in geophysical models. In recently completed work supported by this grant we provided the first long time rigorous bounds on numerical approximations of the stochastic Navier-Stokes equations. \nBayesian PDE inverse problems involving the measurement\nof high dimensional fluid flow characteristics. We formulated and\nrigorously analyzed two physically motivated model problems in the\nframework of Bayesian statistical inversion: a) the recovery of a flow\nfield from the observation of the concentration of a passive solute placed \nin the fluid medium b) the estimation of a fluid domain shape from flow measurements. These two inverse problems serve both as testing ground for recently discovered monte carlo sampling algorithms and as a basis for novel domain applications. Moreover, for the first model problem, we have been considering the question of consistency, i.e. the complete recovery of the unknown parameter, in the large data limit.\nIdentification and rigorous analysis of Monte Carlo sampling\nalgorithms to numerically resolve statistical models. Our work\ndeveloped methods based on high dimensional (Markovian) stochastic\nprocesses to effectively resolve measures on collections of functions\n(i.e. infinite-dimensional distributions). This markov chain monte carlo (MCMC) sampling work was partially motivated by the need to resolve the Bayesian PDE estimation problems in the previous item. Meanwhile our approach drew heavily on ideas and techniques we developed in the first two items. Highlights of our work includes a unified theory of bias for a certain class of MCMC methods resulting in novel algorithms. We also established rigorous bounds on numerical accuracy for some methods based on Hamiltonian mechanics.\n\n\n\nThis project supported the mentorship of graduate students and postdoctoral \nfellows. Our work was disseminated through invited talks and co-organized \nsessions in domestic and international conferences and research seminars.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/02/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: NathanEGlatt-Holtz\n"
