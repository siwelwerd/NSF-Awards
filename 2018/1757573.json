 "awd_abstract_narration": "The REU program \"Applied Mathematics and Computational Modeling in the Greater Phoenix Area\" is aimed at providing summer research experiences to mathematically talented undergraduate students from 2-year institutions and 4-year liberal arts colleges who wouldn't otherwise participate in practical, cutting-edge research in applied mathematics and computational modeling. The program consists of two integral components --- a two-week preparatory module for students from the Maricopa County Community College District, followed by an eight-week research experience for all participants. The preparatory module will expose students to mathematical topics that are not covered in a typical community college curriculum, including a mix of interesting \"real world\" problems and an introduction to numerical computations, which the students will then use during the research period. Following the two-week course module, students will work in small groups of 3-4 on problems suggested by mentors, in areas of interesting overlap across research groups. Participating students will learn applied mathematical concepts and numerical tools that model space- and time-dependent dynamical processes. They will also be exposed to enrichment activities including relevant research seminars and workshops on STEM opportunities and career services. \r\n\r\nThe overall goal of the REU program is to expand research opportunities for place-bound community college and liberal arts college students; engage community college students to matriculate into Baccalaureate programs; guide students in scholarship and graduate school applications; and establish a supporting network to assist students throughout their undergraduate programs. To realize these goals, the curriculum is designed to provide opportunities to undergraduate mathematics and science majors to work as part of a team on an interdisciplinary problem; read journal articles to gain some background on a new subject quickly; analyze open-ended problems using computer simulation as a discovery tool; and present a talk on their work at the end of the program and (optionally) at an appropriate research conference. Students are also encouraged to continue collaboration with mentors remotely, leading to publications in archival journals. The summer research will address problems related to weather prediction, atmospheric dynamics, aviation hazard analyses and forecasting; image processing and Fourier analysis; network dynamics and topology; and mathematical models of cancer (especially brain and prostate cancer). Students will be supervised by experienced faculty in their respective fields. By reaching out to community colleges, the program will tap into diverse talents from underrepresented minority groups and increase their research participation in mathematics and STEM fields. Special efforts will be made to recruit students who are first-generation college students as well as students who are female and/or members of underrepresented groups in the mathematical sciences. This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
