 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:\r\n\r\nHigh-voltage low-current power-electronic converters that can deliver voltages between 10s to 100s of kV and currents in the 1-100 mA range play a critical role in many medical, environmental, and aerospace applications, established or emerging. In many of those applications, a compact and lightweight high-voltage power supply is desirable if not essential. Unfortunately, conventional technologies are inefficient, heavy, and bulky. This project seeks to develop a new generation of lightweight and efficient high voltage power converters that will enable many promising applications. The fundamental idea is to leverage radio frequency circuit techniques and the recent introduction of high-performance wide-bandgap semiconductor power transistors. This project will make possible many high-voltage applications that have previously been considered impractical, thereby creating new research and business opportunities. A miniaturized power supply that can reach 10s of kV in a fraction of a millisecond will enhance the portability and safety of X-ray systems. These power supplies can also enable smaller and cheaper particle-beam accelerators to make ion and neutron sources more readily available. These systems can be used to detect harmful substances, explosives and map the distribution of petroleum in an oil well. Other applications can become possible with a dramatic reduction in the size and weight of a high voltage converter, like a new kind of electrohydrodynamic aerial vehicle that uses no moving parts and with very low noise and heat profile.\r\n\r\nInvestigators will develop a small and lightweight dc-dc power converter capable of generating an output voltage close to 100 kV. One of the most promising candidates for such goal is high-frequency multi-stage class-DE rectifiers with inductive isolation. In the principal investigator's previous works on multi-stage class-DE rectifiers, the dc output voltage is limited to the breakdown voltage of capacitors with high-quality factors. With the insertion of an air-core transformer, the output voltage upper limit is enhanced up to the breakdown potential between transformer primary and secondary windings. Parallel-input series-output connection of rectifiers in conjunction with high-frequency operation leads to fast rise and fall times, making the circuit particularly suitable for systems that require pulsed dc voltage. Regarding power density (output power per unit volume) and specific power (output power per unit mass), the developed power converter is expected to be superior to state-of-the-art existing converters by at least an order of magnitude and hence will enable or improve many technologies that require high voltage source. In a later stage of the project, efforts will be made to prove the practicality of the developed high-voltage power supplies by building prototypes of target applications including an electrohydrodynamic aerial vehicle, an X-ray tube, and a neutron source.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The low output capacitance and gate capacitance of wide-bandgap devices allow one to drive a transistor at high frequency in a power-efficient manner. Inductors and transformers built with a low-permeability magnetic core allow optimized component sizes. Meanwhile, by using resonant converter topologies, one can eliminate hard-switching power losses and minimize unwanted effects of parasitic circuit elements. As a result of all these factors, the benefits of high-frequency switching can be reaped without compromise in power conversion efficiency.</p>\n<p>The biggest advantage of switching at a higher frequency is that smaller inductors and capacitors can be used to process the same amount of power. For that reason, the weight and size of the circuit can be reduced by increasing the frequency. This is especially true for a voltage multiplier which includes many capacitors and thus greatly benefits from the size reduction of passive components.</p>\n<p>In this project, we firstly investigated the design of a planar PCB transformer that achieves high voltage isolation in a small, repeatable, and low-cost manner. Fast switching allows using small inductance values. When the inductance values are small enough, the magnetic core of inductors and transformers can be eliminated altogether. Building a high voltage power supply with coreless inductors and transformers opens some new design space, such as implementing those elements by one or more spiral traces on a PCB. For experimental validation, we placed a spiral trace on the top layer of a PCB and another trace on the bottom layer. In this manner, a coreless transformer is formed in which the PCB's dielectric material acts as a high voltage insulator.</p>\n<p>Second, we presented a new voltage multiplier topology that is a hybrid of Cockcroft-Walton (series) and Dickson (parallel) multipliers. Many kilovolts-range capacitors available on the market have a small capacitance in the range of a few nanofarads or less. Increasing the switching frequency allows the use of those capacitors with smaller capacitance values and higher voltage headroom for building a voltage multiplier. The proposed multiplier topology makes use of that extra headroom. As a result, this new multiplier topology exhibits a lower output impedance than a Cockcroft-Walton multiplier and requires a lower capacitor voltage rating than a Dickson multiplier.</p>\n<p>Third, we explored a method to build a miniature high voltage generator for small centimeter-scale robots. The proposed design takes advantage of small component sizes, which are made possible by high-frequency switching. The resonant dc-to-RF conversion followed by a voltage multiplier achieves 3.7 volts-to-several kilovolts dc-to-dc conversion at an efficiency higher than 70 percent. The entire circuit is implemented on a flexible circuit board so that it can be folded into a box shape and easily integrated into small robotic platforms. We published the building method of the power supply and demonstrated a perch-and-stare drone as an application example. The miniature power supply drives an electroadhesive pad that is attached to the drone, and, as a result, the drone can perch on the ceiling and prolong its battery life.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we presented a rather unique approach of using a pulsed laser to generate a high voltage dc. To achieve extreme input-to-output voltage isolation, power is delivered using fiber coupled laser, and the receiver converts the optical energy to electrical energy via a photovoltaic cell. The novelty of the proposed scheme is that the laser is pulsed at the resonant frequency of the LC network of the receiver circuit. The LC resonance not only increases the achievable output dc voltage but also allows one to implement the receiver without an inverter circuit, which is usually necessary in most power-over-fiber systems.</p>\n<p>Throughout this project we have explored several ideas that can be useful in building a high voltage dc generator that is smaller and lighter than conventional designs. Since many of those ideas are hinged on high-frequency switching, as the technology progresses for high-frequency power electronics, we believe the presented ideas will become more relevant over time.<br /><br /></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/19/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Juan Manuel&nbsp;Rivas-Davila</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1808489/1808489_10570566_1636330033889_shrimp--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1808489/1808489_10570566_1636330033889_shrimp--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Miniature battery-powered 3 kV generator for robotics applications\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1808489/1808489_10570566_1636330033889_shrimp--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Miniature battery-powered 3 kV generator for robotics applications\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Miniature battery-powered 3 kV generator for robotics applications</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sanghyeon Park and Juan Rivas-Davila</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Juan Manuel&nbsp;Rivas-Davila</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Miniature battery-powered 3 kV generator for robotics applications</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1808489/1808489_10570566_1636329979915_hybrid--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1808489/1808489_10570566_1636329979915_hybrid--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Hybrid voltage multiplier topology\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1808489/1808489_10570566_1636329979915_hybrid--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Hybrid voltage multiplier topology\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Hybrid voltage multiplier topology</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sanghyeon Park and Juan Rivas-Davila</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Juan Manuel&nbsp;Rivas-Davila</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Hybrid voltage multiplier topology</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1808489/1808489_10570566_1636329916053_pcbtr--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1808489/1808489_10570566_1636329916053_pcbtr--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"PCB transformers for high voltage isolation\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1808489/1808489_10570566_1636329916053_pcbtr--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"PCB transformers for high voltage isolation\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">PCB transformers for high voltage isolation</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sanghyeon Park and Juan Rivas-Davila</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Juan Manuel&nbsp;Rivas-Davila</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">PCB transformers for high voltage isolation</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1808489/1808489_10570566_1636330194588_laser--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1808489/1808489_10570566_1636330194588_laser--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Optically powered modular 15 kV dc generator\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1808489/1808489_10570566_1636330194588_laser--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Optically powered modular 15 kV dc generator\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Optically powered modular 15 kV dc generator</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sanghyeon Park and Juan Rivas-Davila</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Juan Manuel&nbsp;Rivas-Davila</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Optically powered modular 15 kV dc generator</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
