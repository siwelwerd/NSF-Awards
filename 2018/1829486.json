 "awd_abstract_narration": "Measurements of seafloor pressure are useful for understanding the earth and the ocean because they are sensitive to changes in the height of the seafloor and the weight of the overlying water and atmosphere.  The best pressure sensors drift unpredictably so their output cannot be used to resolve long terms signals such as the steady buildup of strain between subduction zone earthquakes and long term changes in the mass of the oceans.  Drift also makes existing pressure sensors less sensitive to shorter-term signals such as those from slow-slip earthquakes and ocean eddies. A new method has been developed to remove drift using the internal pressure inside the instrument housing as a reference and has been tested successfully with a seafloor prototype.  This project will redesign the prototype so that the instrument is more robust, better calibrated, more compact and lower power.  It will be attached to the Ocean Observatories Initiative Cabled Array on Axial Seamount, a volcano that is inflating rapidly following an eruption in 2015.  The engineering effort will be led by a female engineer in a field where women are underrepresented and the project will train a graduate student in a technical project where they will learn to work with both engineers and scientists.  The cruises that service and deploy instruments on the Ocean Observatories Initiative Cabled Array incorporate a large number of undergraduate students, and one will be engaged to conduct a project related to this instrument.\r\n\r\nThe A-0-A method is a new approach to calibrating pressure sensors to remove drift.  Periodically, a valve is used to switch the pressure sensor for a short interval from measuring the pressure in the ocean to measuring the pressure inside the instrument housing.   The drift can then be determined by comparing the pressure readings to an accurate barometer. The A-0-A method has the potential to substantially reduce the drift of long-term seafloor pressure records in a much more economical way than current approaches.  The first non-proprietary seafloor tests at 900 m in Monterey Bay on the MARS cabled observatory suggests that A-0-A calibrations may reduce pressure sensor drift to as little as 1-2 mm/year in 1000 m of water.  However, design improvements are required to remove known sources of error and a side-by-side seafloor test is essential to verify the technique against established methods of drift removal.  The first deployment of the redesigned instrument on Axial Seamount will allow comparisons with the absolute pressure measurements of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography Self-Calibrating Pressure Recorder (an instrument that uses a dead weight tester for periodic calibrations) and the relative pressure measurements obtained from repeat closed-loop mobile pressure recorder surveys, both of which have an uncertainty of ~1 cm of water. The cabled sensor can then be used for future vertical geodetic studies of the Cascadia subduction zone megathrust aimed at understanding patterns of fault locking, creep and slow slip.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

For oceanography, they can be used to observe the pressure changes from tides, ocean weather, ocean circulation, and long-term changes in the distribution of water in the ocean. For geophysics, they are sensitive to changes in the depth of the seafloor from volcanoes inflating and deflating, the accumulation and release of strain on faults, and slumping of unstable slopes. Although the best conventional pressure gauges can make very precise measurements, they suffer from unpredictable instrumental drift that is equivalent to a systematic change in reading every year of up to tens of centimeters of water. Without correcting for drift, it is not possible to distinguish slow changes in the elevation of the seafloor and the weight of the water column from instrumental drift. The A-0-A method is a new approach to calibration which uses a valve to switch the pressure gauge from measuring external pressure to measuring the internal pressure of the instrument housing for short calibrations. During a calibration, the drift can be measured by comparing the pressure gauge to an accurate barometer. Prior to this project, we tested the A-0-A method with a prototype instrument that was connected to a cabled observatory in Monterey Bay. The results suggest that the sensor drift can be reduced from ~1 part in 104per year (10 cm / year in 1000 m of water) to ~1-2 parts in 106(1-2 mm / year in 1000 m of water). The goal of this project was to develop a lower power, more compact version the prototype A-0-A instrument and test it on the Ocean Observatories Initiative Regional Cabled Array which extends off the coast of central Oregon. We built an instrument and successfully operated it for 3 years from 2019-2022 on Axial Seamount where several other calibrated pressure gauges are also located. The first deployment collected data successfully but there were some problems early on with poor calibrations, so that the calibrated pressure data is only reliable for the last two years of the deployment. We did some laboratory testing and concluded that at least some of the problems might be related to gas bubbles getting stuck in the internal oil-filled piping of the instrument. To address this problem, we redesigned the A-0-A instrument to include a valve with a larger tubing diameter and redeployed the instrument for a second test on the Ocean Observatories Initiative Regional Cabled Array. The instrument is now collecting data on the seafloor and should be in operation for an expected eruption of Axial Seamount in the next year or two when the seafloor above the volcano will drop several meters as magma is expelled onto the seafloor. \r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/02/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: WilliamSWilcock\n"
