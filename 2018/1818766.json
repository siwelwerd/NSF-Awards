The aim of the meeting is to gather both leading experts and younger researchers in some of the most rapidly developing parts of combinatorics, including in particular Schubert calculus, total positivity, and cluster algebras.  \r\n\r\nThe main aim of the conference is to strengthen interaction between researchers and introduce students to this field of study. The organizers place particular attention on attracting junior participants, as well as participants from underrepresented groups. It is expected that the conference to aid the dissemination of new results in these areas and lead to fruitful interactions and new directions. The website for the conference is https://math.berkeley.edu/~williams/FominFest\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
