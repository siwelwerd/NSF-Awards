 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Colorado State University, located in Fort Collins, Colorado, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2018-2020. The program scientific focus is in the area of molecular life sciences. Participants present their research findings orally, by poster, and in a written final report. Experiential challenges supplement educational visits to government labs and biotech companies and participation in science communication panels, ethics and professional development workshops. The success of the program is assessed through surveys, focus group discussions and the CIMER REU Common Assessment tool. Participants should have completed freshman biology and chemistry. Participants must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents and registered as undergraduate students. Students from underrepresented groups or those attending colleges with limited research opportunities are strongly encouraged to apply. Applications are evaluated by the Program Director, the Co-Director and faculty mentors. Student application is evaluated holistically based on GPA, courses completed, personal statement, and letters of reference.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. The REU site goal is to train undergraduates in research while advancing discovery and understanding. This REU site strives to broaden the participation of members of underrepresented groups (minority students, particularly from four year colleges with limited research opportunities). Society will benefit from a greater number of better-trained molecular bioscience researchers and educator role models, particularly from underrepresented groups. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences.\r\n\r\nA common web-based assessment tool used by all REU Site programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after participation in the program to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program is available by visiting http://www.bmb.colostate.edu/undergraduates/reu/program-description/, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Paul Laybourn at paul.laybourn@colostate.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Thomas Santangelo at Thomas.santangelo@colostate.edu).",

The <strong>objective</strong> of this program is to expose undergraduates to the broad range of research areas and approaches that constitute the modern discipline of molecular life sciences. The <strong>targeted student participants</strong> are from institutions with high concentrations of underrepresented minorities and limited on-campus research opportunities. The <strong>intellectual focus</strong> of our program demands that participants i) learn how to formulate, experimentally challenge, and analyze results within student-derived hypotheses, and ii) derive meaningful results and effectively communicate these results. The individual research experiences as well as the interactions with mentors provide mechanisms and opportunities for learning about and implementing the latest research techniques and technologies. Our training <strong>timetable</strong> pairs trainees and mentors at least a month prior to arrival to begin formulating possible projects. Within the first two weeks our participants have already been exposed to and performed many new techniques, and their preliminary results form the basis of their initial project proposal. By week 4, continued refinement and experimental details permit submission of the formal project proposal. In the program conclusion at week 10, the participants present their research findings orally and through a poster session. Participants also turn in a detailed final report in manuscript form. Several experiential challenges (<em>i.e. </em>team building exercises, white water rafting, and hiking in Rocky Mountain National Park) supplement excursions to nearby government labs and biotech companies, and participation in science communication panels, ethics-related workshops, and formal guidance on preparing graduate program applications and resumes for direct entry into the life sciences workforce. Alumni return during the last week of the summer session each year. We conducted a 10-week summer program for 33 participants and set a goal to recruit 30 participants. REU participants from outside of CSU numbered 30 or 91% of the total (33). We set a goal of at least 50% of our participants consisting of underrepresented minority students, a goal we have surpassed (81%) in the previous two funding periods. The primary objectives of recruiting and exposing a diverse group of STEM-oriented students to research and training in the molecular biosciences was achieved.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/28/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Paul&nbsp;J&nbsp;Laybourn</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757514/1757514_10530383_1682715023551_NSFREUMBSgroupphoto--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757514/1757514_10530383_1682715023551_NSFREUMBSgroupphoto--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Graduation Day Group Picture\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1757514/1757514_10530383_1682715023551_NSFREUMBSgroupphoto--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Graduation Day Group Picture\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Last Day In CSU REU Program 2021</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Paul Laybourn</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Paul&nbsp;J&nbsp;Laybourn</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Graduation Day Group Picture</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
