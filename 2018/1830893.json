 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to integrate sensing, computation, and actuation directly into the body structure of a micrometer- to millimeter-scale soft robot, by creating a new class of soft hydrogels that can be thermally and biochemically programmed. This integration is critical for constructing autonomous robots that can function in complex, real-world environments. This project seeks to develop a comprehensive framework for the design, programming, validation, and fabrication of these gel robots. The robots will respond to temperature and biochemical cues from the environment, make decisions, and execute multistep motion programs that will allow them to move in a desired direction. The project will address fundamental scientific and engineering challenges in hydrogel mechanics, biochemical sensing, path planning, and controls for continuum soft robots, making it possible to efficiently design and manufacture the hardware for gel robots and to program them with biochemical software. These robots will have potential applications in marine, biological and medical environments, including in vivo targeting and diagnostics in medical settings.  The project will also provide research opportunities to undergraduate and K-12 students, including those from underrepresented groups, via new and established outreach programs at Johns Hopkins University. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop a framework for building a broad class of submillimeter-scale thermobiochemomechanical (TBCM) C3 robots in the form of architected hydrogels in which systems of chemical sensors, actuators, and computing devices replace the electronic sensors, actuators, and controllers in traditional robots. The research objectives of the project are to develop thermal and DNA responsive hydrogels and utilize these materials with advanced patterning and printing techniques to assemble robots that can respond to TBCM cues which are of relevance to human environmental and physiological conditions. Hardware design will be guided by a biomolecular software framework, mechanics based computational and reduced-order control models to enable planning and sensory feedback control. The broader impacts of this work include K-12 outreach programs to foster participation in STEM, dissemination of the research in peer-reviewed journals, dissemination of code and data and the development of new educational materials for undergraduate and graduate instruction.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

A new class of gel crawlers was developed that can break symmetry and move unidirectionally based on contact forces. Unique DNA-based materials that integrate complex circuitry for autonomous function were created. Fabrication protocols using 3D printing or light-based patterning were developed for soft gels across size scales from the sub-mm to the centimeter.A newchemomechanicaltheory was developed for polyelectrolyte hydrogels that describe dynamic polymerization of polymernetworks.The approach was specified forthe physically crosslinked hydrogel developed inpreviousworks and applied to investigate the dependence of the swelling ratio on theratio of DNA terminator to hairpinand the slow swelling kinetics. Experiments have shown that the swelling time for a DNA hydrogel segment was independent of its size.The model showedthat the increased fixed charge density of the polymerizing DNA crosslink excludesthe DNA hairpins from the gel, which impedesfurther incorporation of DNA hairpins into the crosslinks.The theory is also being applied to model the chemically crosslinked DNA hydrogels.Finite elementmodelswere developedto design and control gel materials and robots.The finite element model ofthe multi-segment robot was applied toinvestigate the contribution of the swelling and deswellingkineticsand friction on locomotion.The results showed that friction was needed to break the symmetry of shape change to achieve a nettranslation of the robot, and the heating and cooling rates can be tuned to maximize the translation.New methods forbuilding low-order, data-driven models in real-time enableonline gait optimization andsteeringcontrol that is robust torobotdamage.Methods to use DNA reactions to control robots autonomously were developed.\n\n\nThese studies provide new knowledge on creating soft, untethered robots that can be programmed by biochemicals or temperature signals of broad relevance to biosensors, biomedical engineering, drug delivery, robotics, and medicine.
