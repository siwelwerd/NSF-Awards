 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wearable electronics and health assistive devices have become commonly used for daily activity tracking and medical care.   However, the existing devices can no longer satisfy the growing demand on computing power and energy efficiency especially when a large number of sensors are utilized to improve the performance of such devices. This work will develop a new generation of wearable biomedical devices that utilize the emerging computing architecture and state-of-art networking techniques to boost the data processing capability of such devices. The developed techniques will be demonstrated in the state-of-art prostheses for rehabilitation application.  \r\n \r\nSeveral key intellectual merits are delivered.  First of all, this project will develop novel distributed neuromorphic computing architecture featuring a scalable, reconfigurable, and multi-chip neural network system for sensor fusion enabled biomedical devices.  Heterogeneous sensor data from physiological signals will be efficiently processed through reconfigurable neural processors.  Moreover, to form a highly efficient network and remove routing congestions, body channel communication will be developed and integrated with the neural processors to achieve a high-bandwidth, low-latency, inter-connected network around the human body.  \r\n\r\nThe work brings significant advancement and benefits to modern biomedical devices by creating highly efficient sensing, computing and networking solutions.  The proposed development promotes technology fusion across fields of computer, electrical, biomedical engineering. The sub-tasks of the project will be delivered to undergraduate and graduate classrooms for hands-on experience of integrated circuits design, biomedical instrumentation, machine learning techniques.  New courses on computing techniques for sensor fusion enabled biomedical system will be created to disseminate the learned knowledge to broader audience. \r\n\r\nAll publications, and experimental data, source codes, design files from this project will be retained on institutional servers for 3 years after the completion of the project.  All publications along with important data, codes, and supporting design files will be made accessible through PI's data repository, http://nu-vlsi.eecs.northwestern.edu/data_repository.html.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

However, there are still several hindering factors that limit the effectiveness of such devices.  First of all, the most advanced computing algorithms such as artificial intelligence still observe a hard time to be applied to such small wearable electronics healthcare due to the limited computing resources and battery life. Second, the use of sensor fusion techniques with numerous sensor signals routing into a central computing device creates major signal routing challenges across the human body and significant power overhead for data communications across multiple devices.    To resolve the above challenges, this project aims at developing a new generation of wearable biomedical devices that incorporate the emerging neural computing architecture for real-time AI computation and utilize novel device-to-device distributed computing and networking techniques to boost the communication efficiency of such devices.  \n\nTowards the above goal, this project has successfully delivered the following important technical advancements.  First, this project has developed a novel distributed neural processing architecture for use in low power small wearable devices featuring a scalable, reconfigurable, and multi-chip neural network system for sensor-fusion enabled biomedical devices; Second, novel body area communication technique has been developed allowing physiological sensor data to be efficiently shared and processed through multiple devices in the network; Third, wireless powered implantable devices with data compression and integrated deep learning support have been delivered for the first time to enable intelligent biomedical devices for real-time AI computation.  As a result, this project has created a new class of AI empowered biomedical device which consumes 1000 times less power than existing microprocessors used for similar applications.  The developed hardware closes the gap between the high computing workload of modern AI algorithms and the poor computing support from existing wearable biomedical devices.  The developed techniques have been demonstrated for the classification of human movement intent for prosthetic devices in rehabilitation.\n\nMore than seven graduates and undergraduates have been trained based on research developments from this project.  This project disseminated the research findings into many conferences in the field and downloaded the research knowledge to the college classrooms through hand-on training on designing intelligent biomedical devices.  Summer workshops specially for underrepresented students have been hosted for mentoring college students to build up a career in advanced computing technology.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/28/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jie Gu"
