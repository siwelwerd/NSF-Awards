 "awd_abstract_narration": "Transformation, the generation of stable, transgenic lines, is a fundamental tool in both basic and applied plant biology used for everything from testing gene function to increasing crop yields and resilience to stress.  In some plant species, transformation is a routine procedure; however, several key crop plants, including corn (maize), are very difficult to transform, and success is limited to only a few varieties, severely limiting the study of gene function and use of the most cutting-edge, genome editing technologies. New, accessible, inexpensive methods to transform plants are needed to advance research and accelerate crop improvement. This project utilizes simple magnets and DNA-carrying particles to introduce engineered DNA into maize pollen, which is easily collected, and then uses the transformed pollen to transmit introduced DNA to the next generation progeny, the seed. Success of this method would revolutionize maize research, allowing rapid and inexpensive modification of any genetic stock by most labs, opening the door to one-step, precise genome editing. Expanding this method to other species would speed up progress in understanding plant genome functions in general and translation of that understanding into improved commercial breeding lines. The project will also help train graduate and undergraduate students in maize genetics, genomics and cell biology.\r\n \r\nThe goal of this EAGER project is to develop magnetofection of maize pollen as a simple and rapid method for transformation.  Magnetofection, which uses magnetic force to propel DNA-carrying nanoparticles into a cell, is a relatively new (and inexpensive) technology that has recently been proved effective in the pollen of several plant species, most notably cotton.  However, the structure, development and physiology of maize pollen appears likely to introduce significant hurdles for implementing magnetofection. The project will utilize the relevant expertise of two maize research groups to overcome these hurdles, and to characterize the outcome of transformation via pollen magnetofection on a genome-wide scale.  The experimental plan incorporates three objectives that are calibrated to address the specific barriers to success identified in maize pollen.  Aim 1 will, in parallel, optimize transient magnetofection of maize pollen in vitro, and determine the effects of such treatments on pollen fecundity (i.e., ability to produce seeds).  Aim 2 will use the results from Aim 1 to guide implementation of a stable transformation protocol.  Aim 3 will use standard genetic methods alongside next-gen sequencing to characterize transgene heritability and genome-wide structure in stable transformants.  Any successful transformation protocol would be validated in both labs, and thereafter rapidly released to the maize community via preprint server.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this EAGER (high risk/high reward) project was to implement a recently-published protocol for stable plant transformation in maize, pollen magnetofection.  The reported ease of this approach, alongside the expertise of the PI in working with maize pollen, raised the possibility that a rapid and broadly useful protocol could be developed that could be transformative for maize genetics and genomics research.  Unfortunately, the results of the project (in collaboration with Jenny Mortimer at the Joint BioEnergy Institute) indicated that pollen magnetofection is not easily implemented in several monocot species (maize, lily and sorghum).  Because pollen magnetofection was widely viewed as a method with great potential in the plant sciences community, we published these negative results to communicate that caution was warranted when pursuing this approach.\n\nDue to these early negative results with magnetofection, the goal of the project shifted to implementing a different novel technology to benefit maize genetics - imaging and automated phenotyping of kernels on maize ears.  The kernel is important biologically as the progeny (next generation) of pollination, and also as a primary agricultural product, and thus enhancing the ability to study kernel phenotypes is of broad interest for understanding maize.  A maize ear phenotyping system built from commonly available parts was therefore developed, creating a projection of the entire surface of an ear, displaying kernel phenotypes for analysis.  Furthermore, these digital projections were used to develop a deep-learning-based computer vision model (\"EarVision\") that identifies and quantifies kernel phenotypes on the ear. The system increases the scope of feasible experiments addressing maize reproductive biology and related agricultural traits by reducing a bottleneck in data acquisition and quantification, paving the way for enhanced high-throughput phenotyping in this area.  The schematics and software for this system were released as a preprint and via Github, to enable academic groups to easily implement the system, if desired.  A peer-reviewed publication validated the EarVision pipeline, and a Perspectives article discussing the use of computer vision approaches for automated phenotyping placed the work in a broader context, seeking to enable others to utilize similar computational approaches.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/27/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John E Fowler"
