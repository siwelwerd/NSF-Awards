 "awd_abstract_narration": "Determining whether or not two shapes are the same is a fundamental goal in Topology, an area of mathematics which has important applications to physics.  In two dimensions, this is a relatively simple question which was addressed in the early part of the 20th century.  In the 1980s and 1990s, the area of mathematics known as Representation Theory had applications to this goal in dimension three.  In the late 1990s the program of categorification, which encompasses various areas of mathematics, was introduced to tackle this question in dimension four. This National Science Foundation funded collaborative project aims to further this already deep connection between the two fundamental fields of mathematics. \r\n\r\nSoon after quantum groups were introduced in the 1980s, certain knot invariants, such as the Jones polynomial, were constructed from these objects.  Specializing the parameter of a quantum group to a root of unity led to invariants of three-dimensional manifolds.  Categorification is an interdisciplinary area of research which seeks to \"upgrade\" certain structures in mathematics such as replacing numbers with vector spaces and vector spaces with categories.  A link homology discovered in the 1990s categorified the Jones polynomial.  This led a surge in research in categorifying various aspects of quantum groups and their representations at a generic value of the quantum parameter.  In order to categorify three-manifold invariants coming from quantum groups, one must try to understand categorified quantum groups at a root of unity.  The subject of hopfological algebra was outlined in the early 2000s to accomplish this goal.  Quantum groups at roots of unity are associative algebras defined over rings of cyclotomic polynomials.  Such rings are categorified by stable categories of modules over truncated polynomial algebras.  The investigators will look for module categories over these stable categories in order to try to categorify the representation theory of quantum groups at roots of unity including knot and three-manifold invariants.  In order to categorify the associated 3-dimensional TQFT, one must work over a slightly larger ring where certain integers are inverted.  This ring has been categorified recently and the investigators will attempt to incorporate this structure into categorical representation theory.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Three-dimensional topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) were developed in the 1980's and 1990's using the representation theory of quantum groups.  A major goal is to lift these constructions to higher dimensions.  The program of categorification introduced by Crane and Frenkel suggests that the algebraic inputs should be upgraded to higher structures in order to achieve this purpose.  Generally speaking, this means that vector spaces should be replaced by categories, and actions on vector spaces should be replaced by actions of functors on categories.  The categories involved in this project are of a representation-theoretic or combinatorial nature.  \nThe Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev (WRT) TQFT may be constructed from colored Jones polynomials evaluated at a root of unity.  In a series of recent papers joint with Qi, Robert, and Wagner, the colored Jones polynomials at a root of unity have been categorified.  This should serve as a foundational ingredient in the contruction of a new homology theory of three-dimensional manifolds which could then possibly be extended to a higher dimensional TQFT.\nSome of the tools used in this new link homology build upon work of Khovanov who gave a vast generalization of homological algebra which depends upon a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra.  In an effort to make this new subject more accessible to mathematicians in related areas, an online seminar on \"hopfological algebra\" ran in the summer of 2021.\nIn another direction, three-dimensional TQFTs have begun to play a role in condensed matter physics over the last few years, and there is hope that it could give rise to a fault tolerant quantum computer.  Another aspect of this project has been to study non-semisimple versions of these connections in joint work with Geer, Lauda, and Patureau-Mirand.  \nWhile many of the tools used in these TQFTs and partially categorified versions of them require some machinery, there are still many accessible projects for undergraduate students.  Some aspect of this project led to an undergraduate summer research problem on symmetries of link homology.  There are also many concrete questions related to TQFT perspectives on quantum computation that could be infused into an undergraduate curriculum.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/01/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joshua Sussan"
