 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation, and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Professor Jeffrey Johnson from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and colleagues Gary Pielak, Alexander Miller, Jillian Dempsey and Bo Li have upgraded the console of a 600 MHz NMR spectrometer  and have equipped the spectrometer with a cryoplatform to allow higher sensitivity. This will transform and old instrument into a modern spectrometer. This upgraded spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as allow study of biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The cryogenic probe provides a significant increase in sensitivity relative to standard NMR probes which permits use of small samples. The instrument is used for research and research training at this university and neighboring schools. \r\n\r\nThe proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts studies of complexity-building reactions from feedstock chemicals as well as utilization of proton-coupled electron transfer in solar fuel production. The spectrometer is used to investigate quantum dots and in the exploration of structural and functional diversity of microbial natural products and in the identification of new microbial natural products. The upgraded instrument is also employed in characterizing biosynthetic intermediates in natural product pathways and for probing mechanisms in sustainable organometallic catalysis. Fluorine NMR in cells is used to probe globular proteins.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNuclear magnetic spectroscopy is a workhorse analytical technique to probe chemical structure.  As structures and experiments become more complex, the demands on the instrumentation grow.  The current award has allowed the UNC Chemistry Department and users of the NMR Core Laboratory to perform increasingly complex analyses, supporting the research and teaching missions of the department.  Students have 24/7 access to 600 MHz instruments operating with cryoprobes that detect on multiple nuclei.  The award has facilitated significant fundamental advances in synthetic organic chemistry, polymer chemistry, organometallic catalysis, and energy-related research. \n\n \n\nThe new spectrometer has had broad impact on the research areas covered by the publications cited in the references.  Both routine and advanced characterization of organic molecules and organometallic complexes were enabled, including in situ catalytic reaction monitoring and kinetic analysis, variable temperature structural dynamics studies, and thermodynamic studies.  Other work has included characterization of biomolecules and ligand loss from quantum dots.  Recent work related to 19F relaxation in proteins is further expanding impact.\n\n \n\nThe increased throughput enabled by the sample changer, continues to reduce time students spent waiting to obtain NMR spectra and as a result, students are spending more time in the wet chemistry labs running reactions.  During the pandemic shutdown, the automation capabilities were the only way we could keep up with samples. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/16/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey S Johnson"
