 "awd_abstract_narration": "People are increasingly exposed to data and datasets in everyday life, in domains from health and science to news and policy.  This raises important questions about how to help non-specialists make sense of those data, in particular, around understanding how to think about correlation and causation.  These concepts can be slippery; confounding correlation with causation may lead people to assume causality when there is none, but correlations do often provide precious hints to causation. This project will investigate how theories of cognition that emphasize the relationship between thinking and physical action can be used to design full-body and tangible ways to interact with data-based museum installations that prime people to think in ways that improve their understanding of causation and correlation. The goal is to develop bridges between theories of embodied cognition, the design of data visualizations, and long-term learning effects about science, technology, engineering, and mathematics concepts discussed in the installations. The project will be deployed in real contexts, having direct potential impacts on visitors' understanding, and will be used to inform educational curricula in ubiquitous computing and design for informal learning.\r\n\r\nThe project is organized in four phases that will be conducted at Discovery Place, a science museum in Charlotte, NC. In part one, the team will design visualizations of geo-referenced datasets on a wall-size projected screen. Using a semi-experimental design, groups of visitors will interact with one of several variations of the installation, including full-body and tangible interaction styles based on different physical metaphors for correlation as well as a tablet-based control condition. In part two, the team will experiment with different styles of data visualization (e.g., line charts or heat maps), and in part three visitors will be asked personalize the dataset on display; these extensions are necessary to assess the generalizability of the results from phase one to different data presentations and domains. Part four addresses transferability of learning across time and to other contexts, following up with museum visitors weeks or months after their visit and asking them to evaluate the likely correctness of data-based claims about correlation and causation in science articles in domains such as health remedies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

They are, however, difficult to interpret. For example, people may believe that the mumps, measles, and rubella (MMR) vaccine causes autism (even if these two variables increase in different years). On the other hand, the mantra that correlation does not imply causation may conceal how correlation can be a precious hint to causation (for example, the correlation between smoking and lung cancer).</p>\n<p>This project attempts to mitigate these challenges by providing guidelines for designing interactive installations for informal learning places like museums. We hypothesized that different ways of interacting with a data visualization could affect how we make sense of causation and correlation in data. To test this hypothesis, we iteratively designed and implemented three prototypes of an interactive museum installation. In the full-body prototype, visitors interacted with a geo-referenced data visualization using hand gestures and body movements (like jumping or grabbing). In the tangible prototype, they used paper-made objects or a 3D-printed globe. In the traditional prototype, visitors used a gamepad to control the installation.</p>\n<p>We tested our prototypes at Discovery Place, a science museum in Charlotte, NC. We placed a 65\" TV in a busy area of the museum and allowed visitors to interact with the installation freely. During our initial study sessions, we also identified interactivity problems that affect data visualizations in museums. In particular, screens in museums often compete with surrounding stimuli (e.g., people, exhibits, signage, objects). This limits the number of people who notice them or who understand that the display is interactive (two phenomena known in the pervasive display literature as \"display blindness\" and \"interaction blindness\"). To address these issues, we investigated how different ways of representing the user next-to a data visualization (as a skeleton, avatar, or by using the full camera feed) impact people's engagement with the installation. For example, in a study with 731 museum visitors, we found that by representing the user as an avatar or using the full video feed from the camera, the screen could attract more people than using a skeleton.</p>\n<p>Because of COVID-19 related closures and restrictions, we continued our studies in-lab at IUPUI in Indianapolis, IN. Consistently with our original hypothesis, our experimental findings indicate that different interaction styles alter how we make sense of causation and correlation in data. In particular, our experimental sessions showed that people report different levels of agreement with statements that portray correlation and causation across the data on display, depending on the prototype they used. Participants tended to agree less with such statements after interacting with a gamepad. Vice versa, interacting with body movements may promote the detection of causal patterns.</p>\n<p>This grant allowed a diverse pool of undergraduate and graduate students to participate in research activities actively. It enabled the research team to produce peer-reviewed publications that were presented at highly competitive international conferences in the field of Human-Computer Interaction and that were shared with professionals at the partner museum.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/28/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Francesco&nbsp;Cafaro</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1848898/1848898_10571428_1656456647599_DP1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1848898/1848898_10571428_1656456647599_DP1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"User Study at the Partner Museum\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1848898/1848898_10571428_1656456647599_DP1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"User Study at the Partner Museum\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Museum Visitors interact with our prototype exhibit at Discovery Place Science in Charlotte, NC</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Francesco Cafaro</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Francesco&nbsp;Cafaro</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">User Study at the Partner Museum</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1848898/1848898_10571428_1656456779201_DP2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1848898/1848898_10571428_1656456779201_DP2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"User Study at the Partner Museum - Surroundings\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1848898/1848898_10571428_1656456779201_DP2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"User Study at the Partner Museum - Surroundings\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Museum Visitors interact with our prototype exhibit at Discovery Place Science in Charlotte, NC.
