 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funding is requested to support the operation of the UNOLS East Coast Van Pool (ECVP) for CY 2018 - 2022. Operations include scheduling, van transportation logistics, maintenance, repairs, outfitting and construction of new vans. The Van Pool provides these portable laboratory assets to Oceanographic research projects around the globe. The pool has 13 portable laboratories of several different functions. Funds included in this proposal will be used to support a number of upgrades and repairs to the existing vans as well as personnel time to provide necessary general maintenance.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nOperational Description\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe East Coast Van Pool and the counterpart West Coast Van Pool provide specialized portable lab space to the U.S. Academic Research Fleet. The Lab Vans are shipped to ports in the U.S. and across the globe to load onto and from research vessels per mission requirements. The Lab Vans have a critical role in ensuring the Fleet can meet the research goals of Science Missions. Funding for operating these shared use facilities is provided by the National Science Foundation and supplemented with daily usage charges.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nHaving specific Pools for the Laboratory Vans ensures standardized design, safety, outfitting, and maintenance of the Lab Vans. This is essential for the safety of personnel and for providing reliable and efficient Lab Vans to the Fleet. The Lab Vans are maintained at a high level, inspected frequently, and overhauled periodically. Prior to having a standardized pool, the research fleet had significant issues with the safety, design, and upkeep of portable labs leased for missions or maintained by individual institutions. The East Coast Van Pool, operated by the University of Delaware, has proven to be very effective and cost efficient for the U.S. research at sea effort.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nGoals and Benefits of the Van Pools include:\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCentralizing maintenance ensures standards are sustained. The Lab Vans are maintained at a high level by a few workers very familiar with the vans and their systems. A number of institution owned vans have lapsed in their maintenance and have required replacement or were returned to the pool for refurbishments.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCost efficiency. Centralized maintenance and logistics are cost effective. Relationships with tech support vendors, freight carriers, and global shipping agents make efficient use of time and funding.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDesign and implementation of Standards in van construction and functionality. The standards provide users with clear expectations of functionality, in both special portable van requirements and additional van space aboard the research vessel fleet.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nLimiting costly issues related to each institution owning and maintaining sets of vans.
