This meeting will bring together experts in Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI), cerebral palsy, neuroscience, language development, and related fields to identify the challenges and path forward to developing a BCI system that will allow individuals who have not previously developed spoken language to communicate with the broader society.  \r\n\r\nThe workshop will be organized as an intensive 2-day meeting organized around three stages: 1) review of current knowledge relevant for real time speech generation; 2) identification of theoretical and practical barriers to new systems; 3) identification of solutions to overcoming barriers; and 4) developing a specific research roadmap to advance the start of the science and engineering in this field.  Results of the Summit will be disseminated through a developed white paper, to be made publically available by the Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation, and the publication of a reviewed journal article on the conclusions reached.  Invited participants will be selected based on their expertise, paying attention to including individuals from underrepresented groups, including those with disabilities, and inviting several early career researchers to prime a pipeline within the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNSF Award #1817353, entitled \"Research Summit on \"Thought to Speech\" for People with Cerebral Palsy\" accomplished its intended purpose of funding a 2-day research summit of experts on brain-computer interfaces (BCI), cerebral palsy (CP), neuroscience, and language development to consider the specific challenges of creating a device to provide direct interpretation of brain activity related to intended speech for people with cerebral palsy.  The Summit was held May 3-4, 2018 in San Francisco, California.  The Summit provided funding for 25 researchers from around the world to travel to San Francisco for the Summit.  Government and industry representatives paid their own way to participate in the Summit.  Of the NSF supported participants, 7 (28%) were early career researchers including one PhD student, three postdoctoral fellows, and three junior faculty members.    Each attendee gave a presentation and participated in discussions.  The attendees agreed that interpretation of intended speech from brain activity was a highly desirable goal with unique challenges for use with people who have CP.  Differences of opinion arose about whether the risks of implanted electrodes were tolerable to achieve this goal, especially with children. \n\nThe award also funded presentation at the 2018 Brain-Computer Interface Meeting of an interactive workshop on May 24th, 2018 to continue this discussion with additional participants from the BCI community.  The workshop was entitled ?Real-time BCI communication for non-verbal individuals with cerebral palsy: Challenges and strategies for progress.?  This discussion concluded that implanted electrodes would be appropriate and could even provide advantages.  Implanted electrodes would provide advantages of constant availability and invisibility of the thought-to-speech device. This discussion resulted in foundation funding from Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation to one of the participants to further explore the research opportunities for an intended speech interpretation device.\n\nSupplemental funds were obtained for a one-day follow-up discussion on July 31st, 2018 to create a research roadmap for investigating the use of implanted electrodes for interpretation of intended speech.  The supplemental funds supported in-person participation of 11 participants, including two junior faculty members.  An additional two funding officers attended using their own travel funds and three people participated by video-conference.  This discussion resulted in consensus on inclusion/exclusion criteria for the first participants, the first research goals, the initial technology, and additional tests to be included in a feasibility study.  Discussion extended to the size of the budget needed for a feasibility study and possible sources of funding.\n\nThis gathering, the final one funded under this award, led to the creation of a draft protocol which was reviewed in detail under separate funding support in November 2018. \n\nThis award thus produced the key outcome of initiating on-going discussion and research efforts that continue under Award Abstract #1901986, \"Thought to Speech\" Step 3: Science, Engineering and Clinical Planning of an Intracortical Communication System for Adults with Cerebral Palsy (BrainGate-CP).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/21/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jane E Huggins"
