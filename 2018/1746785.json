 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I project will study novel methods for extracting and recovering valuable metals from an abundant industrial waste source, namely coal combustion fly ash. If successful, the technology developed in this project has the potential to reduce the environmental and societal risks of both newly generated- and legacy coal combustion wastes, while strengthening the supply chain security of raw materials critical to advanced technology and green energy applications. Moreover, by establishing a secure long-term supply of affordable scandium, this project can catalyze long-lasting improvements in commercial and personal transportation. Demonstration of this highly-selective, solvent-free metal separations technology may also influence a paradigm shift in the metallurgical industry towards more sustainable practices. Validation of technologies for waste utilization and value creation is an attractive avenue for transitioning coal-dependent regions towards economies based on advanced manufacturing and high-tech jobs.\r\n\r\nPrevious attempts to extract metals from industrial wastes have suffered from technical limitations that the technology developed in this project overcomes. Based on commercially-available engineered polymer supports, our suite of adsorbents exhibits REE-selective functionality across broad pH regimes, enabling flexible, complementary deployment and high rates of reagent recycle. The goals of this project are to translate the laboratory-scale synthesis schemes for our novel adsorbents to greener, industrially-scalable chemistries and to demonstrate a holistic system prototype that validates the key unit operations of our process together. The former will be accomplished by following well-established protocols of the chemical industry under the supervision of our commercial partner and the latter through extensive, dynamic subsystem testing and finally construction and operation of a lab-scale prototype. The project team expects the final deliverable of this development effort to constitute a high-fidelity demonstration of the process at a Technology Readiness Level of 5.",
