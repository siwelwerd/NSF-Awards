 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable up to 12 students from educational institutions in the US to attend the 12th Annual Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bio-medicine (BIBM 2018).  The conference is one of the premier research conferences in bioinformatics and bio-medicine.  The BIBM community strives to build an international platform to foster experience sharing of multi-disciplinary research, education, and outreach activities through scientific presentations, keynote speeches, and workshop and panel discussions. Cutting-edge research shared at the conference will impact the science and technology of many fields, from agricultural and environmental to pharmaceutical and medical sciences. Due to the high cost of international travel, which often precludes student authors from participation due to insufficient support from their mentors and institutions, the travel grants will greatly encourage students, especially under-represented and disabled participants, from US institutions to attend the meeting. \r\n\r\nThe student awardees will have the opportunity to present their research, listen to talks, both keynotes and regular paper presenters, from the scientific program, which will highlight the following seven themes: 1. Bioinformatics and Computational Biology of Molecular Structure, Function and Evolution, 2. Computational Systems Biology, 3. Next Generation Sequencing and High-throughput Methods, 4. Cheminformatics and pharmacogenomics, 5. Cross-Cutting Computational Methods and Bioinformatics Infrastructure, 6. Medical Informatics and Bioinformatics of Disease, and 7. Healthcare Informatics.  These themes are designed to provide breadth, depth and synergy for research collaboration. In addition, to foster open discussions about research, education, and outreach opportunities and barriers, the students will join special panels in topics related to Big Data, Actionable AI, and Consumerable Discoveries.  The panels will cover opportunities for young investigators and provide tips to early career researchers and encourage the sharing of informatics tools dissemination.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
