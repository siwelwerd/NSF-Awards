 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference \"Interactions of quantum affine algebras with cluster algebras, current algebras and categorification\" will take place at the Catholic University of America in Washington, DC on June 2-8, 2018. The conference will focus on problems related to, or motivated by, representations of infinite dimensional Lie algebras and their quantum analogues. The recent rapid growth, rising prominence, and emerging connections between these topics underscores the timely need for a conference that focuses on new connections by bringing together leading researchers who work on different aspects of these subjects. A main goal of the conference is to expose graduate students and early-career researchers to recent developments in representation theory. In an effort to foster their interest and engagement, the four day conference will be preceded by a three day summer school/workshop for junior researchers. \r\n\r\nInfinite-dimensional Lie algebras and their quantum analogues play a prominent role in mathematics and mathematical physics. In recent decades their representation theory has been connected with a number of different subjects, such as algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, combinatorics and cluster algebras, to name but a few. The talks will focus on topics such as crystal and canonical bases, Weyl, Demazure and Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules and interaction between them, highest weight categories, Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier algebras and their applications to categorification, cluster algebras and related structures, geometric methods in infinite dimensional representation theory (in particular, the role of quiver varieties), and map algebras. A special emphasis will be placed on interactions between various structures. Further details can be found at the conference website: http://www.mi.uni-koeln.de/~dkus/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe representation theory of Lie algebras is a highly active area of modern mathematics, with important connections to physics and other areas of mathematics, such as combinatorics, differential and algebraic geometry, and topology.  Among many topics in Lie theory, the prominence and significance of certain Hopf algebras known as quantum affine algebras has grown tremendously since the notion of a quantum group was introduced in the 1980's.  Today, the representation theory of quantum affine algebras has grown into a highly active and globally studied research topic.  Current algebras are a class of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras whose representation theory is closely related to that of quantum affine algebras.  Category theory, introduced in the 1950's, provides a broad framework for finindg a more uniform approach to distinct but similar notions in mathematics. The related goal of categorification is to replace set-theoretic statements by category-theoretic analogues, and to view phenomena in representation theory as shadows of these broader category-theoretic structures.  Relating all of these ideas is a new category-theoretic approach, which explores the structure of the collection of finite-dimensional representations of quantum affine algebras as a cluster algebra.   \n\nIn 2018, the PI's organized the conference \"Interactions of quantum affine algebras with cluster algebras, current algebras and categorification\", to bring together both leading experts in this field and the next generation of students and junior researchers pursuing these topics.  The goal of the conference was to present current progress and future directions in these research areas, and to promote collaboration among the global community of researchers. \n\nThe conference was held on June 2 - June 8, 2018, at The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.  The event consisted of two initial days in a summer school format, followed by four days of conference talks.  Two mini-courses were offered. Alistair Savage (University of Ottawa, Canada) gave lectures on String Diagrams and Categorification. Bernard Leclerc (Universit&eacute; de Caen, France) lectured on \"Quantum Affine Algebras and Cluster Algebras\".  Both mini-courses consisted of 3 90-minutes sessions and were intended for the junior audience to provide them with a comprehensive background for the conference talks that followed. \n\nThere were 18 conference talks given by senior researchers and experts in the field in 50-minute presentations, and 32 contributed talks by graduate students and junior researchers in 15-minute presentations.   The conference talks were given by Georgia Benkart (University of Wisconsin), David Hernandez (Universite Paris-Diderot, France), Bogdan Ion (University of Pittsburg), Anthony Joseph (The Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel), Masaki Kashiwara (Kyoto University, Japan), Shrawan Kumar (UNC at Chapel Hill), Venkatramani Lakshmibai (Northeastern University), Michael Lau (Universite Laval, Canada), Aaron Lauda (University of Southern California), Christian Lenart (SUNY at Albany), Yiqiang Li (University of Buffalo), Adriano Moura (UNICAMP, Brazil), Eugene Mukhin (Indiana University-Purdue University), Erhard Neher (University of Ottawa, Canada), Alistair Savage (University of Ottawa, Canada), Eric Vasserot (Universite Paris-Diderot, France), Monica Vazirani (University of California Davis), Weiqiang Wang (University of Virginia).

International participants came from Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Israel, Italy, Singapore, and Russia. \n\nScientific Merit\n\nThe conference presented current progress and future directions on many interrelated topics in Lie theory, including representation theory of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras, crystal bases, highest-weight categories, representations of current algebras, affine quantum groups, knot invariants, and categorifications.  The workshop and conference schedule provided ample opportunity for participants to discuss ideas, questions, and future research projects.  \n \n\nBroader Impact\n\nThis major event attracted a large segment of the mathematical community working in representation theory and related fields.   The broad spectrum and great current interest of the topics discussed at the conference made it especially useful for young mathematicians. The conference website provided access to slides of talks, which remain available, and which allow the ideas discussed at the conference to reach a world-wide audience.

In particular, it includes lecture notes of both mini-courses.\n\nConsistent with our desire to broaden the reach and appeal of the conference themes, we focused our proposed support for junior researchers, women, and minorities at smaller liberal arts institutions.  Many of these researchers were personally invited and attended the conference.  This conference provided an exceptional opportunity for us to reach out to many pools of research potential where NSF support may not typically flow, and where often-overlooked researchers are often encumbered with higher teaching loads.  We enjoyed a strong attendance from junior international researchers, and were able to promote the rare opportunity for those at smaller US institutions to meet, interact with and learn from colleagues from around the world. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/22/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jacob Greenstein"
