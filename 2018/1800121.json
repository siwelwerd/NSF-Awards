 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 43rd Annual New York State Regional Graduate Mathematics Conference (ANYSRGMC) will be held at Syracuse University on Saturday, March 24 2018. This conference is an opportunity for graduate students in New York State and the surrounding region to come together, share current research, and interact with other graduate students in a similar phase of their academic career. Opportunities to speak at conferences are an essential part of training future mathematicians. At the ANYSRGMC graduate students in all areas of mathematics have an opportunity to present their research. In many cases this will be the first time a graduate student will speak at a conference, giving them a valuable opportunity to learn how to structure and deliver a talk. In addition, given the broad range of topics covered, graduate students have the opportunity to learn about other research going on in the region, as well be exposed to research in areas of mathematics with which they are less familiar. \r\n\r\nThe ANYSRGMC is a one day conference, the majority of which consists of thirty minute graduate student talks given in parallel sessions. There will also be two invited guest speakers, an opening address in the morning and a Keynote address in the afternoon. The two speakers will be prominent mathematicians in two distinct areas of mathematics who can speak to the diverse interests of the graduate students attending the conference. The conference schedule, abstracts, and other information related to the 43rd ANYSRGMC will be posted at http://mgo.syr.edu/conferences-talks/conference/upcoming-conferences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

An additional 15 graduate students who did not give talks this year were also able to attend thanks to NSF funding for travel and hotel expenses.  In total there were 63 attendees from out of town, 41 of whom directly received travel support due to NSF funding, and several others who indirectly benefited by carpooling with drivers who were reimbursed.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/28/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Casey L Necheles"
