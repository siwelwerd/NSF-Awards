 "awd_abstract_narration": "With five years of funding from the NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) program, Franklin Pierce University (FPU) will create the Biology and Environmental Science Training (BEST) Program.  The BEST program will provide scholarships to 14 low-income, high-achieving students pursuing baccalaureate degrees in biology and environmental science. The program aims to increase academic success, retention, graduation, and job or graduate school placement of these students, thus contributing to regional and national need for STEM graduates and employees. BEST scholars will participate in program activities focused on using more than 1,000 acres of undeveloped land on FPU as a living laboratory, where they will conduct research on the natural community, environmental health, and conservation.  The expectation is that these activities will help students graduate and transition into meaningful careers in biology and environmental science. BEST scholars will be part of a learning community that shares academic interests, sections of courses, and shared residence. Scholars will be matched to faculty mentors, have peer and professional tutoring, and job shadowing opportunities. The program will share the materials and resources it develops, as well as its research results, within the university and nationally.  These materials and results will inform FPU's biology and environmental science curriculum.  In addition, they have the potential to deepen understanding about the role of enhanced curricular and co-curricular opportunities for student success.\r\n\r\nThe BEST Program will build upon existing and ongoing successful activities, as well as introduce new ones, to achieve its goals of recruitment, retention, and career preparation of students with financial need.  BEST Program objectives include 1) increasing the number of high achieving students in Franklin Pierce's biology and environmental science major by 14 total students, using targeted recruitment practices; 2) increasing academic success of S-STEM students, using evidence-based curricular improvements; 3) improving first year retention and four-year graduation rates of S-STEM scholars to 86%, by enhancing co-curricular support and services; and 4) contributing to the knowledge base of effective practices for enhancing success of students with demonstrated financial need, by research on the impact of undergraduate learning communities that use time spent outdoors as a community building theme.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

FPU's S-STEM Program had four main objectives:</p>\n<ol>\n<li> Increase the number of academically talented students in FPU's Biology and Environmental Science programs</li>\n<li> Increase the academic success of S-STEM Scholars</li>\n<li> Improve first year retention and four-year graduation rates of S-STEM<br /> Scholars</li>\n<li> Address STEM workforce needs by increasing placement of S-STEM scholars into graduate programs or professional positions within their fields</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To achieve these objectives, FPU's S-STEM Program implemented supports and activities around community-building, mentorship, career readiness, and financial aid. CPDE distributed and analyzed surveys throughout the entirety of the program (2019-2024) to provide ongoing formative and summative feedback to program leagers. The present report highlights progress along each of the four program objectives and summarizes Scholars' perceptions of the key program components. The attached images are the report. They are JPEG images as a PDF format was not allowed. The report highlights how well the program did in meeting its objectives. It also highlights the significant components of the program from a student perspective. Lastly, it offers concluding remarks that sum up the past five years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 07/28/2024<br>\nModified by: Rhine&nbsp;Singleton</p></div>\n<div
