 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) program, this project will provide scholarships to 20 high-achieving, low-income students with financial need who are pursuing bachelor's degrees in Physics, Chemistry, or Biology at Susquehanna University. In addition to programming that supports the success of these students, the project will include a series of roundtable discussions between students and industry. The project will also develop a tele-mentoring program to connect scholarship recipients with industry mentors, which can positively affect student success and help align STEM education with STEM workforce needs. \r\n\r\nThe project will recruit and provide scholarships to 20 STEM students with financial need, and seeks to graduate 20 scholarship recipients by the end of year five. It is expected that 90% of the students will either be accepted into a graduate program or enter the workforce in their STEM major within eight months of graduation. The project will develop specific programming tailored to the scholarship recipients, including an interdisciplinary summer bridge program, a dedicated section of the Susquehanna Perspectives course, access to summer research opportunities, a STEM-based unit within the Center for Academic Achievement, and an interdisciplinary seminar course that includes interaction with industry mentors and other invited speakers. The project will also conduct a series of roundtable discussions with local and regional workforce organizations, such as the Central Pennsylvania Workforce Development Board, to better align STEM workforce needs with the supply of STEM majors. The tele-mentoring program will pair students with industry mentors in the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia metropolitan areas. Rather than meeting in person, the mentor and mentee will connect monthly via Skype or other means once a month to discuss topics including the student's program of study, research experiences, and strategies the mentor has relied upon for success in industry. Tele-mentoring programs such as the one proposed are necessary to connect students at rural institutions, such as Susquehanna University, with industry partners at more distant locations. The success of the industry roundtable discussions and tele-mentoring program will be measured with a combination of open-ended interviews and periodic surveys, both of which will focus on the students' and industry partners' sense of the quality of information exchanged and the STEM students' preparedness to enter industry or a graduate program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nS-STEM Project Outcomes Report\n\n \n\nBuilding on the success of the Susquehanna University\u2019s 2012 NSF S-STEM grant Broadening Intensive Opportunities for Scholarship (NSF No. DUE-1060484), the physics, chemistry, and biology departments received funding in 2018 to develop an expanded version of the program aimed at providing opportunities for students in multiple STEM departments at SU.  Two cohorts of 10 students each were recruited from those interested in majors within these three departments.  Students who were chosen to participate fit the NSF S-STEM program\u2019s goal of providing support for academically talented students who have a demonstrated high financial need. In addition to financial aid through the grant scholarship, programming was developed to support the S-STEM students both academically and professionally.\n\nIn particular, supporting programming included a summer bridge program, dedicated S-STEM sections of first-year seminar and subsequent seminar courses, funding for summer research opportunities, and one-on-one pairing with industry mentors.  The S-STEM team placed specific emphasis on the industry mentoring component as connections with industry professionals can be difficult in more rural areas such as Susquehanna University\u2019s location in central Pennsylvania.  A group of 26 mentors were identified and maintained through our S-STEM mentoring coordinator.  These mentors were paired up with S-STEM students who met with them regularly over the course of their four years at SU. At the beginning of the program in 2018, the plan was to have half the mentor-student pairs meet in person and the other half meet remotely via phone or video. The aim was to gauge the effectiveness of tele-mentoring as an alternative to in situations where in-person opportunities are less prevalent. However, the tele-mentoring aspect became a vital part of this process when COVID restrictions forced remote-only options. Beginning with tele-mentoring as an option allowed us to cast a wider net when recruiting mentors which gave students a broader perspective than would have been available if our search was restricted locally.\n\nIntellectual Merit: Students in our S-STEM program were given the opportunity to interact with peers, faculty, and industry professionals from their own fields of interest as well as those in related STEM fields that they otherwise might not have considered.  The programming allowed students to consider how knowledge of related fields could benefit them in their own discipline or even open up unique interdisciplinary career opportunities. Results, lessons and takeaways from the program were presented at the national 2022 S-STEM Symposium.\n\nBroader Impacts: Throughout the program, emphasis was placed on exposing students to a variety of perspectives related to STEM careers that would prepare and inform their decisions related to post-graduation plans.  Industry mentor pairing along with roundtable discussions with the local Chamber of Commerce and Central Pennsylvania Workforce Development Board provided students with a broader picture of the career opportunities that are available for them to pursue with their STEM education. Expanding this program\u2019s scope to include majors from physics, chemistry and biology allowed for a more interdisciplinary experience for the students.  The variety of faculty and mentor interaction gave students a wider perspective of STEM for their time in school and beyond.  The expanded scope did highlight the need for flexibility in the support programming particularly related to the mentoring component and cohort semesterly seminar courses.  For the current proposed programming based on this feedback we plan to continue to include majors from all three participating departments but offer more targeted and relevant support content at various points during the cohorts\u2019 time at SU.  With much of this content, we would like to place an emphasis on issues of diversity, equity and inclusion in STEM fields.  By shifting this content out of a seminar course, we will also be able to make this programming available for the benefit of the S-STEM students but also to the broader campus community.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/17/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Carl Faust"
