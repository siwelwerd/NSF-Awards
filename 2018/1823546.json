 "awd_abstract_narration": "While the general public typically focuses on processor clock speed as a measure of microprocessor performance, it is often the memory system that limits overall system performance, particularly for today's data-hungry uses of computing.  This project explores a transformative approach to designing computer hardware, particularly the memory system:  Rather than rely solely on human insight and intuition, this approach adapts and leverages machine learning techniques to explore larger and richer design spaces in a more thorough and systematic manner.  This approach enables hardware designers to consider more complex design factors than are currently possible.  \r\n\r\nThis project consists of two phases.  The first phase seeks to dramatically improve traditional memory system components, such as cache replacement policies and data prefetchers, which have been heavily studied but are now ripe for innovation with the use of machine learning. The second phase considers complicating factors such as criticality, the interaction among these components, and the use of new memory technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project has developed novel techniques for designing computer hardware. Rather than rely solely on human insight and intuition, our approach adapts and leverages machine learning techniques to explore larger and richer design spaces in a more thorough and systematic manner. Thus, this approach enables hardware designers to consider more complex design factors than are currently possible. In particular, we have focused on two lines of research.\n\n\nThe first line of work focuses on the design of hardware prediction mechanisms within the memory system, specifically, cache replacement policies and data prefetchers. This project has shown that neural models can be used to improve the design of cache replacement policies: In particular, we have shown how an impractical neural model can provide insights that lead to new practical policies that advance the state-of-the-art. This project has also produced a series of new data prefetchers that improve the performance of programs with irregular data access streams, including Voyager, the first neural model that can perform a form of irregular data prefetching known as temporal prefetching. While Voyager is far too large and expensive to be deployed as a hardware prefetcher, it demonstrates the significant headroom that still remains in this well-trodden research area.\n\n\nThe second line focuses on the automated design of hardware accelerators for deep learning. These accelerators provide significant performance and energy savings for deep learning applications, which are now ubiquitous. The automated design of such accelerators is challenging because of the huge, complex design space of deep learning hardware and the software that runs on them. Here, our primary contributions has been the use of intelligent search techniques that exploit the use of domain information to better navigate these huge design spaces. The end result is a tool that converges faster to good design points faster than previous automated solutions while also identifying superior points in the design space that other techniques overlook.\n\n\nBroader Impact:\n\n\nThis project has helped train and mentor many students. It has trained one postdoctoral researcher, and it has produced 5 PhD dissertations, 3 Masters reports, and 9 undergraduate honors theses. In addition to producing numerous publications in top computer architecture venues, this project has produced one book on cache replacement policies, and it has developed and deployed a research-based computer architecture course for undergraduates.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/16/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: CalvinLin\n"
