 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project seeks to find a common decision-making framework that seamlessly integrates offline data and computing, real-time data and computing, learning, and probabilistic predictive decision. It provides a unified theory of model-based and data-driven real-time optimization and control for uncertain networked systems. Integral Reinforcement Learning holds the key to integrating real-time data-driven methods, model-based methods, and physical constraints. The structure of Integral Reinforcement Learning will be explored to investigate exactly how and where to use Deep Learning neural networks in architectures that have multiple nested learning loops. A probabilistic spatiotemporal scenario data-driven framework will then be developed for multi-scale sequential control of networked engineering systems under uncertainty. The algorithms and tools developed will be used to sculpt optimal power profiles for power electronics converters in a DC distribution network and help mitigate the adverse effects of intermittent sources, uncertain load demand, or faults.\r\n \r\nThe project represents a radical departure from the exiting big data and decision-making research, toward developing autonomous decision-making under uncertainty constructs for systems of growing scales and time critical mission requirements.  Algorithms and tools developed can be extended to other smart and connected domains, e.g., air traffic management, networked traffic platoons, and sensor networks. US microgrid capacity is expected to reach 4.3 GW by 2020. DC distribution networks are emerging alternatives to AC distribution ones, and are critical to the scalable integration of renewable energy resources and electrified transportation fleets. Research results will be ported into topics in reinforcement learning, optimal control, networked control systems, data-driven analysis and decision-making, and power electronics systems. This project synergizes research activities between University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) and Texas A&M-Corpus Christi (TAMUCC), both HBCU/MI Hispanic Serving Institutions, and involves students from Electrical Engineering and Computer Science backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
