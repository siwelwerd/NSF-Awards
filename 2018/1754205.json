 "awd_abstract_narration": "Psychological scientists have an impressive arsenal of research methodologies at their disposal.\u00a0\u00a0Many of the currently popular methods are tried and tested and have been in use for 100 years or more.\u00a0\u00a0Recently, however, exciting new methods have been developed that make use of modern computing technologies, advances in statistics, and big data.\u00a0Because these modern methods often allow researchers to process large amounts of data at once and ask very detailed questions, they often give results that are robust (reliable and replicable).\u00a0In order to bring these robust research methods to the forefront of psychological and social science, a \"Workshop on Robust Social and Behavioral Sciences\" will be held, which will be attended by some of the world's foremost experts in this area.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe most important \"robust\" methods are (1) multifaceted randomized designs that enhance generalizability to a wider set of conditions, (2) robust statistics that are less sensitive to common violations of assumptions (including, notably, the assumption of random sample selection), (3) alternatives to classical hypothesis testing such as parameter estimation, process modeling, model selection, and Bayesian inference, and (4) collection of intensive data such as data generated by social media, data collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk, or data output by \"many-labs\" research consortia.\u00a0 During the Workshop, attendees will discuss the pros and cons of these research methods that are adapted to the demands and affordances of our field in the present day.\u00a0 An interdisciplinary panel led by an expert in cultural and behavioral change will evaluate the applicability of these methods to different subfields, identify discipline-specific challenges, and prepare a \"road map\" document outlining current such challenges for methodologists to address.\u00a0 Attendees will also produce video lectures on the topic of robust methods, and these lectures will be informed by comments from the interdisciplinary panel.\u00a0 All products of the Workshop will be made public.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe purpose of this project was to organize a workshop on research methods in social science.  The Workshop on Robust Social Science took place in St. Petersburg, Florida, from June 4 to 7, 2018.\n\nThe workshop focused on modern research methods &mdash; recent developments in methodology and statistics, and new techniques made possible by modern technology &mdash; that are more conducive to reproducibility. In particular, panelists discussed how such methods can and cannot be applied in behavioral and cognitive science and how their use could be facilitated or encouraged.\n\nThe workshop was attended by global experts in research methodology and statistics (to discuss the methods) as well as domain experts in a variety of disciplines in psychology and cognitive science (to discuss their feasibility).\n\nThe primary output of this workshop is a sequence of publications &mdash; some still in progress &mdash; on the topic of robustness in social science.  The first major output is a target paper and a special issue of the journal Computational Brain &amp; Behavior.  The target article and special issue focus on the interface between computational and cognitive model on the one hand and open and transparent science on the other hand, and they discuss the need for registration of analysis plans.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/14/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joachim Vandekerckhove"
