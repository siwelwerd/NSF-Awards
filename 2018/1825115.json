 "awd_abstract_narration": "Additive manufacturing (AM) processes for metallic materials, namely powder-bed fusion, and various powder-feed and wire-feed systems, are bringing dramatic changes to the manufacturing industry. The unprecedented agility achieved through layer-by-layer material addition is enabling near net-shape production of complex components. Despite this promise and progress, the qualification and acceptance of AM parts have been compromised by the lack of consistency in material behavior and life-limiting properties, e.g., undesirable ductility and fatigue behavior. These inconsistencies are often attributed to subtle, yet characteristic variations in the microstructure (morphology and defect structure), possibly a consequence of small perturbations in the AM process parameters. By implementing a multi-pronged approach incorporating innovative methods of integrated computational materials engineering (ICME), such as physics-based multi-scale modeling, multi-objective design, and materials characterization and testing, this research will address this shortcoming by developing a robust framework for location specific material properties and behavior in structures fabricated by AM processes. Ultimately, it will provide guidance on the links between process parameters and product performance and life, paving the acceptance of AM parts in critical applications. The research will promote the sciences associated with ICME; advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by establishing the provenance of AM manufacturing; and secure the national defense by enabling near on-demand, net-shape production of critical parts in theaters. Collaborative partnerships with Sandia National Laboratories and JHU/Applied Physics Laboratory will be a strength of this research. Graduate students on this project will undergo multi-disciplinary training in state-of-the-art techniques in multi-scale modeling, design optimization, materials characterization and modern manufacturing processes. The collaboration with Sandia and JHU/APL will also provide them exposure to the most advance technological advancements that will help their professional career development. \r\n\r\nTwo specific developmental modules will be realized for AM processed metals and alloys with polycrystalline-polyphase microstructures. They are: (i) development and implementation of parametrically homogenized constitutive/damage models (PHCMs) with explicit representation of microstructural descriptors in the form of representative aggregate microstructural parameters or (RAMPs), and (2) development of PHCM-based robust design methods for location-specific material design in structures designed, e.g., by topology optimization. Furthermore, PHCM-based simulations readily estimate the effect of variations in the microstructure on structure-scale variables like stresses, strains, strength, and even ductility or fatigue life. This will facilitate sensitivity analysis in location-specific material design in AM processed structures that have been conceptualized by design methods like topology optimization. A multi-objective function framework will be incorporated for identifying a Pareto front, defining the achievable cross-property space. The outcome of the detailed material design undertaking will be a structural-scale layout of the microstructure (in terms of RAMPs) for a robust, site-dependent distribution of macro-scale properties. This will guide the selection of AM processes parameters and routes to improve structure-material performance and life.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Ti-6Al-4V processed by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). These alloys, characterized by complex Widmanst?tten microstructures containing HCP lattice-based alpha laths in parent BCC lattice-based beta grains have high promise in high-performance, mission-critical components with complex topological configurations. The performance and life of these materials are affected by defects at a range of length-scales that are inherent to AM materials. The major outcome of this research project has been on multiple fronts. With respect to research, the major outcomes include the development of a very efficient, yet detailed micromechanical model of the AM materials with complex microstructures. In addition, a data-driven Bayesian model has been developed for predicting fatigue crack nucleation in polycrystalline microstructures of metallic materials.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work has developed an effective crystal plasticity framework with a parametric representation of the alpha lath morphology by identifying the crystallographic relationship of the alpha laths in relation to the parent beta grains from which they have nucleated and developing methods to incorporate a statistical representation of HCP alpha laths in beta grains. The constitutive model for beta grains statistically accounts for the size, shape, orientation, and crystallography of all 12 alpha lath variants. An important contribution is the integration of porosity evolution with the crystal plasticity model. Important outcomes of this project &nbsp;include the following.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A method for creating statistically equivalent RVEs (SERVEs) for Widmanst<em>?</em>tten microstructure of Ti-6Al-4V containing clusters of multiple variants of alpha laths in the beta grains. A parent beta grain identifier and classifier are constructed using a Bayesian method. </li>\n<li>An equivalent crystal plasticity model is developed to account for the multiple variants of alpha laths in the beta grains of AM materials. A homogenization approach that represents the underlying material response of the alpha laths is constructed. Within each parent beta grain, the slip systems for each of the 12 potential variants are calculated. </li>\n<li>A crystal plasticity model is developed for the deformation and ductile failure of porous crystalline microstructures. The proposed model captures the effect of porosity, crystallo- graphic orientation, and stress-states on the homogenized mechanical response of microscopically porous RVEs with single crystal HCP matrix phase.</li>\n<li>A machine learning-aided parametrically homogenized crystal plasticity model has been developed for microstructures containing distributed heterogeneities. Supervised and unsupervised learning methods, such as support vector regression, artificial neural networks, k-means, and symbolic regression, enhance optimization, model emulation, and sensitivity analysis methods, which are all critical components of the multi-scale modeling pipeline. The integration of machine learning techniques with physics-based models enables the construction of a single crystal parametrically homogenized constitutive model for polycrystalline alloys.</li>\n<li>A probabilistic predictive model for crack nucleation under fatigue loading. In this process, it fuses several statistical, data-driven methods operating on micromechanical and experimental data, as well as important mechanistic observations. The model systematically reduces a large set of experimentally obtained microstructural data and corresponding crystal plasticity-based micromechanical simulation results to a 3D posterior probability density function for crack nucleation. The framework identifies most important crack-delineating state variables in the microstructural material volume. This selection process follows a statistically unbiased approach that makes an informed decision while accounting for numerous experimental microstructures and mechanical simulations. A multi-dimensional Bayesian model, con- structed to capture this sequence of mechanistic events, is validated for various microstructures and probabilistic measures. A simplified crack nucleation indicator is formulated to integrate the parallel slip concepts into a single scalar model.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impact</strong></p>\n<p>Two Ph.D. students have&nbsp; been supported to completion in this project.
