 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines the constructive aspect of social movements.  Although attention and research often focus on contentious actions like strikes and protests, movements also seek their goals through a range of constructive strategies and tactics such as proactively creating alternative economic institutions.  This study will investigate how a solutions agenda fits into the pursuit of collective goals and what the effects of simultaneous use of constructive and contentious actions are.  Findings will increase theoretical understanding of social movements and also will be useful to policy makers and public representatives who seek to negotiate solutions to pressing social issues.\r\n\r\nThis project uses the tools of ethnography in multiple sites to analyze the general social movement practice of \"resist and build\" in the context of a specific campaign of financial divestiture.  The research design triangulates interviews, observations, and documents collected at three social movement organizations: a grassroots nonprofit, an intermediary convener, and a transnational social movement organization.  Bringing scholarship extending theories of contentious politics into dialogue with theoretical debates in sociology, the project asks why actors paired repertoires of contention and construction and how the resulting practice has shaped the social movement.  As a baseline study, the project seeks to establish a new theoretical bridge between two substantive areas of sociology and to inform social movement practice by broadening the scope of inquiry to a new set of repertoires.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe dissertation resulting from this project explores the interplay of resistance and building in collective political struggle.  Although strikes, protests, and other contentious activities garner much public attention, the constructive dimensions of social movements have often been overlooked.  I call attention to the myriad ways movements build social-relational infrastructure to meet collective needs ranging from cooperatives to community gardens. \n\nFocusing on the example of a campaign to move money from fossil fuel investments to communities most impacted by climate change, I illustrate how pairing the contentiousness of divestment with the constructiveness of reinvestment in climate solutions yields new theoretical models of how movements tick.  I find, for example, that saying \"yes\" to a just transition to a regenerative economy is crucial for sustaining morale and dramatically expands our understanding of what counts as activism.  I also find that foregrounding solutions can be an effective strategy to build unlikely coalitions and adapt to a changing political environment. \n\nUltimately, paying attention to constructive dimensions of social movements is necessary for both theoretical and practical reasons.  My research creates new opportunities to build bridges across disciplines, policy platforms, and social divides.  It expands our knowledge about the broader range of actions collectivities pursue to achieve social change.  And most importantly, it helps us envision concrete pathways to rise to the challenges of our times.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/17/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Laura K Schlachter"
