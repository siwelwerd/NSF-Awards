 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University and Jepson Herbaria (UC/JEPS) at the University of California, Berkeley with approximately 2,250,000 specimens is the largest collection west of the Missouri Botanical Garden and the largest at a public university in the USA. It is a widely used and growing collection representing all plant groups across all continents. This project will enable the consolidation and proper housing of three important collections that were developed over the research career of four specialists on mistletoes (parasitic plants that live on host branches).  This consolidation of approximately 20,000 specimens, including 1,200 haustoria (connections between host and parasite), will result in the largest and most comprehensive collection of mistletoes in the world and will provide a unique resource that is not available elsewhere.  Securing these collections is urgent because they are currently stored in non-archival conditions and are not easily available for study.   Mistletoes are considered keystone forest species that are central to studies on ecology, biodiversity, and species interactions in forested environments.  Undergraduate students from the research apprenticeship program at the University of California, Berkeley will be trained in museum curation and work-study students will be trained in databasing and digitization of natural history collections. \r\n\r\nTo accommodate these collections, compactors with 44 new cabinets will be installed and archival boxes purchased to house haustoria.  Specimens will be imaged and label information will be captured for incorporation into the UC/JEPS herbarium portal (http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/specimens/) and will be shared with GBIF (https://www.gbif.org/) and iDigBio (https://www.idigbio.org/), making these collections accessible to the public and researchers across several platforms. More information about the UC/JEPS Herbaria and this project is available at: http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In addition, collections are educational materials that illustrate earth&rsquo;s diversity and facilitate learning activities. Mistletoes are photosynthetic flowering plant parasites that live on host branches and obtain water and nutrients from the host. They are considered keystone species in many communities where they provide significant food resources, nest sites, shelter, and nutrient-rich leaf litter. Mistletoes represent unique collections that not only capture information about species and their occurrences but also information about interactions between parasites and their hosts and potentially other complex interactions within their communities.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>With this study, three large mistletoe collections were incorporated into the existing University and Jepson Herbaria (UC/JEPS) at the University of California, Berkeley. These three collections were donated to the University by mistletoe experts and expanded the collection from about 2,000 to 19,500 specimens. Included is a unique collection of about 1000 haustoria (connections between host and parasite), that are rarely collected. The collection is now housed together in 37 cabinets that store vouchers and seven that store archival boxes with haustoria (Fig. 1). Vouchers are digitized with images that are available to researchers, students, and the public through the UC/JEPS portal (https://webapps.cspace.berkeley.edu/ucjeps/publicsearch/publicsearch/). Final counts and analyses indicate that it is comprehensive across families, genera, and areas of occurrence. It includes specimens from each of approximately 82 genera across the five families of mistletoes with major holdings from Africa, North, Central and South America, Asia, and Australia, regions that are rich in mistletoes. From comparisons to other collections, it is believed to be the largest collection of mistletoe worldwide. It is also the only known intentional collection of mistletoe haustoria, although some herbaria may have a few haustoria in their bulk collections.</span></p>\n<p>Some of the diversity present in mistletoe flowers and their overall growth is illustrated in Fig. 2, and haustorial diversity in Fig. 3. Mistletoes mostly occur in forest or savannah habitats but can also be found in urban settings. An example is&nbsp;<em>Amylotheca dictyophleba</em>&nbsp;or brush mistletoe (Fig. 4), a rainforest species that occurs occasionally in urban areas, such as this Brisbane park in Australia. Its berries are important forage for birds, especially the mistletoe bird and honeyeaters, and it is the host for several caterpillars including those of the trident penciled-blue butterflies. Fig. 5 shows a voucher and haustorium from our collections of the brush mistletoe.</p>\n<p>This study provided funds for seven work study students, several worked two or three years on the project. Each of these students graduated with a BS degree and these funds were essential to their success. Through this project the work study students were trained in collection curation, digitization, and data handling. This study also trained two undergraduate research apprentices in the curation of special collections, use of collections in research, and research methodologies. Both students worked closely with Dr. Wilson on curation of the haustoria collection, and a research project using the mistletoe collection, on-line resources of mistletoe occurrence, and climate data. A student gave two professional talks and presented one poster over different aspects of our research into Australian mistletoes. Fig. 5 is a poster that was presented and shows present occurrences of species with different haustorial types as well as predicted current and future suitable habitat. We are currently reviewing the final version of a manuscript over our findings prior to submission. The student is now interviewing for PhD positions and credits his work on this project as key to his successful applications. The second undergraduate research apprentice is working on a similar project on African mistletoes and will continue with her research even though the curation of the mistletoes has been completed.

Specimens from this collection have also been used by research groups who studied specimens and extracted DNA from leaves. Natural history collections hold a wealth of information and are increasingly valued in research. They provide for analyses of large data sets that provide insights into changes in plant form, community composition, and flowering time over centuries of time. They also provide materials for DNA, cellular, and chemical analyses from across the living world and will be available for study far into the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/27/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Carol&nbsp;A&nbsp;Wilson</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1756351/1756351_10532609_1698358711379_Fig-mistletoestoragecopy--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1756351/1756351_10532609_1698358711379_Fig-mistletoestoragecopy--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1756351/1756351_10532609_1698358711379_Fig-mistletoestoragecopy--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Mistletoe collection in 44 cabinets: lower, work study student cross-checking haustoria with list; top left, cabinet with vouchers; top right, cabinet with haustoria.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Carol A.
