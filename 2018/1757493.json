 "awd_abstract_narration": "This interdisciplinary REU Site program will prepare undergraduates for research, employment, and advanced study in the emerging discipline of Computational Science - a discipline that is critical not only for the advancement of science, but for our nation's economic growth and security. With the advent of more powerful computing tools, computational science is often described as the third pillar of science, joining the traditional pillars of theory and experiment. Students will work in small groups and with faculty guidance while employing innovative computational tools to solve problems in applied science.  Students will acquire essential technical and professional skills by participating in faculty-led workshops. One-on-one interactions with faculty mentors, collaboration between students, independent inquiry, and guided training will provide students with valuable skills in programming, computational modeling, simulation, data analysis, visualization, research management, and communication. The research conducted through this REU Site program has the potential to produce high-impact, publication-quality results in the fields of materials science, epidemiology, cellular biology, and molecular dynamics. Targeted recruiting and selection efforts will ensure that under-represented constituencies, including women, minority, first generation college, and veteran students, are well represented in the program.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this REU Site program is to recruit undergraduate students into the fast growing, and interdisciplinary field of computational science. Faculty will mentor students as they integrate computation and mathematical/statistical theory to solve problems in molecular dynamics, epidemiology, materials science, and cellular biology. Research problems will form and test mechanistic hypotheses about the structure of biological proteins, yield insights into the dynamics and control of diseases that pose a major threat to public health, address computational topics in the design of optical and acoustical metamaterials, and investigate fundamental principles of cellular decision-making. These research projects, together with a series of bi-weekly workshops, will support innovation by training students in a) Python programming, including best practices for readability, documentation, sharing, and structuring of code and b) tools (e.g. MDAnalysis, Comsol, and Pymol) and techniques (e.g., machine learning, sensitivity analysis, and parameter estimation) for model development, data analysis, and visualization.  Students with a strong background in mathematics, computer science, physics, or biology, and an intense interest in applied science and computation are encouraged to apply.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nREU Site: Computational Modeling and Simulation in Applied Sciences.\n\n\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\n\n\n\nThe objective of this REU program is to introduce students to the rapidly evolving discipline of computational science through closely mentored research experiences. With the advent of more powerful computing tools, computational science is often described as the third pillar of science, joining the traditional pillars of theory and experiment. Currently only about 60 graduate programs in computational science exist in North America and Europe &#8203;(SIAM, 2017)&#8203;, and opportunities for undergraduate study in this area are even more limited. Students are often unaware or under informed about this growing discipline. This REU offers a unique opportunity for students to gain formative first-hand experience in computational science. Research projects will be on topics aimed at producing publication-quality results. Middle Tennessee State University has long supported excellence in undergraduate research and the faculty participants in this grant have an established record of publishing with undergraduates.\n\n\n\n\nBroader Impacts\n\n\n\n\nThis project trained students to use innovative computational tools and a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach to solve problems in applied science. Student trainingtook place through one-on-one interactions with faculty mentors, independent inquiry, workshops, and a python boot camp, which instructed students in best practices in programing. Through participation in this REU students gained skills for computational modeling, simulation, and data analysis as well as professional skills related to research management and communication. These skills serve the participants in their future STEM careers whether they go to graduate schools or directly enter the job market.\n\n\n\n\nThe REU site produced new results in computational science that can potentiallyimpact a variety of disciplines, including materials science, epidemiology, cell science, and molecular dynamics. Student participantswere involved in the on-going research of the faculty mentors, carrying out research programs designed to lead to high impact results. The PI, co-PI, and senior personnel on this grant have a strong record of crafting undergraduate research projects that lead to publication.\n\n\n\n\nThis REU also increased the diversity of the STEM workforce through the targeted recruitment of women, minority, first generation college, and veteran students. The recruitment and selection efforts ensured that students from these constituencies were well represented in the program.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, there are a host of other beneficial impacts. Faculty mentors have broadened their network of scholars by participating in collaborative research with the students, graduate&#8239;student&#8239;mentors also benefited from gaining valuable mentoring&#8239;experience. MTSU hasbenefited from having a diverse group of bright young scholars on campus. The Computational Science PhD program had the opportunity to recruit one or more of the REU students, and the REU workshopsprovided a foundation for an undergraduate course in computational science, which could be adopted by other institutions.\n\n\nOutcomes\n\n\nTwenty five participants completed eighteen research projects. Research projects and results were summarized as posters and presented at the university's summer research celebration. Each summer formal training consisted of a Python bootcamp, fiveProfessional Workshops, and sevenScientific Workshops. This grant has so far resulted in seven publications and twenty regional and national presentations. Eight students have been accepted to graduate school and one student received a Goldwater scholarship.\n\nMiller, J., Naderi, S., Mullinax, C. B., and Phillips, J. L. (2022). Attention is not enough.
