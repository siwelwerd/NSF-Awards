 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent national reports call for undergraduate laboratory courses to be transformed so that all students have research experiences. Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) have proven to be a successful educational innovation that have enabled more students to do research. The biological context for this education research project is a CURE that is based on the gut bacterial microbiome of the bean beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus. College and university faculty from a range of institutions and geographic locations will attend workshops as a part of this project to learn how to work with bean beetles, study their microbiome, evaluate microbial community data, and implement bean beetle microbiome CUREs in their courses. Working with bean beetles will allow student researchers to readily manipulate factors that might affect gut bacteria in ways that would not be possible with vertebrates or other insect model systems. Students will have the freedom to design their own experiments and to develop their own research questions, as practicing scientists do.  The project is designed to examine the importance of student autonomy (i.e. choosing their own research questions) in the context of course-based research classes, and to guide science educators as they change the way in which science is learned and taught. This project has the potential to benefit students at a range of institutions including minority serving and two-year colleges by increasing the retention of students in science and fostering interest in pursuing STEM careers or graduate school. \r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this project is to determine the importance of student autonomy in a discovery CURE across diverse institutions. This goal will be achieved by disseminating, implementing, and assessing a data-intensive bean beetle microbiome CURE that will simultaneously advance our understanding of insect host-microbe interactions.  The first objective is to examine the importance of student autonomy in a discovery CURE. Student outcomes will be assessed using a mixed methods approach with surveys, structured interviews, and focus groups. The second objective is to foster research on insect host-microbe interactions using experimental approaches with the bean beetle model system. The third and fourth goals are to develop faculty expertise with hands-on workshops in research protocols for examining microbial communities in bean beetles, and in data science for bioinformatics and microbial community analyses. The fifth objective is to foster the implementation of data-intensive course-based research at diverse institutions. Faculty from the hands-on workshops will implement a bean beetle microbiome CURE in two different semesters. The project is designed to increase the number of minority and two-year college students who participate in CUREs, stay engaged in science, and pursue graduate degrees in STEM disciplines.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\n\nThis project trained faculty from colleges and universities to implement an insect microbiome curriculum in undergraduate laboratory courses. This curriculum, a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE), engaged students in authentic scientific research. Students evaluated factors that influence the bacterial communities that are found in the digestive tract of bean beetles, Callosobruchus maculatus, an agricultural pest species with worldwide distribution. Although CURE learning has been well documented to improve student outcomes, the importance of student autonomy to choose their research question was unknown.\r\n\n\nThis study addressed the role of student autonomy by having faculty implement the bean beetle microbiome curriculum two times with different students, once where the students chose the research question (high autonomy) and once where the instructor specified the research question (low autonomy). We found that the level of student autonomy to determine their research question did not significantly change student perceptions of the research work that they were conducting nor student outcomes. Short-term student outcomes included assessments of Self-Efficacy (self-confidence about conducting research), Scientific Community Values, Project Ownership and Networking. In addition, Science Identity (a medium-term outcome), and Career Expectations (a long-term outcome) were assessed. None of these outcome components were significantly different between high and low student autonomy groups.\r\n\n\nThese findings indicate that CURE laboratories are just as effective when an instructor specifies a research question as when students have the autonomy to determine a research question so long as students engage in authentic research activities. Consequently, laboratory instructors may pursue CURE pedagogy in their teaching without concern about compromising student outcomes if the instructor determines the research question in advance. Being able to determine the research question in advance should minimize laboratory preparation constraints that may be caused by the uncertainty of not knowing what research question will be pursued.\r\n\n\nIn addition to the educational research outcomes, the project produced scientific research outcomes. Faculty were not given specific research questions or factors to address in their specific laboratory class implementations, so a wide variety of scientific questions on the factors that influence bean beetle microbiome communities were pursued. Students conducted research on such factors as sex differences, the bean species on which the beetle developed, temperature, life history stage (adults, larvae or eggs), and age. Since very little is published on bean beetle microbiome biology, all these findings add to our knowledge of insect-microbiome interactions.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nBroader Impacts\r\n\n\nA total of 84 faculty and staff from 49 colleges and universities participated in one of 6 workshops (3 in-person workshops and 3 online workshops) as part of this project, from 2019  2023. This included faculty from 23 HBCU or minority-serving institutions, 11 community colleges, 17 liberal arts colleges, 8 comprehensive universities and 9 research universities. These workshops provided technical training for the successful implementation of the bean beetle microbiome curriculum (raising and handling live insects, microbiology techniques, molecular biology, DNA technologies, bioinformatics, and community ecology), as well as training in the implementation of CURE laboratories in biology courses.\r\n\n\nA total of 1038 students in 76 course sections at 23 colleges and universities participated in this project (completed a pre-course assessment survey) and conducted a bean beetle microbiome research study. 50% of the students self-identified as under-represented minorities. 48% of the students self-identified as female, and 25% as first-generation college students. Among faculty who responded to an end-of-project survey, 56% (10/18) reported that they plan to continue teaching the bean beetle microbiome curriculum after the end of NSF support for this project.\r\n\n\nA dedicated website for the project www.beanbeetles.org was established prior to this project but was augmented with all the laboratory protocols, instructors guides, instructional supplemental materials and sample data for the bean beetle microbiome curriculum. All these materials are freely available. The website will be maintained for at least 8 years after the end of NSF funding.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/08/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: LawrenceSBlumer\n"
