 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molecules typically vibrate at frequencies that correspond to infrared light (the wavelength range important in night vision technologies).  Etalons are optical devices that consist of two parallel reflective metal plates whose spacing corresponds to infrared wavelengths (roughly 1 micrometer to 1 millimeter).  If molecules are placed inside an etalon with just the right spacing, their vibrational properties can change.  The molecule+cavity system is called a \"mixed state\", an interesting combination of light and matter.  Since molecular vibrations have very important roles in how molecules undergo chemical reactions, there is the possibility that by simply changing cavity spacings, we can change vibrational properties of the molecules as well as their reactivity. In this project supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms-A Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor James Coe and his graduate students at The Ohio State University seek to demonstrate the feasibility of making mixed states of infrared etalon cavity modes and condensed phase vibrations to change reaction rates.  \"Chemistry in Etalons\" would represent an entirely new field of chemistry, and may offer significant opportunities for producing chemicals more efficiently.  The students involved in this project are gaining experience in both advanced optical spectroscopy and theoretical chemistry calculations.  Professor Coe also plans to collaborate with professors at Cal State Dominguez Hills, which has an ethnically and economically diverse student body. \r\n\r\nThe project begins with the construction of alignable and adjustable etalons in order to produce etalon fringes of variable width. The etalon is filled with a condensed phase material which has vibrations of interest. Etalon fringes are angle-tuned into resonance with the vibrations and an infrared transmission spectrum is recorded which enables the measurement of Rabi splittings--the energy difference between the mixed states of cavity and vibration. In order for the measured Rabi splittings to be related to fundamental quantum mechanical properties such as dipole derivatives, our models show that the etalon fringe width and vibrational transition width should be the same. Since vibrational features show a wide range of widths, there is a need to be able to carefully design etalons that match molecular vibrations.  This project is focusing on: 1) the effect of etalon fringe width on measured Rabi splittings, 2) the conjugated double bond system of CO2 in water, and 3) broadened gas phase systems, all in order to establish the relation of these measurements to fundamental quantum mechanical properties. Finally, selected reactions are being studied within the wavelength-scale etalon cavity as informed by the previous results and as followed by infrared transmission spectra that allow assessment of whether the rates of reactions can be affected by mixed states of cavities and vibrations. While this project seeks fundamental insights into etalon-molecule mixed states, there is a potential for implications in a wide range of technological applications, including chemical and nanoparticle sensors, and even in heterogeneous catalysis (e.g., the etalon mirrors could serve as catalysts or catalyst supports).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

More specifically, these experiments made mixed states of infrared light and molecular vibrations, i.e. cavity-vibration polaritons, by placing molecules in solution between two parallel plate mirrors with a wavelength-scale spacing, i.e. an etalon cavity.&nbsp; Figure 1 shows the experimental arrangement in which an infrared beam impinges on the etalon at a variable angle (theta) and the light builds up by constructive interference when multiple passes within the etalon equal a whole number of wavelengths.&nbsp; &nbsp;The transmission output of the etalon when filled with air is shown at different angles in Figure 2.&nbsp; The basic idea is to angle-tune an etalon cavity mode into resonance with a molecular vibration of the liquid material placed in the etalon gap.&nbsp; A simplified model of the interaction of a molecular vibration and an etalon cavity mode is shown in Figure 3.&nbsp; The etalon cavity mode is in resonance (has the same energy) with a single vibration of energy indicated with a red vertical line.&nbsp; The blue trace shows the etalon cavity modes without this vibration and the green trace shows it with this vibration.&nbsp; The interaction of the cavity mode and vibration primarily produces two peaks marked by green asterisks.&nbsp; They are mixed states with high vibrational character and their energy difference is known as the effective Rabi splitting.&nbsp; One important outcome of our work is revealed by the shifts of the green transmission maxima from the blue revealing that other etalon cavity modes are also involved in the light matter interaction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our most significant outcome came when liquid acetonitrile was placed in an etalon with a 52 micron spacer as shown in Figure 4.&nbsp; The vibrational states of acetonitrile (blue labels) cause dramatic changes in the etalon transmission maxima as compared to an air gap etalon (Figure 2) including attenuations, shifts, and splittings of the transmission maxima.&nbsp; Our most important experiment involved angle-tuning etalon cavity modes in the region circled in Figure 4 which contains two vibrations which are known to interact in the absence of etalons, i.e. by Fermi interaction.&nbsp; This region is expanded in Figure 5 showing a snapshot at one angle, but the essential aspect is that the etalon cavity mode is angle-tuned from the CN stretch dominated vibration indicated with a vertical red line to the combination band vibration indicated with a vertical green line.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another major outcome of our work concerns the blue traces of the etalon cavity modes in Figures 2 and 5 which are not measured - rather they are reconstructed from knowledge of the complex index of refraction of the etalon contents.&nbsp; A method has been developed to get the complex index of refraction of the sample from etalon measurements (if not already available in the literature).&nbsp; We have developed ways to predict etalon transmission with and without target vibrations enabling a quantum mechanical interaction model for cavity-vibration mixed states.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scientific outcome of these experiments is shown in Figure 6a where the quantum mechanical coupling parameters for vibration-vibration and vibration-cavity interaction are plotted as an etalon cavity mode is tuned between the target vibrations.&nbsp; The fundamental property of Fermi interaction by vibrational coupling can be changed upon interaction with the cavity mode of an etalon which is an interesting and fundamental result.&nbsp; Likewise, the cavity-vibration couplings also change in interesting and detailed ways.&nbsp; The quantum mechanical interaction model also allows the cavity-vibration mixtures to be quantified as is shown with coloring in Figure 6b.&nbsp; States (two vibrations and seven etalon cavity modes ) before interaction are shown on the left of Figure 6b, and upon interaction, mixed states are produced in the model and compared to experiment on the far right side.&nbsp; The mixtures are indicated with colors on the energy level bar (red and green for the vibrations and blue for the summed contribution of etalon cavity modes).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ability to change fundamental vibrational dynamics within a cavity builds a foundation for understanding molecular vibrational dynamics in parallel plate etalon cavities.&nbsp; Most initial work on cavity-vibration mixed states has a single etalon cavity mode interacting with a single vibration (like Figure 2).&nbsp; Our work shows that multiple fringes can be involved and paves the way for the investigation of multiple, interacting vibrations by simultaneously placing etalon cavity modes in resonance with multiple, interacting vibrations.&nbsp; Since vibrations can be associated with reactions coordinates, it may be possible to change the course (speed and products) of reactions by performing the reaction within etalons.&nbsp; Practicality remains to be determined, but studies using etalons to change reaction rates are emerging in the literature.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/01/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: James&nbsp;V&nbsp;Coe</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1800414/1800414_10562427_1633019319426_outcomes_fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1800414/1800414_10562427_1633019319426_outcomes_fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1800414/1800414_10562427_1633019319426_outcomes_fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Geometry to make cavity-vibration mixed states.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">James V Coe</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">James&nbsp;V&nbsp;Coe</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1800414/1800414_10562427_1633019479057_outcomes_fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1800414/1800414_10562427_1633019479057_outcomes_fig2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1800414/1800414_10562427_1633019479057_outcomes_fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Angle-tuning shifts the position of transmission maxima (etalon cavity modes) of an air filled etalon.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">James V Coe</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">James&nbsp;V&nbsp;Coe</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1800414/1800414_10562427_1633019699771_outcomes_fig3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1800414/1800414_10562427_1633019699771_outcomes_fig3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1800414/1800414_10562427_1633019699771_outcomes_fig3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Model interaction by etalon transmission simulation (transfer matrix method) without vibration (blue) and with (green) a single strong vibration (red) in resonance with an etalon cavity mode producing two mixed states with high vib. character indicated with green asterisk.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">James V Coe</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">James&nbsp;V&nbsp;Coe</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1800414/1800414_10562427_1633019813394_outcomes_fig4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1800414/1800414_10562427_1633019813394_outcomes_fig4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1800414/1800414_10562427_1633019813394_outcomes_fig4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Experimental etalon transmission with 52 micron gap filled with liquid acetonitrile (black symbols).
