 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) at the National Science Foundation (NSF) has recently formed a partnership with the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (OE) at the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to support fundamental mathematical and statistical research that aims to develop novel methodology and algorithms for improvement of the security, reliability, and efficiency of the modern power systems. The new program, named the Algorithms for Modern Power Systems (AMPS), intends to catalyze a broad range of interdisciplinary research initiatives at the forefront of power system engineering, mathematics, statistics, and financial mathematics. The objective of this proposal is to request support to organize the NSF AMPS PI's workshops, to be held in the fall terms of 2018 and 2019. The upcoming NSF AMPS PI's workshops will gather principal investigators funded by the AMPS program along with the stakeholders from DOE and other government agencies, to report the progress from the research projects, and to facilitate creation, transfer and application of knowledge on modern power grids. \r\n\r\nResilience of power systems is of the utmost importance to our daily lives. Understanding the causes and impact of power disruption -- from random failures to natural disasters to terrorist attacks -- is the key to the societal sustainability and well-being. The ability to integrate concepts and methods from different domains is essential to our understanding of the power system functionality and, hence, to enhancing the national security. Furthermore, as broadly recognized nowadays, the nature of power system analysis does not fit within a paradigm of any single discipline and requires development of novel algorithms that transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries. As the NSF Strategic Plan FY 2018--2022 emphasizes, ``combining our knowledge enables us to find more robust solutions''. The NSF AMPS PI's workshops will create a unique opportunity for interaction among diverse teams of researchers and practitioners to discuss fundamental challenges of modern power systems and to offer  interdisciplinary insights on finding more secure and reliable solutions to analysis of modern power grids and critical infrastructures, in general.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
