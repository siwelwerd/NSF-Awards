The SIGMETRICS conference presents innovative, exciting work related to all aspects of performance for all types of computer systems. Highly original ideas, new approaches, and/or ground breaking results are expected. \r\n\r\nTravel support will make possible the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend. Particular attention is paid to directing support towards under-represented groups, e.g., gender or ethnic minorities and students from smaller or less well-known institutions. The support will provide students who attend with the opportunity to interact with a diverse group of mentors and peers, furthering their education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
