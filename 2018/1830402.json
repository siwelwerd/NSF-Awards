 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to track, predict and reason about pedestrians and vehicles in a fast-paced dense urban environment is crucial to ensuring that autonomous vehicles can operate safely and dependably.  This project focuses on providing that capability to fleets of autonomous cars and delivery drones, allowing these autonomous systems to realize their promised societal benefits, such as the potential for greater mobility of people and goods while reducing traffic congestion and increasing safety.  This technology can moreover be customized for other applications such as large manufacturing operations and even small household robotic applications.  The methods and results from this project will be included in course curricula and in used outreach programs and events.\r\n\r\nThe project approaches this challenge in several ways: (i) combine classification algorithms from machine vision with the motion tracking of the objects from multi-target Bayesian filters into a new filtering architecture; (ii) generate new online, distributed tessellation algorithms, using tools from Voronoi-based distributed coverage control, to dynamically partition the surrounding environment in a way that leverages the innate parallelism of teams of multi-robots; (iii) use this partition to create a distributed memory architecture that has bandwidth-efficient updates and ensures data integrity in the face of system errors and malicious agents; (iv) develop semantically-aware path planning algorithms for fast, online optimization of robot motion that account for the range of possible reactionary behaviors of other objects; and (v) design an app-based interface that facilitates two-way information exchange between a human operator and the multi-robot team.  A prototype system based on these advances will be tested and evaluated in a highly instrumented laboratory environment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to develop distributed algorithms for groups of robots to collaboratively track dynamic objects in their environment, to do so scalably to networks of 1000s or 100,000s of robots, and to develop distributed planning and control algorithms to help the robot interact more safely and intelligently with these dynamic objects.  The project has immediate applications to autonomous driving, in which cars with vehicle-to-vehicle wireless networks can use our algorithms to improve their perception performance, safety, and efficiency, and to networks of aerial drones for package delivery, which have collaboratively track people, birds, aircraft, or cars to safely avoid them while navigating to their destinations.  This was a collaborative project between teams at Stanford University and Temple University.  This project outcomes statement reports outcomes specifically from the Stanford team.\n\nThe project was highly successful in terms of publication output, publication impact, and educational training of PhD students and postdocs.  We published 8 conference papers and 6 journal papers in top-tier conferences and journals, with one other journal paper still under review.  These publications had strong impact in multiple fields.  One conference paper proposed a new distributed optimization-based algorithm for robotics to track dynamic objects in their environment, reducing tracking errors by up to 100x compared with current single-robot tracking algorithms.  This method also out-performs state-of-the-art distributed Kalman filtering based solutions.  The paper won the best paper award in multi-robot systems in the 2020 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA).  The project also produced a series of papers proposing and refining a new game-theoretic approach to robot planning, which uses mathematical concepts from game theory to account for the reactive feedback effects between a robot and the other dynamic agents in its environment.  Game-theoretic planning leads to safer and more human-interpretable motions for robots, autonomous cars, and drones.  This has become a significant research topic in robotics and control theory, and is already being transitioned into fielded autonomous vehicle technology.  Finally, as for educational training, this project provided partial support for 7 different PhD student over its four-year span.  Four of those students have already finished their PhDs and are working as research engineers in industry.  One other student will graduate in the summer of 2023, and the other two will graduate before the summer of 2024.  The project also partially supported a postdoctoral researcher, who is now a successful faculty member at UT Austin.\n\nIn summary, the project successfully achieved its goals, and has had a strong positive research impact.  The research from this project is already finding its way into engineering technology that will ultimately benefit people by improving the safety and efficiency of robotic systems such as self-driving cars and delivery drones.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/08/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mac Schwager"
