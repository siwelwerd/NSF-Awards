 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Biological and Environmental Data Education (BEDE) project seeks to create a community of biologists and data scientists dedicated to empowering undergraduate instructors to bring data science into biology and environmental science curricula. All scientists must now, to some extent, be data scientists--they must manage, analyze, and communicate about data in the context of collaborative, reproducible research. Furthermore, future professionals will need to have data science skills to deal with urgent problems in agriculture, environmental management, and public health. However, most students in biology and environmental science graduate with little data science experience. The BEDE Network will help address this need by focusing on developing the technical skills, curricular resources, and pedagogical confidence of undergraduate instructors so that they can more intentionally include core data science skills in their classes and labs. By engaging an inclusive community of scientists and biology and environmental science educators, BEDE will develop training workshops, curricular materials, and best practices that can be adopted by educators at almost any institution and in almost any course.\r\n\r\nBiology and environmental science have been fundamentally reshaped by recent technological advances, including increased computational power, sensor technologies, publicly available software and data, and the Internet. Together with these advances, complex, multidisciplinary questions and urgent environmental and public health problems have led to changes in scientific culture and practice, with shifts toward greater collaboration, accountability, and transparency. These technological advances and cultural changes represent an educational challenge: already-full courses and curricula do not prepare students to address data-intensive problems. To assess the main opportunities and obstacles for integrating data science into biology and environmental science curricula, BEDE investigators will use a survey to gather data on faculty attitudes and expertise about it. Data from the survey will be examined at a BEDE workshop, where participants will: 1) develop Train-the-Teachers workshops based on curricular needs of survey respondents, 2) prepare a position/review paper describing barriers and opportunities to incorporating data science in biology and environmental science education; and 3) develop plans for further expansion of the Network. \r\n\r\nThis project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange/finalreport/).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

All scientists must now, to some extent, be data scientists; they must learn to manage, analyze, and communicate about data in the context of collaborative, reproducible research (Figure 1). Yet most undergraduate students in biology and environmental science have little exposure to data science. Moreover, undergraduate courses and curricula are already quite \"full,\" and instructors often do not feel prepared to address data science topics due to gaps in their own understanding and training. BEDENet is designed to address these challenges by building a community of practice that can provide technical training and curricular understanding that empowers instructors to bring data science skills into their classroom.&nbsp;</span>BEDENet convened its opening workshop in the spring of 2019 and has gone on to recruit a robust community of participants, including a steering team made up of educators from varied backgrounds, career stages, and institution types.</p>\n<p>Originally a one-year award, the project was extended because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which prevented the ability of the BEDENet members to travel for in-person meetings and workshops. The primary purpose of Incubator award program is to prepare full, 5-year RCN-UBE proposals, and the BEDENet proposal was successfully funded in 2021.</p>\n<p>Intellectual Merit</p>\n<p>To meet the needs of practicing educators and to test our hypothesis that instructor training and support is a key need, we surveyed life and environmental science educators (n=106) from across baccalaureate, master's and doctoral institutions, in order to identify critical gaps in current undergraduate data science education, as well as the main barriers to incorporating data science skills into courses and curricula. Our results, which were published in BioScience (Emery et al. 2021), demonstrate that, in addition to the background knowledge of students, instructor knowledge and curricular space are the key barriers to bringing data science into the curriculum. In contrast, the lack of institutional support, student interest, or access to instructional resources were not highlighted as important barriers (Figure 2).</p>\n<p>We also found that instructors use, teach, and view data management, data analysis, and data visualization as important skills, while coding, modeling, and reproducibility were less valued by the instructors (Figure 3). However, there were differences in priorities according to institution type and career stage. Instructors expressed the most interest in training in data analysis, visualization, and coding, but we also discovered potential instructional gaps in data management and reproducibility (Figure 4).</p>\n<p>Taken together our results provided critical information for guiding BEDENet efforts, including the design of teacher training workshops and the development of curricular maps for scaffolding data science skills across course levels.</p>\n<p>Broader Impacts</p>\n<p>In addition to the opening BEDENet workshop, we have developed and delivered instructor training workshops at the annual meeting of the Ecological Society of America (ESA) in 2019 and 2021. The latter workshop was delivered remotely and a planned 2020 ESA workshop was cancelled due to the pandemic. By targeting undergraduate instructors rather than graduate students, our workshops have the potential to impact a greater diversity of students and to have downstream benefits for students from underrepresented groups, since data science skills are valuable to students whether they choose to enter graduate school, begin a career, or switch fields. To amplify this effect, our workshops explicitly model the use of inclusive language and methods, building student confidence, and creating an equitable environment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We have also broadened the impact of the BEDENet by actively recruiting participants and leaders from a wide variety of institutions and at varied career stages. By the time of the full RCN-UBE proposal, in addition to educators from research universities and liberal arts colleges, two community college faculty members have joined the BEDENet steering committee as senior personnel. The diversity of pedagogical perspectives represented in the network has reinforced the importance of our curricular mapping efforts, so that instructors of students at any level can understand both the specific data science skills that might be appropriate for their course and the larger context of how those skills fit together in the larger framework of data science pedagogy.</p>\n<p>Network efforts have continued under the full BEDENet RCN-UBE award, and the 2022 annual network meeting (supported in part by this Incubator award) was focused on inclusive pedagogy and working across international borders, with 54 participants from seven nations. The BEDENet has become a vibrant and diverse community of practice, with strong impacts on the quality of undergraduate life sciences instruction.</p>\n<p>Emery, N.C. et al. 2021.
