 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) is being organized as part of the 47th ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL), the premier conference on the foundations of programming languages. The conference will be held in Lisbon, Portugal. This award specifically supports students from underrepresented groups and gives priority to US citizens and permanent residents to attend the mentoring workshop in addition to the POPL conference. The impact of the award relates to broadening participation in computing, providing opportunities for students to receive mentoring from leading researchers, and building the next generation of researchers and knowledgeable practitioners in all aspects of programming languages and systems.\r\n\r\nThe mentoring workshop program comprises a number of talks and panels in several areas of programming language theory, such as type systems, verification, program analysis, model checking, logic and language design. The intention of these talks is to provide an introduction to the topics covered by the POPL conference and to the breadth of the programming languages research community. Additionally, the workshop will include mentoring panels that will cover practical topics about starting a research career, the job search process, and different careers that are available post-PhD. The purpose of these panels is both to provide useful advice that will benefit the participants as well as to demonstrate the day-to-day components of a research career. Speakers will be a mix of junior and senior researchers, who are leaders in their respective research areas and known for their mentorship efforts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
