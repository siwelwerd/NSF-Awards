 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part 1\r\n\r\n\r\nShining brighter than a trillion suns, quasars are the most luminous persistent\r\nsources in the universe. These cosmic powerhouses form when gas is funneled\r\ntoward giant black holes at the centers of galaxies. Since quasars are thought\r\nto shape the growth of their galaxies, better understanding these sources is one\r\nof modern astronomy's major goals. This project makes new telescopic\r\nobservations over several years to improve estimates of the most basic\r\nproperties of quasars, enhancing a wide range of astronomical studies.\r\n\r\nSome 350 hours of infrared observations of 400 distant quasars with the\r\nGemini-North telescope in Hawaii will produce the best and largest data set of\r\nits kind. Studying the infrared light will lead to better estimates of the\r\nmasses of the quasars' black holes, their fueling rates, and their distances\r\nfrom Earth. These results will, in turn, help to develop improved equations for\r\nthese properties in the larger quasar population. Comparison with nearby quasars\r\nwill also show how these sources change over time, indicating how the galaxies\r\nsurrounding such quasars change as well. This project represents a stepping\r\nstone in understanding quasars which, in turn, will enable more in-depth projects\r\nat the forefront of modern astronomy.\r\n\r\nPart 2\r\n\r\nQuasars are the most powerful objects in the universe. They greatly outshine all\r\nthe stars in the galaxies in which they reside. They consist of growing black\r\nholes, millions to billions of times more massive than the sun. Better\r\nunderstanding these most energetic of objects, their properties, their effects\r\non the galaxies that surround them, and how they grow over time are important\r\nquestions in modern astronomy. This project will use one of the world's largest\r\ntelescopes to better understand some of the most powerful and distant quasars in\r\norder to help answer these questions. Additional related areas at the forefront\r\nof modern astronomy will benefit as well.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of this project is to substantially improve how we measure the\r\nfundamental properties of distant quasars. These properties include the black\r\nhole mass, fueling rate, and distance. Another goal is to see how these\r\nproperties have changed over time. To achieve these goals, the investigators\r\nwill use the Gemini-North telescope in Hawaii to observe the infrared light from\r\nmore than 400 distant quasars, thereby creating the largest and best such data\r\nset to date. This effort will take 350 hours of telescope time over several\r\nyears. Analysis of certain features in the light of these sources will provide\r\nthe best measurements yet of key quasar properties. The results of this project\r\nwill yield new calibrations for quasars in general, and enable a wide range of\r\nfollow-up studies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
