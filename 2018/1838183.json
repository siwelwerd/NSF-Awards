 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an interdisciplinary project involving computer science and economics. The big data problem to be addressed concerns how to analyze and understand financial trading, and its effects on the stock market. The project introduces new behavioral models of financial trading and applies big data techniques to implement them.  The project will foster research on the financial ecosystem of machine-machine and machine-human interactions by bringing financial economists and data scientists together in a series of workshops.\r\n\r\nThe PIs will work with the National Center for Supercomputing and develop a new and more accurate taxonomy of trading frequencies by categorizing high frequency traders (HFT), buy-side algorithmic traders (BAT) and human traders using two proprietary high frequency datasets. The workshops will foster research on the implications of the new financial ecosystem for the overall financial system and the economy in general, as well as creating new metrics and data for the discipline of finance in economics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The new rule reduces      the tick size to 0.5 cents for stocks priced at or greater than $1 per      share if the time-weighted average spread of the stock during a specified      three-month evaluation period is lower than 1.5 cents.

U.S. regulations enforce a minimum tick size of one cent and a minimum lot size of 100 shares. The PI&rsquo;s research demonstrates that less volatile stocks should choose higher prices, effectively making pricing more continuous and quantities more discrete. Despite variations in optimal prices across firms, the research finds that all companies achieve their liquidity-maximizing prices when their bid&ndash;ask spreads equal two ticks&mdash;where frictions from discrete pricing balance those from discrete lot sizes.
