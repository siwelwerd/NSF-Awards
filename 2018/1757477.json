 "awd_abstract_narration": "The REU Site award to the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) will support the training of ten students for ten weeks during the summers of 2018-2020. The goal of this site is to give students an opportunity to engage in research projects on model-based reasoning. Modeling is an important practice of science as models provide bridges between ideas and observations of the physical world.  Models are simplified versions of real-world systems that allow scientists to ask new questions, test new hypotheses, and communicate explanations to a broad audience.  Major STEM education reform initiatives in K-12 and higher education support opportunities for students to engage in the practice of modeling throughout the STEM curriculum.  These reform initiatives must also be supported by a research base that includes well-defined goals, assessment tools, an understanding of common student difficulties, and effective curricular approaches.  The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Model-based Reasoning in STEM Education will give students an opportunity to engage in novel research projects in this exciting and important field.\r\n\r\nDiscipline-Based Education Research (DBER) combines disciplinary expertise in a STEM field with education research methodology that undergraduate students can do, if provided with preparatory work and mentoring. This DBER REU program will enable STEM students to apply their growing disciplinary knowledge to important problems in education research.  Over the next three years, the program will select 30 diverse undergraduate students to join the RIT STEM research community. During the program, students will engage in rigorous education research projects with the support and collaboration of research mentors. The program will help students prepare for DBER and/or scientific research careers  and graduate programs. These potential future educators will be introduced to teaching, learning, and assessment of the core scientific practice of modeling. Students in this program will disseminate their findings at conferences and through scholarly publications. To support program objectives, this DBER REU program has four core components: Mentored Research projects, Professional Development Workshops, DBER Methods Workshops, and Cohort-building Activities.  The project will contribute to research around the development and assessment of students' abilities in modeling, which is essential for the efficacy of educational initiatives.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Of the participants, 32% were individuals from backgrounds underrepresented in STEM (Black/African American, LatinX/Hispanic) and 64.5% of our participants identified as women.  Although two of of our cohorts (2020 and 2021) were run in a virtual format due to the Covid-19 pandemic, all participants were engaged in rigorous mentored-research projects, professional development activities focused on career preparation, scientific communication and research-backed teaching strategies as well as cohort-building experiences.  Participants in these three REU cohorts co-authored a total of 11 peer-reviewed publications and presented/co-presented their work through 13 regional or national conference artifacts (posters or oral presentations).  All 31 of our participants graduated from their STEM programs at their home institutions with many attending graduate or professional school in STEM after college graduation.  At least five program alumni have gone on to become K-12 teachers. Program alumni reported the skills, research community and mentoring and experiences played positive roles in their career trajectories.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/20/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Leslie K Wright"
