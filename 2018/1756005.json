 "awd_abstract_narration": "Combustion has been an important source of energy for ages and will continue to be so for\u00a0considerable future.  With the\u00a0help\u00a0of high-performance computing (HPC),\u00a0predictive\u00a0and accurate\u00a0combustion simulations have a tremendous potential to emerge as\u00a0a\u00a0cost-effective and\u00a0reliable design, assessment, and decision-making tool for practical\u00a0systems (e.g., gas turbines, internal combustion engines, furnaces, etc.).\u00a0 Detailed predictive modeling of combustion system requires, among other things, detailed and accurate modeling of thermal radiation.  However, models for thermal\u00a0radiation\u00a0used in combustion simulations are usually over-simplified.  The main bottlenecks in using\u00a0detailed\u00a0radiation model\u00a0are its\u00a0high\u00a0computational cost and poor\u00a0parallel efficiency\u00a0in\u00a0HPC.\u00a0 This project explores several novel ideas to increase efficiency and robustness of a high-fidelity\u00a0radiation solver\u00a0in\u00a0HPC\u00a0combustion\u00a0simulations, leading to the possibility of performing\u00a0predictive\u00a0and accurate simulations of\u00a0practical\u00a0combustion systems in a realistic time-frame.\u00a0 The\u00a0ability to perform\u00a0such\u00a0large-scale\u00a0reliable\u00a0predictive simulation\u00a0is\u00a0not only\u00a0important\u00a0in the design process of\u00a0real\u00a0combustion devices\u00a0but\u00a0also\u00a0essential to\u00a0further our understanding of fundamentals of combustion processes.\u00a0 Considering the ever-increasing need for cleaner combustion devices, this predictive capability can potentially have a significant\u00a0effect\u00a0in academic research,\u00a0as well as\u00a0in energy\u00a0and\u00a0transportation industry.  The\u00a0project will also have an impact in popularizing computer programming in undergraduate students.  Therefore, this research aligns with the NSF's\u00a0mission to promote the progress of science and to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe radiation solver of choice in this project is a Monte-Carlo ray tracing-based (MCRT) solver.  It is one of the most accurate radiation solver available, and typically outshines all other radiation solvers as the complexity of the problem increases.\u00a0 To achieve improvements in\u00a0efficiency and scalability\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0MCRT\u00a0solver\u00a0in HPC\u00a0simulations\u00a0of large-scale combustion\u00a0systems,\u00a0this\u00a0research\u00a0brings together ideas from different disciplines of mathematics, statistical theory, and computer science and applies them to solve an engineering problem.\u00a0 Considering the fact that\u00a0the\u00a0performance of an MCRT solver in HPC primarily depends on\u00a0the underlying statistical algorithm and\u00a0computational\u00a0load-balancing,\u00a0the\u00a0current research\u00a0is divided into three primary tasks.  First, the project\u00a0is\u00a0developing new algorithms for improved convergence using special statistical distributions with low discrepancy.  Second, novel strategies for MCRT load management, both in terms of computational time and memory utilization, are being\u00a0explored to\u00a0improve scalability of the solver\u00a0in HPC\u00a0simulations.\u00a0 Third, the improved MCRT solver are planned to be created as a modular, platform-independent\u00a0solver\u00a0module\u00a0with\u00a0standardized interfaces so that it can be used with any combustion and/or CFD solver without\u00a0significant sacrifice of its performance.\u00a0 By enhancing efficiency and scalability of MCRT, this work aims to enable more accurate predictive HPC simulations of large-scale combustion systems in a realistic timescale.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
