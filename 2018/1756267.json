 "awd_abstract_narration": "Volcanic eruptions produce clouds of ash, which are hazardous to air travel and infrastructure.  In emergencies, forecasters predict the transport of ash using numerical models, but they typically assume that particles fall as individuals to simplify the analysis.  In reality, fine ash particles combine together into larger clusters, accelerating their rate of fall.  This allows the ash to fall out of the cloud.  Rates of aggregation depend on many factors, including moisture, electric charge, and turbulence.  There is limited existing data on the effects of these properties, particularly for turbulent flows, even though aggregation affects up to 95% of fallout in some eruptions.  Hence, there is a need for better experimental measurements of aggregation processes, along with more advanced models that include the phenomenon.\r\n\r\nThis study aims to improve forecasting of volcanic hazards through both high-accuracy experiments and upgraded models.  Ash aggregation will be examined in two different, relevant flow conditions: homogeneous turbulence and high-speed jets.  High-resolution optical techniques will be used to study the flow, turbulence, and particle clustering.  The results will be integrated into state-of-the-art analytical models, including some used for forecasting.  Further, this research will be presented to the broader public through a series of hands-on demonstrations at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nVolcanic eruptions eject a diverse mixture of material into the atmosphere, with much consisting of ash particles.  Although most of the ash is small, the particles typically aggregate together, producing larger clusters that fall out more rapidly.  The aggregation process involves several physical mechanisms, notably driven by electrostatic interaction, moisture, and fluid turbulence.  Previous research has demonstrated the impacts of these mechanisms, but the measurements have been somewhat qualitative, especially in terms of turbulence.  Notably, there has been limited effort devoted to integration of aggregation into computational models of fallout.  Therefore, there is a clear need to conduct detailed experimental measurements on the aggregation process, which then need to be incorporated in numerical models.\n\nWe assembled a multidisciplinary research team to examine ash aggregation, involving members of the geophysical and engineering communities.  At Stanford University, a team developed a novel experimental facility that generates homogeneous turbulence, akin to conditions in the ash cloud high above the eruption.  This facility was used to directly measure the aggregation process for particles at different mass loading, humidity, and turbulence intensity.  At Washington State University, we used a modified apparatus to produce a particle-laden vertical jet, representative of the shearing flow near the vent exit.  In collaboration with partners from Portland State University, we studied the impact of high-inertia particles on the jet development, and we indirectly studied aggregation through clustering measurements.  Finally, we interacted with colleagues at the USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory (CVO), who aided with integration of the experimental data into an existing plume model, Plumeria.  This modified tool provides predictions of the ash aggregation distribution for volcanic eruptions.\n\nWe completed three major research tasks at WSU over the course of the project.  First, we modified our experimental apparatus to permit controlled introduction of particles to a vertical jet.  Second, we acquired images of the flow through particle image velocimetry (PIV) methods, which result in full-field velocity statistics in the near exit region.  Third, we conducted detailed flow and clustering analysis of these images, which demonstrated significant inertial effects that influence local aggregation.  These results are linked to improved modeling tools developed by partners at the USGS CVO and Stanford.\n\nOver the course of this project, we achieved several important technical outcomes.  First, with high-inertia particles, entrainment of ambient air is significantly reduced.  This reduces the column collapse criterion by as much as three times, and it also slows the dilution of the ash density.  Second, high-inertia particles also experience much smaller turbulent velocity fluctuations within the jet, decreasing by an order of magnitude compared to air and low-inertia particles.  This slows the mixing and clustering of particles, indicating less opportunity for collision and aggregation.  Third, we used our experimental data to develop a modified form of the 1-D plume model Plumeria, which provides realistic predictions of aggregation from a historic 2009 Redoubt Volcano eruption.\n\nThroughout the project, we conducted educational outreach at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI).  We developed an interactive, hands-on demonstration that displayed how ash particles travel differently depending on their density and size.  This activity was presented periodically at OMSI ?Meet a Scientist? events, each time involving direct interaction with more than 50 people ranging from preschool age to senior citizens.  One of these presentations was also part of a special Pride-focused event, which specifically sought interaction with the LGBTQ+ community.  Although the Covid-19 pandemic curtailed opportunities for in-person presentations from March 2020 until late 2021, we remained engaged with OMSI educators in developing new activities for the museum.\n\nFinally, the project results have been disseminated through journal articles and conference presentations.  Currently, we have one published journal article, one more in review, and two more in final preparation for submission.  We have made a total of five conference presentations at international geophysical and engineering meetings, and at least one more is planned.  One graduate student at WSU wrote her Masters thesis based on this research work.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/08/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stephen A Solovitz"
