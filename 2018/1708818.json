 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Description:\r\nMore than 50 years ago, a distinguished theoretical physicist and a science writer George Gamow said that only number theory and topology had no application to physics.  Nonetheless, physicists started to understand the significant role of topology in physics since 1980's, and new types of materials called topological quantum matter are being discovered.  These materials possess unexpected properties which not only expand our knowledge but also functionality of the materials.  In general, these topological materials are composed of multiple elements with complex structures.  However, a form of helium, called helium-three isotope, becomes a topological matter when it is cooled down to a liquid form at extremely low temperature close to absolute zero.  At such conditions it forms a new state of matter called a superfluid that exhibits fascinating quantum phenomena.  In this project, the PI's research group investigates the nature of superfluid helium-three using a unique experimental technique employing small mechanical oscillators.  This project will expand our understanding on these unique properties of helium-three.  The research group is composed of graduate and undergraduate students working as a team.  They will be trained not only in the field of low-temperature physics but also in silicon nanofabrication technology from design to fabrication of specialized devices that have proliferated our modern world through their widespread use as sensors and actuators.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description: \r\nGrowing interest in the surface Andreev bound states in p-wave superfluid 3He arises from the fact that it is arguably the most complete platform available to investigate the nature of topological excitations. The PI's group has developed a versatile and powerful experimental probe based on Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) technology to study the surface Andreev bound states in this system.  The major activities are:  (i) Investigation of the topological surface states on a specular boundary for comprehensive understanding of the nature such as experimental evidence for Dirac fermions and a possible field-driven topological transition.  (ii) Investigation of the interactions between two surface states in close proximity.  (iii) Development of a sensitive quasiparticle flux sensor with a spatially resolved detection capability in the form of MEMS arrays.  This project, in close collaboration with theorists, will certainly expand our understanding of these unique excitations in a pristine topological superfluid.  Confirmation of the theoretically predicted topological transition induced by a small magnetic field would be one of the most convincing manifestation of a symmetry-protected topological superfluid and Majorana fermions in this system. The successful development of MEMS arrays will provide unprecedented opportunities to achieve spatially-resolved detection in 3He and 4He with many foreseeable applications: visualization of vortices and angle-resolved detection of quasiparticles in 3He, and momentum resolved roton-phonon detection and quantum turbulence study in He-II.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This technique has been a major driving force on the development of modern sensors and actuators and can even reach the realm of a physical dimension where quantum mechanical considerations are essential to the behavior of the devices.  We embarked on developing such devices suitable for ultra low temperature applications, specifically aimed for the study of special fluids, whose properties arise from purely quantum mechanics, called quantum fluids.  There are two representative systems that belong to this category:  coherent superfluid states of 3He and 4He.  We took advantage of the minute size and the exceptional force sensitity to investigate excitations in each above mentioned system.  In superfluid 3He, a prestine material with unique topological and superfluid properties, we targeted to unveil the nature of the excitations emerging only near the boundary such as containing surface or the device surface in contact with liquid 3He.  These excitations carry particular importance becausse the microscopic identity of the system -- symmetry and topology -- are projected onto them.  We exposed a unique process occuring in this surfce states and the influence of the surface smoothness on the nature of the excitations.  In superfluid 4He, we studied how the quantized vortices, a quantum version of eddies or tornadoes in classical systems, behave and interact with the microscopic oscillating objects and themselves.  We learned that pinnin of the vortices on the surface of the oscillator plays major role to the dynamics of the vortices and the behavior of the oscillator itself.  \n\nThe mission of physics education and academic research is not limited to producing career physics researchers. The reality is that the majority of the students will end up in diverse areas in mainly STEM sectors.  The students, involved in this project were exposed to and learned, and practiced the knowledge and skills which include cryogenics, nanofabrication techiniques, high precision measurements, numerical simulation, topological materials,  superconductivity, an ect.  These are also the faculty required for the workforce in Quantum Information Science Engineering (QISE), a strategically important field in the 21st century.   Through this project,  three PhD's and numerous undergraduate students were trained.  With the training received throughout this project,  the studens are prepared to make imprtant contributions in this field in varying manner. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/25/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Yoonseok Lee"
