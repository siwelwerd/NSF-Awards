 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many industrial and natural processes depend crucially on splashing, the collision of a liquid drop with a surface and its subsequent fragmentation into smaller droplets.  Common yet important examples include inkjet printing, spray painting, spray cooling, precision soldering of microelectronics, pesticide spraying, fire suppression, airborne dispersal of seeds, bacteria, and viruses.  Our ability to predict and control such phenomena is limited by an incomplete understanding of the fundamental process that governs these phenomena, the splash. The overarching goal of this proposal is a fundamental study of splashing using a newly-developed technique that makes it possible to measure the fluid dynamics of a splash with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution.  The project includes a significant educational component, including training of future scientist at the undergraduate and graduate level, outreach to unrepresented minorities in the K-12 community, and dissemination of science to the public through social media and collaborations with museums.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop a model of splashing by decomposing the splash in terms of jets.  Jets are the high-speed sheets of liquid produced soon after drop impact.   The objectives will be met by (1) measuring the jet's early time dynamics and stability, (2) determining the bifurcation points for qualitatively different dynamics, (3) measuring the most unstable wavelength and the resulting droplet distribution, (4) modeling the stability of jets and comparing with experiments, (5) studying jet production from an apparatus that removes the complications in splashing from drop impact.  Experiments will record the evolution of the liquid-gas interface and the size distribution of droplets created during the splash using high speed X-ray and visible light imaging for a range of impact speeds with different liquid and gas combinations.  These data will be supplemented with direct numerical simulations.  This program is expected to (1) produce the highest resolution experimental characterization of splashing, (2) test the hypothesis that splashes can be analyzed in terms of jets, and (3) provide a fundamental basis for modelling more complicated process that involve changes of topology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe scientific goal of this project was to reach a better understanding of what happens when a drop collides with a pool of liquid.  Such a collision typically produces a splash, consisting of  a cylindrical sheet of liquid - the jet - that rises rapidly and fragments into smaller droplets. Splashing is a common process in nature and industry, and it can be advantageous or disadvantageous depending on the circumstances. For example, splashing is detrimental in inkjet printing, pesticide spraying and lubrication; whereas it is beneficial for dispersing biological agents, optimizing fuel combustion, and transferring gasses across the air-sea interface.\n\n\nOur project consisted of experiments and numerical simulations.  For the experiments we designed a novel apparatus in which a liquid is squeezed out from between two plates at high speed.  This experiment produces a liquid sheet that is an analog of the cylindrical sheet in a regular splash.  We call these synthetic jets to distinguish them from the jets that occur in drop impact.  Because the sheet deforms and obscures parts of itself from observation with the unaided eye, we used high speed X-ray imaging for our observations.  \n\n\nWe hypothesized that this experiment, which avoids many of the complications found in drop impact, would provide an easier system in which to study the mechanisms that contribute to the formation of jets.  Our experiments revealed a rich variety of structures that can be broadly classified into three types depending on the liquid, the speed of ejection, and the geometry of the plates.  These observations enabled us to develop empirical relationships between the formation of the sheet and the experimental parameters.  This is the first step in developing a theory for the behavior of a sheet.  While these experiments showed that in the late stages when break up occurs, the synthetic jets and drop impact jets behave similarly, the formation of the synthetic jets is dominated by the presence of plates.\n\n\nWe also used our observations to develop accurate numerical simulations of jet formation.  Numerical simulations of fluids depend on various numerical techniques to accurately resolve the dynamics.  Comparing these simulations with data is the best way to ensure that the simulations give accurate results.  Our X-ray data provided the means to achieve this comparison. Simulations are an important complement to experiments because they provide data on  parameters that are not available or very difficult to obtain experimentally, for example the flow field, stresses, vorticity, and more.  Our simulations showed a strong correlation between the formation of vortices at the edge of the plate and the subsequent shape. In particular, they show that at early times the flow fields for synthetic jets is markedly different than in drop impact jets.\n\n\nLastly, we conducted numerical simulation of drop impact to examine how liquid is transferred from the pool and the drop into a jet.  These simulations revealed the initial distribution of the mass within the drop that ultimately is transferred into the jet.  This finding may lead to application in which the composition of the drop is tailored to produce a desired distribution of liquid following drop impact.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/27/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert Deegan"
