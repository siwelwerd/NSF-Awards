 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Yue Chen from the University of Minnesota to investigate a specific cellular signaling pathway using an innovative new methodology called, quanititative chemical proteomics. Ubiquitination is a modification of proteins with a number of biological functions including signaling. For example, when DNA is damaged, ubiquitination plays a critical role in activating specific response pathways to initiate DNA damage repair.  A newly developed quantitative chemical proteomics approach is  applied to reveal just how this takes place. Experimental studies are expected to identify novel ubiquitination-dependent regulatory mechanisms and find previously unknown enzymatic activities in DNA damage response. During the project, undergraduate biochemistry students train with interdisciplinary techniques in chemical synthesis and quantitative proteomics through a fully integrated chemical proteomic training program. Additional outreach programs promote biochemistry education for high school students through specifically designed field learning activities.\r\n\r\nThe research projects integrate the new isotope-encoded stoichiometry analysis method and chemical proteomics strategies to functionally dissect ubiquitination signaling pathways. Compared to the traditional relative quantification, this approach enables site-specific absolute quantification of ubiquitination prevalence and, therefore, allows the identification of ubiquitination targets that are stoichiometrically activated in specific biological processes. This strategy is applied to determine the dynamic activation of ubiquitination signaling during DNA double-strand break. Temporal dynamics analysis and functional validation reveal key regulatory ubiquitination targets that are critical for the activation of specific response pathways. In vitro and in vivo quantitative analysis determine the substrate dynamics and specificities of important ubiquitination E3 ligases in double-strand break and repair. Overall, these studies provide mechanistic insights into the ubiquitination-mediated signaling and regulatory pathways in DNA damage and response.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Classic strategies in proteomic analysis of ubiquitination pathways with affinity enrichment and relative quantification analysis are limited in understanding the physiological significance of ubiquitination dynamics as well as upstream regulatory enzyme activities.

For example, a two-fold relative increase can mean a stoichiometry increase from 0.1% to 0.3% or 30% to 90%, which apparently indicates different physiological relevance of ubiquitination dynamics. In our published study (Li, Y. Angew Chimie Intl 2019), we demonstrated the reliability and broad applicability of IBAQ-Ub on site-specific measurement of absolute ubiquitination stoichiometry with a wide dynamic range using spike-in standards or complex nuclear extracts.

We continued to improve the IBAQ-Ub by developing one-step IBAQ-Ub which significantly simplified the labeling and analysis workflow (manuscript in preparation). We further developed a software tool for reliable calculation of site-specific stoichiometry using IBAQ-Ub approaches.

We demonstrated that the strategy was reliable in specifying E3 ligase activities with the published study using enzyme knockout models. We further demonstrated its broad applicability in profiling E3 ligase activities in cellular stress response and in analyzing both data-dependent or data-independent mass spectrometry studies.
