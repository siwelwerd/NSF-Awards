 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Description: Magnetic materials have a long history of successful integration with high frequency electronics dating back to the invention of the radio and continuing through the present day in cell phones and other wireless communication technologies. Given this central role, it is unfortunate that our choice of materials is significantly limited by the fact that magnetic materials in nature are exceedingly rare and our ability to predict which new materials will have targeted magnetic properties is limited. This project fills that gap by employing the strategy of \"materials by design\" to predict and produce high quality magnetic materials that enable next-generation microwave technologies. The envisioned materials form high quality \"magnetic spray paints\" that can be patterned onto nearly any surface, enabling accurate micro-scale patterning for materials engineering. Down-stream technological benefits range from more power efficient microwave electronics to the potential to contribute to the development of quantum computing and quantum communication. This work helps grow our economy in the fast-moving technology sector by establishing a leadership role for the US in these emerging fields and by training students in the new techniques and new knowledge necessary to succeed in the competitive international landscape of science and innovation.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description: This project exploits the ability to engineer highly coherent magnon (spin-wave) excitations in the organic-based ferrimagnet vanadium tetracyanoethylene to explore magnonic phases ranging from dilute gasses of magnon atoms (isolated magnetic micro/nanostructures) and magnon molecules (coherently coupled magnon atoms), to magnon crystals (coherently coupled arrays of atomic/molecular magnon building blocks). For example, the PIs are investigating exotic phases such as topologically protected modes in magnon crystals whose symmetry and structure are based on deterministic materials design and microscale fabrication/synthesis. This work is a joint theory/experiment collaboration, and employs both cavity and broad-band ferromagnetic resonance and magnetothermal transport measurements as well as numerical modeling and prediction of the relevant magnonic states. Both PIs have a strong track record of mentoring at all levels, and are leveraging that commitment and expertise during this program to provide an interdisciplinary and collaborative environment for the training of 3 PhD students. This research advances the field of coherent magnonics and provides a deeper understanding of the role of topology in creating and preserving coherent excitations with implications for applications ranging from next generation microwave electronics to quantum information systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

There are more exotic waves, however, including the response of magnetic materials to various disturbances. These waves are called \"spin waves\", or in the quantum regime \"magnons\" in analogy with \"phonons\" which are quantized sound waves. This project exploited the newly achieved ability at the collaborating institution (Ohio State University) to engineer very persistent magnons in an unusual organic magnet. This material (vanadium tetracyanoethylene, or VTCNE) has very persistent waves, comparable to the very best materials discovered. It also can be shaped into new forms that allow us to explore the \"topological\" properties of waves. This broad area of physics explores when the connectivity of regions of material stabilize or otherwise alter the properties of the waves within them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this project the theoretical properties of such waves were explored, and a magnetic analog of the \"fruit fly\" of topological systems, the one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, was simulated. The stability of these waves changed depending on the magnetic field direction and the structures of the material. An image is shown of the propagation of these waves in a plot known as a dispersion curve (energy versus momentum); the \"momentum\" shown is the inverse wavelength of the excitation and the energy is the frequency of oscillation of the wave. The coupling to a uniform microwave field is shown by the intensity of the plot.</p>\n<p>Simulations of the properties of bars of material also explained some puzzling properties associated with the response of magnets to applied fields. Responding fields (known as demagnetization fields) occur near the edges of the magnetic material that can cause the magnons to become very strongly confined to narrow regions of the bar. This project identified several examples of this new phenomenon.</p>\n<p>Finally this project also intended to explore the properties of the unusual magnetic material itself. ab initio calculations were performed of the electronic and magnetic structure of VTCNE and compared electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) measurements. The electron scattering illuminated the fundamental properties of the material, including what atomic orbitals dominated the magnetic properties and what the energy scales of the material were. This illuminated the origin of the unique magnon properties of VTCNE and pointed the way to potential new materials that might have similar properties.</p>\n<p>In addition to perhaps providing some potential insight into new microwave devices, these studies have suggested that materials similar to VTCNE may exhibit the same favorable properties used in superconducting quantum bits.
