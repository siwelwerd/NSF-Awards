 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the discipline-based research and STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project supports that goal by disseminating the achievements and findings of the colleges that have been realized with federal funding, and to increase the knowledge and understanding of tribal colleges and their role in economic and community development for a subset of the Nation's Native citizens.\r\n\r\nScience, technology, engineering, and mathematics now represent the largest and most dynamic parts of the curriculum within most of the nation's tribally controlled colleges and universities. While small and underfunded, these colleges are graduating students ready to work or earn graduate degrees in fields ranging from electrical engineering to Native environmental science. Additionally, all are pioneering new approaches to STEM education by incorporating traditional cultural values, student research opportunities, and community development projects into their degree programs.  However, few people working outside of the tribal colleges are aware of these accomplishments. Because tribal colleges represent a relatively young educational movement, many Americans do not know they exist. Even those familiar with the colleges are often surprised by the diversity and sophistication of their rapidly expanding STEM programs.  The purpose of this proposal is to address the need for greater national awareness of STEM education programs within tribal colleges and, additionally, to promote greater communication between tribal college STEM faculty through the development of Native Science Report , a new online journal focusing on STEM education within tribal and Native-serving colleges and universities (nativesciencereport.org).  This young publication, which is sponsored by Sisseton Wahpeton College, is significantly expanding its capacity to report on trends in STEM education within the tribal college movement.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
