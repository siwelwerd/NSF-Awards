 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phytoplankton are a diverse group of microscopic organism living near the ocean surface. They play essential role in marine food webs and global biogeochemical cycles. The Imaging FlowCytobot(IFCB) has been used for a number of years but because of the high power requirements deployment has been limited to these types of nearshore sites with power and internet connection. This EAGER proposal will test deploy the Imaging FlowCytobot on an open ocean mooring.\r\n\r\nThe ability to determine the composition and temporal dynamics of phytoplankton communities is important but traditional methods for collecting samples is time consuming. The Imaging FlowCytobot (IFCB) was developed at WHOI as a submersible flow cytometer that can resolve particles in the 10-150 micrometer size range, including critical phytoplankton groups such as diatoms, dinoflagellates, and coccolithophores, and can capture up to 30,000 high resolution images per hour. To date IFCB?s have been deployed at coastal fixed structures (piers, tower) with power, internet, and regular maintenance. This EAGER proposal will expand the operational capabilities of IFCB by testing it on an open ocean mooring. If successful, a new generation of autonomous plankton samplers could be deployed in geographically diverse locations throughout the global ocean in ecologically and biogeochemically significant locations far from the coastlines. This project will fund a graduate student from SIO who will be trained to operate and maintain the IFCB, as well as analyze data using machine learning tools and image analysis software.",

Their vast diversity, microscopic size, and rapid responses to environmental changes make plankton challenging to observe at space and time scales required for many scientific studies. In the last decade, the automated submersible microscope Imaging FlowCytobot (IFCB) has proven to be a valuable research instrument to meet many of these sampling challenges, but use of IFCB was previously limited to shipboard or nearshore observatory facilities. This project focused on taking the first steps towards being able to deploy IFCBs anywhere in the ocean, away from the nearshore setting and without fixed infrastructure, in order to observe unprecedented details of coastal and open ocean plankton community dynamics. The project addressed technical and logistical challenges and showed that IFCB can be operated on an open water mooring for a duration exceeding 5 months with 3-h sampling interval. Solar energy provided power for the instrument and real time observations were transmitted to shore. During the final mooring deployment of this project, IFCB images made it possible to detect the start and evolution of a massive ?red tide? bloom off the coast of Southern California in spring 2020. The automated observations of the bloom were especially important since the event occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic when it was difficult to impossible to carry out routine monitoring usually done by resource managers to protect human and ecosystem health from harmful bloom impacts. The successful demonstration of IFCB operation on an ocean mooring provided by this project has broader impacts for the ocean research community, as well as for issues of immediate societally relevance. IFCB is being used by a growing number of researchers worldwide to study plankton ecosystems, and the expanded deployment capabilities can be readily adopted by others. Resource managers responsible for living resources and safety of seafood harvested for human consumption will benefit from enhanced early warning about potential harmful algal blooms, some of which initiate in offshore waters.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/26/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Heidi&nbsp;M&nbsp;Sosik</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1810927/1810927_10525968_1622033483777_GOPR1533_27Jan2020_QuinnMontgomery_SIO--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1810927/1810927_10525968_1622033483777_GOPR1533_27Jan2020_QuinnMontgomery_SIO--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"IFCB deployed on an open water ocean mooring\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1810927/1810927_10525968_1622033483777_GOPR1533_27Jan2020_QuinnMontgomery_SIO--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"IFCB deployed on an open water ocean mooring\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">During this project, Imaging FlowCytobot (IFCB), an automated underwater microscope for plankton research, was successfully deployed on the Del Mar mooring several meters below the surface float.
