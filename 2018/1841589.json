 "awd_abstract_narration": "Today's fast-moving and competitive markets increase the frequency of product updates and rapidly expand demands for customized parts. Accordingly, high quality, low-cost prototyping and low volume manufacturing processes are desirable. No proven additive manufacturing or rapid prototyping approaches exist for sheet metals or large, thin parts - conventional additive manufacturing has too small of a build space and warps too much to produce parts such as automotive body panels. Incremental sheet forming (ISF), which utilizes a small tool to induce local deformation as it translates over the metal sheet, is a manufacturing approach that has been investigated recently because of its die-less setup, universal tooling and high flexibility. However, achieving dimensional and geometric accuracy as well as surface finish of the current ISF formed parts are a challenge, but the main drawback is the limited formability in the approach, leading to very high scrap rates. Ultrasonic vibration, known for its bulk material softening effects, surface modification and friction behavior improvements, offers promise in alleviating these concerns. This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award supports fundamental research to advance knowledge of the ultrasonic effects on material behavior in ISF processes. Success in this unique multidisciplinary study will lead to significant improved formability and process capabilities. Leveraging this new knowledge will expand ISF applications in various industries, such as aerospace, automotive, defense and medical, so that it has direct positive impact on the US national security and economic welfare. Students involved in the project will gain multidisciplinary knowledge and research capabilities including material, mechanical and manufacturing science and technologies. Outreach activities will emphasize the mentoring of women and underrepresented minorities. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is an innovative improvement of the incremental sheet forming (ISF) process by effectively applying ultrasonic vibration to the tool during the forming operation. The potential benefits are to reduce forming force, increase formability, increase dimensional and geometrical tolerance and improve surface quality. This collaborative project includes an integrated experimental and modeling study of material behavior during tensile testing with ultrasonic vibration utilizing high speed digital image correlation analysis.  The results will serve to design an effective approach for incorporating ultrasonic energy into ISF process. Ultrasonically assisted ISF will then be performed under different conditions. The interaction mechanisms between ultrasonic vibration and material deformation during ISF will be studied in terms of in-process variables, post-processing properties and multi-scale microstructure. The effect of ultrasonic vibration on both surface and bulk properties will be studied, including the impact on texture and grain size. The goals of this project are (1) understanding of the fundamental principles that govern the material behavior under ultrasonic vibration and (2) demonstration of the improvements enabled by ultrasonically assisted incremental forming process for complex free form geometries.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project aims to improve conventional ISF process with the auxiliary ultrasonic energy to reduce forming force, increase dimensional and geometrical tolerance and improve surface quality. This project supports the proliferation of ultrasonically assisted manufacturing by advancing the knowledge of acousto-plasticity physics, especially in the complex stress state during ISF process. In this collaborative project, the Ohio State University (OSU) team leads an integrated experimental and modeling study of ultrasonic effects on material deformation behavior in terms of flow stress, strain distribution and microstructure evolution. The University of Michigan (UM) team leads UA-ISF studies, where both UA single-point incremental forming (SPIF) and UA two-point incremental forming (TPIF) are comprehensively analyzed in terms of forming force, surface roughness, deformed sheet thickness, texture and grain size. The two teams are collaborating closely to effectively incorporate ultrasonic energy into ISF process and reveal the underlying physical principles based on the efforts and expertise from the two sites.</p>\n<p>Specifically in the OSU site, an innovative ultrasonically assisted micro tensile test frame with the capability of in situ high speed imaging and digital image correlation (DIC) analysis is developed. During intermediate tests of pure copper where ultrasonic energy was turned on for a short period in the plastic deformation and then turned off, it is observed that flow stress of material drops instantaneously when ultrasound is applied. After ultrasonic vibration is turned off, the flow stress then raises immediately. Residual softening and hardening are also observed depending on different material systems. In conditions where the ultrasonic vibration is applied throughout the tensile tests, reductions on both the yield strength and plastic flow stress are observed. With increasing the vibration amplitude, the decrease in stress is more significant. While ultrasonic softening is consistently observed when increasing the strain rate from 0.06/s to 1/s, there is no statistically significant difference in the amount of flow stress reduction. The in situ DIC analysis revealed a modified strain field in the UA-tensile test condition, with a higher strain located near the ultrasonic transducer side. With infrared (IR) thermal imaging, the ultrasonic effects on the temperature distribution are minimal during tensile tests to induce thermal softening or microstructure change. Multiscale characterizations of the tensile tested copper sample are performed. Optical imaging shows reduced number of annealing twins in the UA-tested sample, which can be contributed by the enhanced migration and annihilation of annealing twin boundary from ultrasonic assistance. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) results show more prominent texture development in certain directions in the ultrasonically assisted samples. Furthermore, these samples contain reduced amount of low-angle boundaries, overall smaller misorientations, and lower amount of geometrically necessary dislocations (GND) dislocation densities compared with conventional tensile tested samples. Preliminary finite element modeling results show that by simply adding an ultrasonic oscillating displacement boundary conditions, the calculated stress-strain curve can not match with the experimental observations, especially the residual softening phenomenon. This indicates that the ultrasonic softening effect is beyond pure stress superposition</p>\n<p>In the UM site, an ultrasonically assisted incremental sheet forming (UA-ISF) experimental system is developed. The use of ultrasonic vibrations in SPIF was shown to be ineffective. Since SPIF does not utilize supports, such as a die, the sheet is free to vibrate and resonate which diminishes the acoustic energy transfer. In contrast, significant force reduction is observed in UA-TPIF, where the sheet is supported by a partial- or half-die and enables better transfer of acoustic energy. Improved surface finish and modified sheet thickness was also observed. The OSU team and UM team have regular bi-weekly meetings to discuss results and exchange findings. UM team also supports base aluminum alloys for the OSU team to perform material testing.</p>\n<p>The results of the project have broader impacts on manufacturing. Acousto-plasticity effect can be extended to different materials systems which have been notoriously difficult to form or lead to additional post processing steps. The UA-TPIF equipment can be extended to double-sided incremental forming (DSIF), which utilizes a moving support tool, and robotic forming allowing for greater geometric freedom. The dual benefit of the agile nature of ISF and the unique solution of aided ultrasonic vibration allows various industries, including aerospace, automotive and medical prosthesis, to achieve customized parts, improve turnaround time, and design optimize material properties. The results of this collaborative project are disseminated through conferences, seminars and journal publications. The results are also presented in the Manufacturing USA institute, LIFT to attract attention from industrial members. Boeing company agrees to provide in-kind support for the project. Finally, this project provides multidisciplinary training opportunities to several graduate and undergraduate students, including students from the underrepresented groups.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/08/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Xun&nbsp;Liu</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1841589/1841589_10566534_1591371894025_fig5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1841589/1841589_10566534_1591371894025_fig5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Ultrasonically induced flow stress reduction\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1841589/1841589_10566534_1591371894025_fig5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Ultrasonically induced flow stress reduction\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(a) Engineering stress-strain curves at different strain rates (Ultrasonic amplitude: 1.3&#956;m); (b) Reduction of flow stress measured at different strains from (a)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jiarui Kang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Xun&nbsp;Liu</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Ultrasonically induced flow stress reduction</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1841589/1841589_10566534_1591371985694_fig10--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1841589/1841589_10566534_1591371985694_fig10--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Ultrasonically induced microstructure change\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1841589/1841589_10566534_1591371985694_fig10--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Ultrasonically induced microstructure change\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">EBSD results; (a), (b), (c) are image quality (IQ) map, kernel average misorientation (KAM) map and geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) map without UA, respectively; (b), (d), (f) are the corresponding results with UA</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jiarui Kang</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Xun&nbsp;Liu</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Ultrasonically induced microstructure change</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1841589/1841589_10566534_1591372714592_fig9--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1841589/1841589_10566534_1591372714592_fig9--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Ultrasonically induced optical microstructure change\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1841589/1841589_10566534_1591372714592_fig9--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Ultrasonically induced optical microstructure change\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Optical images of tensile tested specimens with (a) no ultrasonic vibration; (b) 20kHz 1.3&#956;m ultrasonic vibration (strain: 0.2, strain rate: 0.06/s).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jiarui Kang</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Xun&nbsp;Liu</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Ultrasonically induced optical microstructure change</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
