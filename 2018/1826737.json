 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a research project that studies how to create adaptive knowledge infrastructures that will support and sustain research and management programs through environmental and sociotechnical transitions. The project will build knowledge to help address challenges in science policy and transition management and will provide management and policy recommendations that are applicable to creating adaptive knowledge infrastructures across disciplines and locales. The study explicitly engages with how researchers go beyond participation and play a role in initiating transformation. Looking to Scotland as an exemplar of a nation that is investing heavily in innovation and research for emerging low-carbon technologies will serve to provide a better understanding of how to support these transitions and develop appropriate science-policy measures in the US and globally.\r\n\r\nThis research project will conduct a large-scale ethnographic case study and transition analysis of renewable energy research, innovation, and development. This project will take advantage of this unique historical juncture in which a nation builds a scientific infrastructure, providing an exemplar of a sustainability transition to a low-carbon sociotechnical imaginary; that is, an imagined form of social life reflected in the design and implementation of a national energy transition project. It will also develop theoretical frameworks for understanding scientific innovation and transformation through novel interdisciplinary engagement of STS and the field of sustainability transitions. Understanding how knowledge infrastructures change has been identified as one of the key research challenges for infrastructure studies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This purpose of this project was to understand how research communities adapt knowledge infrastructures to meet sustainability transitions driven by emerging sociotechnical imaginaries. By using the case of marine renewable energy in Scotland, this study brought conceptual insights from research on knowledge infrastructures and sociotechnical imaginaries together with emerging work on sustainability transitions in science, technology, and innovation studies. Using this case, we describe how knowledge infrastructures adapt to shifts in sociotechnical imaginaries of nation and nature in times of sociotechnical transition. We also examine the dynamics of change in knowledge infrastructures more broadly. We illustrate that a great deal of the &lsquo;old&rsquo;&nbsp;knowledge infrastructures for energy research, rather than being wholly swept away, instead persist across energy transitions. We demonstrate that concept of knowledge infrastructures provides a powerful addition to energy social science and sustainability transitions because they are fundamental to our ability to research and develop renewable energy technologies, and so play an important role in defining possible energy futures. In addition to supporting the fields of STS and energy and sustainability transitions through this case study, this work informs our understanding of how knowledge infrastructures can enable or constrain innovation in times of socio-technical change in pragmatic ways. This is particularly relevant to emerging sectors in the United States, including marine renewable energy. Findings from this research will contribute to future and on-going work on innovation in the marine energy sector in the US and beyond.</p>\n<ul>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/01/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Shana&nbsp;Hirsch</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
