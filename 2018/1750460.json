 "awd_abstract_narration": "Data is messy.  Fortunately, with minimal human intervention, good data cleaning heuristics produce mostly reliable, usually actionable information from big, messy data.  For instance, analysts might automate their curation workflows by using classifiers to predict missing attribute values, or by using an entity-resolver to find and merge duplicate records.  Unfortunately, heuristics are also dangerous, as the result of heuristic curation is often taken as fact.  Serious mistakes like people being denied a loan due to someone else's bad credit, 12-year olds being identified as terrorists, or billion dollar investment errors, often result when low-confidence, or uncertain heuristic inferences are treated as truth.  Many principled tools like probabilistic databases already exist for automatically tracking potential errors in unreliable data, but these tools are not easy to use.  As a result, analysts more often resort to simply documenting potential errors and hoping that anyone using the data will realize the implications.  This proposal will enable data management systems that can query and organize uncertain data, without being hard to use.\r\n \r\nThe specific aim of this proposal is to decouple the process of asking questions about uncertain data from mechanical concerns like why the data is uncertain, how the user wants to view uncertainty in query results, or which algorithms should be used.  To enable this sort of \"declarative uncertainty management,\" the project team will build on a system called Mimir that virtualizes uncertainty by augmenting data curation workflows (e.g., ETL pipelines) with a form of provenance capture through which heuristics can register alternative outputs (e.g., a schema matcher may register multiple potential matches).  This provenance can then be used to synthesize a wide range of different physical and visual representations of uncertainty in data and in query results.  To enable declarative uncertainty management, this proposal will address specific problems that fall into two general categories: (1) selecting and efficiently constructing qualitative summaries of uncertainty in query results, and (2) enhancing database query compilers and optimizers to support practical, efficient query processing over uncertain data. For further information see the project web page: http://mimirdb.info\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

inter-linked areas of uncertain data management, data science tools, and data structure.&nbsp; The award supported foundational insights into the nature of data management, the development of technologies to simplify reliable data science, and seeded multiple interdisciplinary collaborations that are actively improving the quality of people's lives.<br /><br /><strong>Making Uncertain Data Management Practical</strong><br /><br />Probabilistic databases explicitly track data uncertainty: When answering queries, probabilistic databases also include statistics about their confidence in results, making them ideal for situations where data is incomplete or ambiguous.&nbsp; Through this award, we completed a ground-up redesign of probabilistic query processing, from theory to systems, massively improving the performance of probabilistic queries, and making probabilistic query processing viable for day-to-day use.<br /><br />Most individuals find probabilities them unintuitive, leading us to explore lighter-weight forms of uncertainty.&nbsp; We developed \"caveats,\" simple textual annotations that can be attached to individual records in a dataset.&nbsp; This award supported the development of Mimir, a plugin for Apache Spark that adds support for caveats to SparkSQL.<br /><br />We studied not only how to propagate caveats efficiently, but also how to effectively present them to end-users.&nbsp; The Vizier system (supported by NSF award ACI-1640864) is a 'workflow notebook', and an ideal platform for the exploration of how people interact with uncertain data.&nbsp; We leveraged Vizier's data visualization capabilities to design ways to effectively communicate data uncertainty to users.&nbsp; We developed a set of general-purpose user interface designs, and extended them into a platform for streamlined data documentation that we called DataSense.<br /><br /><strong>Querying the Structure of Data</strong><br /><br />This award allowed us to explore strategies for querying not only uncertain data, but data with uncertain structure, including semi-structured data and data lakes. &nbsp;<br /><br />The frequently used JSON data format is self-describing: Each individual document encodes its own structure.&nbsp; Storing self-describing data efficiently still requires a global schema, and so we developed a new approach to discovering global schemas automatically.&nbsp; Our approach addresses the question of ambiguity in global schemas through a heuristic rooted in information theory, unlike past approaches, which relied on hard-coded intuitions about typical JSON usage patterns.&nbsp; Our work kick-started a new wave of research on ambiguity-aware JSON schema discovery.<br /><br />Unionability queries search data lakes for datasets with similar attributes, so-called 'unionable' datasets.&nbsp; In addition to several minor contributions in this space for unionability with numerical data, we developed a data model and search algorithm for unionability queries under mappings.&nbsp; Datasets often contain data that is unionable, but only after transformation: Unit conversions (C to F), Terminology changes ('Yes' to 'true'), and Structural decomposition (Full address to Zip code) all derive new attributes from existing ones.&nbsp; Our data model and search algorithm can efficiently query data lakes for not only datasets that can be unioned directly, but also datasets that can only be unioned after the appropriate mappings have been applied.<br /><br />We also realized, in partnership with collaborators described below, that the data model we were using for unionability under mappings would be ideal for use in longitudinal studies.&nbsp; Survey instruments (i.e., forms) in a longitudinal study are used extensively throughout the social sciences.&nbsp; However, over time, researcher understanding of the problem domain grows, and frequently the survey instruments must be adapted accordingly.&nbsp; We began exploring strategies for managing the data alignment/integration challenges that arise within data collected through such studies.<br /><br /><strong>Broader Impacts</strong><br /><br />This award supported the development of tools to make it easier for researchers to make informed decisions about uncertain data.&nbsp; This includes the Mimir plugin for Spark, and a new probabilistic database that leverages approximate query processing, allowing it to answer probabilistic queries faster than a classical (deterministic) database.&nbsp; We also extended the Vizier system to support caveats, helping its users to work with unreliable data more effectively. &nbsp;<br /><br />The true value of this award was the fact that it allowed PI Kennedy to lay the foundation for multiple interdisciplinary collaborations, including one with researchers in food systems to assist in the design of a food mapping system to make it easier for Buffalo residents to find fresh and healthy produce, and one with researchers in social determinants of health, environmental health, and linguistics, to make it easier for researchers to analyze and publish longitudinal study data, from the use of telemedicine to treat opioid use disorder, to cataloging the many languages of Cameroon. &nbsp;<br /><br />PI Kennedy would also like to acknowledge its support for his outreach efforts, including collaborations with the LIBERTY Partnerships I Can! program, and UB's CSExplore program.&nbsp; In a particularly notable event (featured on Buffalo Channel 4 news) Buffalo-area students got to build their own cell phones from scratch, including designing 3-D printed cases, soldering the electronics, and programming the resulting system.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 07/01/2024<br>\nModified by: Oliver&nbsp;A&nbsp;Kennedy</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\"
