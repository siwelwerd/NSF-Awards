 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to enable long-time simulations of reactive molecular systems through efficient\r\nand scalable techniques. Long-time reactive simulations are critical for several scientific problems\r\nsuch as catalysis, battery interfaces, biological simulations involving water, and emerging\r\nareas like surface oxidation and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth. However, progress on\r\nthese fronts is limited because long-time simulations of large-scale systems are very difficult, if\r\nnot impossible, to perform using existing methods. The Reactive Force Field (ReaxFF) method is in principle  \r\nideally suited for this purpose. However, the short time steps required in current ReaxFF simulations \r\nand the computationally expensive force field formulation limit ReaxFF's temporal capabilities to \r\nnarrow simulation time ranges. This project aims to overcome such limitations by creating ReaxFF2,\r\nwhich will extend time scales by one to two orders of magnitude - thus making large-scale, \r\nlong-time RMD simulations accessible to a wide community. Codes developed will be made publicly \r\navailable and results from this project will be highlighted on a dedicated website, and they will also be \r\nincorporated into workshops by the PIs.\r\n\r\nIn creating ReaxFF2, the PIs will enhance the Reax force field formulation significantly, and develop \r\ninnovative algorithms and software implementations for scalable simulations. More specifically, \r\nalternative ReaxFF interactions will be formulated to eliminate sharp derivatives in energy terms \r\nand enhance ReaxFF time step lengths by at least a factor of four. To accelerate the dynamic charge \r\ndistribution models needed in RMD, scalable parallel preconditioning techniques for the iterative \r\nsolvers will be developed. A task parallel approach to compute interactions, hierarchical problem \r\ndecomposition, vectorization of the key kernels, and use of mixed precision arithmetics constitute\r\nthe main techniques that will be utilized to fully leverage the performance capabilities of large\r\ncomputer clusters. Finally, capabilities of accelerated RMD concepts in the proposed ReaxFF2 \r\nformulation will be evaluated and inlined trajectory analysis tools for RMD will be developed \r\nto facilitate the study of long-time RMD simulations. This project will significantly enhance the PIs' \r\nsoftware development, community building,  and sustenance efforts for the RMD community. Codes, \r\nfunctional forms, and parameter sets developed will be made publicly available, enabling fast and \r\naccurate modeling of diverse reactive systems beyond the scope of this project. For community outreach, \r\nresults from this project will be highlighted on a dedicated website, and they will also be incorporated \r\ninto workshops by the PIs.\r\n\r\nThis award by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the Division of Materials Research \r\nand the Division of Chemistry within the NSF Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
