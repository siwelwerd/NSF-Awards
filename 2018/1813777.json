 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rigorous research and development methods are essential for developing and testing new approaches in STEM education. This project will address two critical opportunities to improve the translation and connection of innovations and evidence across federally funded STEM education projects. First, the project will aim to build capacity and learning opportunities for STEM education research and development.  Second, the project will synthesize evidence of discovery and innovation across NSF-funded work. The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. \r\n\r\nThis project will conduct four research syntheses.  Final topics will be determined but may include early math education, early learning in science, and engineering in the elementary grades. As part of this work, the team will produce a brief report for each topical synthesis, designed to highlight and elevate evidence and contributions across a set of projects, in a nontechnical format that combines graphics with text. Content will include a rationale for the topic and its importance in STEM education; synopsis of the investments in this area and the projects sampled; synopsis of the cross-project contributions, with illustrative highlights or examples from projects; commentary on the quality of evidence; and discussion of the contributions and potential broader impacts of the investments. The project will also plan and conduct a series of methods-focused webinars which may include topics such as rigorous quasi-experimental designs; measuring implementation fidelity and adaptation; applying improvement science methods; cluster randomized controlled trials; design-based research; or developing and testing valid measures. The materials from the webinars will be procured and made publicly available for the education research community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
