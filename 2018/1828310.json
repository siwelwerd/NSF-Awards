 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Professor Bradley Kraft from St. John Fisher College and colleagues Renuka Manchanayakage and Anand Sridhar have acquired a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as allow study of biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The instrument positively impacts student researchers who coauthor papers and present their results at local and national conferences. The spectrometer promotes its enhanced research opportunities in its outreach, and empowers future generations in science and engineering. Secondary school students who attend Science Exploration Days participate on hands-on workshops that introduce them to NMR spectroscopy. The team of researchers also have industrial collaborations that benefit the region.\r\n \r\nThe proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It is especially helpful in analyzing the structure, bonding, dynamics, and reactivity of Group 14 metal complexes and for characterizing, and evaluating applications of synthesized ionic liquids. The spectrometer aids investigators in designing and synthesizing inhibitors of the enzyme 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) synthase. It is also used in investigations of the phytochemical constituents of tropical, succulent flowering plants native of tropical Africa from the Kalanchoe species which may have potential antiviral properties.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis NSF grant provided funds for the purchase of the latest model of Bruker Avance NEO 400 MHz NMR spectrometer and allowed us to replace our former 20-year old Bruker DPX-250 NMR spectrometer that had become increasingly unfit for use due to frequent hardware failures.\n\n \n\nThe new spectrometer allows undergraduate students and faculty at St. John Fisher (SJF) University to continue and expand their research during the academic year and during the summer in the Summer Fellows research program.  With the departure of two of the original co-PIs on this project, the use of the instrument was limited to fewer faculty members and research projects.\n\n \n\nCurrently, Dr. Bradley Kraft utilizes the instrument in his research projects with students involving fundamental studies of the chelate effect in novel organosilicon N-oxide complexes.  The new NMR spectrometer has facilitated the completion of a major research project and this work \"Chelation Equilibria and &pi;&#8209;Electron Delocalization in Neutral Hypercoordinate Organosilicon Complexes of Pyrithione\" has been published in the journal Organometallics, the flagship journal for advances in the field of organometallic chemistry.  Significant progress was also made by a student in the SJF Summer Fellows program in synthesizing and characterizing new organosilicon complexes of 8-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide.  A manuscript of this work is in preparation and is expected to be published in the coming year.\n\n \n\nAnother faculty member at SJF, Dr. Alexey Ignatchenko, Associate Professor, and his students utilize the NMR routinely for the collection of proton and carbon-13 NMR spectra for studying H/D exchange processes related to heterogeneous catalytic reactions on the surface of metal oxides.  Two manuscripts of this work are in progress and expected to be published in the coming year.  A third faculty member, Dr. Irene Kimaru, Associate Professor, utilizes the NMR spectrometer for characterizing chiral ionic liquids to be used potentially for enantioseparations.  All faculty and/or their students have presented the results of their research at either national or local chemistry conferences.\n\n \n\nThe NMR spectrometer is used routinely in the Organic Chemistry II Laboratory and Advanced Lab I courses for the characterization of reaction products.  In these courses, each student gains hands-on experience in using the NMR for every experiment.  The NMR is also used extensively in the Advanced Lab II course for characterizing uncharted organosilicon complexes prepared by chemistry majors in which both routine spectra are collected in addition to 2-D HMQC spectra and variable-temperature NMR experiments.  The latest technology of the new NMR instrument and ease of use of the new software allows rapid and routine collection of 2-D spectra that was not practical in laboratory courses with our former instrument.\n\n \n\nDue to the effects of the pandemic, our anticipated use of the instrument in a mini-workshop for Science Exploration Days has not yet come to fruition.  We are committed to broadening the participation of underrepresented students in the sciences and expect to be able to offer this activity in the near future.  Additionally, with the eventual hire of new chemistry faculty, we expect increased instrument use and research productivity in the coming years.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/18/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bradley M Kraft"
