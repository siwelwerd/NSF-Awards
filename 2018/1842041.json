 "awd_abstract_narration": "International networks-of-networks have the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by leveraging US support and participation in international research collaborations. This initiative would grow US scientific capacity and leadership, provide avenues for training and mechanisms for international efforts to share technology, data and equipment. A preparatory workshop will be held to enhance readiness for the US scientific community, across scientific disciplines, to respond to a call for proposals to form International networks-of-networks. To broaden the impact of international networks-of-networks, SESYNC will hold a workshop on-site and live streamed for the community at large. This workshop will provide the scientific community with an introduction to the science of team science, common processes, tools and education on key challenges and successes in international research network formation.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the workshop is to introduce potential proposers of international networks-of networks to the science of team science particularly as relevant to remote collaborative interactions. The attendees will acquire skills useful in their existing research efforts and applicable to responding to a new international network- of-networks call.  Discussions and presentations during the workshop will include material on effective network communication, participant engagement, network leadership, and management techniques that are effective at fostering and leveraging existing US investments in critical research networks. The workshop will include topical discussions, explore examples, and include exercises for participants to begin to implement concepts into practice. Participants will gain an enhanced understanding of the critical roles played by leadership styles, well-developed organizational and communication strategies, establishment of a shared vision and goals, data management/sharing agreements, and adaptation as network needs change.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In doing so, they can rapidly advance progress on critical issues and cooperatively identify and coordinate efforts to address knowledge gaps and research needs. Effective networks of networks (NoNs) will also enhance US scientific capacity and leadership, provide avenues for training and mechanisms for international efforts to share technology, data and equipment. For international NoNs to be successful the research community must overcome a number of challenges including; applying effective organizational planning that can lead to structures that sustain dispersed multi-team networks; using best practices for collaboration and teamwork, adopting new modes of leadership and communication, developing data management/sharing agreements and especially, planning for adaptation as network needs change over time.Knowledge of and competencies in these and other areas will be essential to the development of competitive proposals for funding and ultimately to implementing effective NoNs. To help the US research community address these issues, The National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) held a preparatory workshop in September 2019 to enhance readiness for the US scientific community, across scientific disciplines, to respond to an NSF call for proposals to form International networks-of-networks. Central to the event was an introduction to NSF's AccelNet program. The two-day workshop included 12 presentations covering a range of topics including; network to network models, tools to build and sustain dispersed NoN, defining a collective vision and mission and overall expectations, models for effective network leadership, the science of team science and collaboration and approaches to evaluation. SESYNC hosted 35 attendees on-site in Annapolis with nearly 70 more participating via a livestream of talks and interactive QA sessions. Participants came from a range of disciplines and interests. The workshop included topical discussions, explored examples relevant to these different natural and social science domains. Those on-site contributed to lively discussions and they gained a better understanding of the critical factors (common processes, tools and education) that can enhance the success of new NoNs. Informal conversations among participants indicated new collaborations were forming and future AccelNet proposals were considered.In a broader context, attendees also acquired skills useful in their existing research efforts. To expand the impact of the workshop, SESYNC posted slide decks from each presentation on its website (http://www.sesync.org/project/propose-a-workshop/sesync-networks-of-networks-workshop) and produced high quality videos of all the contributed talks. These are available through the SESYNC YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIGFwrZq94y8YCsRPyXkybb49e0MqMbVo) where they continue to be accessed. To date, the workshop videos have been viewed over 700 times indicating an ongoing interest in the materials developed for this event.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/30/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jonathan&nbsp;Kramer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
