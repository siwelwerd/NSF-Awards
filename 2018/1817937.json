 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is a novel prosthesis that addresses many health concerns addressed by the more than 600,000 individuals in the lower limb amputee population. The amputee population exhibits many day-to-day challenges associated with mobility tasks such as descending stairs, or even level ground walking. This projects seeks to develop an ankle prosthesis that addresses many of these needs while maintaining a small, quiet, and lightweight package. No other prosthesis on the commercial market exhibits the same functionality as this device, and therefore, there exists a gap in the market that can be filled by this device.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on a novel ankle prosthesis, utilizing a novel actuator. This novel actuator allows this device to exhibit the following three mechanical functions: 1) high torque locking under load; 2) high-power dissipation under load; and 3) low-power generation in the absence of a load. These functions allow amputees to adapt to various terrains, gain support during standing, perform stair descent like healthy subjects as well as lift their toe during swing to avoid tripping. A prototype device has been created, and is to be assessed on amputees to determine its biomechanical benefit.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
