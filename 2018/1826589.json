 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will develop models of complex systems in which the movement of social entities themselves (either into or out of a system of interest or among subsystems) is endogenously related to the relationships among those entities. Endogenous migration is critical to understanding important social phenomena ranging from recruitment into and turnover in organizations to the mass convergence of volunteer responders that occurs when disaster strikes. Endogenous migration is an important driver of the heterogeneity that can challenge conventional models of social network structure.  This project will address current limitations in the modeling of networks with endogenous migration. The development of these models will advance modeling of complex social systems. Although the primary impact of this research will be within the statistical and social science communities, the tools and techniques to be developed also will be applicable to problems in biology, computer science, and engineering. The resulting insights will have direct policy relevance for groups or organizations dealing with important societal issues, such as emergency responses. The project also will make contributions via student education and training, the creation of instructional materials, and freely available software tools for use by government, industry, researchers, and the general public.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop new families of statistical models for studying social networks with endogenous migration processes.  The project will build on the well-known exponential family random graph model and related network modeling frameworks to integrate migration processes.  The investigator will develop of new classes of models for dynamic relational data with endogenous migration and for cross-sectional data arising from unobserved migration-dependent processes. The investigator will evaluate and test these new model classes using social network data. A variety of data sets will be used as testbeds for the new models, including social media data, disaster-related data, and water and polymer data. Testbed applications will be used to evaluate the models and also facilitate the communication of results across disciplines. Broad access to these models will be ensured by the development of freely available software toolkits and the creation of training materials and workshops.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur ability to model network structure and dynamics has advanced considerably over the past decade, opening up new frontiers for empirical and theoretical investigation.  One such frontier is the modeling of networks in which vertices endogenously migrate - whether between groups, in and out of a single network, or among locations - as the network evolves.  Such migration is seen at a range of spatial and population scales, from attendance at sequences of events to mass convergence in disasters and migration between countries or communities.  This research worked to advance our ability to model networks featuring such endogenous vertex dynamics, either explicitly (in cases where dynamics is directly observed) or implicitly (in cases where unobserved vertex dynamics shapes the structure of an observed network)\n\nResearch supported by this project has resulted in numerous technical and theoretical advances in network modeling.  Among these has been a new family of techniques for modeling the ways in which groups create and maintain boundaries that we believe will be widely used within the network community, new results on network measurement and stability, new mechanistic foundations for network models based on vertex dynamics, new work on migration networks, and new tools for understanding network dynamics in continuous time.  This work will, we believe, ultimately open up a wide new range of phenomena to network modelers.\n\nProject research has also addressed issues of public concern.  At present, understanding the factors that drive not only migration but also social integration are increasingly critical to societies throughout the developed world.  Developing a solid evidence base to inform policy - and reliable techniques to measure and predict migration-related phenomena - is more important than ever.  Beyond spatial migration, we are also grappling with questions regarding social migration in the context of e.g. selection into and out of STEM or other career paths, phenomena that cannot be separated from the formation and dissolution of the personal ties that draw individuals into - or keep them from pursuing - particular pathways.  The types of methods developed in this research will help researchers build an evidence base regarding these and other problems of fundamental importance to the security and economic productivity of our diverse and ever-changing society.\n\nOur work also directly addressed the COVID-19 pandemic: when the pandemic struck, project researchers immediately began working to apply our models to the problem of understanding the dynamics of viral diffusion, and in particular to understanding the disparities that can arise due to contact network heterogeneity.  This work identified weaknesses in the dominant models that were being used for epidemic forecasting, and suggested improvements that may provide more realistic assessments at urban and intra-urban scales.  It has also provided a potential structural explanation for differences in perceptions of the pandemic, in terms of real differences in social exposures to disease morbidity and mortality in different locales.  In some cases, our findings suggest that differences in attitudes towards appropriate responses to the COVID-19 pandemic often ascribed to political or cultural disagreements may have emerged from real and significant differences in community experiences during its opening months.\n\nIn addition to the above contributions, this project supported graduate and undergraduate training, development of free software tools for data modeling and analysis, and freely available tools for modeling SARS-CoV-2 diffusion, the latter made available via publicly available software and data repositories.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/23/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Carter T Butts"
