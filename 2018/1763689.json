 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microrobots have many potential applications in applications as diverse as biomedical and advanced manufacturing.  While current microrobots can navigate using externally applied magnetic fields, their lack of sensing and manipulation limit their capabilities.  In particular, micro-force information is essential for safe biomanipulation, sensing biological processes, and performing microassembly tasks in advanced manufacturing applications.  In addition, mobile microrobots that can sense electrical potentials and connections of cells will enable the characterization and study of therapeutic strategies, assisting in the treatment of various cancers.  As part of the planned outreach activities, researchers will develop STEM outreach programs with Deaf Kids CODE to help empower deaf/hard of hearing K-12 students.\r\n\r\nTo this end, the project will create a new class of light responsive polymer magnetic microrobots (LRPMMs) with active end-effectors and dual-mode sensing capabilities.  An embedded magnetic body will enable the use of external magnetic fields to control microrobots to navigate in the workspace.  The active end-effectors will be made from responsive polymers and actuated by structured light patterns. The polymer structures will be calibrated so vision-based force-sensing techniques can be applied. Additionally, electrochromic properties will be embedded into the polymers to enable detection of electrical potential levels in the environment through their change in color. The proposed research tasks include the design and fabrication of the LRPMMs; optical system development for structured light actuation, sensing, and tracking; and control and experimental validation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The two classes of RPMMs developed were the Helical Adaptive Multi-Material MicroRobots (HAMMRs) and the Modular Responsive Microrobots. The HAMMRs consist of a hard-magnetic head and helical hydrogel tail that can adapt its geometry to its environment. It locomotes using a rotating magnetic field. The Modular Responsive Microrobots consist of a magnetic base unit and sets of modular end-effectors. A responsive mating component consisting of hydrogel material is used to connect the different end-effector types to the magnetic base for different applications. It is controlled through the use of magnetic field gradients. The Dual Locomotion Mode Multi-Functional Robot (uDMMF) is a novel microrobot that utilizes two distinct magnetic locomotion methods, a combination of rotating and gradient field control, for precise micro-object manipulation using multiple end-effectors. A novel 3D optical sensing system was developed for the high-speed, high-resolution tracking of the microrobot's pose and real-time deformation. Based on structured light patterns, a calibration method to achieve high measurement accuracy was developed along with a focus stacking method to enlarge the depth-of-field (DOF). A novel absolute phase unwrapping algorithm which requires less fringe patterns for higher speed 3D optical sensing and a method to optimize microscopic 3D imaging speed were also created.\n\n\n\n\n\nBroader Impacts Outcomes\n\n\nThe great many applications for micro-scale robots and systems yield many potential broader impacts of this work. Advances in mechanobiology, automated biomanipulation, cancer cell screening, life science automation, microsurgery, drug delivery, and diagnostic testing with microrobots can impact the healthcare of many. The use of the RPMMs for micromanipulation and assembly of micro-scale components can have impacts in advanced manufacturing areas.
