 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop novel methods for analyzing and modeling \r\nheterogeneous dynamic networked data. Network data arises in a number of \r\napplication domains ranging from Internet of Things, cloud computing, software analysis, \r\nneuroscience, biology, geography, to social sciences. Accordingly, network \r\nanalysis has emerged as a major paradigm for exploring complex processes \r\nbehind observed data. Compared to high dimensional data, analysis of network \r\ndata is more challenging due to interdependencies between entities, the \r\npresence of attributes, and the natural evolution of networks over time. The \r\ngoal of the project will be to understand and model the heterogeneity of \r\nbehaviors in dynamic networks. The project will have a transformative impact \r\non big data problems that are enabled by a network-centric approach to \r\nexploiting dynamic, heterogeneous data, such as brain networks. The project \r\nwill integrate research and education by introducing methods and results of the \r\nproject into courses and seminars, and train a diverse group of undergraduate \r\nand graduate students.\r\n\r\nThe project's focus will be on heterogeneity in dynamic networks: \r\nheterogeneity of node behaviors across network structure and time, \r\nheterogeneity of the coupling of structure and attributes, and heterogeneity \r\nacross networks. Against this backdrop, the project will consider the basic \r\nproblems of clustering (partitioning), classification/regression, decomposition \r\nof networks into its basis elements, and the problem of explaining global \r\nnetwork behaviors by small network fragments. These problems will be \r\nconsidered for a single network and for multiple networks. Within a network, \r\nheterogeneity is observed when nodes or clusters exhibit different behaviors, \r\nfor instance due to hidden or missing data. Across networks, heterogeneity is \r\nobserved in the diversity of subject populations or among network instances. \r\nThe first research thrust will apply spectral theory for partitioning attributed \r\nand dynamic networks. The second research thrust will apply convex \r\noptimization to find clusters while tolerating heterogeneity across network \r\nstructure and time. It will also develop methods for estimating graphical models \r\nfor multiple dynamic networks. The final research thrust will focus on the \r\ndiscovery of succinct sub-networks that are predictive and that evolve \r\nconcurrently with the underlying networks.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
