 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a research project that studies how improvements since 1965 in scientific and technical education for a broader range of young people has grown into what is currently a national priority. The study will explain in detail how, when, and why this commitment to diversity developed, permanently reshaping our modern cultures of science, engineering, education, and child-rearing. Major outcomes include an academic book, Recruiting Engineer Jane and Astrophysicist Amy: American STEM Advocacy for Girls, 1965-Present, plus scholarly papers, public presentations, a textbook, and museum exhibit. Analysis is primarily grounded in history, but draws on and informs our understanding of present-day outreach in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). \r\n\r\nAlthough the project being supported focuses on the evolution of campaigns for girls, the account to be developed will provide insights into parallel efforts to promote access for other under-represented groups, adding historical dimension to ongoing discussions of diversity in STEM. The researcher conducting the study has extended research experience in the history of science and technology, science-policy studies, and the broad context of modern U.S. history. Her study draws on a wide range of reports, letters, administrative records, and other documentation from individual actors and organizations, such as the National Science Foundation, National Academy of Engineering, American Association of University Women, and Girl Scouts. Beyond assessing this wealth of data, this initiative explores new territory by conducting central case-studies and several dozen unique oral-history interviews with key figures in the movement to open STEM to girls. The researcher will conduct oral-history interviews and archival research across multiple libraries and archives. She will deliver talks to both academic and general audiences, mount a museum exhibit on STEAM (the A denotes the Arts) and diversity, and develop K-12 curriculum packets and exhibit-visitor materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
