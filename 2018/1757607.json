 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Bowie State University (BSU), located in Bowie, MD, will support the training of 8 students in a 10-week program during the summers of 2019-2020. The program is hosted by the BSU Department of Natural Sciences and the University of Nairobi in Kenya and Egerton University (Kenya, Department of Crops, Horticulture and Soils). Students spend the first week at BSU for an intensive boot camp on the history and culture of Kenya, safety, ethics/responsible conduct of research, basic scientific principles, and skills to prepare for the research project. The next 8 weeks are dedicated to research at Egerton University (Year 1) or the University of Nairobi (Year 2) with field sampling trips, followed by a concluding week at BSU where students present the results of their research. Research focuses on the genetic, physiological, and ecological mechanisms that underlie crop responses in a changing environment with a goal towards food security. Example student projects include molecular studies of aflatoxin grain contamination, sweet sorghum genotypes and ecotypes, genetic and metabolite diversity of the indigenous vegetable Cleome gynandra, analysis of sweet sorghum enzymes, and characterization of Rhizobia species in Dolichos lablab. Workshops focus on professional skills (e.g., literature review, experimental techniques and design, data collection and analysis, oral and written presentation skills). Recruitment and participant selection will focus on students with outstanding research potential with special emphasis on students from underrepresented groups. \r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that a total of 16 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, analyzed, and communicated. Many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences, and some will publish the results in peer-reviewed journals.\r\n\r\nA common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to determine the effectiveness of program. Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. This REU is also supported by the Division of Human Resource Development in the Directorate for Education and Human Resources. More information is available by visiting https://www.bowiestate.edu/academics-research/colleges/college-arts-sciences/departments/natural-sciences/research-experience-for-underg/  or by contacting the PI, Dr. Anne Osano at aosano@bowiestate.edu.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The program was &nbsp;hosted by Egerton University, Kenya. The students engaged in 8 weeks international research working with international mentors and therefore had a chance to gain cultural competency. We implemented the program in 2019 when 9 interns participated in the international program. We however were interrupted in 2020 and 2021 due to Covid-19 travel restrictions . In summer 2020 and 2021, we requested a change in scope and hosted a domestic REU without global experience. In all, we had an excellent program. &nbsp;We further received some supplemental funds to train &nbsp;3 students in the summer of 2023.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit : The products&nbsp; </strong><strong>from the</strong><strong> </strong>program are<strong>&nbsp;3 (three)</strong>&nbsp;peer reviewed publications with &nbsp;2 undergraduate co-authors in&nbsp;<strong>2 manuscripts</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>46 Extramural conference</strong>&nbsp;presentations with peer reviewed abstracts on Food security research. The conference presentations included Emerging Research STEM conference (ERN) in Washington DC; Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minorities Scientists (ABRCMS among others. This research goal was to increase our&nbsp;<strong>knowledge</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>understanding of the treasures of food value</strong>&nbsp;hidden in the unforgotten food crops of Africa. The latest figures in Africa show that 73 million people suffer from acute food insecurity while Africa imports around 85% of its food from outside the continent, making an annual food bill of $35 billion, which is projected to hit $110 billion by 2025. However, the African continent is home to a rich diversity of food crops, most of which have received&nbsp;<strong>little or no attention</strong>&nbsp;in terms of research and development of policy frameworks that can promote their effective commercial and industrial utilization. Their integration into the food system can mitigate the effects of environmental change and improve qualitative of food security. Our research aimed to respond to this need and was undertaken by a team of&nbsp;<strong>qualified research scientists</strong>&nbsp;from Egerton University and Bowie State University. Some of forgotten crops studied included <em>Lablab purpureus </em>which<em> </em>has been underutilized although it is a legume that can potentially replace meat as a protein source due to its high protein content; Sorghum (<em>Sorghum bicolor </em>L. Moench) which is an important crop with a great potential to provide fodder and can grow in &nbsp;more diverse environments; and is more resilient to multiple abiotic and biotic stresses. &nbsp;Finger millet (<em>Eleusine coracana L.</em>) has nutritional benefits with ability to grow and develop in places with high drought and where the nutritional resources are few. <em>Cleome Gynandra</em> ,spider plant, is an indigenous leafy vegetable, with a rich source of micronutrients but also contains anti-nutrients, such as tannins and alkaloids, phytates and oxalates that may adversely affect the health of individuals. This research aimed at determining the levels of these antinutrients in spider plant vegetable. The results obtained&nbsp; indicate safe levels of these anti-nutrients, phytates and oxalates.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong>, the program trained 25 minority undergraduate students;<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>87% of our total applications were minorities</strong><strong>. </strong>Six (<strong>6) students </strong>frorm the program have<strong> gone to graduates schools, two of whom are in a PhD Program, two(2) in medical schools; one in Agricultural business, the rest working in science labs. </strong>We will highlight only a few responses to the <strong>URSSA survey</strong> which was given to the students at the end of their &nbsp;experience .
