The workshop will take place at Institute of Scientific Studies of Cargese (IESC) Corsica, France. The Cargese workshop will provide a high-level interdisciplinary overview and training on flow, transport and biogeochemical processes, experimental methods and numerical and statistical modelling in critical zone environments. Multiple sessions led by invited scientists from around the world will discuss emergent scientific questions and approaches in critical zone science. The event will address the interfaces of hydrology, hydrogeology, biogeochemistry, geomorphology, microbiology and ecology.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project supports the participation of 16 US graduate students and post-doctoral researchers in a training workshop on observation, experimentation and modeling subsurface processes in the Critical Zone. The workshop will take place at Institute of Scientific Studies of Cargese (IESC) Corsica, France from 25 June to 7 July, 2018. The Cargese workshop will provide a high-level interdisciplinary overview and training on flow, transport and biogeochemical processes, experimental methods and numerical and statistical modelling in critical zone environments. In particular, sessions lead by leading scientists from around the world will discuss emergent scientific questions and approaches in critical zone science. The event will address the interfaces of hydrology, hydrogeology, biogeochemistry, geomorphology, microbiology and ecology.  The main topics to be addressed are (1) the water cycle: interaction between groundwater and surface water, eco-hydrology; (2) fluid flow and transport: multiphase flow, mixing and reactive transport, coupling flow/transport with biological activity, thermo-hydromechanics, complex fluids and biofilms; (3) experimental methods: hydrogeological and hydrogeophysical characterization, seismic noise tomography, bio-geophysics, micro-scale and microfluidic imaging; and (4) numerical and stochastic modelling methods, data analysis, inverse problem, upscaling, uncertainty analysis and geostatistics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe problems faced in hydrologic systems in the United States are faced around the world.  Many of the leading scientists across Europe, Asia, and Africa gained their graduate training in the USA, and are delighted to maintain strong connections to US institutions and researchers.  But if the USA is to remain at the forefront of advancement in hydrological systems, we must venture beyond our own shores.  This grant allowed 9 faculty and 7 graduate students to spend two weeks at the world\u2019s highest-level training event in groundwater hydrology which took place in France in June of 2018.  The teaching team was almost half made up of US faculty, and 10% of the students were from the USA.  Aside from paying for airfare and lodging costs of the US participants, all other costs were borne by European institutions.  A key goal of the NSF-funded effort was to capture the 101 lectures given at the event so that they could be posted for students across the USA and the world to benefit from the technical content of the meeting.  All the lectures were recorded by a US Hydrogeology student, and the videos were processed by a US Media Studies student.  Since posting the videos in 2019, they have been viewed more than 14,000 times.  Consisting mostly of &gt;1 hr lectures, this represents a major advancement in the field of hydrogeology, where the number of people engaged is relatively small.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/28/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John S Selker"
