 "awd_abstract_narration": "Toxic algae have serious negative effects varying from fish kills to human illnesses caused by the consumption of shellfish contaminated with algal toxins.  The economic impact from blooms of these algae can be devastating to fishing and shellfish industries and tourism.  However, bioactive compounds and molecules produced by these toxic algae have also become an interesting and exciting avenue for innovative basic and applied research.  The Algal Resources Collection (ARC) at the University of North Carolina Wilmington is the only public collection exclusively dedicated to toxic microalgae in the United States.  Currently comprising 424 algal strains, ARC is a major supplier of toxic algae strains for scientists all over the world.  Cultures have been extensively used by national and international research community in studies encompassing diverse subject areas, including ecology, taxonomy and phylogeny, comparative genomics, studies on the effects of algal toxins on human and animal health, and for the development of toxin profiles.  Cultures are also used to develop alternative solutions for the monitoring and remediation of toxic algae and toxins, as well as in the search of new bioactive compounds in the development of new drugs to treat or cure a variety of diseases.  Additionally, ARC researchers and staff are involved in outreach activities that involve diverse educational levels including K-12 teachers and students, undergraduate, graduate and PhD students.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to optimize the functionality and accessibility of the ARC as a Living Stocks resource.  The main goals are: 1) Enhancement of infrastructure and procedures for the improvement of culturing conditions and workflow efficiency, 2) Improvement of the collection organization and curation practices, and 3) Increase the visibility of the collection to the research community.  These improvements will allow ARC to offer their unique cultures to a much larger portion of this scientific community, to take the final step towards the consolidation of the ARC as a community research resource, and to achieve the self-sustainability necessary for its maintenance and expansion.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Most toxic algae are sensitive species, difficult to isolate and maintain in culture. Due to our available infrastructure and expertise in dealing with such challenging-to-grow microorganisms, the ARC occupies a niche in terms of services (primarily related to customized large-scale culturing) that are not currently offered by any other public culture collection in the U.S. Most ARC users are researchers that have no experience or available infrastructure to maintain microalgal cultures. The ARC is presently a major supplier of toxic or otherwise harmful microalgal strains for researchers worldwide, as many collaborations, loans, and exchanges are made every year.</p>\n<p>The project NSF1756414 aimed to optimize the functionality and accessibility of UNCW-ARC. The main goals were: 1) enhancement of infrastructure and procedures for the improvement of the culturing conditions and workflow efficiency, 2) improvement of the collection organization and curation practices, and 3) increase the visibility of the collection to the research community. Main outcomes included the correct taxonomic assignation of several microalgal strains, toxicological characterization of several strains, optimization of culturing conditions for all strains, reorganization of the ARC database, implementation of a barcode label system, and reformulation of the UNCW-ARC website. The exposure of the UNCW-ARC through our new website (www.algalresourcescollection.com), our participation in conferences, and the use of UNCW-ARC strains in recent publications resulted in an increase in the number of national and international contacts from researchers interested in our cultures. We observed a significant increase in the number of distributed strains compared to 2016 (130 strains in 2021 compared to 16 strains in 2019). This was a direct result of this grant that contributed significantly to enhancing the visibility of the UNCW-ARC to the research community made possible by this grant. The increase in the number of distributed strains over the last six years was mostly due to a higher demand for microalgal materials provided as microalgal biomass. A similar increase was observed in the requests for large-scale cultures (over 10 L). A significant amount (over 80%) of materials distributed by UNCW-ARC in the last years were provided to researchers holding grants from varied funding agencies such as NSF, NOAA, NASA, the More Foundation, and the North Carolina Biotechnology Center. The grant also UNCW-ARC trained four undergraduate and two graduate students involved in ongoing applied and basic research projects related to microalgae-related subjects in the UNCW?s Department of Biology and Marine Biology. The UNCW-ARC participates every year in the Open House of the UNCW?s Center for Marine Science, in which the community has the opportunity to learn about UNCW?s coastal research and join us for informational outdoor displays and activities, live demos, and tours. We also regularly host educational tours for students from elementary and middle schools, high schools, and community colleges.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/01/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Catharina&nbsp;Alves-De-Souza</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1756414/1756414_10530729_1658517709222_UNCW-ARCCollection--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1756414/1756414_10530729_1658517709222_UNCW-ARCCollection--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"UNCW Algal Resources Collection\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1756414/1756414_10530729_1658517709222_UNCW-ARCCollection--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"UNCW Algal Resources Collection\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The UNCW\ufffds Algal Resources Collection (UNCW-ARC) is dedicated to the growth and maintenance of toxic or otherwise harmful microalgal species.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Catharina Alves-de-Souza</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Catharina&nbsp;Alves-De-Souza</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">UNCW Algal Resources Collection</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1756414/1756414_10530729_1658519167924_UNCW-ARCLarge-scale--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1756414/1756414_10530729_1658519167924_UNCW-ARCLarge-scale--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"UNCW-ARC Large-scale\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1756414/1756414_10530729_1658519167924_UNCW-ARCLarge-scale--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"UNCW-ARC Large-scale\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Due to our available infrastructure and expertise in dealing with senstive and challenging-to-grow microalgae, the UNCW-ARC occupies a niche in terms of services (primarily related to customized large-scale culturing).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jeff Janowski</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Catharina&nbsp;Alves-De-Souza</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">UNCW-ARC Large-scale</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
