 "awd_abstract_narration": "Low frequency radio arrays are opening up a new window in discovery space.  Designed to maximize throughput, they have the survey speed and sensitivity to find a significant number of sources absent in earlier studies. They can systematically probe the radio sky for transient and variable sources, following up exotic transients while characterizing the behavior of known sources. The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) are premier facilities well suited for detecting radio emissions occurring on sub-second timescales using unique detection strategies to overcome noisy environments. Detected transients will trigger mapping to image the source of emission to locate and determine the emission mechanisms giving rise to it.   Some will be known sources with unexplained energetics while others will be totally new sources.  This grant funds a postdoctoral associate and undergraduate students at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, who will gain valuable Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education in signal processing and analyzing massive amounts of data, which is a necessary skill in today?s software industry. The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee?s Astronomy Club will expand its STEM activities by involving undergraduate students in this research. \r\n\r\nThis research will use the abilities of the MWA?s and ASKAP?s as discovery engines to detect short duration, less than one second, transient events and variable phenomena in imaging surveys over the sky. Together MWA and ASKAP provide powerful and complementary constraints on source?s astrophysics by providing data over an octave in radio frequency.  It will focus on the study of the emission mechanisms of low mass stars and extrasolar planets, orphan gamma-ray burst afterglows, multi-wavelength to multi-messenger prompt and coherent emission with MWA and late time after glows with ASKAP, as well as unexpected sources/transients from unknown progenitors. Detection strategies to overcome background emission will include circular polarization detection and image subtraction against background radiation.  The discovery of significant events will be followed-up by measurements at multiple wavelengths.  If nothing is discovered, significant limits will be established for future searches.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nIntellectual Merit:\r\n\n\nThis project supported work to conduct surveys of the radio sky with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP). The primary outcomes of this work were to greatly expand the number and nature of transient radio sources discovered, especially through use of radio polarization as a way to filter out alll of the non-interesting radio sources. We also worked on understanding the nature of the radio emission from the first binary neutron star merger GW170817, and predicting/developing strategies to understand the emission from future mergers.\r\n\n\nAt the start, we focused on using the MWA to understand the radio emission from different types of transients, and used that information to inform the science case for the second phase of the MWA.\r\n\n\nWe then moved to the ASKAP and the Variables and Slow Transient (VAST) Survey Science Project. First we used pilot observations during 2021 to help understand key observational parameters and capabilities, and then used those to develop a plan for the full survey which started in 2022. We also developed tools to facilitate wide usage of the data by members of the public and the wider collaboration.\r\n\n\nWhile we studied a range of different types of sources, from nearby stars to supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, and tidal disruption events, the most interesting work focused on using radio polarization to study sources within the Milky Way galaxy and the LMC. These included finding several new pulsars that had been missed by previous surveys (including the brightest pulsar in the LMC), the coolest brown dwarf seen to emit radio waves, and a new transient source toward the Galactic Center.\r\n\n\nDuring the final period, the primary outcomes were identification of a number of interesting long-period radio transients (periods of minutes to hours). These were first discovered only in 2022, but now the VAST survey is discovering an increasing number of them with a range of properties, including the slowest one (6 hour period) and the first with an X-ray counterpart. While we still do not know definitively what powers these objects, this survey is starting to at least assemble basic demographic information about the population.\r\n\n\nBroader Impact:\r\n\n\nThe work for this project had several key components. First, we mentored the UWM Astronomy Club, who meet regularly and discuss ongoing astronomy research, the nature of astronomy as a career, and gets students involved in research pipelines that lead to career development opportuntiies. Second, this project supported development of hands-on exhibits that were shown to the general public at the Milwaukee Maker Faire. Third, this project directly supporset several undergraduate students in in-depth research projects that led to publications. Fourth, a number of the science results from this project appeared in the popular press or had popular articles written by the PI for the Conversation, which led to much greater discussion of this type of work.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/02/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DavidLKaplan\n"
