 "awd_abstract_narration": "The US food and beverage industry employs 1.46 million individuals and is responsible for more than 10% of all manufacturing shipments. Even though sanitation is one of the food industry's biggest production expenses, inadequate sanitation remains one of the greatest threats to America's food safety and security due to the lack of modern technology and consistent application of sanitation policies.\r\n\r\nCAFSS will strive to integrate and streamline the entire food supply chain in the US from 'Farm to Fork' and supply safe (pathogen and allergen free), secure (uninterrupted and fully traceable sources), wholesome and plentiful supply of food to the US and Global consumers.\r\n\r\nCAFSS objectives will focus on addressing two grand challenges of national importance:\r\n\r\n1) Ensuring a stable and sustainable supply of affordable, safe, nutritious food not only for the US but also for the rest of the world.\r\n2) Equipping and empowering US food manufacturers and their supporting industries, to establish highly competitive manufacturing plants in the US and the world.\r\n\r\nThe US food industry adds commercial value to agricultural products and provides employment opportunities in both rural and urban areas and CAFSS will enhance the overall sustainability and profitability through automation and new private-public partnerships.\r\n\r\nThe proposed CAFSS will bridge technological gaps, which fall under the general theme of food safety, security and traceability of all raw materials throughout the entire supply chain from 'Farm to Fork'.  Bridging these gaps will require multidisciplinary collaborations among public and private enterprises and groundbreaking research and development within the following fundamental science and engineering platforms:\r\n\r\n1) Automation, control and robotics; IoT systems and data integration; \r\n2) New sensors; big data analytics and artificial intelligence; \r\n3) New functionalized surfaces, new materials / coatings  \r\n4) Novel food sterilization technologies. \r\n\r\nAutomation, control, and robotics minimize human contact with food and greatly enhance food safety. Newer sensors with data analytics enable the food companies to improve food safety, quality, and traceability. Novel functionalized surfaces enhance food sanitation efficiency thereby reducing production downtime, and energy and water requirements.  Novel food sterilization and pasteurization technologies improve food safety with minimal deterioration in food quality and they meet consumers' demand for minimally processed foods.\r\n\r\nResearch projects will be carried out at CAFSS hub facilities in Nebraska and Georgia and the resulting breakthroughs will allow the US food manufacturing industry to join other industries in terms of efficiency, automation, lower cost, predictability, safety and security of goods supplied.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes Report for Planning IUCRC at Georgia Institute of Technology: Center for Engineering and Manufacturing Technologies Advancing Food Safety and Security (CAFSS)\n\n\nFaculty and researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology in partnership with faculty at the University of Nebraska explored the opportunity to put together an Industry/University Collaborative Research Center focused on Engineering and Manufacturing Technologies for Advancing Food Safety and Security (CAFSS).  This was supported by a small planning grant ($15K) as part of a NSF solicitation process for competing for an IUCRC. As part of this process, team leaders participated in the IUCRC boot camp at the National Science Foundation to explore the application of customer discovery and product need/opportunity principals to assess the need and financial viability of a center of this nature.  This included interviewing many food industry representatives, as well as allied industry participants to understand the true needs and knowledge gaps facing the industry.   \n\n\nThese industry interviews yielded two very interesting observations and results.  First, there is a large gap in research funding to support equipment technology development for food manufacturing in general.  Most of the modern equipment technologies being developed for food manufacturing are coming from overseas corporate entities often with support from EU governments.  While funding is available to support research in the targeted area of food safety and microbiology, there is very little that focuses on the broader equipment and technology systems that manufacture the food in the processing facilities.   The outcomes of the interview processes did point to an interest in and a need for new equipment technologies for processing and manufacturing foods that could address food safety and labor concerns. \n\nSecondly, a culture mismatch was observed when it comes to resourcing the research and development of equipment technologies for the food industry and the processes used for other technology intensive fields.  While we did no attempt to delve into causality, the low-margin, high-volume, and ever changing nature of food manufacturing does not necessarily align with the corporate funding models for collaborative research centers.  Large food manufacturing companies typically rely on their equipment suppliers to do the manufacturing research and development, and then wait for new innovations to emerge on the market.  The equipment companies, while interested, are somewhat reluctant to join a collaborative research center focused on food manufacturing technologies.  While intellectual property concerns are certainly a contributing factor, there appears to be some concern that pursuing new concepts and technologies in food manufacturing may be disruptive to existing manufacturing infrastructure investments and revenue models.  In addition, the equipment manufacturers are hesitant to drive new technology solutions without a significant pull from the large food manufacturing companies.  So there is a bit of a ?chicken and the egg? challenge.\n\n\nIt was clear from this process that there is a real need for disruptive innovation in the food equipment and manufacturing sector.  The food equipment industry is predominantly foreign owned and resourced, which provides a unique challenge and opportunity in terms of improving US food security.   Finally, it appears that significant investment will be required beyond what the food industry and allied partners can provide if the United States hopes to regain a major presence in the development of food equipment and manufacturing technologies.   \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/24/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Douglas F Britton"
