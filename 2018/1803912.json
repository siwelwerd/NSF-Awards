 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)is the microscopic theory of the strong interactions based on the theory of quarks and gluons that allows us to understand how hadrons (baryons, including the protons and neutrons that make up an atomic nucleus, and mesons and their excitations) are formed. For over a half century, the only known hadrons fit into the categories of either 3-quark compounds (baryons) or quark-antiquark compounds (mesons).  Since 2003, almost 3 dozen new \"exotic\" hadrons, fitting into the categories of 4-quark tetraquarks and 5-quark pentaquarks, have been discovered. That said, fundamental questions like the reason for the multiplicity and spacing between masses of these new particles, as well as the question of how the quarks inside them arrange themselves, are still unresolved.  The goal of this project is to develop a physical paradigm (pioneered by the PI and his collaborators) called the dynamical diquark picture into a fully predictive model that will be used to compute the physical properties of exotic hadrons.  This model will be developed with the participation of a graduate student mentored by the PI.\r\n \r\nThe primary project research is the development of a predictive model to describe the heavy-quark exotic hadrons that have been (and continue to be) discovered in the charmonium and bottomonium sectors.  Even fundamental issues about exotics like their basic structure are not yet settled.  Recently, the PI and his collaborators developed the \"dynamical\" diquark picture -- in which combinations of two quark (or antiquark) combinations called diquarks rapidly separate from each other, but are still bound by QCD color confinement -- as a possible structure for tetraquark states.  The development of a full model implementing this picture forms the PI's principle research in this project.  The model will be developed using an effective field theory based upon the Born-Oppenheimer (B-O) approximation, partly in collaboration with senior researchers at other academic institutions.  Parameters for the potential energy functions needed in the B-O approximation can be gleaned from the results of lattice numerical simulations.  Working out all the implications of this model will form the Ph.D. project for a student mentored by the PI.  The masses, decay modes, and internal structure of exotics predicted by the model will then be compared directly to experiment. Numerous yet-unseen states are likely to be predicted.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe grant PHY-1803912 was very unusual in that it served as the primary source of support for the PI during the period 9/18-8/21, and then during the period 9/21-8/24 it existed almost exclusively in extensions through AGEP (Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate) awards to support the PI's PhD student Steven Martinez. The primary work of the first three years developed the PI's \"dynamical diquark model\" for exotic hadrons [strongly interacting particles that belong neither to the well-known \"meson\" (quark-antiquark compound) nor \"baryon\" (3-quark compound) category; a diquark is a bound 2-quark subunit of a hadron]. The purpose of this model is to explain what the dozens of recently discovered exotic hadrons are, and how they are assembled.The PI and his graduate student Jesse Giron and undergraduate students Curtis Peterson and Justin Gens performed numerous calculations to obtain the spectrum and decay properties of exotic hadrons for multiple sectors of quark content. The PI also directed the development and dissemination of educational videos describing this research in both English and Spanish, among other educational videos. The second three years of the grant almost exclusively supported Martinez to carry out extensive calculations to develop the PIs diabatic extension of the dynamical diquark model [the PIs own work supporting these studies was carried out under grant PHY-2110278]. These calculations involved the development of intricate code to handle the diabatic mixing of diquark-based and di-meson-based descriptions of the exotic hadrons. In a sequence of several major papers, Martinez and the PI developed the model to the point that it can be applied to any quark-content sector, and important observable quantities such as the masses and decay rates of all exotic hadrons have been calculated. The second three years of the grant also supported numerous opportunities for Martinez to present these results in seminars and at conferences.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/03/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RichardFLebed\n"
