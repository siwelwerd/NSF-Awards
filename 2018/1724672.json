 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nations economy, well-being and security are linked to engineering-driven innovation and the future of engineering is inextricably linked to broadening participation in the field. As stewards of the profession, Deans of engineering are acutely aware of these linkages and uniquely positioned to provide leadership in the development of a diverse cadre of engineers who are innovators, leaders and problem-solvers. In particular, as a group, the engineering deans serving on the NSF Directorate for Engineering Advisory Committee, AdCom serve as intermediaries between NSF and the broader engineering community and help guide investments in engineering research and education. \r\n\r\nThe Engineering Deans Forum on Broadening Participation anchored by the Engineering AdCom Deans as a backbone organization within a collective impact framework, serves as a national network for sharing and disseminating, convening, and building partnerships toward the training and preparation of a diverse engineering workforce. The goals of the Forum are to 1) increase the percentage of underrepresented groups in engineering, 2) achieve diversity and inclusion in engineering research and education, and 3) provide an ongoing mechanism to achieve the aforementioned goals. Through its activities, the Engineering Deans Forum guides the development and implementation of innovative approaches to diversity and inclusion and helps bring evidence-based practices to scale across institutions leading to a diverse and agile engineering workforce representing the full range of talent in the country.",
