 "awd_abstract_narration": "Of the many English Language Learners (ELLs) in American schools today, roughly 75% speak Spanish as their native language. This represents nearly four million children who speak Spanish at home while attending school in English. The linguistic variation that these children are exposed to is one possible factor that may contribute to the persistent achievement gap between school-age ELLs and their monolingual, English-speaking peers. Research that investigates how bilingual language development progresses during the school-age period is critically needed to understand the factors that affect language development at this age and to develop programs that facilitate linguistic growth and academic success in all learners. Contrary to historical 'English-only' approaches, recent evidence suggests that providing ELLs with academic training in their first and second language leads to better outcomes in both languages. However, it is less clear what specific aspects of development contribute to this observation and what their long-term effects into adulthood may be. This study investigates the impact of literacy in ELLs' first language as one important component of school-age development that may enhance the ability to comprehend oral language. The findings of this study will have important consequences for young ELLs, who commonly acquire reading and writing skills in their second language.\r\n\r\nThis project takes a psycholinguistic perspective to investigate the role of literacy in the language development of school-age ELLs. It tests the Literacy Enhancement Hypothesis, which claims learning to read and write improves language comprehension by strengthening an individual's ability to more efficiently monitor morphological structures. The linguistic focus is gender and number markers on nouns and participles in Spanish because these are often important cues for tracking referents in complex sentences, such as passives, which are more frequent in written than in spoken language. In some cases, successfully interpreting (im)plausible passive sentences in Spanish requires listeners to attend to morphosyntactic agreement dependencies between the verb and its object. Study 1 tests 9-10 year old Spanish-speaking children (half in dual language, half in English only schools) and Study 2 tests low to high literate Spanish-speaking adults. Both studies include two identical experiments. One experiment uses visual world eye tracking techniques to measure how learning to read and write in Spanish affects these speakers' ability to use gender markers on past participles in passives sentences to anticipate the object of a sentence. The other experiment uses event related potentials (ERPs) to measure if differences in brain responses to critical words in similar sentences indicate how literacy impacts the use of syntactic and semantic information during auditory sentence processing. The findings will help improve understanding of the interaction between literacy and linguistic knowledge, and how this interaction impacts cognitive processes involved in oral language comprehension in child and adult bilinguals with different academic language exposure and experience in their native language.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

For these Spanish heritage speakers, the start of schooling in only English frequently coincides with the loss of Spanish. Apart from the loss of their heritage language, this trend has additional negative consequences because research has shown that L1 development in bilingual children also helps their L2 outcomes. Therefore, this project sought to investigate how developing L1 literacy impacts the oral production of Spanish vocabulary and complex sentence structures by 8-12-year-old Spanish heritage speakers. The study involved one group of heritage speakers who attended English-only schools and a different group of heritage speakers who attended bilingual schools, which provided literacy and content instruction in Spanish and English. As a result, all the children spoke Spanish as their L1, but only half had acquired Spanish literacy at school. To test their oral abilities in Spanish, the heritage speakers completed a series of experiments including a battery of literacy tests, an oral narrative, a picture description task, and a sentence repetition activity that evaluated the children's ability to generate (a) simple sentence structures common in oral language compared to (b) complex sentence structures like passive sentences that are more typical of written Spanish. The results found positive effects of L1 literacy on L1 oral production in these children. Heritage speakers with stronger Spanish literacy produced oral narratives that contained more diverse vocabulary and more complex sentence structures. Increased literacy also resulted in the production of fewer grammatical errors, including for grammatical gender, which is one well attested area of difficulty for these children. Finally, whereas all the heritage speakers performed well during the repetition of common sentence structures, the group with higher Spanish literacy levels was better equipped to understand and generate more complicated structures. These findings provide evidence that developing Spanish literacy is a potential tool that can effectively counteract L1 language loss in school-age heritage Speakers in a way that goes beyond the use of oral Spanish at home only. The results also further our understanding of L1 written language as an important component of linguistic input that influences the cognitive development of bilingual children. As increasing numbers of bilingual children enter schools across the U.S., these findings, which are being published in books and journal articles, have the potential to inform the design of effective curricula that will help all children learn and grow to the greatest extent possible.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/21/2023<br>\nModified by: Andrew&nbsp;Armstrong</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
