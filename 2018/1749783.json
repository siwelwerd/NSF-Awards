 "awd_abstract_narration": "Deploying assistive technologies that intelligently minimize the risk of musculoskeletal injury during physical tasks could improve user safety and significantly reduce the healthcare costs associated with the treatment of long-term disabilities such as chronic pain.  With that goal in mind, this CAREER project will contribute key innovations that allow robots to reason about the biomechanical safety of actions performed jointly with a human partner.  The research will focus on the concept of Preventive Robotics, a novel approach to human-machine collaboration that incorporates the biomechanical well-being of the human user into robot control and decision-making.  In contrast to Rehabilitation Robotics, which focuses on therapeutic procedures after an injury occurs, Preventive Robotics seeks to proactively reduce the risk of injury.  A critical knowledge gap in this regard is the absence of a theoretical foundation that supports human-machine symbiosis - healthy, physical, and bi-directional interactions between human and machine which can be comfortably sustained over very long periods of time.  The main objective of Preventive Robotics is to generate assistive robot actions that (a) seamlessly blend with actions of the human partner to achieve the intended function, while (b) minimizing biomechanical stress on the human body.  Coalescing these two goals will unlock new potential for robotics to drastically improve public and occupational health.  The project will also involve transition of innovations to a commercial partner developing intelligent lower-leg prostheses.  The research integrates with an education program targeting K-12 students, undergraduate and graduate students, and students from underrepresented groups.  \r\n\r\nTo these ends, the project will develop a unified Bayesian framework for modeling symbiotic dynamics among multiple agents using a compact probabilistic and data-driven methodology. The framework will bridge the divide between predictive modeling of humans and predictive control of symbiotic human-robot systems. A Bayesian representation will be used to derive algorithms for learning and adaptation which include the future biomechanical state of a human user. In addition, new symbiotic control algorithms will be introduced that utilize predicted biomechanical variables to steer the human-robot interaction towards biomechanically safe movement regimes. These control methods will provide new insights about strongly-coupled systems with reciprocal dependencies, in which only one system can be actively controlled (e.g., an assistive device or prosthesis). The new approach will be implemented on a powered-ankle prosthesis in order to anticipate joint loads and proactively avoid high stresses. The resulting prosthesis will have the potential to significantly lower the risk of musculoskeletal diseases such as osteoarthritis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This includes people with diabetes, automobile accident survivors and veterans. Robots and robot prostheses have the potential to substantially improve their quality of life. However, in practice robot prosthetics are often avoided since they don't adapt to their human user and can even apply stress to the human body. In this project, we developed a method that allows robots to learn and adjust their motions to the human partner. Our method called Model-Predictive Interaction Primitive allows the robot to accurately predict the forces that will affect the user's body. Our method is 20x faster and 4x more accurate than existing approaches. Our experiments also show that this approach reduces the vertical forces acting on the knee by about 16%. This is a significant reduction which also drastically reduces the risk of developing Ostheoarthritis and other diseases down the road.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, a critical question in this regard is whether users will trust such intelligent, learning devices in the future. Our research shows that it is critical that such devices obey basic safety constraints. Such constraints are very difficult to incorporate into machine learning approaches as ours. That is why we have developed a new methodology called \"neural network repair\" which can be used to strictly impose safety considerations onto the output of a neural network. In our work, we investigated how to incorporate \"ergonomics\" as a safety constraint - the robot should not only generate stable locomotion, but also take into account human comfort throughout. For this, we used smart shoe insoles that allow us to measure the forces acting on different parts of the foot as well as forces generated in the knee. We have also shown that predictive models can be learned that don't require these smart shoe soles anymore; this reduces the financial burden or buying an additional sensor. Instead, we have used more commonly available sensors such as IMUs, which can be found in smartwatches already worn by many people. This has the potential to drastically reduce the costs of smart prosthetic devices.</p>\n<p>The results of this project are published in a number of peer reviewed papers.
