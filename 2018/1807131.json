 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Professor Gary A. Lorigan from the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Miami University to investigate the structural and dynamic properties of a membrane protein known as pinholin. Novel powerful state-of-the-art techniques are used to study pinholin, which is an important membrane-bound protein that is directly involved in cell death.  The last step of the virus infection cycle is cell death through lysis, the breakdown of the cell membrane. Professor Lorigan plan to develop the experimental procedures to characterize the structure and mechanism of the active and inactive forms of pinholin in a membrane.  The pursuit allows graduate students, undergraduate students, and students from under-represented groups to obtain specialized training in cutting-edge Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) biophysical techniques.  The new biophysical methods developed are useful generally to study a variety of different membrane protein systems.  This research project also enables the development of a transformative STEM mentoring program called DUOS at Miami University that strengthens the synergy/interaction between graduate and undergraduate researchers to collaborate on a research project under the supervision of a faculty member in a Ph.D. granting department.  One undergraduate/graduate student team from the Lorigan lab is scheduled to participate in this new program.\r\n\r\nThe research project is conducted to characterize the structure, topology, dynamics, and oligomerization state of the active and inactive forms of pinholin.  Powerful CW-EPR and pulsed EPR spectroscopic techniques are used to investigate the different formations of pinholin.  Multiple distances are to be measured between spin labels to provide important structural information on the pinholin embedded in a membrane.  Information from this study should provide new insight into the pinholin mechanism and cell lysis, and provide novel methodology generally applicable to membrane proteins.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Pinholin is comprised of two alpha-helical transmembrane domains (TMDs) connected by a small chain of amino acids.  This complicated membrane protein system is very important to study. We developed a new method to synthesize, purify, and spin label mg quantities of pinholin for biophysical studies.  \n \nThe structural topology and dynamic properties of pinholin S21 were investigated and published in two different JPC-B publications.  CW-EPR power saturation experiments and EPR linewidth analysis were used to determine the residues that were buried inside the lipid bilayer and located outside. The data indicate that TMD1 partially externalizes from the lipid bilayer and interacts with the membrane surface, whereas TMD2 remains buried in the lipid bilayer in the active conformation of pinholin S2168.  \n\n \n\nProtein-lipid interactions of the active and inactive forms of pinholin were investigated with solid-state NMR (SS-NMR) spectroscopy.  This paper was published in BBA-Biomembranes.  Different forms of pinholin were incorporated into a deuterated DMPC-d54 lipid bilayer.  31P and 2H SS-NMR spectroscopic measurements were used to probe the protein-lipid interactions with the phosphorus head group at the surface of the bilayer while interactions with the 2H nuclei were used to study the hydrophobic core. A comparison of the 31P chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) values of the active S2168 pinholin and inactive S21IRS pinholin indicated stronger head group interactions for the pinholin in its active form when compared to that of the inactive form supporting the model of a partially externalized peripheral transmembrane domain (TMD) of the active S2168.  \n\n \n\nThe structural topology and conformations of active (S2168) and inactive (S2168IRS) pinholin in DMPC proteoliposomes were investigated using the four-pulse DEER EPR spectroscopic technique and SDSL to measure distances between transmembrane domains 1 and 2 (TMD1 and TMD2). This work was recently published in JPC-Bas well.  For the first time, we put together a structural model of the entire pinholin membrane system. \n\n \n\n \n\nBroader Impacts:\n\nThe biophysical chemistry research conducted on this NSF grant advanced our understanding of the structural properties of the active and inactive forms of pinholin, while promoting teaching and training.  Graduate and undergraduate students have received important scientific training. Undergraduate students played an integral role by preparing membrane protein samples and conducting EPR spectroscopic experiments. I have considerable experience working with undergraduate students in my lab. Over the last few years,  25 undergraduate students worked in my research lab. Undergraduate researchers in my lab have been co-authors on over 150 articles, with 10 of them serving as the first author on the paper.  Several of them have achieved Beckman Scholar awards, Astronaut Fellowships, Goldwater Fellowships, USA Today College Awards, and NSF Predoctoral Fellowships.  Thus, I am deeply committed to undergraduate research. In addition, 11 students who were in the lab as part of our summer research program decided to attend graduate school.  Postdoctoral researchers and graduate students typically help train undergraduates in the lab; therefore, they receive important experience in mentoring. \n\nSix undergraduate students from underrepresented groups worked on this research project over the last few years, including two NSF REU students.  Two African American students, one Native American, a Hispanic undergraduate student, and numerous women are working in my lab on this project.  Finally, a female undergraduate student received the Astronaut Fellowship working on this project.  The DUOS program has been a big success at Miami University.  33 undergraduate/graduate teams participated in the DUOS program over the last three years.  Two of them were in the Lorigan lab.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/15/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gary A Lorigan"
