 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funding is requested for Ship Operations support for the Research Vessel Atlantic Explorer for the period from 2018 with a five-year budget until the end of 2022.\r\n\r\nR/V Atlantic Explorer is a general-purpose research ship owned and operated by the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS) and is part of the Academic Research Fleet (ARF). BIOS is a U.S. 501 (c) 3 and 509 (a) not-for profit research and educational institution incorporated in the state of New York, and geographically located on the island of Bermuda. The mission of the ship is to support funded science research. RV Atlantic Explorer has 204 days funded in 2018. \r\n\r\nThis proposal supports scientific users of R/V Atlantic Explorer, and primarily NSF funded research projects. The major research projects that use  R/V Atlantic Explorer are oceanographic time-series efforts, ancillary users of the ship conducting independent and collaborative research through opportunities provided to sample the deep ocean, and independent users of the ship undertaking research in the North Atlantic Ocean. R/V Atlantic Explorer supports scientific research and technology development that improves scientific knowledge of societal relevant environmental issues. The oceanographic time- series and other scientific research programs directly contribute to improved understanding of such global issues as: (1) global climate change; (2) the complex interaction and feedback between climate phenomena, global warming, ocean biogeochemistry and ecosystem variability and health; (3) ocean warming, stratification, and ocean deoxygenation; and, (4) the variability of greenhouse gases such as CO2, the exchange of CO2 between ocean and atmosphere, variability of carbon sources and sinks, and ocean acidification. The mission of the ship is to support funded science research. The vessel is scheduled for 204 days at sea in 2018. These days are primarily in support of National Science Foundation funded science. R/V Atlantic Explorer will support scientific research in the oligotrophic subtropical gyre of the North Atlantic Ocean. This region is an important modulator of the oceanic cycling of biogeochemical (N, P) and radiatively important elements (e.g., CO2), air-sea heat and salt transport as well as climate. The ease of access to these deep waters has allowed R/V Atlantic Explorer to significantly contribute to national efforts to improve our understanding of ocean processes. Three nationally and internationally important oceanographic time-series programs have and will be supported by R/V Atlantic Explorer operations, including: (1) Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) research program begun in 1988; (2) Hydrostation S research program begun in 1954, and; (3) Ocean Flux Program (OFP) begun in 1978\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The ship has been outfitted to support three major science functions, including: Time Series programs located in the Sargasso Sea; general oceanographic research in the North Atlantic Ocean; and deep-sea mooring deployment and recovery. BIOS was previously known as the Bermuda Biological Station for Research (BBSR).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDuring the last 6 years, the vessel has participated in 196 oceanographic cruises amounting to 1,129 days at and 934 dockside logistical days. During that time BIOS / ASU hosted cruises supporting the Office of Naval Research (ONR), Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS), and the National Science Foundation (NSF). R/V Atlantic Explorer is highly valued by the scientific community.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nBermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS), Inc., is a US nonprofit marine science research and education institute located in St. Georges, Bermuda. BIOS research programs investigate the role of the ocean in global climate, health of coral reefs and international collaborative efforts beyond Bermuda waters. Bermudas unique location allows researchers to better access the deep ocean, furthering our understanding of the biological, chemical and physical processes that underpin the oceans role in planet systems. BIOS owns and operates R/V Atlantic Explorer which is equipped with\r\n\n\nnavigation, laboratory, technical systems and equipment that is instrumental in servicing sponsored research. Our location in the mid-Atlantic provides a perfect location for rapid response operations in the area. It is not unusual for R/V Atlantic Explorer to be called upon to retrieve expensive scientific equipment that has gone adrift due to weather or malfunction.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDuring the last 6 years BIOS and Ship Operations have supported scientific research in the oligotrophic subtropical gyre of the North Atlantic Ocean. This region is an important modulator of the oceanic cycling of biogeochemical (N, P) and radiatively important elements (e.g., CO2), air-sea heat and salt transport as well as attempting to understand ocean systems. The ease of access to these deep waters has allowed R/V Atlantic Explorer to significantly contribute to national efforts to improve our understanding of ocean processes. Three nationally and internationally important oceanographic time-series programs have and will be supported by R/V Atlantic Explorer operations, including: (1) Bermuda Atlantic Timeseries Study (BATS) research program begun in 1988; (2) Hydrostation S research program begun in 1954, and; (3) Ocean Flux Program (OFP) begun in 1978.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nOf these time-series, the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) that began in 1988, is now in its 36th year of operation, and located approximately 80 km southeast of the island of Bermuda.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe BATS project is one of the two ocean time-series projects funded by NSF (originally in the context of the U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Study). Long-term time-series oceanographic studies at BATS (64 days R/V Atlantic Explorer in 2010) and sister station ALOHA off Hawaii have allowed investigation of subtle habitat changes, irregularly spaced stochastic events and complex interdependent ecological phenomena that affect biogeochemical cycles. BATS and ALOHA are increasingly important observatories for capturing unpredictable, larger-scale and\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe Hydrostation S sampling program has been conducted at roughly biweekly intervals for the past 64 years (since 1954 with 26 ship days each year from 2022 to 2027). This is the longest continuously running ocean time-series program in the world. This long-term record has proved to be immensely valuable, showing a clear increase in sub-surface temperatures of nearly 1C over the past half century, ocean acidification and ocean deoxygenation.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAnother important time series program in the waters near Bermuda is the Ocean Flux Program (OFP), begun by Dr. Werner Deuser (WHOI) in 1978 and continued by Dr. Maureen Conte (MBL/BIOS). This program, measuring the sinking flux of particles at several depths below 500 m, has been ongoing for three decades. In conjunction with the surface tethered particle interceptor traps (PITS) that are deployed monthly at BATS, there is a one-of-a-kind dataset on particle fluxes in the Sargasso Sea.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nEvaluating the scientific impact of BATS, Hydrostation S and the R/V Atlantic Explorer. As of December 2023, nearly 800 peer-reviewed papers have been published using data collected from the R/V Atlantic Explorer, with substantive contributions of BATS and Hydrostation S data have been published over the past thirty years with publication of approximately 40 papers on average each year. Using Google Scholar, these 800 papers have been cited in the literature over 100,000 times, and the h-index and i-10 number for the BATS project, for example, are 160 and 680, respectively. Papers with BATS data have been cited approximately 4,500 to 6,000 times each year during the past five years, for example.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/18/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MurrayAStein\n"
