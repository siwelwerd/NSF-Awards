 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical\r\n\r\nOptical frequency combs are a revolutionary form of broadband light consisting of a large number of colors that are precisely spaced in frequency. Since their development in the early part of the new century, optical combs have enabled remarkable advances in precision measurement of time and frequency, which are critical to position and inertial guidance, and in high-speed spectroscopy useful for applications such as environmental sensing and breath analysis. However, these combs are generated from specialized lasers, which are rather bulky, which still hinders their deployment for many real world applications. Furthermore, the pulses they emit are limited to relatively low repetition rates.  Substantially higher repetition rates are needed for other promising applications, such as optical communications, photonics-based radio-frequency signal processing, and calibration of certain astronomical instruments.  More recently, a new choice for generating optical frequency combs has emerged, based on the interaction of light with tiny \"microresonator\" structures on integrated photonic chips.  These microresonator-based comb generators are fundamentally very small, which offers new opportunities for low cost deployment, and provide much higher repetition rate, which offers compatibility with new applications.  Research at Purdue University will explore methods to overcome challenges in guiding the optical combs generated from microresonators into stable and repeatable low-noise states desirable for applications and will provide advanced training to students at the graduate and undergraduate level relevant to careers in high technology and science.\r\n\r\nTechnical\r\n\r\nContinuous-wave pumping of a high quality factor microresonator can give rise to formation of combs of optical frequencies spaced by tens to hundreds of GHz.  Such combs arise due to nonlinear wave mixing mediated by the optical Kerr effect and are frequently termed Kerr combs.  In a particularly interesting state, the comb comprises cavity solitons (more formally called dissipative Kerr solitons), ultrashort pulses of light that propagate in the microresonator with remarkable stability, thanks to a double balance between loss and parametric gain and between dispersion and nonlinearity.  However, controlling the nonlinear dynamics to achieve the desired stable states of operation is complex.  One complication is that the comb evolves through a chaotic regime before it potentially switches into a stable cavity soliton state; the passage through chaos leads to strong indeterminacy in the state generated.  Competition with thermo-optic nonlinearities that are exacerbated by power transients that occur upon transition into the soliton state cause further challenges.  Although progress has been made, control strategies to deal with these issues are particularly challenging for desirable chip-scale microresonator devices.  This project proposes to explore two new approaches to guiding the evolution of the comb to desired states, including single soliton states, within the rich, nonlinear dynamical phase space.  One approach investigates the idea of a so-called chaos-avoiding trajectory involving coordinated manipulation of pump laser power and frequency to reach stable soliton states without passing through the chaotic operating regime usually encountered.  A second complementary approach will explore a recently proposed passive scheme toward obtaining single solitons based on mode interactions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit:\n\nOptical frequency combs consist of hundreds or thousands of distinct, equally spaced optical frequencies.  First demonstrated using short pulse lasers roughly 20 years ago, combs have delivered revolutionary scientific advances in areas such as precision frequency and timing measurements.  However, the size and complexity of such laser-based combs limit their widespread use outside the laboratory.  An alternative approach for generating frequency combs relies on nonlinear optics in integrated optical microresonators.  The compact, chip-scale nature of such combs offers promise to enable exploitation of frequency combs for a much broader set of applications.  However, such microresonator-based combs presented new challenges, such as low optical power and efficiency and difficulty in attaining desirable stable, low noise operating conditions.  In this project we collaborated with researchers at University of Maryland Baltimore County to explain why it is difficult to access desirable comb states deterministically and to analyze control schemes that would avoid states with high noise.  We also participated in a study that refines our understanding of the relative power efficiency in two different low noise comb states, referred to as soliton combs and dark pulse combs (the latter - discovered at Purdue in previous research - offers significantly higher power), and explored new nonlinear physics associated with the dark pulses.  Later in this project we turned our attention to system applications of microresonator-based combs, including analog fiber optic communication links and photonic-assisted down-conversion of broadband radio-frequency (RF) signals.  Finally, we proposed and analyzed a modification of the microresonators which enables a new functionality which we term spectral compression, which may be important for interfacing quantum light sources with quantum memories in quantum networks.\n\nBroader Impact:\n\n Advances in microresonator-based combs may help to move a variety of comb-based applications out of the laboratory, including high precision time transfer, environmental sensing, precision ranging, low noise microwave generation, and RF signal processing.   Our group has been especially active in applications of Kerr combs in RF photonics for analog signal transmission and signal processing, as well as for digital lightwave communications.   We are also now collaborating on application of Kerr combs for read-out of chip-scale atomic clocks, with potential impact to precision navigation and timing, and for down-conversion and sampling of RF signals, with potential impact to enhanced use of the radio spectrum.\n\n The work performed under this grant provided training, through active participation in cutting edge research, in state-of-the-art photonic technologies and instrumentation.
