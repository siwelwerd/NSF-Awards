 "awd_abstract_narration": "New technologies that exploit quantum mechanical phenomena promise transformative advances in communication, storage, and processing of information compared to what is possible with currently available, classical systems. While many proof of principle advances have been demonstrated in research laboratories, quantum phenomena are inherently fragile, and developing reliable systems for real world applications is one of the major challenges in the field. This research program will integrate state-of-the-art optical fabrication technologies with laser cooled atoms to develop compact and robust devices that couple atomic quantum memories to optical photons for secure quantum communication. Similar technologies will be used to couple populations of molecules. The research program will thereby advance the progress of quantum science, while enabling new technologies for secure communication systems and quantum chemistry of benefit to government and industrial sectors. Research and education activities supported by this NSF award will contribute to workforce training for quantum technologies and development of course material that will enhance the participation of under-represented groups in science and technology.\r\n\r\nThis project will advance the state of the art of photonic technologies used for quantum science by targeting two specific applications. The group will design, fabricate, and test an integrated photonic device containing planar metaoptics, optical gratings, and high finesse fiber optic resonators in order to implement a functional, and pre-aligned module for atomic memory enhanced quantum key distribution. The research will advance the state of the art in integrated photonics for atomic experiments and demonstrate new capabilities for quantum cryptography and communication. In addition the group will use the fiber resonators for studies of condensed phase molecular spectroscopy and reactivity in the regime of strong coupling.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
