 "awd_abstract_narration": "The near surface atmosphere over West Antarctica is one of the fastest warming locations on the planet. This atmospheric warming, along with oceanic forcing, is contributing to ice sheet melt and hence rising global sea levels. An observational campaign, focused on the atmospheric boundary layer over the West Antarctic ice sheet, is envisioned. A robust set of year-round, autonomous, atmospheric and surface measurements, will be made using an instrumented 30-m tall tower at the West Antarctic ice sheet divide field camp. An additional unmanned aerial system field campaign will be conducted during the second year of this project and will supplement the West Antarctic ice sheet tall tower observations by sampling the depths of the boundary layer.\r\n\r\nThe broader subject of the Antarctic ABL clearly supports a range of research activities ranging from the physics of turbulent mixing, its parameterization and constraints on meteorological forecasts, and even  climatological effects, such as surface mass and energy balances. With the coming of the Thwaites WAIS program, a suite of metrological observables would be a welcome addition to the joint NSF/NERC (UK) Thwaites field campaigns. The meteorologists of this proposal have pioneered 30-m tall tower (TT) and unmanned aerial system (UAS) development in the Antarctic, and are well positioned to successfully carry out  and analyze this work. In turn, the potential for these observations to advance our understanding of how the atmosphere exchanges heat with the ice sheet is high.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
