 "awd_abstract_narration": "The scientific goal of this project is to deepen understanding of so-called high-L Rydberg states of atoms, or atomic states with high angular momentum. These are hydrogen-like states in which one electron is excited quite close to the ionization threshold. These states are very fragile, and easily perturbed by surrounding electric and magnetic fields; such Rydberg atoms interact strongly with other particles due to their large spatial volume. These states contrast with the low-angular momentum (low-L) states that are easily accessible in the lab by laser excitation from the ground state, and which have been studied extensively.  The less studied high-angular momentum (high-L) Rydberg states have unique advantages and pose certain challenges to both experimental and theoretical approaches. They are important due to the role they play in key processes in a wide range of environments. For example, Rydberg states played a critical role in cosmology during the recombination era, shortly (approximately 200 thousand years) after the Big Bang. Rydberg atoms are also now being studied for potential use as building blocks in quantum computation, somewhat similar to the role that semiconductors play in classical computers. Indeed, both Rydberg atoms and semiconductors owe their value to their exceptional versatility, sensitivity to environment and ease of control. This project will involve undergraduate students from underrepresented communities, providing valuable experiences in theoretical atomic physics research through year-long active mentoring, and summer research programs.\r\n\r\nThis research makes progress in the following three specific science projects: (1) Calculate the rates for angular momentum mixing of Rydberg states in dilute plasmas, (2) Optimize and design pulse shapes that facilitate intrashell coherent population transfer among degenerate highly excited Rydberg states, and (3) Calculate cross sections and rate coefficients for electron spin changing collisions of Rydberg atoms. The common theme for the three aims is to expose the rich, undervalued physics qualities of high-L Rydberg states that emerge from the underlying SO(4) symmetry group of the degenerate hydrogenic shell states. The Hilbert space of problems involving Rydberg states is extremely large, so direct exact quantum mechanical solutions are often numerically difficult due to extreme fluctuations in the wave functions. This program proposes to use a dual quantum-classical strategy, in which results obtained from feasible quantum mechanical calculations for low enough n values are compared and extrapolated by using classical mechanics calculations, by virtue of the correspondence principle and the underlying symmetry. Since it acts at a rather fundamental level, this research program is favorable to engaging junior and senior undergraduate students in relevant research at the forefront of atomic and molecular physics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
