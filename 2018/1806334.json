 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to prepare reactants and control products on demand with quantum state precision is a long cherished goal in chemistry. This goal is increasingly becoming achievable thanks to the progress in recent years in cooling and trapping molecules and controlled manipulation of their interactions at temperatures close to absolute zero. The fundamental question of how chemical reactions proceed at a collision energy close to absolute zero can now be explored both by experiment and theory. Such controlled manipulation of atoms and molecules is an integral part of current research in quantum technologies, including quantum information processing and quantum computing. Theoretical studies of molecular encounters in this area face significant obstacles as computations become intractable when all relevant quantum states and external field effects are included. The goal of this NSF award is to develop and implement new methodologies to study ultracold chemical reactions with full quantum state resolution of both reactants and products. The research may lead to new computational programs capable of describing chemical reactions at ultracold temperatures. The research crosses disciplinary boundaries in diverse areas of chemistry, physics, and astrophysics and develops a highly skilled science and engineering workforce. \r\n\r\nAn ultimate goal in chemistry is the complete control of quantum states of both reactants and products with high selectivity and specificity.  The quantum state resolution applies both to the internal states of the molecules and the angular momentum partial waves involved in the collision process. Restricting partial waves requires reducing the collision energy to a kelvin or below for most molecular systems. Even in this regime, electronically non-adiabatic and geometric phase effects play an important role in governing the outcome of a chemical reaction. However, such processes remain largely unexplored in the utracold regime. The main goal of this NSF Award is to develop new methodologies and computer codes to study electronically non-adiabatic effects in chemical reactions at cold and ultracold temperatures.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
