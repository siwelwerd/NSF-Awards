 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nImproving the reliability of the electric power grid is one of the critical challenges facing the nation. To meet this challenge, we believe that the Intelligent Sensors and Analyzers  advanced technology proposed here can begin to transform our power grid and its affiliated microgrids to a Next-Generation-Smart-Grid. It could also enhance our power and energy sustainability and restorability in severely adverse weather conditions. It has the potential of starting a new revolution in creating intelligent Power Grid and Microgrids by extending todays microchip technology to integrated multi-sensing and information processing in a single compact device -- specialized for Power and Energy arena. Advanced sensor models integrated with Power Grid and Microgrids models will be developed for achieving the true potential of the intelligent sensors and analyzers (proposed herein) that would be deployable on a massive scale. The project will also promote teaching, training and learning in this key technology area. Specifically, the sensors, process-flow, and specialized microchip design activity of the project will be imported into the undergraduate senior-design projects. The project will also significantly benefit several graduate courses including a new course on Smart Power Grids, and existing courses on Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems II, and System on a Chip. The advances will be shared with the power and energy industry, government, and academia through a dedicated web site and, of course, through scientific publications.\r\n\r\nAs stated above, the goal of this project is to improve the reliability and restoration capability of wide area Power Grid as well as its affiliated Microgrids thereby reducing power outages and their cascade effects. Our solution is to embed novel intelligent sensors with distributed processing tools to provide real time monitoring and control of \"Power Grid as well as its affiliated Microgrids\" from transmission and distribution levels. The problems associated with the present lack of a real time intelligent infrastructure to monitor and control Power Grids -- on a massively distributed basis, have resulted in numerous blackouts and other serious inefficiencies. Our sensors/analyzers will provide accurate information to protective relays, enable intelligent islanding, a means by which the modeling of loads can be based upon accurate measured data rather than estimated data, for load shedding plans. The unique sensor architecture, fabrication, and signal processing issues will be addressed through an advanced Heterogeneous Sensor System on a Chip. As just stated, included will be Microgrids, in which the focus will be on islanding and restoration, sensors, estimation of key variables (frequency, phase and amplitude -- for harmonics as well when desired), defect and fault tolerance, thereby reliability improvement. Microgrids incorporate renewable energy sources, among others. System on a Chip based sensors can provide effective, real-time monitoring and control  that is self-healing, for such sources. In short, the main objectives are the following: (1) Multi-Sensor (including Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems) design, fab, and test, (2) Intelligence: analog and digital sections design, fab, test (for \"Power Grid and Microgrids\"), (3) Power Grid and Microgrids objectives: Fault detection, islanding, active & reactive power estimation, theoretical models & simulations, (4) Final Heterogeneous System on a Chip design, fabrication, tests; Also, tests in our Smart Grid Lab.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
