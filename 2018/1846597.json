This project develops a framework for achieving the following key objectives: 1) Increase the number and yield of bachelor's degrees Historically Black Colleges and Universities award in computer and information science and related fields, 2) Increase the readiness of Historically Black Colleges and Universities' science, technology, engineering and math graduates for tech workforce and tech job creation, 3) Increase the number of African American computer and information science doctoral students at all U.S. doctoral programs from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (undergrad degree), and 4) Increase the institutional capacity - including research and development - of Historically Black Colleges and Universities to achieve the above stated goals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
