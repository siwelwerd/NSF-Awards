 "awd_abstract_narration": "To meet pressing societal needs for more cost-effective and sustainable energy, future combustion engines need to be more fuel-efficient, produce less emissions, and operate on a variety of fuels, including alternative fuels.  Engineers often use computer models of fuel combustion chemistry to design engines with improved performance and determine the suitability of a certain fuel in an engine. In producing combustion models for engineers to use, scientists usually start by creating a trial model, then generate computational and experimental data to test the model, and improve and validate the model against the data. The latter two tasks are often repeated until the resulting model is sufficiently accurate for reliable use. Present techniques for developing reliable, validated models for transportation-relevant fuels typically involve combining the efforts of multiple research groups, taking multiple years or even decades to obtain enough data. The present approach for developing fuel combustion chemistry models is insufficient to address pressing energy needs in a timely and effective manner, particularly as many potential modern fuels have not been well characterized. This project will create and test the performance of a new autonomous system that creates trial models, generates data, and makes model improvements to rapidly converge on a reliable, validated, fuel chemistry model. Successful implementation of the novel autonomous system will provide an advanced model development tool for combustion kinetics and an accelerated means of understanding the oxidation behavior of the many alternative fuels, which governs their viability.  Finally, this project will engage undergraduate and graduate students in research and create novel teaching modules for data science applied to combustion kinetics. The modules will enhance proficiency of younger generations of students in the scripting and data science tools necessary to ensuring a competitive STEM program in the U.S.\r\n\r\nThe technical objective of this project is to create an autonomous system for studying fuel oxidation chemistry and evaluate its performance relative to current time-intensive approaches.  This autonomous system will use a multi-physics uncertainty quantification framework, MultiScale Informatics, to integrate an automated kinetic model construction platform, Reaction Mechanism Generator, an adaptable automated High-Throughput Jet Stirred Reactor experiment, and an algorithm for performing automated quantum chemistry, statistical thermodynamics, and transition state theory calculations (AutoTST). By linking the uncertainties both in experimental observables in the Jet Stirred Reactor and in Quantities of Interest, such as onset of ignition in an engine, to physically meaningful parameters in the kinetic model, such as barrier heights of a reaction, calculations and experiments can be optimally designed to improve the model?s accuracy for predicting Quantities of Interest. This project seeks to (1) create the autonomous platform, (2) use it to generate a model for n-heptane, for which previous data and models are relatively mature, to assess its performance, and (3) apply it to diisobutylene, a promising biofuel recently identified in the DOE?s Co-Optima program. This project will create a new data-driven approach for combustion research at an accelerated pace, contribute to scientific understanding for n-heptane and diisobutylene, and, more broadly, contribute to understanding of autonomous science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe chemical processes involved in fuel oxidation are dauntingly complex.  Consequently, the most reliable models for oxidation of a particular fuel often result from a culmination of extensive efforts from computational modelers, theoreticians, and experimentalists spanning multiple years or even decades.  In most successful cases, the model, once created, undergoes a repeated process to refine it, involving selecting what data are useful, generating such data experimentally or computationally, and integrating these data into improved models.  Autonomous systems that replicate this process (or elements of it) could significantly accelerate the pace of scientific inquiry of alternative fuels and reduce the amount of human effort (and cost) needed.\n\nThis collaborative project made several important advancements in such autonomous systems for scientific inquiry, where the selection of the most useful new data to generate and their integration into improved models is accomplished within an uncertainty quantification framework.  Our collaborators developed autonomous methods to create models based on computational data with uncertainty estimates, perform theoretical calculations to generate new computational data, and to link the two in a workflow that creates a model and refines it computationally.  This portion of the project focused on computational methods to choose the most useful experiments to perform, a computer-controlled experimental platform to conduct those experiments, a code to retrieve and post-process the experimental data into a structured file format, and multiscale uncertainty quantification methods for integration of experimental data (and theoretical data) into improved models.\n\nThe backbone of the new semi-autonomous experimental platform was a novel high-throughput jet-stirred reactor (HT-JSR), whose operation is entirely computer controlled.   Furthermore, the HT-JSR can measure dozens of species within minutes to achieve a high data generation rate; it also can prepare mixtures of up to ten distinct reactants to achieve high information content per experiment by sensitizing specific chemical pathways via diverse mixtures.  This project also involved substantial characterization of the uncertainties in HT-JSR experiments to aid in optimal selection of experiments to perform and automated post-processing of the data into improved models.  Using these rigorously characterized uncertainties, we created a new uncertainty-guided design of experiments procedure that accounts for realistic uncertainties in both the experimental conditions and the measurements in identifying the experiments that most improve predictions of a desired quantity of interest; we also wrote a code to retrieve experimental data directly from the instruments, post-process the measurements and associated meta-data, quantify the associated uncertainties, and produce human-and-computer-readable YAML files using a new format developed in this project.\n\nOur multiscale uncertainty quantification software, MultiScale Informatics (MSI), was extended in terms of its flexibility, user-friendliness, and capabilities.  We made MSI a python package, which enables our new design of experiments module to call specific modules within MSI and, more generally, makes the code easier to install and use.  We also created and integrated a new software module to encode physical models for the JSR within our MSI codes.  This new module enables MSI to read in YAML files containing experimental JSR data and associated uncertainties, make model predictions of the experimental observables with quantified uncertainties, and improve the model via optimization and uncertainty quantification.  Additionally, we created new methods for quantifying uncertainties (due to unspecified third-body efficiencies in reaction rate constants) that were not considered in previous methods for optimization and uncertainty quantification.\n\nThe new semi-autonomous experimental platform and its integration with data-driven computational approaches serve as a template for experimentation in the data age. The improvements in user-friendliness and capabilities of the MultiScale Informatics code will lead to better integration of experimental and computational data for chemical kinetics.  The research results, tools, and workflows will lead to improved combustion kinetic mechanisms for use in computational tools for the design of future engines with higher fuel economies and lower emissions---addressing pressing societal needs for more affordable energy generation, reduced environmental impacts, and better air quality.  The training and involvement of students in research and integration of current research topics and computational methods into the mechanical engineering curriculum at Columbia serve to develop the next generation of scientists, engineers, and computer scientists.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/12/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael P Burke"
