 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this Baja Basins International Research Experiences for Students (Baja Basins IRES) project is for undergraduate student participants to develop skills in conducting and communicating scientific research, to utilize an integrative field and lab research approach using digital technology and modern analytical lab equipment, and to learn international cooperation by collaborating side-by-side with Mexican students, professors, and mining professionals to address research questions on the tectonic evolution of  economically important rift margin basins in Baja California Sur, Mexico. Each year of this three-year program, a cohort of ten undergraduate students will be hosted by Minera Boleo mine for four weeks in January in Baja California Sur, Mexico. Students will conduct geologic fieldwork in topical groups (basin analysis, volcanology, neotectonics, and mineralogy) that will be co-mentored by Mexican and U.S. faculty. Field samples will be sent for geochemical, petrographic, and geochronological analyses. Then in July of the same year, Baja Basins IRES students will reconvene for collaborative lab work and data analyses at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. This will culminate in preparation of student abstracts and poster displays for a local symposium.  Clear educational outcomes and career goals will be measured by appropriate assessment strategies. We will recruit junior undergraduate geoscience majors both nationally and regionally near our home institutions, as this will facilitate the participation of under-represented minority, first-time college, and veteran students who often remain close to their hometown when pursuing higher education. Our collaboration with Mexican colleagues and mining professionals, and the international nature of the fieldwork will provide an unparalleled avenue for cultural enrichment for the students as well as an experience in global cooperation that will be invaluable for a student's future success in an increasingly global workforce and economy.\r\n\r\nThe Baja Basins International Research Experiences for Students (Baja Basins IRES) project will provide ten undergraduate student a year with the opportunity to investigate basins located along the central Gulf of California rift in Baja California Sur Mexico, an area that has not been thoroughly mapped within the framework of tectonics and thus provides an excellent field location to study the progressive evolution of a rifted continental margin and its unique continued magmatic activity and economic mineralization. The young geologic age of the sedimentary basins, excellent exposures, and field access, as well as sedimentary fill with numerous tuffs and uplifted terraces dateable by radiometric and OSL methods, make it ideal for resolving the rates of development of structures and resulting depositional systems. This Baja Basins IRES program will provide students with an unprecedented opportunity to collaborate internationally with mentors from our partner universities in Mexico (Universidad Autonoma de Baja California Sur and Universidad de Guanajuato) and several mining companies. Students will develop field and laboratory skills in basin analysis and tectonics in a volcanic-sedimentary sequence that is geologically interesting, economically important, and culturally diverse.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Few places in the world expose volcanic and marine sedimentary sequences and large uplifted Quaternary terraces that can be used to understand the processes involved in the progressive stages of continental breakup. Because of the rapid tectonic motion in the Gulf of California rift, the Santa Rosal&iacute;a basin area is a site where the stratigraphic history and processes of deformation can be studied in detail with exceptional exposures and accessible outcrops. Student research has advanced structural and depositional models for copper- and gypsum-enriched basins, quantified tectonic uplift and fluvial incision rates, and mapped new areas that will improve our understanding of the regional tectonics. The Baja Basins IRES program ran for three years (2019, 2020, 2022) and had 32 US and 7 Mexican undergraduate student participants that were led by eight faculty and seven graduate student mentors. The program has increased both the number of women (21) and under-represented minorities (10) conducting research. The program resulted in 14 student-authored presentations at the Geological Society of America meetings. Our Baja Basins IRES program also brings diversity to the face of our role models with three Hispanic and four women faculty mentors/project leaders. Our collaboration with colleagues at Minera Boleo, Carbomex, and Comsa mining companies and the international nature of the fieldwork provide an unparalleled avenue for cultural enrichment for the students as well as an experience in global cooperation that will be invaluable for a student&rsquo;s future success in an increasingly global workforce and economy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/09/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Tina&nbsp;M&nbsp;Niemi</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1827180/1827180_10569526_1683654395564_Bajadrillrig--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1827180/1827180_10569526_1683654395564_Bajadrillrig--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Students at a drill rig\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1827180/1827180_10569526_1683654395564_Bajadrillrig--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Students at a drill rig\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Field trip to an exploration drill site on Minera Boleo mine property in Santa Rosalia, Baja California, M\ufffdxico</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tina Niemi</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Tina&nbsp;M&nbsp;Niemi</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Students at a drill rig</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1827180/1827180_10569526_1683654704020_StudentsatGSA--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1827180/1827180_10569526_1683654704020_StudentsatGSA--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Students Presenting Posters\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1827180/1827180_10569526_1683654704020_StudentsatGSA--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Students Presenting Posters\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">In October 2022, Baja Basin students presented posters at the annual meeting of the Geological Society of American in Denver, CO.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tina Niemi</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Tina&nbsp;M&nbsp;Niemi</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Students Presenting Posters</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1827180/1827180_10569526_1683655017808_IMG_20200107_130226507_BURST000_COVER_TOP--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1827180/1827180_10569526_1683655017808_IMG_20200107_130226507_BURST000_COVER_TOP--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Students at the gypsum mine\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1827180/1827180_10569526_1683655017808_IMG_20200107_130226507_BURST000_COVER_TOP--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Students at the gypsum mine\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students get instructions from a mining engineer at the Comsa gypsum mine on San Marcos Island, Baja California Sur, M\ufffdxico</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tina Niemi</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Tina&nbsp;M&nbsp;Niemi</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Students at the gypsum mine</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
