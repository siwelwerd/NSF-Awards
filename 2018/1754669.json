 "awd_abstract_narration": "How and why do new species evolve?  How and why do complex organs, like eyes, evolve?  These phenomena happen on time scales much longer than our lives, making it difficult for us to understand how they happened.  Species are defined by being distinct from and not breeding with each other.  Not interbreeding could be a simple matter of when, where or who you choose to mate with.  It could also be caused by a failure to produce offspring that can survive and reproduce.  Species today are often kept separate from one another by multiple mechanisms, so we do not know how they evolved in the first place.  Likewise, complex organs are like machines with many parts that must all be present and well integrated if the machine is to work, but how did this complexity arise?  In each case, nature most often presents us with end products without any clues about how they came about; however, sometimes nature provides groups of species that retain enough clues to these processes for one to be able to study how they occur, as in the case of this research program.   One impact of this work pertains to the complex organ that is studied.  These investigators are studying the evolution of placentas and are doing so in a context in which they can compare species with placentas with close relatives who lack placentas or have less complex placentas.  This diversity enables them to address the consequences of having a placenta, including how it affects fertility. The research will enhance the training of students at multiple levels (high school, college, and post-graduate) as well as provide outreach to the public.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research combines work done at two levels of resolution. First, the investigators will work on all species in the fish family Poeciliidae, enabling them to define the timing and order of evolutionary changes.   Second, they will perform experiments on individual species within the family to characterize the mechanisms that cause evolution. They will sequence whole genomes then use the DNA sequences to reconstruct the family tree.  They will characterize the biology of every species on the tree, including how females provision their young and how males and females choose who to mate with.  These fish all bear live young, but some fully provision eggs before they are fertilized while others continue to provision eggs after fertilization.  The latter group has the functional equivalent of a mammalian placenta, but species vary in how well the placenta is developed and how much they provision young during development.  Species also differ in how they choose mates, with some having males with elaborate ornamentation and courtship displays and others with no sex differences in coloration and no courtship.  The integration of biology with the family tree is what will enable the investigators to infer when and in what order female provisioning and aspects of mate choice evolved.  It is also possible to test whether the evolution of certain traits is associated with an acceleration or deceleration of how fast new species are formed.  It will then be possible to test predictions derived from evolutionary theory for how the evolution of these traits are inter-related with one another.  The family tree also enables the investigators to identify closely related species that differ in the presence or absence of placentas.  These species pairs become the subjects of experiments in which they will perform more detailed studies of the biology of reproductive isolation, including assessments of multiple mating and the rate of evolution of reproductive isolation.  The integration of work done at both levels will enable the investigators to detail how mating systems and mode of reproduction affect the evolution of reproductive isolation, how these different facets of speciation have interacted to shape the evolution of species in the family and how they affect the rate of speciation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nWe are studying the evolution of placental reproduction and some fundamentally important biological issues that come into play in association with the evolution of placentas. These include, sexual conflict, the origin of new species, the biological factors that affect the rate of speciation and how reproductive isolation contributes to speciation. Sexual conflict is caused by the differences between males and females and how those differences affect fitness, which is a composite measure of survival and reproductive success. Theory predicts that sexual conflict will play an important role in placental reproduction. These predictions are supported with circumstantial and some experimental evidence in mammals, including humans, where it can be one of the potential causes of problems with interfertility among couples.\r\n\n\nInvestigators have mostly used mammals to study placentation, but mammals are a poor choice if one wishes to study the evolution of placentas because all mammals inherited theirs from a single common ancestor that lived more than 180 million years ago. We can learn about how placentas work and evolved after their origin, but not about how they evolved in the first place nor assess the biological consequences of placentation. The live bearing fish family Poeciliidae are a better target because the functional equivalent of a placenta has evolved at least nine times and there are multiple clusters of closely related species that either do or do not have a placenta.\r\n\n\n The conceptual framework of our research is Zeh and Zehs viviparity driven conflict hypothesis. Their hypothesis was motivated by the way the evolution of the placenta changes when mothers provision offspring. Non-placental livebearers fully provision eggs before they are fertilized. Placental livebearers instead provide most resources after the egg is fertilized. Theory predicts that provisioning offspring after fertilization invokes conflict because it is under the control of both the mother and father, since the fathers genes are active in the developing embryo. The quantity of resources that it is in the best interest for the baby to receive from the mother is greater than is in the interest of the mother to provide to the baby, hence the conflict. Zeh and Zeh predict that this change will cause a shift from non-placental species choosing who to mate with to placental species mating with more males then choosing which sperm fertilize eggs and/or which eggs to provision after they are fertilized. They also predicted that one consequence of the constant tug of war between mother and offspring over resource allocation caused by the conflict would accelerate the evolution of post-mating reproductive isolation because of differences among populations in how the conflict was resolved. They predict that this will cause placental lineages to have a higher rate of speciation.\r\n\n\n We test these predictions at the level of differences among populations within a species and differences among species. Our within species experiments revealed that\n  1) females of placental species can choose which embryos to provision based on their genotype and that they discriminate against offspring sired by males from a different population\r\n\n\n 2) post-mating reproductive isolation evolves more rapidly in placental species than in closely related non-placental species\r\n\n\n We are in the process of quantifying rates of multiple paternity in placental versus non-placental species so that we can test the prediction that placental species\r\n\n\n Our comparisons among species revealed that:\r\n\n\n 1) male attributes associated with enticing females to choose to mate with them, including ornaments like enlarged fins, bright coloration and courtship displays, only evolved in lineages that do not have placentas,\r\n\n\n 2) the genomes of placental species reveal significantly less evidence of interspecific hybridization than non-placental species, which suggests stronger reproductive isolation, but\r\n\n\n 3) placental species have slower rates of speciation, which is contrary to Zeh and Zehs predictions. The highest rates of speciation are seen in those lineages of non-placental species with males that are ornamented, brightly colored and actively court females. This result, which has been replicated in other organisms, suggests that the evolution of female mate choice plays a stronger role in causing speciation than does the genetic compatibility of the mates and its effects on offspring quality.\r\n\n\n Our broader impacts include training four PhD students, engaging over 30 undergraduates in research, establishing a public outreach website and initiating citizen science projects with aquarium enthusiasts. We have given presentations to aquarium societies and at the annual conferences of the American Livebearers Association, published our research in peer reviewed journals, and given talks at universities and the annual conferences of research societies, like the Society for the Study of Evolution.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/19/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DavidNReznick\n"
