 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Christine Dunham from Emory University to investigate mechanisms to control protein expression with the goal of engineering proteins with diverse, non-natural chemical moieties. The translational machinery of cells is responsible for the incorporation in proteins of twenty-two amino acids.  For research and application purposes, the incorporation of non-naturally occurring amino acids is very important and has long been recognized as an important goal of synthetic biology. This represents a current technological challenge. The research in Dr. Dunham's lab develops a solution to this challenge that is based on the use of engineered molecules called transfer RNA (tRNAs). The research in her lab is a training ground for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, who acquire interdisciplinary scientific skills at the interface between biology and chemistry. This project is also integrated into an outreach program whose mission is to raise the interest of high school students in STEM, to train these students to become independent thinkers, and to help create a diverse STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThe question of how to manipulate the ribosome to express proteins containing one or more novel chemical moieties is an important synthetic biology puzzle. The realization that the genetic code is not immutable and that recoding events could occur has attracted the interest of many chemical biologists. The major limitations of previous approaches to solve this puzzle include cross-reactivity with host translation machinery and low incorporation of engineered molecules on the ribosome due to competition with endogenous tRNAs. This proposal centers on expanding the coding capacity of tRNAs using the novel and innovative strategy of rational, structure-based redesign of frameshift suppressor tRNAs and biochemical and structural biology approaches. Information from this study provides new insights into the regulation of protein synthesis, a topic critically important to a broad biomolecular and synthetic biology research community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our results in this funding period reconcile a long-standing question regarding the importance of chemical modifications of key molecules in this process and their role in distinguishing correct from incorrect pairing during protein synthesis. We further expand these studies from normal molecules involved in this process to mutant ones known to cause changes in the genetic code. This work impacts multiple scientific disciplines by establishing that this approach may allow us to engineer the genetic code in diverse ways.</p>\n<p>We first tested the dependency of a simple chemical 1-methyl modification located in tRNAs at position 37 in the anticodon stem loop. Using kinetic assays, we determined that the tRNA<sup>Pro</sup> isoacceptors require the m<sup>1</sup>G37 modification for association to the decoding center while the m<sup>1</sup>G37 modification prevents association with a +1 slippery or four-nucleotide codon (Figure 1). We next engineered a frameshift suppressor of tRNA<sup>Pro</sup> called tRNA<sup>SufA6</sup>, using our knowledge of its function and structure. This mutation in the tRNA counterbalanced the strength of the pairing between the tRNA anticodon and the mRNA codon pair. We solved a high-resolution X-ray structure of this mutated frameshift suppressor tRNA bound to the decoding center of the ribosome and confirmed we stored the pairing (Figure 1). This work was published in the <em>Journal of Biological Chemistry (JBC)</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To determine if the rules we defined above could be applied to other tRNA<sup>Pro</sup> isoacceptors, we used single particle cryo-EM approaches to capture snapshots of tRNA<sup>Pro</sup> as the tRNA traverses the ribosome (Figure 2). We also considered the possibility that elongation factor P (EF-P) may be preventing the ability of the ribosome to frameshift. EF-P is recruited to the ribosome during the reading of poly-proline stretches and previously research revealed that EF-P can suppress +1 frameshift induced by tRNA<sup>Pro</sup>. Since EF-P is not essential in bacterial, one long term goal could then be to delete EF-P to increase the efficiency of nonnatural amino acid incorporation. To gain insight into EF-P?s role, we solve a single particle cryo-EM structure of EF-P bound to a tRNA<sup>Pro</sup> isoacceptor lacking m<sup>1</sup>G37, that is, a tRNA that undergoes frameshifting (Figure 3).</p>\n<p>The key outcomes of this work is that we understand the molecular basis for how tRNA<sup>Pro</sup> isoacceptors engages with a +1 slippery codon, how the dynamics of this interaction may provide insight into the ability of this tRNA to be more flexible and finally, determine how EF-P prevents +1 frameshifting likely by establishing close interactions with tRNA<sup>Pro</sup> lacking the m<sup>1</sup>G37 modification. Our results establish the molecular basis for how the cell adapts to nutrient deprivation resulting in the lack of tRNA modifications to prevent mRNA frameshifting by EF-P action. Taken together, the results significantly improve our understanding of how tRNA<sup>Pro</sup> isoacceptors lead to frameshifting events which we will exploit in attempting to circumvent quality control mechanisms for the incorporation of nonnatural amino acids.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/14/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Christine&nbsp;M&nbsp;Dunham</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1808771/1808771_10571689_1689367022809_Figure1-b--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1808771/1808771_10571689_1689367022809_Figure1-b--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1.
