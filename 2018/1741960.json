 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spokane Falls Community College (SFCC) will pursue the \"Engineering Scholarship Project\" to provide 36 undergraduate engineering students with scholarships and supporting activities that promote academic success. The project includes a collaboration with Eastern Washington University, which will recruit upper-class engineering students to serve as peer mentors for first-year community college students within the context of a year-long robotics design activity. Targeted scholarships integrated with a program of structured mentoring and student support activities aim to increase the number of students who persist and complete an engineering transfer degree at SFCC, and successfully transfer to a four-year institution. The project has the potential increase the diversity and availability of qualified engineers to meet regional workforce needs. \r\n\r\nThe project will generate new knowledge regarding evidence-based approaches to improving outcomes in community college engineering student persistence, completion, and transfer to baccalaureate-granting institutions. The Engineering Scholarship Project will develop and apply methods of systematic outreach to high schools to recruit academically motivated students and encourage them to enter undergraduate engineering programs at SFCC. Student cohorts will be supported for four years: they will complete their two-year engineering degree at SFCC and transfer to a four-year institution, where they will complete the additional requirements needed to earn a baccalaureate engineering degree.  Student success will be supported through curriculum pathways, faculty advising, peer student mentors, and supportive co-curricular activities. Evaluation results will be used to drive changes in practice and institutional culture that improve SFCC's future success in recruiting student in STEM, as well as support successful two-year degree completion and transfer.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\nSpokane Falls Community College Engineering Scholarship Project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Spokane Falls Community Colleges (SFCC) Engineering Scholarship Program aimed to encourage academically talented students to pursue a full-time education by providing scholarships and other types of support that would result in increased student retention, improved completion rates of degrees, and additional students transferring to four-year universities. The project had three primary objectives: 1) develop an outreach approach to recruit low-income, academically motivated students into an engineering transfer track, 2) guide student scholars to complete their Associate of Science in Engineering degree and successfully transfer to a four-year institution, and 3) develop sustainable practices to support underrepresented student cohorts in STEM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThroughout the grant, the outreach piece proved to be the most challenging. Prior to the pandemic, recruitment at regional high schools occurred through faculty visits, flyers, and communication with high school counselors. However, the pandemic focused the grant team to modify the outreach approach particularly pivoting to virtual bulletin boards, such as PeachJar, and informational sessions. The grant team learned many lessons from this experience that are appliable to future recruitment events across the science disciplines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe implementation of the guidance course served as the program's foundation of success. The structure fostered a cohort model among the scholars while also connecting them with their faculty advisor from day one of the program. Both the guidance course and the relationship with a faculty advisor were identified by scholars as pivotal components to their confidence in their educational journey and success in maintaining focus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe exploration of engineering avenues during the first quarter guidance course assisted scholars with selecting a focus area which generated strong educational plans for scholars to follow. SFCCs implementation of the Guided Pathways model added supportive pillars, as scholars not only had their faculty advisor to connect with but were part of a group-advising model. Further, scholars also had a Guided Pathways STEM Specialist who was available to assist with advising holds, pre-requisite requirements, and transfer questions. This multi-faceted approach to guiding and supporting students during the academic journey resulted in 16 scholars transferring to a local university for engineering with the remaining Cohort 4 scholars scheduled to graduate and transfer in Spring 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA significant component that the grant team identified is that the financial support paired with holistic advising resulted in a strong combination for the scholars. However, the scholars, particularly Cohorts 3 and 4, reported a decrease in the feeling of belonging and that situations outside of academics were causing challenges within the classroom. Based on this feedback, the grant team along with the science department chairs examined other avenues in which STEM students could be supported, including leveraging the work of the Math, Engineering, and Science Achievement (MESA) program as well as working with Student Affairs to address hunger, housing, and counseling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Engineering Scholars Program was implemented at SFCC during a time of transition at the college. SFCC began the work of Guided Pathways when the first Engineering Scholars cohort was onboarded and implemented various components of the Guided Pathways initiative from Cohort 2 through Cohort 4. Such components included but were not limited to six official pathways with multiple program maps to support students through their degree path, outcomes assessment model to align course and program learning outcomes, development and launch of a guidance course for all SFCC students, instructional program review, and the tracking of students through subplan codes in the student management system. As such, the Engineering program leveraged the work at the college to infuse the grant work into a sustainable model across the STEM pathway. Holistic advising, including group advising and transfer drop in-sessions, was expanded beyond the engineering program to include STEM students in other disciplines. The Division also strategically leveraged the MESA program to support those scholars who fulfilled the MESA criteria as well as to collaboratively design workshops and roundtable discussions for 2024-2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of the funding period, the program has supported 27 scholars. Although we saw significant decline in scholar applications for cohorts 3 and 4, perhaps due to the pandemic and the change in financial need for students, the program was a success for SFCC engineering students. STEM programs at SFCC will continue the work started during the grant. Moving forward, our intent is to develop a series of annual events that enhance the sense of belonging among STEM students while also continuing to build on the foundation of our STEM pathway with respect to support for quarterly retention and transfer. \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/27/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: SarahAMartin\n"
