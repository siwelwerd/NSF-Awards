 "awd_abstract_narration": "Support for this conference provides partial participant support for the 2018 NISS Writing Workshop for Junior Researchers held at the Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM) July 29 and 31, 2018 in Vancouver, BC, Canada.  These funds support a technical writing workshop for 24 junior researchers in statistics, biostatistics, and data science. The writing workshop will provide individual hands-on guidance and mentoring by recent journal editors on how to write journal articles and research funding proposals.  Junior researchers will apply to the workshop by June 1 by submitting a writing sample and will be notified of acceptance no later than June 20 after pairing applicants with eight senior editors.  Previous workshops have been very successful with many workshop participants going on to become associate editors or co-editors of major statistical journals.  More specifically, at least 23 associate editorships and one co-editorship are among the 109 recent graduates from 2007 to 2011.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom 2007 to 2016, NISS organized technical writing workshops for junior researchers in statistics, biostatistics and data science. The 2018 NISS writing workshop consists of two parts. The workshop will open with tutorial sessions on the organization of material for a technical article or a grant application, on techniques for technical writing, and on the specific objectives and audiences of key journals in the statistical sciences. Another session will cover journal specific information for deciding where to publish, and a panel of current and recent editors will discuss the differences among the key journals.  Important ethical issues will also be discussed, and issues of journal choice, and understanding and responding to reviewers' comments will be covered in the final session.   At the end of this part, each participant meets with their mentor who analyzed a draft paper the participant submitted prior to workshop and receives feedback and suggestions.  The second part focuses on the specific issues for participants whose native language is not English, covering the writing process and details of grammar, sentence structure and word choice.  A panel of senior researchers whose native language is not English will discuss their experiences with technical writing in English.  The website for the workshop is:  \r\nhttps://www.niss.org/events/2018-niss-writing-workshop-junior-researchers-jsm\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEach year from 2007 to 2016 NISS and ASA have conducted a technical writing workshop at JSM.  Later other societies joined this workshop as a co-sponsor in 2013 and following years.  NSF provides support for the participants\u2019 travel and partial housing expenses.  The workshop is designed for junior researchers to improve their scientific writing, in order to improve the dissemination of their scholarly work, while reducing the burden on editors and associate editors.  The 2018 Writing workshop was held on Sunday, July 29 and Tuesday, July 31, 2018, before and during the JSM held in Vancouver, BC, Canada.  \n\nWe advertised the 2018 writing workshop in the spring and received 29 applications, of which 26 qualified.  Each applicant submitted a writing sample to be reviewed.  Among the 26 applicants, 16 were female and 10 were male.  One applicant withdrew due to a family health issue, and three were not accepted based on their writing samples.   The remaining 22 were assigned to mentors and invited to participate.  The participants were all recent Ph.D. graduates in Statistics or Biostatistics, and 13 were females and 9 males.  Unfortunately, four could not attend, due to travel restrictions or visa difficulties, resulting in 10 females and 8 males.  Each participant was assigned to one of the 12 mentors, experienced current or past editors of statistical journals, or former NSF program officers. \n\nThe workshop began Sunday morning with lectures and tutorials by Nell Sedransk on organization, content, structure, and style. Other lectures by Edsel Pena provided information on how to decide where to publish, followed by a panel discussion with four current or former editors of the premier statistical journals, Xuming He, Hal Stern, David Rocke, and Lee Wilkinson.  Lunch provided the setting for mentors and junior researchers to meet and discuss the issues of good writing.  In the afternoon, Peter Imrey discussed the ethical issues in the context of reproducibility, authorship, giving credit and citations.  The final presentation by Keith Crank considered grant writing strategies and how to frame the proposal.  The day ended with meetings between the participants and their mentors, focusing on the writing sample each participant provided to the mentor in advance. \n\nOn Tuesday, the workshop emphasized the specific issues for participants whose native language is not English, covering the writing process and details of grammar, sentence structure and word choice.  A panel of senior researchers whose native language is not English, Ali Shojaie, Limin Peng, Gabriel Huerta, and Nicoleta Serban, discussed their experiences with technical writing in English, and their path to a successful career.\n\nAfter the workshop, participants were encouraged to continue their contact with their mentors and other participants to build a network of colleagues who can assist in their careers.\n\nMentors:  The mentors selected were those who planned to be available at JSM and included the following 12 former and current editors.  The mentors and participants met during the Sunday session, and at the end of the workshop.  The mentor-mentee pairs were also encouraged to continue their conversations during the JSM and the participants provided a corrected version of their writing sample after incorporating the suggestions. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n2018\n\n\n\nEntity\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Carone\n\n\n\nUniv of Washington\n\n\n\n\n\nNicole Lazar\n\n\n\nUniv of Georgia\n\n\n\n\n\nEdsel Pe&ntilde;a\n\n\n\nUniv of South Carolina\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Rocke\n\n\n\nUniv of California, Davis\n\n\n\n\n\nKeith Crank\n\n\n\nIndependent Consultant\n\n\n\n\n\nHal Stern\n\n\n\nUniv of California, Irvine\n\n\n\n\n\nSusan Ellenberg\n\n\n\nUniv of Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n\n\nXuming He\n\n\n\nUniv of Michigan\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Imrey\n\n\n\nCleveland Clinic\n\n\n\n\n\nLee Wilkinson\n\n\n\nH2O\n\n\n\n\n\nHeping Zhang\n\n\n\nYale Univ\n\n\n\n\n\nNell Sedransk\n\n\n\nNISS\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nBased on the feedback from the participants, the workshop was considered very beneficial. \n\nComments received from the Writing Workshop participants included the following:\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThank you so much for the great opportunity!\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks again for holding such a beneficial   workshop in JSM!!\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for organizing the writing workshop!
