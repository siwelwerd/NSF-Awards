 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organohalides are common environmental contaminants designated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency as priority pollutants due to their toxicity and prevalence in the environment. Cleaning up organohalide pollution is thus important for the protection of human health. Biochars (materials generated from high-temperature decomposition of organic matter) have unique surface properties that has led to interest in using them to clean up environmental contaminants. However, relatively little is known about the ability of biochar to stimulate the biological degradation of organohalides. In this project, researchers from three Universities will investigate how biochar can help enhance the cleanup of toxic organohalides in wastewater. The findings of the project will be tested and applied under real-world conditions through collaboration with wastewater treatment facilities. If successful, this research has the potential to create an inexpensive and effective treatment technology for the most important class of pollutants in the U.S.\r\n\r\nThis research will test the hypothesis that biochar can catalyze the microbial dehalogenation of emerging organohalides through accelerated extracellular electron transport. In this project, the team will: (1) quantify the biochar-catalyzed microbial degradation of organohalides and their degradation products by two pure cultures of known model bacteria; (2) study the effects of nano-sized biochar, lowest-valent biochar, and nano-sized lowest-valent biochar on biotic and abiotic dehalogenation; (3) analyze the degradation of organohalides by a natural microbial community in the presence of biochar and study this potential application for advanced wastewater treatment. This project will provide timely information for the biochar-catalyzed microbial degradation of emerging organohalides. Lowest-valent biochar and nano-sized lowest-valent biochar, as novel analogs to zero-valent iron and nano zero-valent iron, will be produced and studied for their role in the degradation of organohalides. The intellectual merit is derived from the novel understanding of the role biochar properties play in catalyzing the microbial reductive dehalogenation of organohalides. The project has the potential to create a cost-effective strategy for the treatment of organohalide-contaminated waters in the U.S. and other countries. By working with UNR's Dean's Future Scholars program and The North Star STEM Alliance program at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, the investigators will offer summer research internships for first-generation college-bound middle school students and underrepresented graduates in STEM fields to enhance awareness and knowledge of modern water quality problems and technological solutions. Research results will also be integrated into current undergraduate and graduate courses.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This study investigated the dehalogenation of a model organohalogen compound, triclosan (TCS), by aqueous biochars (a-BCs) (&lt; 450 nm). We found that TCS can be anaerobically degraded by reduced a-BCs, and the degradation rate of TCS correlated with the amount of a-BCs-bound electrons available for donation. Recovery of chlorine and detection of byproducts confirmed the reductive dehalogenation mediated by aqueous biochar. A mathematical model was&nbsp; developed for simulating the degradation of TCS, by accounting for all the possible reactions occurred in the presence of a-BCs, and could fit the time-dependent residual of TCS very well. Our results showcased that the reduced a-BCs can reductively degrade organohalogens, with potential applications for wastewater treatment and groundwater remediation. While TCS was used as a model compound in this study, a-BC-based degradation can be likely applied to a range of redox-sensitive trace organic compounds.For biochar-mediated reactions, quinones (QNs) and products of their redox reactions (i.e. hydroquinones (HQs) and semiquinones (SQs)) were suggested as important players, but direct evidence is limited. Reductive dehalogenation of TCS by 1,4-benzohydroquinone (BHQ) was studied. Degradation of TCS did not occur within the experimental period (up to 288 h) in the presence of BHQ only, but happened in the presence of BHQ and FeCl3 under the anoxic condition at pH 5 and 7 (above the pKa of BSQ, 4.1). The degradation of TCS was shut down in the presence of saturated dissolved oxygen. Kinetic simulation and thermodynamic calculation indicated that BSQ was responsible for the reductive degradation of TCS. The critical role of SQs in the reductive dehalogenation can be ubiquitous in natural and engineering systems based on the reported reduction potentials of QNs/SQs and SQs/HQs and supported by experiments with additional model hydroquinones (HQs).&nbsp;The chemical nature of quinones in biochars or similar environmental samples remains largely unknown although their importance in redox reactions have been claimed for decades. To concur this challenge, a quantification method was developed by coupling chemical tagging of quinones with cysteine-containing non-aromatic peptides (Cpep) through a Michael addition reaction, size exclusionary chromatography (SEC) separation, and ultraviolet (UV) analysis leveraging on the featured absorption of aromatic rings in quinones at 254 nm. The featured absorption of the peptide-quinone adducts was used to quantify model quinones, including 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ), 1,4-naphthoquinone (NQ), and 1,4-anthraquinones (AQ). Concentrations of quinones in water extractions of biochars, soils, and wildfire-derived ashes were determined. This method provided a novel rapid quantification of quinones in complex environmental media and opened a new avenue for studying the biogeochemical cycles of these important compounds.Overall, this project demonstrated the reactivity of aqueous biochar in degrading organohalogen and their potential use in the treatment of wastewater or remediation of contaminated water bodies. For the fundamental understanding for the reactive components of biochars, the critical roles of semiquinones were demonstrated in addition to the roles of hydroquinones and quinones, highlighting the importance of fully understanding the chemistry of natural quinones. For understanding the chemical nature of quinones in biochars and other complex environmental samples, a method for its quantification and identification was developed by coupling Michael addition reaction of quinones with cysteine-containing peptides and size exclusionary chromatography. The tagged results can also be potentially used to identify the chemical nature of quinones through consequent high resolution mass spectrometry analysis. This project outcome is also of great value for understanding the impact of wildfire on the watershed function, especially the redox biogeochemical reactions derived by wildfire and impacts on the mobilization of nutritional elements.The results were integrated into a NSF-supported IGE project to train first-year graduate students, especially from first-generation communities, for their understanding about chemical kinetics, statistical analysis and use of computation tools for analysis of datasets for different implications. This project was also incorporated into a NSF-supported RET project to disseminate the frontier research to local middle school/high school teachers so that the information can be used to educate next-generation students with context for sustainable energy development.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/29/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Yu&nbsp;Yang</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1804209/1804209_10582636_1675046639520_AqueousBiochar--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1804209/1804209_10582636_1675046639520_AqueousBiochar--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Aqueous biochar\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1804209/1804209_10582636_1675046639520_AqueousBiochar--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Aqueous biochar\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Aqueous biochar for reaction with pollutants</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Yu Yang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Yu&nbsp;Yang</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Aqueous biochar</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
