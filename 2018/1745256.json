In the years 2018 and 2019 the conference will take place on the campus of Washington and Lee University. Additional information about the conference can be found on the website https://votcam.wordpress.com/\r\n\r\nThe Virginia Operator Theory and Complex Analysis Meeting (VOTCAM) is an annual regional conference that has taken place since 1992. It brings together a diverse group of mathematicians whose primary research interest is in function theoretic operator theory and related areas. A sampling of the topics presented in the 2017 event is given by the following: quasidiagonality of C*-algebras, recovering topological spaces from continuous functions, von Neumann algebras determined by microstates, approximation properties and Banach spaces, commutators of singular integrals, and multipliers on spaces of functions. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.",
