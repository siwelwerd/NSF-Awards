 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fundamental to personality and social psychology is the premise that human behavior may be determined by the person, the situation, or a combination of both. While instruments for assessing the psychological characteristics of persons have been well developed, parallel instruments for situations have lagged far behind. Laboratory experiments have demonstrated that small changes in situations can create large change in behavior; however, the impact of real situations that people actually experience has rarely been investigated. The proposed research will fill these important gaps, and examine the nature of situational transitions, their antecedents, and their consequences in daily life. The results will afford a better understanding of the relationship between personality, situations, and behavior as they naturally occur. Moreover, the proposed research has the potential to be transformative by providing a template for investigating psychological processes in natural environments. \r\n\r\nTo address the study aims, the proposed research will capitalize on several recent methodological and technological advances. First, Ryne Sherman (Florida Atlantic University) and his colleagues have developed a psychometrically valid way to measure situations, which will be used in project. Second, it has been difficult to study real world situations due to a lack of technology for collecting information about situations as they are experienced in real time. This research will utilize advances in mobile sensing technology, which can visually capture the situations experienced by a participant. These images will later be rated by both participants and coders. Data analyses will examine associations among elements of situations, personality traits, and specific behaviors. The novel methodological approach developed in this project could be applied to other important questions, such as how naturally occurring situations affect outcomes such as aggression, relationship satisfaction, or well-being.",

This project systematically and simultaneously examined these two forces, with a focus on the yet largely unexamined characteristics of situations. To do so, this project used wearable photographic cameras to capture situations, behavior, and emotions as people experienced them in their daily lives. More than 300 participants wore a photographic camera on their shirt or blouse for a 24-hour period. The camera automatically took a still photo of the person?s surrounding environment every 30 seconds. Participants later reviewed these photos to recall the situations they experienced, described the psychological nature of those situations, as well as how they felt and behaved in those situations. Prior to this, participants completed personality questionnaires. Data from this project has thus far allowed us to understand how people transition from one situation to the next, how personality is related to the kinds of situations people encounter, and how people navigate situations in their daily life. Data analysis from this project continues at the time of this writing. In addition, as this was one of the first studies to use wearable cameras in psychological research, it permitted us to gain valuable insights into the methodological benefits and potential privacy risks associated with using wearable cameras for research. In general, we found that participants were quite comfortable wearing the cameras for research purposes, but precautions need to be put in place to ensure the privacy of bystanders is protected. The funding for this project supported three graduate students, all of whom received doctorates in psychology and are now employed in both private and public sector jobs. In addition, more than 30 undergraduate research assistants worked on this project, many of whom come from backgrounds historically underrepresented in the sciences. All students received training in psychological research, data analysis, and state-of-the-art research methodology using wearable cameras.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/23/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ryne&nbsp;Sherman</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
