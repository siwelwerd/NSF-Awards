 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this PFI project is to improve skin imaging to see deep enough below the tissue surface that they are useful for dermatologists and surgeons.  The technique, called optical coherence tomography or OCT, can non-invasively image tissues with near cellular resolution and identify changes in structure due to disease or injury. While OCT has shown great capabilities for imaging the retina, the approach offers limited depth penetration which has prevented success in other tissues. We have developed a new approach for OCT, under NSF support (CBET 1133222), that significantly extends its depth penetration.  Increasing depth penetration will open up new applications, particular for diagnosing skin disease. We expect this project to help justify commercialization by our partner company by showing that the technology can image skin in a format that is compatible with medical practice of dermatologists and surgeons.  This proposal seeks to build and test a prototype system with enough scanning range to be useful to medicine.  The technology will be tested and validated with skin imaging in animal models. By increasing access to better biomedical imaging technology, we will advance the health and welfare of the American public.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will advance a new imaging modality, dual axis OCT, towards a practical implementation for imaging skin. The proposal builds on NSF supported work that demonstrated the principle of extended depth imaging in OCT. Currently, OCT is not widely used for skin imaging due to limited penetration depth and an inability to evaluate large enough tissue areas. The proposed work will address this shortcoming. First, we will build a new scanning system that will validate that the approach can be used to examine larger tissue areas yet penetrate deeply into biological tissues such as animal skin. Second, we will implement a new dynamic focusing approach that will enable commercial success by making allowing physicians to image tissues at several millimeters below the tissue surface without repositioning the device.   Finally, this proposal will demonstrate the medical applicability of the approach by imaging in vivo animal tissues.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project advanced imaging technology to allow for deeper penetration into tissues like skin.  Traditionally, optical coherence tomography (OCT) could only image a fraction of a millimeter into tissues which cause light scatter.  The technology developed here, termed dual axis (DA) OCT for its configuration where light is delivered in one direction and collected at a slight angle offset of 3-6 degrees, enables deeper penetration into tissues.  \n\nThe outcomes of this projectt aimed at translating OCT for use in fields such as dermatology and dentistry where previously the penetration depth was a limiting factor.  The project successfully demonstrated wider imaging range, covering several millimeters in the lateral direction, using dynamic focusing to increase depth penetration and integration of a new spectrometer technology.  The imaging demonstrations showed the positioning of a syringe needle into a skin-simulating tissue phantom and into mouse skin.  Using DA-OCT technology, the imaging depth of 2.5 mm in skin exceeded the 1.5 mm penetration depth of traditional OCT by a substantial margin.\n\nThe broader impact of this award was to stimulate commercialization of the technology.  The technology improvements developed here did drive commercialziation with Lumedica, Inc. licensing this technology from Duke University.  Lumedica has continued to develop the technology under support from SBIR awards from NSF Phase I and Phase II (current).  Lumedica expects to begin sales of this technology into the research space in the next 12-18 months.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/22/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Adam P Wax"
