 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded by the Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division. Dr. Christine Thomas of The Ohio State University is developing metal catalysts using inexpensive Earth-abundant metals. The approach involves cooperation between the metal and a phosphorus atom bound to the metal. Implementing more efficient, economical and environmentally friendly catalyst technologies is the key to developing more sustainable processes for the production of fuels, commodity chemicals, and consumer products. Large scale industrial catalysts are most commonly derived from metals such as palladium, platinum, rhodium, or iridium. These are often referred to as \"precious metals\" owing to their high cost and low Earth-abundance. A better solution is to replace the precious metals in these catalysts with more economically viable Earth-abundant metals such as manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, and copper. However, the development of catalysts featuring these metals has been challenging because such metals are often reluctant to undergo the complex chemical processes required to make and break chemical bonds. By actively involving both the metal and the phosphorus atom in the cleavage and formation of chemical bonds, these obstacles may be overcome, allowing more sustainable, economical, and environmentally friendly catalytic processes to be developed. Through this project Dr. Thomas is providing rigorous training in scientific research for both undergraduate and graduate students. Dr. Thomas is also actively involved in outreach activities geared towards K-12 programs, public forums on the importance of catalysis and sustainability, and efforts to encourage and support women in careers in STEM.\r\n\r\nDr. Thomas is developing a new strategy for promoting sigma-bond activation processes with ultimate catalytic applications using metal-ligand cooperativity. Cooperative approaches of this type have proven particularly effective for facilitating reactions using Earth-abundant transition metals, which are often limited in the range of reactions they can perform on their own. This limitation stems from the reluctance of Earth-abundant transition metals such as manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, and copper to undergo multi-electron redox changes. Participation of a ligand in sigma-bond activation processes, either via ligand-based redox activity or by ligand involvement in heterolytic sigma-bond cleavage events, alleviates at least some of the redox requirements on the transition metal. Dr. Thomas is investigating N-heterocyclic phosphenium (NHP+) and phosphido (NHP-) ligands and their transition metal complexes using a chelating diphosphine pincer ligand framework to enforce metal coordination and impart stability upon the resulting complexes. When incorporated into a rigid chelating framework, NHP+ phosphenium cations can be reduced to their anionic NHP- form, allowing for further ligand-based redox processes to occur. The unique properties of NHP+/- ligands allows them to participate directly in bifunctional sigma-bond activation processes. A complete series of first row transition metal complexes is under investigation and studies of their reactivity and catalytic applications are ongoing. In support of the broader impacts of this project, Dr. Thomas is actively involved in outreach activities geared towards K-12 programs, public forums on the importance of catalysis and sustainability, and efforts to encourage and support women in careers in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

However, the utility of first row metals in catalysis is often limited by their reluctance to undergo multi-electron redox changes. The approach taken by the PI and her team was to use a pincer ligand that could function cooperatively with the metal center to make and break chemical bonds&nbsp;by incorporating a reactive phosphorus-containing N-heterocyclic phosphido functionality into the primary coordination sphere of the metal. During the course of this project, a series of metal complexes including those of Co, Rh, Mn, Fe, and Ni were synthesized (e.g. Figures 1-2) and their properties and reactivity were explored in an effort to better understand the interplay between the metal and the ligand in a variety of redox processes and stoichiometric bond activation reactions. Unusual bond activation processes by which substrate &sigma; bonds were cleaved across a first row metal-P bond were discovered (Figure 3). Moreover, a selective catalytic process for the hydroboration of terminal alkenes was developed using a cobalt-containing catalyst whose performance was superior to a rhodium analogue under similar conditions (Figure 4). This represents an important breakthrough in base metal catalysis and highlights the importance of ligand design in enabling catalytic transformations with first row metals.&nbsp; The NSF funded project resulted in 4 peer-reviewed publications detailing our extensive studies into the coordination chemistry, reactivity, and catalytic abilities of metal complexes containing N-heterocyclic phosphido fragments.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project also contributed to the rigorous training of 3 Ph.D. students, 1 M.S. student, and 3 undergraduate researchers in laboratory techniques as well as oral and written science communication.
