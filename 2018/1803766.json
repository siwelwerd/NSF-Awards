 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research conducted under this grant concerns the study of moduli spaces of algebraic and geometric objects, and in particular those of manifolds. Manifolds are mathematical objects generalizing the three-dimensional space in which we live, and appear throughout mathematics and science. Locally they look like ordinary space, though possibly of a different dimension, but globally their shape may be complicated. As a consequence, they can have interesting symmetries or can be deformed in interesting ways. It is a classical problem to understand which symmetries and deformation exist, and how to distinguish these in a computationally effective manner. Moduli spaces provide a geometric method to access this information, and we will contribute to the progress of science by furthering their study.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo understand of the topology of moduli spaces of algebraic and geometric interest, and in particular their homology, the Principal Investigator  will apply the techniques of homotopy theory and higher algebra. Firstly, the PI shall use the existence of additional higher-algebraic structures on moduli spaces. The PI will then use higher-algebraic cellular structures to reinterpret homological stability results and obtain meta-stable results about those homology groups for which homological stability does not hold. Secondly, the PI will destabilize recent stable results in manifold theory by comparing closely related moduli spaces.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nModern questions in geometry are often approached through the study of an auxiliary object known as a 'moduli space.'  A point of a moduli space typically represents another geometric object, in the way the numerical values of dials on a control panel represent the state of the system being controlled.  When studying geometry through the use of moduli spaces, the fundamental expressions of geometric shape are replaced by the more abstract mathematical notions of \"homology groups\" and \"homotopy groups.\"  These notions belong to the field of algebraic topology.\n\nMany of the systems described by moduli spaces fit into families of increasing complexity.  For example, if one is studying the moduli space of position of a mesh, one can increase the complexity by adding more mesh points, and get a new moduli space.  The process of increasing complexity is called \"stabilization\" and the process of decreasing complexity is known as \"destabilization.\"  Surprisingly, increasing the complexity of a moduli space, or stabilizing, often leads to something easier to understand.  The first part of this project, carried out by PI Kupers, in collaboration with Soren Galatius and Oscar Randal-Williams, exploited additional structure, commonly found found in moduli, spaces to establish new homological stability results and introduced higher-order homological stability results.  Applications were given in the fields of low dimensional geometry and number theory.  This new framework has been widely adopted, and has led to many new (higher order) homological stability results for moduli spaces.\n\nThe second part of this project introduced a technique for working backward, from the stabilized moduli space to the individual or \"unstable\" moduli spaces.  This yielded spectacular results for diffeomorphism groups of high-dimensional manifolds, an important subject in geometry.
