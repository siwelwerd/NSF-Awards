CNS is a primer venue for communications and networking researchers to present new research results, focusing on communications and network security. This travel grant will enable career development and learning opportunities for US-based and/or US citizen graduate students. Attending conferences is an important component of graduate school education for our society's future computer security researchers. Students have the opportunity to discuss leading edge research with world-class computer security researchers, and establish networks, connections, and mentoring relationships that will serve them well during their research careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
