Additional information about this meeting can be found at the website: http://fac-staff.seattleu.edu/boersema/web/WCOAS/WCOAS2018.html.\r\n\r\nThis conference is the twenty-fifth installment of the West Coast Operator Algebra Seminar (WCOAS), a series that annually brings together a diverse group of mathematicians whose primary research interests are in the theory of operator algebras. These meetings cover many current aspects of research in the theory of C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras. Some of the 2018 emphasis will be on the following topics: subfactors and their invariants, rigidity for ergodic actions and von Neumann algebras, free probability and its applications, classification of C*-algebras (the Elliot program), noncommutative geometry, operator spaces, quantum groups, graph C*-algebras. The conference program broadens participation in the theory of operator algebras and provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
