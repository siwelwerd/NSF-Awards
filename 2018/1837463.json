 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cyberlearning Resource Center (CRC) has responsibility for promoting integrative collaboration among cyberlearning grantees (across NSF programs); synthesis and national dissemination of cyberlearning findings, technologies, models, materials, and best practices; creating a national presence for Cyberlearning; helping the disparate Cyberlearning research and development communities  coordinate efforts to build capacity; and providing infrastructure (technological and social) for supporting these efforts. Monitored through the Cyberlearning: Transforming Education program, the CRC serves as a resource for all NSF grantees and programs with cyberlearning components, helping to promote synergy and integrate projects across NSF's cyberlearning investments. \r\n\r\nAmong society's central challenges are amplifying, expanding, and transforming opportunities people have for learning and more effectively drawing in, motivating, and engaging young learners. Engaging actively as a citizen and productively in the workforce requires understanding a broad variety of concepts and possessing the ability to collaborate, learn, solve problems, and make decisions. Whether learning is facilitated in school or out of school, and whether learners are youngsters or adults, to develop such knowledge and capabilities, learners must be motivated to learn, actively engage over the long term in learning activities, and put forth sustained cognitive and social effort. Consistent with NSF's mission and strategic plan, a variety of programs at NSF invest in research aimed towards achieving these goals. In support of this important thematic thrust, the Cyberlearning Resource Center works with researchers and NSF program officers to identify and disseminate findings from across programs and projects; develop ways to broker productive partnerships and collaborations; convene meetings for purposes of envisioning the future, integrating findings, and building capacity,; and monitor the cyberlearning portfolio and its influences and impacts.",

The field of cyberlearning is defined by strong attention to both computer science and learning sciences perspectives, an orientation to the future of learning, a commitment to interdisciplinary work, and dedication to considering how the future of learning could be more equitable. With the community, we charted novel and advanced designs for learning that are emerging as new technologies come into play (e.g. natural language processing, artificial learning and teaching agents, social robots, learning analytics, etc.). We also tracked and reported on the areas of learning theory that researchers are finding most powerful in investigating innovations for learning (e.g. embodied cognition, collaborative learning, agency and identity, cross-context learning). Most importantly, we helped the field to reflect on the kinds of scientific work that are generating the most progress.

Through \"buddy\" activities, we actively sought to increase the diversity of the field, for example, inviting researchers at HBCUs to engage with cyberlearning researchers. We connected the U.S.-based cyberlearning field to parallel efforts in Europe, called Technology-Enhanced Learning.
