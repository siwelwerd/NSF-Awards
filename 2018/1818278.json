 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to explore the commercial potential of a portable, energy-efficient and cost-effective device capable of producing high-quality potable water from moist ambient air. The core technology uses a combination of cooling and electrostatic systems to condense water vapor on surfaces made from proprietary materials. This technology can be incorporated into an atmospheric water extraction device to deliver potable water to customers with limited access to clean freshwater. Current atmospheric water extraction systems rely on energy-intensive refrigerant systems or unsustainable desiccant-based systems that suffer from low water output and high operating cost. The successful development and commercialization of the technology provide a viable solution to produce potable water from air virtually anywhere. Such a water production device addresses the consumption needs at locations where freshwater availability is challenging and where absolute portability is required\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project will further develop a freshwater harvesting system that efficiently and cost-effectively extracts water from moist ambient air.  The process concentrates water molecules from air using a high voltage electrostatic system, then condenses the concentrated water vapor on cooled surfaces consisting of a combination of hydrophobic and hydrophilic materials. The system generates ultrapure water for potable use at locations with limited or no water resource while significantly improves water harvesting efficiency and reduces energy footprint of conventional water condensation systems. Such process improvement minimizes the mechanical intensity and system maintenance requirement associated with water purification and therefore reduces the overall operating cost. As a result, commercial products based on this technology can be developed at various scales to meet the potable water demands in niche markets ranging from personal uses to industrial applications.",
