 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF Nanoscale Science and Engineering (NSE) 2018 Grantees Conference is a two-day annual event that brings together nanoscale educators, researchers, and experimentalists from academia, government, and industry to highlight information on the research and education activities funded by NSF NSE grants. The primary goals are to promote dissemination of innovative research progress, to facilitate research partnerships, and to identify future research directions. Panel discussions will be moderated by NSF-funded researchers as well as NSF Program Directors. The conference helps advance the goals of the NSF and the U.S. National Nanotechnology Initiative. Conference materials are made available to the global audience following the event at the website www.nseresearch.org, along with archival information from previous events. \r\n\r\nThe NSE grantees conference will foster interaction among academic, government, and industry researchers in nanotechnology fields. Keynote presentations and interactive panel discussions on the grand challenges in and convergence of nanotechnology generate opportunities for creative interdisciplinary collaboration. Identification and exploration of future trends in nanotechnology and cyberinfrastructure enable researchers and industry to prepare to fully capitalize on next-generation capabilities. The first day of the conference will focus on Progress in Foundational Nanotechnology and Infrastructure. Topics will include nanoscale modeling and simulation, the use of big data in nanotechnology research, nanotechnological devices and systems, two-dimensional nano-materials, and quantum phenomena in nanoscale systems. The second day of the conference will focus on Progress in Grand Challenges and Convergence. Topics will include the convergence of nanotechnology with a variety of other fields including biotechnology, cognitive science, cyber and artificial intelligence fields, and brain-like cognitive engineering systems. The second day will also include discussions of education challenges and societal impacts of nanotechnology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n2018 NSF Nanoscale Science and Engineering Grantees Conference \n\nProgress in Nanotechnology\n\nThe 2018 conference is one in a series of Nanoscale Science and Engineering Conferences that bring together the investigators who are supported by NSF grants in this field.  Nanoscale Science and Engineering (NSE) has experenced dramatic growth.  As the size scale decreases, the operation of physical and biological systems is revealed: quantum phenomena become more important, and the behavior of biological cells and their interiors are revealed.  The first decade focused on scientific basics of nanoscale systems.  During the second decade ideas have been reduced to practice, as nanotechnology is developed in the physical and biological worlds.\n\nThe 2018 conference combined keynote presentations and panel discussions.  Quantum science and engineering is undergoing a second revolution as the materials and devices move toward the atomic scale.  Advances in science are being exploited to manipulate quantum bits of information to develop functional systems.  Keynote and panel subjects addressing this area were: \"Quantum Information Science &amp; Technology, Atomically Precise Manufacturing,\" and the \"Transfer from Nanoscience to Nanoengineering and Nanomanufacturing.\" Biological systems are also being probed at the nanoscale, aided by tools from the physical sciences.  The topics addressed included: the \"Convergence of Nanotechnology with Biotechnology, Communicating and Controlling Biology via Biofabrication, Synthetic Biology and Microelectronics,\" \"Convergence in the Era of Intelligent Cognitive Assistants,\" and \"Convergence Leaning Challenges.\"  Four NSF supported Nano Centers presented summaries of thier activities, and the nanoHUB Center presented a tutorial about their website.  Education and outreach was addressed by presentations on \"Broadening Participation and Public Engagement in Nanotechnology.\"  Discussiosn of these topics was continued at poster sessions during the conference.\n\nThe 2018 NSE Grantees Conference allowed the participants to learn about and discuss these imporant topics, to build collaborations between the physical and the biological sciences, and to develop ideas for thier next research projects. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/27/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert M Westervelt"
