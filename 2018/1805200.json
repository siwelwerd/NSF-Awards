Success of this proposal will significantly advance the field of microscopy, specifically super-resolution fluorescence imaging. The development of high-performance, fast, compact and affordable microscopes will impact medical diagnostics such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe principal investigator will develop the next generation of stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy for high-performance, fast, compact and affordable STED microscopes. The PI will integrate metallic nanolaser arrays into STED systems which will greatly improve imaging speed and reduce the size and cost of the equipment\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
