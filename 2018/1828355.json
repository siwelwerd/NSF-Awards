 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, the Nexus, a new instrument enabling robotic manufacturing for complex systems spanning dimensional scales between 1:1000 of an inch and 1 foot, will be developed. The proposed infrastructure will be located at University of Louisville's regional NSF National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure site in order to facilitate US researcher access to unique robotic assembly and additive manufacturing capabilities. The Nexus will contribute novel hardware and software for rapid prototyping of emerging microsystems, microrobots, wearable sensors, and multimaterial nanoscale systems. This project will pave the way for the physical realization of future advanced technology prototypes, such as hand-held microfactories for micro and nano technology, the next generation soft robots, and higher performance solar energy conversion systems. Engineering students using this MRI infrastructure will be exposed to an education environment that emphasizes precision robotics, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and advanced manufacturing skills. Imparting this knowledge to graduates is invaluable in keeping manufacturing jobs and startup companies in the U.S., since labor costs are not a factor when harnessing the potential of autonomous micromachines. \r\n\r\nThe Nexus will be capable of multidimensional 100 nanometer positioning accuracy over meter distances for manufacturing of millimeter to computer tablet-sized integrated systems. Innovative custom process capabilities on the Nexus will include: 1) a fiber loom substation for smart fabrics, wearable sensors and soft robots, 2) 3D robotic microassembly alongside aerosol jetting thin film deposition capability for microrobots, in-situ packaged microsystems, and robot sensor skins, 3) a custom ultrasonic metal-polymer printing on robotic positioners for novel multimaterial plasmonic and bio-sensors, and 4) a photonic sintering station for nanostructured thin films.  The design of Nexus will be carried out with in-house simulation tools using evolutionary search methods from design databases, in order to 1) reduce project risks, 2) guarantee high-yield manufacturing, and 3) optimize the system cost. The design framework will guide the development of Nexus software for the automation of robotic transfer motions between substations, intelligent process control, and more intuitive human-machine interfaces.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
