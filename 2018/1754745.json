 "awd_abstract_narration": "A single gene often encodes numerous proteins by assembling different components from the original DNA sequence. These proteins have different functions. Thus, the number and type of proteins produced from a gene, i.e., gene regulation, are important aspects of how an organism functions. The investigators will look across the whole genome in natural populations of the fruit fly that have adapted to different temperature environments. By comparing gene regulation among these populations, they will learn how gene regulation changes as organisms adapt to their environment. The project will provide an unusually complete view of the causes, mechanisms, and consequences of the evolution of gene regulation. It will also inform how insects adapt to novel environments. Thus, they will also learn about the factors that limit the geographic ranges of insects that are agricultural pests or disease vectors.  Broader impacts of this project include extensive training of young scientists, including members of underrepresented groups in science. The project will also strengthen scientific connections between U.S. researchers and their counterparts in Africa. Finally, the team will improve the quality of scientific reference material available to the public online.\r\n\r\nThe fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster originated from warm regions of Africa; this research focuses on three parallel instances of adaptation to colder climates.  The project includes the collection of RNA sequence data from three pairs of warm- and cold-adapted populations that encompass these three climate transitions.  By applying a population genetic framework to this data set, population differences in gene expression and alternative splicing that were most likely driven by local adaptation can be identified.  Crosses between warm- and cold-adapted populations will allow these changes to be classified as either cis-encoded at the affected gene, or trans-encoded by another gene.  For cis-encoded cases of adaptive expression or splicing evolution, patterns of genetic variation can illuminate key details of natural selection's mode of action. Researchers will use existing population genomic data to test whether selection favored new mutations or standing genetic variation.  The project also entails the genetic mapping of cold tolerance differences for each population pair.  The combination of mapping results, population genomic analysis of existing data, and the above RNA sequencing results will identify notable candidate genes for local adaptation via cis-acting changes in gene regulation.  Probing the interface between genetic adaptation and the thermal environment will test whether gene regulatory changes alter or maintain ancestral regulation, and whether such changes result in gene regulatory networks that are less buffered against perturbation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project investigated how changes in gene regulation (the amount of a gene product this is produced, or elements of a gene product that are alternatively present or absent) contribute to the abilities of natural populations to adapt to challenging new environments.  It utilized populations of the model organism Drosophila melanogaster (the common vinegar fly), which originated from a warm region of African but have recurrently expanded into cooler regions within the last 2,000 years. \n\n \n\nThe research found that some of the same gene regulatory changes were favored independently in different cold-adapted populations.  It also investigated whether the favored regulatory changes were encoded by genetic differences at the gene showing the regulatory change, or instead by genetic differences at other genes, and found that the answer to this question depends on the population studied. \n\n \n\nFurther, this research examined the connection between genetic and environmental effects on gene regulation.  It found that favored gene regulatory changes usually reversed the effects of temperature on gene regulation, which might imply that some of those environmental effects on gene regulation were unfavorable.  This investigation also found evidence that favored gene regulatory changes can make gene regulation less stable, potentially because they inadvertently disrupt molecular mechanisms that previously kept gene regulation in a more buffered state. \n\n \n\nThis research also involved the development and application of a new method for genetic mapping, in order to identify numerous regions of the genome that contain genetic changes that helped fly populations adapt to novel cold environments.  The project also involved improving statistical methodology for detecting the genes that help local populations adapt to distinct environments.  Such methods may be useful in many future evolutionary genetic studies.\n\n \n\nHence, this research advanced the field\u2019s understanding of how gene regulation can be involved in the adaptation of natural insect populations to new environments, in multiple respects.  It also yielded specific insights regarding the adaptation of insects to novel climates, which may inform future studies on insect adaptation to climate change.\n\n \n\nThis project also contribute more broadly to scientific training, international collaboration, and the dissemination of scientific knowledge.  It advanced the training and professional development of a postdoctoral researcher, two PhD students, two research staff, and 16 undergraduate students.  It facilitated efforts to increase the collaborative involvement of African researchers in the study of African D. melanogaster populations.  And it motivated the online dissemination of freely available course materials in the field of population genetics.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/29/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John E Pool"
