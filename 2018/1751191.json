 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award will contribute to the advancement of national prosperity and increased national security by studying efficient operations of complex wireless sensor networks. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are increasingly used to collect and process data over space and time in a variety of domains. Wireless sensor networks appear in ecosystems and geological phenomena, as well in monitoring adversarial use of biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons.  In all of these applications, the WSN must provide effective coverage over an extended period of time even as individual sensors fail and require maintenance.  Acquiring and/or installing sensors may be costly, raising the question of how to ensure satisfactory performance of the WSN indefinitely.  This award supports research to establish methodology required for the design and maintenance of the WSN over time as it evolves to meet changing conditions.  The award will additionally support the creation of a new interdisciplinary honors curriculum within the PI's home institution.  This program will prepare engineering students to tackle multi-disciplinary problems by broadening their awareness of emerging solutions to modern societal problems.\r\n\r\nThis research will contribute to the complex problem of designing, maintaining, and adapting ad hoc WSNs over time.  This problem entails numerous sources of computational complexity stemming from modeling randomly evolving networks and decisions made over time.  Overcoming these challenges will require advancing mathematical and computational methods from network optimization, complex system reliability, Monte Carlo simulation, stochastic processes, and stochastic optimization.  The research will initially develop stochastic network maintenance models and computationally tractable reliability estimation procedures for the purpose of describing WSN reliability under a given maintenance policy.  Optimization methodology will be derived to incorporate emerging reliability representation/estimation techniques in order to determine efficient fixed-schedule and condition-based maintenance policies that are efficient with respect to cost and reliability criteria.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nWireless sensor networks (WSNs) are used for a variety of applications, including monitoring infrastructure condition, studying natural environments, and detecting military and homeland threats. In many applications, it is necessary that the WSN persists over an extended period of time; however, WSN sensors fail over time, causing the network's coverage to degrade.\n\n\nThis CAREER award focused on developing methodology at the intersection of optimization and systems reliability to enable planning when and where new sensor nodes should be deployed into a partially depleted WSN to ensure cost-efficient and reliable coverage over time. To address this problem, the research developed several models of increasing complexity to assist in identifying cost- and reliability-efficient policies for redeploying nodes. The collection of models explores a variety of policy classes (e.g., time-based versus condition-based), different node positioning strategies (e.g., random or controlled), and different assumptions on sensor nodes' time-to-failure distributions (e.g., identical or position-dependent). For these models, the research characterizes measures of area coverage reliability under a node redeployment policy and provides methodology to estimate area coverage reliability efficiently, and optimize over the space of node redeployment policies, for WSNs comprised of hundreds of nodes.\n\n\nThe research contributes to the theory and computation of reliability signatures, including the destruction spectrum and survival signature, as well as reliability-aware maintenance optimization for network systems. More specifically, the research exposes bidirectional synergies between reliability signatures and optimization methodology. For example:\n\n\n(1) The research proves that estimating the survival signature of certain types of networks through Monte Carlo (MC) simulation entails solving a multi-objective network optimization problem in each replication and shows experimentally that dedicated multi-objective network optimization algorithms can be used to improve the rate of MC replications by as much as an order of magnitude.\n\n\n(2) The research solves maintenance-optimization Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) by applying approximate solution methods in a way that exploits new connections with the survival signature or known solution procedures for similarly structured static optimization problems.\n\n\nThis project has also sought to engage engineering and data science honors students in undergraduate research through instructing an \"Honors Research Experience\" curriculum. The curriculum introduces students to potential research topics, equips students in fundamental research skills, leads students through the development of an undergraduate research grant proposal, and exposes students to opportunities for graduate school and nationally competitive awards.\n\n\nThe broader impacts of the work are as follows:\n\n\n(1) Impact on the general public: The results may enable more affordable and reliable deployment of WSNs in a variety of applications. In addition, the new theory and methodology can potentially be applied to other systems comprised of groups of similar components. The results may therefore lead to methods for analyzing and improving the reliability of other critical networks, such as infrastructure systems.\n\n\n(2) Impact on principal discipline(s) of the project: The research establishes new synergies between the optimization literature and the systems/network reliability literature and shows that these synergies can enable reliability analysis and reliability-aware optimization of systems at a larger scale. By exposing these synergies, the work creates opportunities for other works to exploit similar synergies.\n\n\n(3) Impact on higher education: Over 20 engineering and data science students were involved in research through the \"Honors Research Experience\" curriculum. All of these students identified a research topic and faculty mentor while also receiving training in scientific communication and gaining exposure to a variety of current problems and methodologies being examined by engineering researchers. Almost all students who participated in this curriculum received either a state-funded or university-funded grant to support their research and subsequently conducted research on their project for at least a year. Many of the students ultimately wrote an undergraduate honors thesis to graduate with honors, and many later pursued graduate studies. Six graduate students also received training while conducting research on this project.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/06/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: KellyMSullivan\n"
