 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in physics at the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL) and Duke University.  TUNL is a research consortium consisting of three major universities in the North Carolina Triangle Area, Duke University, North Carolina State University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  The award will support twelve undergraduates for ten weeks of summer research on topics in nuclear and particle physics.  Eight students will conduct research at TUNL, and the other four will spend part of their summer at CERN working with the Duke high-energy physics group.  Each student is assigned a faculty mentor and is integrated into a research group consisting of faculty, postdocs, graduate students, and other undergraduate students.  In addition, the students have opportunities to visit the physics departments at the consortium universities to learn about the graduate programs at these institutions and to see the scope of research pursued in each department.\r\n\r\nThrough active research, seminars, lab tours, and discussion groups, the students are exposed to various aspects of nuclear and particle physics research and their connections to other science areas. Lecture and seminar topics are chosen to emphasize the nuclear and particle physics research activities at TUNL and CERN, respectively. The students will have opportunities to interact with world-renowned physicists, learn about the most advanced theoretical concepts in the fields, and work with state-of-the-art technologies used in these research areas. Also, professional development activities in scientific writing and oral presentations constitute an important component of the REU program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary goal of this project was to operate a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site in the areas of nuclear and particle physics.  The site was located at the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL) and the Physics Department at Duke University in Durham, NC.  TUNL is a research consortium consisting of four major universities in the North Carolina Triangle Area: Duke University, North Carolina Central University, North Carolina State University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  The combination of the TUNL research community and the Duke High-Energy Physics (HEP) group creates an educationally rich research environment for students.\n\nStudents participated in a 10-week long summer program that focused on research and included lectures for specialized training and educational broadening and social activities for community building. Each student was assigned a faculty mentor and was integrated into a research group consisting of faculty, postdocs, graduate students and other undergraduate students.   This arrangement was intended to give the students a sense of what it is like to be a graduate student conducting research at the frontiers of the field.\n\nThis REU site had both domestic and international components.  The students who conducted research in experimental nuclear physics worked at TUNL or with the neutrino physics group at Duke University.   Those conducting research in particle physics worked with the Duke HEP group and spent part of the summer at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland.  Funding by the National Science Foundation (NSF) for the site provided support for a total of 47 undergraduate physics students to conduct summer research from 2018 to 2021.  In addition, the infrastructure maintained for the program benefited other students conducting research at the TUNL institutions each summer.  These students were supported by other funding sources. \n\nFour students from each REU cohort conducted research with the Duke HEP group, spending the first four weeks of the program in Durham integrating into the HEP group and getting orientated to their research project.  They then traveled to Geneva where they spent the final six weeks of the program carrying out research at CERN.  The other students supported by the NSF each summer conducted research in nuclear physics in Durham.\n\nThe 2020 REU program was delivered virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Students worked on research projects that were appropriate for a virtual program.  The 2021 REU program was held entirely on the Duke University campus for all students due to international travel restrictions.\n\nThe NSF-supported students were selected from colleges and universities from around the country.  An average of 284 students applied for the program each year.  Students were selected for the program based on their academic performance, course and skills preparation for research, and their enthusiasm for research (as assessed from the personal statement).  Special attention was given to advertising the program to organizations that serve underrepresented groups in STEM areas.  For example, announcements were posted on the Pathways to Science, APS Jobs and SPS Jobs web sites and also publicized at the Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics.\n\nApproximately 70% of the NSF-supported students who participated in this REU program during the award period who have graduated with a Bachelor degree are pursuing a graduate degree in physics or in a related field.  Most of those who decided not to attend graduate school immediately after completing their undergraduate studies are working in STEM areas.  Several students are co-authors on papers in research journals that resulted from their REU research project.    \n\nIntellectual Merit: This program provided opportunities for undergraduate students to conduct research at the frontiers of nuclear and particle physics with world-renowned scientists at world-class facilities using state-of-the-art research methods and technologies. The students participating in this program gained experience in various aspects of nuclear and particle physics research and learned about the connections of these fields to other areas of science. The projects carried out by the REU participants were part of the research program at TUNL, the Duke University Physics Department, and CERN that explores matter and forces at distances and energies that provide insights about the first moments of the universe and processes in stars.  The results of the research conducted in this program were disseminated to the broader scientific communities through presentations at international conferences and through publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals.\n\nBroader Impacts:  Through providing research experiences for students across the country, this project contributed to the national goals of developing a diverse, internationally competitive, and globally engaged science and engineering workforce.  To this end, special attention was given to attracting women and students from groups underrepresented in STEM careers.   \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/22/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alexander Crowell"
