 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers at Florida International University (IIS-1213026), University of Illinois at Chicago (IIS-1213013), Brown University (IIS-1212508), and Northwestern University (IIS-1213038) are developing a high-performance model for information processing and fusion in mobile environments, providing a collaborative integration between the real and virtual worlds. This model, applicable to the fields of computational transportation and mobile sensing, enables querying and visualization of moving objects data (MOD) and their relationship to static and dynamic geospatial data. Research project addresses the issues of: balancing the processing of location-based data streams coming into MOD servers with efficient processing of visualization-related queries; determining optimal distribution of queries/tasks among multiple regional servers; maximizing the scalability of prediction techniques in terms of efficient management of objects' data and queries; modeling data uncertainty; coupling map generalization with trajectories' data reduction when zooming across different scales; resolving issues of privacy and security; and enabling semantic querying. A demonstration of the outcomes is available within the TerraFly testbed (http://TerraFly.fiu.edu) -- a public Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping engine and location-based data repository.\r\n\r\nThis work explores the novel steps towards combining the real and virtual worlds, an emerging research frontier. The virtual world is relatively well understood, but the combination of the real and virtual poses great challenges and promises transformative results with high potential payoff, including in-car navigation systems, massive fleets of mobile sensors, self-navigating vehicles, situation command, and location-based services. While advancing Computer Science, the project also leverages prior investment of, and provides direct benefit to, NSF, NASA, DoI, DoT, DHS, and other stakeholders such as the NSF EarthCube project. By improving the efficiency of spatial, temporal, and moving object data management and making these results available to constituencies via TerraFly, EarthCube and other venues, the project will produce societal benefits. This project provides a foundation for improving the quality of services in multiple applications such as disaster management, environmental monitoring, transportation, education, and logistics. The resulting technologies may serve as a base to advance research on self-navigating vehicles, robots, and mobile sensors. In particular, this work facilitates the technologies of Informed Traveler Programs, dynamic navigation, situation control, and airborne observational systems. The project provides rich educational and research opportunities for students from the collaborating institutions -- including underrepresented students. In addition, educational modules are developed, and research results will be incorporated in curriculum expansions. Further information is available at the project's website (http://CAKE.fiu.edu/MOD).",

Findings from this project have provided enabling methodologies for several applications of societal relevance: <em>health care and epidemiology</em>: the results on predicting information diffusion can be applied for predicting spreading of diseases; <em>public safety</em>: the findings from time-series compression and their impact on evolving spatial shapes can be used for efficient management of detecting boundaries of spreading toxic materials/gasses; <em>transportation</em>, particularly multi-modal navigation and crowd-sourced parking.</p>\n<p>This research has resulted in approximately 200 publications, listed at <a href=\"http://cake.fiu.edu/MODPUBS/\">http://cake.fiu.edu/MODPUBS/</a>. Below are a few examples of the team's accomplishments.</p>\n<p>The team has developed efficient algorithms for detecting motion-trends predicates (e.g., moving towards/along) and developing models for fusing uncertainty from multiple sources (GPS; roadside sensors) when tracking moving objects and, ultimately, answering continuous queries in the presence of uncertainty. Results were then extended to deal with tracking and detecting boundaries for evolving mobile shapes.

Techniques have been developed to provide assurance of integrity and privacy protection in the execution of such searches.

The approach considers the brain regions and the tracts that connect them as a road network, and the signals traveling between them as vehicles. Travel patterns are analyzed by a process called traffic assignment. More specifically, the brain is examined in terms of demand for communication of signals which move between neurons and brain regions, and the supply of fibers that enable, and serve the conduit for such movements. The objective of the demand/supply examination is to determine whether or not signal movement in the brain obeys some form of global design for optimum efficiency. Or, as evolution would suggest, movement patterns are emergent thusly more anarchical, with various neurons and regions acting selfishly for the purpose of local optimization, regardless of the global perspective. The former would suggest a System Optimum signal movement, whereas the latter would suggest a User Equilibrium type of movement.</p>\n<p>The team has improved the spatio-temporal resource search algorithms in a probabilistic or competitive setting. In a resource search problem, there are spatially located static resources and a mobile agent, looking to obtain one of the resources while minimizing the cost. This model applies to many situations arising in urban transportation systems: drivers looking for street parking, taxis looking for new customers, and electric vehicles looking for charging stations. Machine-learning methods have been developed for the problems of trajectories-to-user linking, and points-of-interest (PoI) recommendations, for both a single PoI, as well as sequences of PoIs. Efficient query processing techniques have been developed for obtaining the max-diversity subset of PoIs within certain reachability constraints.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/28/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Goce&nbsp;P&nbsp;Trajcevski</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1823267/1823267_10216138_1580027407942_multiple--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1823267/1823267_10216138_1580027407942_multiple--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fusing Location Uncertainties\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1823267/1823267_10216138_1580027407942_multiple--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fusing Location Uncertainties\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Combining Uncertainties from GPS and Road-side Sensors</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Trajcevski/Zhang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Goce&nbsp;P&nbsp;Trajcevski</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fusing Location Uncertainties</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1823267/1823267_10216138_1580027573857_clustering--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1823267/1823267_10216138_1580027573857_clustering--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Clustering of Speed\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1823267/1823267_10216138_1580027573857_clustering--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Clustering of Speed\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Impact of Multiple Lanes When Detecting (Clusters of) Speed Patterns Over Time</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Trajcevski</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Goce&nbsp;P&nbsp;Trajcevski</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Clustering of Speed</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1823267/1823267_10216138_1580027821938_GUI-MAXRS--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1823267/1823267_10216138_1580027821938_GUI-MAXRS--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Continuous MaxRS\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1823267/1823267_10216138_1580027821938_GUI-MAXRS--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Continuous MaxRS\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(Trajectory of) The Centroid of the Range-Constrained Region with Maximum Moving Objects in itsInterior</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Trajcevski/Hussain</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Goce&nbsp;P&nbsp;Trajcevski</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Continuous MaxRS</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
