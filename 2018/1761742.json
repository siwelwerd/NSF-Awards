 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will promote the development of national prosperity and economic welfare by investigating effective operations of critical energy and commodity infrastructure systems.  Merchant operations must manage the operational flexibility embedded in physical energy conversion assets, such as power plants, refineries, and storage and transport facilities.  These systems form the backbone of energy and commodity physical markets, which in turn form the basis for the functioning of their associated financial markets.  Incompleteness of these financial markets reduces the productivity of existing energy and commodity physical assets and hampers investment in new assets.  This project explicitly addresses market incompleteness and supports the development of integrated operations and hedging practices to help asset managers achieve improved valuation, operations, and risk management.  A better understanding of the impact of reduced energy and commodity market incompleteness on economic efficiency can also inform related policy making.  The associated educational plan fosters interest in energy and commodity markets analytics based on curriculum innovation and electronic archives.\r\n\r\nThis research will develop a decision-making framework that directly accounts for market incompleteness when managing on a merchant basis energy and commodity conversion assets modeled as real options.  It will have potential applicability for the valuation, exercise, and hedging of both financial and real options that arise in contexts that transcend the energy and commodity industries.  This approach contrasts common tactics that assume away market incompleteness when devising operating policies, effectively decoupling their optimization from that of financial hedging policies.  It is also distinct from schemes that rely on the calibration of risk propensity parameters.  The methodology in this project will extend the realm of applicability of quadratic hedging, integrating it with the optimization of operating policies for energy and commodity infrastructure.  It will produce tractable algorithms for the computation of near optimal operating and financial hedging policies relying on and extending state-of-the-art approximate dynamic programming techniques.  The performance of these methods will be assessed using available market and operational data.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Incompleteness of the latter markets complicates the valuation and management of energy and commodity conversion assets.  This research has developed a practical decision-making framework that directly accounts for financial market incompleteness when managing on a merchant basis energy and commodity conversion assets modeled as real options.  This approach includes two steps: (i) Maximization of the assessed market value of conversion assets by optimizing operating policies under risk neutral valuation supported by calibration to market data and (ii) minimization of the financial risk embedded in the operating policy cash flows by optimizing financial risk management policies based on quadratic hedging anchored on the determined asset value.  For (i), the research carried out under this grant has broadened the applicability of pathwise optimization, an emerging reinforcement learning approach, beyond the realm of optimal stopping to encompass real option models that feature timing and switching options, in particular merchant energy production.  For (ii), this work has proposed a novel formulation of quadratic hedging that takes the initial bond position as given and focuses on optimizing the residual composition of the hedging portfolio, has applied this model to streams of cash flows, and has put forth a heuristic for this setting that achieves near optimal performance in a realistic merchant energy storage application.  This approach has applicability to both energy and commodity real options and financial options.  This material has been included in a doctoral course on the merchant management of energy and commodity conversion assets.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nicola Secomandi"
