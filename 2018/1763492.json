 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project introduces a grand challenge for the networking community and industry: reducing Internet latencies to close to the limiting physical constraint, the speed of light in free space. Achieving this vision of a 'speed-of-light Internet' could translate into significant value for today's applications; for example, shaving even a few hundred milliseconds from a Web transaction may translate into millions of dollars of revenue for a Web provider, or significantly impact emergency or defense response. The human visual system cannot correctly order visual events separated by less than about 30 millisecond; thus, a response received over the Internet within thirty milliseconds would achieve the illusion of an \"instant response\", potentially enabling the full potential of certain applications, e.g., tele-immersion, that have so far been limited to the laboratory.  For some applications, such as massive multi-player online games, (or any online interactive community), reducing the latency of the Internet will push applications to reach a critical mass of users. A speed-of-light Internet can also be expected to spur the development of new and creative applications. This proposal aims at developing a playbook for realizing a speed-of-light Internet, by identifying the factors that contribute to latency, the applications that would benefit most, and developing an architecture, protocols and methodologies for achieving it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe four main goals of this project are to (1) determine the impact of latency on end users, (2) design a speed-of-light Internet, (3) explore \"end-point agnostic\" mechanisms for reducing latency, and (4) determine how to operate, maintain, and make use of a bandwidth-constrained low-latency network. The project will investigate these questions in the context of candidate applications including electronic commerce, games, and virtual and augmented reality.  The proposed work includes new algorithms and design for the wide-area network infrastructure, and new protocols and network management to deal with the dynamic partitioning of application traffic across the two infrastructures.  The project will explore how to leverage low-latency networking technologies, i.e., microwave and millimeter wave radios, which have thus far been deployed as point-to-point links over long distances primarily for the financial industry; specifically, how they can be incorporated into the Internet at large. The work will be carried out in collaboration with McKay Brothers, the operators of an ultra-low-latency network linking financial markets in New York and Chicago, Akamai Technologies, a major provider of content delivery services, and Exablaze, a manufacturer of the ultra-low-latency network interface cards. This will inform the design of a cSpeed mesh network, and its interaction and interoperability with the standard Internet.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Examples of such time-sensitive endeavors run the gamut from telepresence and virtual reality to header bidding and blockchain propagation.</p>\n<p>At a fundamental level, network speeds are limited by the finite velocity of electromagnetic waves -- the speed of light. The maximum propagation speed for light occurs in vacuum. Light is slowed down in air by a negligible amount (0.03%), but in the conventional solid-core fiber optic cables that currently carry the bulk of Internet traffic, light travels at only about 2/3 of the vacuum maximum. Over long distances, and when many back-and-forth exchanges of information are required, this signaling slowdown becomes material. In addition, the actual over-land and under-sea paths taken by cables are often substantially longer than the minimum A to B distance between data centers.</p>\n<p>Over the last decade, there has been a flurry of construction of long-haul line-of-sight microwave networks that adhere as closely as possible to great-circle paths.

Providing an answer to this question was a key goal of our research. It is, however, a tricky question to answer because the fastest existing long-distance networks were entirely privately funded and their performance remains fully proprietary. Just how fast are these networks, really? How well do they hold up when weather moves through? How much data can they carry during real-world operation?</p>\n<p>Government database scraping provides a first approach to evaluate the performance of the existing ultra-low latency networks. In the US, if one wishes to communicate with microwaves, one needs a broadcast license. The FCC maintains a publicly-searchable list of all licenses and licensees, and this data can be assembled to monitor the construction, consolidation, and improvement of point-to-point networks. The first accompanying image, taken from <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3419394.3423620\">our 2020 paper</a>, shows two snapshots in the evolution of the <em>New Line Network</em>, which connects the CME data center located in Aurora, Illinois to the trading centers of suburban New Jersey. Over time, the New Line Network has clearly grown to provide ever more bandwidth at ever higher availability with a shortest path that adheres ever more closely to the geodesic.</p>\n<p>In April of 2020, in the licensed microwave bands, there were nine separate FCC-registered networks spanning the Chicago to New Jersey Corridor and linking the CME to the NY4 data center that hosts a variety of equity and options exchanges. These are listed in the table that comprises the second image included with this report. The New Line Network, with a 3.96171 millisecond path-latency (compared to a geodesic minimum latency of 3.955 ms) is seen to be neck-and-neck (in terms of path-latency) with several competing networks.</p>\n<p>In the course of our research, we developed a completely independent network latency monitoring technique that consists of correlating precisely time-stamped trading data from physically separated exchanges, and measuring the statistical delay between events that occur at one end of a long-distance network, and the responses that occur at the other end. As part of the <a href=\"https://waqaraqeel.github.io/assets/cisp-nsdi22.pdf\">capstone paper for our NSF-funded research</a>, we undertook this analysis using gigabytes of tick data for the E-mini S&amp;P500 near-month futures contract (that trades in Illinois) and the SPY S&amp;P500 ETF (that trades in New Jersey). In work of this type, there are subtle issues associated with measuring the <em>absolute</em> lowest latencies at which information transport occurs across the relay; these subtleties stem from the operational details of the exchange matching engines. For the purpose, however, of demonstrating that the networks consistently run end-to-end within a few percent of the physical limit, even during periods plagued by heavy weather, our technique provides a remarkably powerful network probe.</p>\n<p>The bulk of our work during the period that we were NSF-funded consisted of taking these (and other) real-world insights into account, and  applying them to design a transcontinental network. Now at the close of the project, we're excited to  release -- at the 19th USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation Conference -- our most up-to-date and detailed design of what nationwide-deployed speed-of-light Internet service  provision (a c-ISP) could look like, and what its overall performance would be.
