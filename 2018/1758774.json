 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the establishment of a research coordination network (RCN) to address the housing crisis in a variety of cities.  The network will advance research on the interconnected processes related to the precarious nature of housing such as evictions, homelessness and displacement, and plans to study them in tandem with forms of segregation and discrimination.  The RCN fills a gap in research by systematically analyzing community and policy responses that seek to create housing access and housing justice through legal frameworks, cooperative models of land and housing, and collective action.  An important aspect of the RCN is its coordination at the intersection of social movements, universities, and policy.  Paying close attention to housing movements and policy interventions, the RCN will synthesize the primary modalities of housing justice and its conceptual underpinnings into a Housing Justice Handbook that will be broadly disseminated.  Focused Summer Institutes with a diverse group of scholars looking at housing issues will be held in a variety of settings.  By integrating experience from a variety of contexts and settings, this RCN will generate new formats of university-community partnerships and engaged research in the United States focused on the experiences of marginalized social groups.  \r\n\r\nThis RCN builds a transnational, interdisciplinary, and intergenerational collaboration to tackle analytical and methodological problems pertaining to spatial exclusion.  It cuts across various silos of housing research and links housing to two other relevant realms of geographic inquiry, carceral geographies, and land dispossession.  In doing so, it builds data collection, data visualization, and story mapping tools that can capture the complex space-time geographies of housing precarity.  By developing novel methods of research dissemination and pedagogy that link key nodes of knowledge production in the Global South with those in the Global North, it fosters critical geographies of learning.  Such an approach sheds new light on the housing crisis in the United States through comparison and demonstrates how the social function of land and housing is being addressed in other democratic contexts with long histories of spatial inequality.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Adopting a global approach to this research question, the HJUC RCN has undertaken transnational learning through conferences, summer institutes, and public programs. In doing so, it has consolidated housing justice as a field of inquiry in geography, urban planning, and related spatially-oriented social science disciplines. A key priority of the network has been inter-generational collaboration and the mentorship of the next generation of housing scholars.</p>\n<p>Some of the prominent achievements and outcomes of the HJUC RCN include the following. <strong>1.</strong> Building a field of inquiry where housing justice is firmly situated in a global analysis of racial justice. This is evident in our inaugural public scholarship volume, <a href=\"https://challengeinequality.luskin.ucla.edu/2019/01/31/housing-justice-in-unequal-cities/\"><em>Housing Justice in Unequal Cities</em></a><em>,</em> as well as in the subsequent expansion of our research themes, for example, through the <a href=\"https://challengeinequality.luskin.ucla.edu/property-personhood-and-police/\">convening of research on policing and housing</a>. <strong>2.</strong> A focus on research and data methodologies that further housing justice, including the publication and dissemination of a landmark public scholarship volume (in English and Spanish), <a href=\"https://challengeinequality.luskin.ucla.edu/2020/04/29/methodologies-for-housing-justice-resource-guide/\"><em>Methodologies for Housing Justice Resource Guide,</em></a> which is now widely used in the U.S. and beyond; <strong>3</strong>. The creation of housing justice summer institutes that serve as an inter-generational space of training, networking, and mentoring for scholars, including the <a href=\"https://unequalcities.org/summer-institute-methodologies-for-housing-justice/\">Methodologies for Housing Justice Summer Institute</a> held in Los Angeles in 2019 and co-led by HJUC RCN Steering Committee member, Raquel Rolnik, and the <a href=\"https://unequalcities.org/summer-institute-igj-2022/\">Housing Justice in Unequal Cities Summer Institute</a> held in Barcelona in 2022 in partnership with the Antipode Foundation&rsquo;s Institute for the Geographies of Justice and co-led by HJUC RCN Steering Committee members Nik Heynen and Maria Kaika, and HJUC RCN Core Partner, Melissa Garcia-Lamarca. <strong>4</strong>. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of our <a href=\"https://unequalcities.org/\">website</a> to hold a virtual public space highlighting key housing justice struggles, policies, legal frameworks, and practices relevant to the pandemic, including the creation of a unique <a href=\"https://unequalcities.org/covid-19/\">COVID-19 &amp; Housing Justice digital repository</a>. <strong>5.</strong> Organizing and hosting agenda-setting public programs on housing justice, including an event on the <a href=\"https://challengeinequality.luskin.ucla.edu/righttohousing/\">Right to Housing</a> featuring three current and former UN Special Rapporteurs on the Right to Adequate Housing, Leilani Farha, Balakrishnan Rajagopal, and Raquel Rolnik, and concerned with the implications of the enshrining of the right to housing in a state or national constitution. Yet another such agenda-setting event was <a href=\"https://challengeinequality.luskin.ucla.edu/futures-of-social-housing/\">Futures of Social Housing</a>, which brought together university and movement-based scholars to discuss the new possibilities of social housing in the U.S., including that of a Social Housing Development Authority. <strong>6.</strong> Resourcing transnational research networks through three global &ldquo;hubs&rdquo; &ndash; in India, Brazil, and Europe. The hub in India, led by HJUC RCN Steering Committee member, Gautam Bhan, has focused on informal housing and the need for social protections in the context of the pandemic. The hub in Brazil, led by HJUC RCN Steering Committee member, Raquel Rolnik, has focused on mass evictions and the call for a &ldquo;no evictions&rdquo; policy (upheld by the Brazilian Supreme Court). The hub in Europe, led by HJUC RCN Core Partner, Michele Lancione, has stewarded a <a href=\"https://radicalhousingjournal.org/issue/issue-4-1/\">special issue of the&nbsp;<em>Radical Housing Journal</em>&nbsp;</a>on the renewed criminalization of homelessness in the U.S. and elsewhere in the North Atlantic. In addition, HJUC RCN has built a strong partnership with the Right to Remain Collaborative, which is based in Vancouver and co-led by HJUC RCN Steering Committee member, Nicholas Blomley, on the issue of precarious housing.</p>\n<p>We are confident that the HJUC RCN will have continuing impact and influence for many years to come. One measure of this is the proliferation of scholarly collaborations among early-career scholars who have been actively involved in HJUC RCN activities. Indeed, we are looking forward to various collaborative publications by these scholars including a forthcoming Housing Justice Keywords volume co-authored by the participants of the 2022 summer institute.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/20/2024<br>\nModified by: Ananya&nbsp;Roy</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div
