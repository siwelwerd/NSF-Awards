 "awd_abstract_narration": "The human genome contains about 3 billion base pairs of DNA that provide essential instructions for cells to respond to developmental or environmental cues.  A key step in the response is transcribing the information in DNA to intermediary RNA molecules that supply another layer of information.  Transcribing DNA to RNA is a highly regulated process, but exactly how it is controlled remains an enigma.  The goal of this project is to decipher this problem by bringing together an experienced team of investigators to take a multi-faceted approach to catalyze discovery in new ways. The research plan will integrate educational and outreach programs at University of Colorado-Boulder and University of California-Los Angeles to expose high school, college students, and postdoctoral scholars to high-impact collaborative research. The tools, strategies, and methodologies to be implemented will be applicable to the study of other biological processes and molecular machines.\r\n\r\nThe questions addressed in this project are fundamentally important for understanding the molecular control of eukaryotic transcription. The human RNA polymerase II transcription machinery will be studied in detail using cutting-edge methods developed initially through analysis of bacterial RNA polymerase.  Highly regulated stages in gene expression, including transcription initiation and pausing, will be the focus.  This collaborative project will merge solution-based single-molecule fluorescence techniques with detailed functional assays enabled by biochemical reconstitution of the entire 4.5 MDa human transcription apparatus. Two key questions will be addressed:  How is RNA polymerase II transcription dynamically regulated by specific protein factors?  What role does RNA polymerase II backtracking play in regulating initiation and pausing? An important aspect of the work will be to test and validate mechanistic findings with in vitro and cell-based approaches.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe research supported by NSF MCB-1818147 led to many groundbreaking discoveries that will drive the field for years to come.  For example, this project has yielded novel strategies to treat human disease and new methodologies for deciphering complex biological processes at the molecular level (important for development of next-generation therapeutics, among other applications).  At the time of this reporting (summer 2023), 18 scientific papers have been published that were supported by this collaborative grant. The research findings have changed and improved current understanding of fundamental cellular processes that contribute to human development and disease.  The research has also advanced methodologies important for biophysical studies of complex enzymatic processes of fundamental importance to biology.  The significant discoveries include 1) new mechanistic understanding of an enzyme called XPB, and 2) identification of new functions for an enzyme called CDK7.  Both XPB and CDK7 are important for human cellular function and each is required for normal function of the RNA polymerase II enzyme, which acts to decode specific regions of the human genome to allow for normal, healthy function in day-to-day life.  A breakdown in RNA polymerase II function therefore underlies many human diseases.  3) We also determined new targets for the CDK7 enzyme, for the first time identifying such targets on a large scale in human cells.  Further, we 4) tested pre-clinical compounds that inhibit the CDK7 enzyme, as well as a CDK7 inhibitor currently being used in the clinic, as an anti-cancer agent.  CDK7 is an emerging therapeutic target for a variety of cancers, and therefore a better understanding of its function will aid in the design of next-generation therapeutics.  We have discovered a new way that CDK7 controls cell physiology, which will have broad implications for both clinical and basic research.  5) Identification of so-called \"Mediator kinases\" CDK8 and CDK19 as therapeutic targets to mitigate hyperactive inflammation in Down syndrome individuals. We demonstrated that inhibition of CDK8/CDK19 antagonizes hyperactive inflammation in a variety of ways, involving transcription, metabolites, and cytokines. Chronic inflammation contributes to Down syndrome co-morbidities and mitigation would benefit this population; moreover, our results may have relevance for other diseases caused by chronic inflammation. 6) Identification of the human general transcription factor TFIID as a genome-wide regulator of RNA polymerase II pausing.  This pausing step for RNA polymerase II is a universal regulatory intermediate; consequently, RNA polymerase II pausing is disrupted in human disease and is also targeted by pathogens and viruses to hijack the human cellular machinery and cause disease.  The discovery that the TFIID protein factor is required for RNA polymerase II pausing has led to new understanding of this basic process and reveals new strategies to target and control with therapeutic agents. \n\n            Separate from the scientific advances that were enabled by the NSF funding, many PhD students, undergraduates, and even high school students were supported by the grant.  The training they received ensures a highly skilled US workforce, which maintains our competitive advantage in science, medicine, and technology.  The highly trained graduates (PhD and undergraduates) go on to work at US companies (e.g. pharmaceutical, biotech, biomedicine, engineering or manufacturing) and/or start their own companies. Moreover, the discoveries made in academic labs drive further innovations at private companies, and often new companies are started based upon discoveries or technologies developed in academic labs, supported by the NSF.  These private companies hire workers (i.e. the companies are job creators).  The workers hired must be highly trained and their training comes from academic labs; the workers pay taxes, and so on.  The result is that NSF funding is an investment in the American people, an investment that yields a very high return in both tangible (i.e. new tax revenue returned to the US treasury) and intangible ways.  This investment also ensures that the United States can continue to dominate the world in science and innovation, which is essential to maintain our quality of life, our strong military, and our ability to influence other nations to act in the best interests of the United States of America.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/22/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Shimon Weiss"
