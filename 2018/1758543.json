 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is its capability to create a positive impact on current and future wireless systems. Multifunctional reconfigurable antenna (MRA) technology targeted in this project enables a single antenna element to dynamically change its frequency band, radiation pattern and polarization properties, which directly impact the radio-frequency (RF) coverage, capacity, and quality of service achieved by any wireless network. Machine-to-machine communications, Internet of Things applications, satellite communications, radar-based sensing, and tactical military communications are just a few of the areas that will benefit from the results of this work. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and commercialize MRA arrays for use in 802.11ac/ax WLAN systems and 5G mm-wave systems based on new radio specifications. 5G systems require exploitation of massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) technology with a large number of antennas to attain significantly improved spectral efficiency, thereby achieving required network capacities and enhanced connectivity. Massive MIMO is also needed to overcome severe propagation losses in mm-wave bands, where large swaths of spectrum is available. If a MIMO system uses legacy dumb antennas with fixed properties, the resulting complexity and cost figures, and the power consumption associated with a large number of RF front ends render them commercially prohibitive. The MRA array technology delivers 3-10 dB higher array gain compared to legacy arrays. Such gains can be used to improve RF coverage, increase user throughput, and reduce network costs by lowering the number of RF nodes or reduce the cost, size and power consumption of access point equipment by lowering the number of antenna elements. This project will deliver the beta prototypes of two MRA array modules containing the hardware and control algorithm that can be seamlessly integrated with WLAN and 5G small-cell modems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
