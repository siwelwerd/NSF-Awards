 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to investigate how network relationships among complex and smaller-scale societies structure, and are restructured by, migration. Prior scholarship on intercultural contacts emphasizes interaction spheres, hybridization, technological transfer, or models of exchange as measures for constructing borders and defining societal membership. Understanding and accounting for historical and relational context, on the other hand, is critical to the development of a coherent and generalizable theory of intercultural contact. Archaeology is well suited to explore the complex sociocultural formations that result from intercultural contact by capturing transformations in relationships between communities following contact. This research contributes to broader social and intellectual benefit by enhancing understanding of the impact of migration on social structure, which is an important analytical issue due to the prevalence of migration induced by war, climatic instability, economic insecurity, and social unrest in contemporary and prehistoric settings. Historical context will also be provided for understanding how and perhaps why different approaches to multicultural coexistence may lead to stable advantageous outcomes or encourage instability and conflict. \r\n\r\nThis project will examine the role of network interrelationships as indicators of how both local societies and non-local migrant peoples approach intercultural social and economic relations. Through the application of a multiple relations, or multilayer, social network analysis methodology it is possible to gain insight into the various networks that connect communities to one another. It is also possible to scrutinize changes in social structure following a migration process. Andrew Upton, a doctoral student at Michigan State University will address the role of ceramic industry in the transformation of communal-scale interaction and identification networks across the Middle to Late Mississippian transition in the Late Prehistoric central Illinois River Valley. . Analysis of network models will clarify how a circa 1300 A.D. in-migration of an Oneota tribal group restructured social relationships in a Mississippian chiefly environment and how communities negotiated multicultural regional cohabitation. Laser ablation inductively couple plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) will provide clues to model networks of clay resource acquisition and exchange of cooking and serving pottery. Analysis of distributions of stylistic decorations on pots will reveal networks of categorical identification based on ascription to common social units and nonverbal communication. Technological characterization data related to pottery vessel form will elucidate shared relationships of learning and the transmission of culture through time. In providing a dynamic and multi-faceted view on social structure, this research contributes to a more nuanced understanding of social and economic transformations resulting from cultural contact.",

What happens when cultures come into contact, and how can we study this phenomenon using archaeological evidence? Archaeologists know that communities are free to pursue various types of interaction in the multicultural contexts that result from culture contact, ranging from the maintenance of ethnic or cultural distinctions through social and political pluralism to the adoption of traits as part of processes of ethnogenesis, or the merging and blending of cultural groups. This study defines expectations for these and other possible outcomes to culture contact and a methodology to test for them using a case study from Illinois' archaeological record. As a result, this research contributes to broader social and intellectual benefit by enhancing understanding of the impact of migration on social structure, which is an important analytical issue due to the prevalence of migration induced by war, climatic instability, economic insecurity, and social unrest in contemporary and prehistoric settings.</p>\n<p>This project explores changes in regional scale social interaction by studying pottery made by Ancestors of Native American peoples. Because it was made by hand, pottery encodes a rich tapestry of information about the people who made it. By measuring the form of various aspects of a pottery vessel, it is possible to explore the cultural transmission of pottery manufacturing techniques. By categorizing pottery decoration, it is possible to examine artistic techniques and the social identities they reflect. Finally, by assessing the chemical composition of pottery, it is possible to explore economic relationships such as what raw material resources might have been used to make a vessel and whether or not vessels may have been exchanged between communities. Together, each of these layers of information tell a story about how peoples interacted along the central portion of the Illinois River about 1,000 years ago and how those interactions changed when a different group of people moved into the region about 700 years ago. Findings suggest that this migration may have been prompted by a breakdown of economic relationships and a proliferation of social identities among the indigenous population. Following in-migration, cultural pluralism between communities was largely pursued in how individuals socially identified themselves and different communities typically did not share raw materials or exchange pottery vessels. Diverging social identities and deteriorating economic relationships among indigenous communities may have prompted the external group to migrate into the host region and in some ways structured where migrant peoples settled. However, potters made vessels in very similar ways and even transferred pottery technology in some multicultural communities following the migration. This suggests that communities still frequently interacted in some capacity, likely around the cooking and serving of food.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/18/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Andrew&nbsp;Upton</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1745150/1745150_10523916_1550536679917_CIRV_sites_lidar--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1745150/1745150_10523916_1550536679917_CIRV_sites_lidar--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Map of Late Prehistoric Central Illinois River Valley\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1745150/1745150_10523916_1550536679917_CIRV_sites_lidar--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Map of Late Prehistoric Central Illinois River Valley\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Map shows town, village, and smaller tertiary sites in the Late Prehistoric CIRV</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Andrew Upton</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Andrew&nbsp;Upton</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Map of Late Prehistoric Central Illinois River Valley</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1745150/1745150_10523916_1550536846930_Slide1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1745150/1745150_10523916_1550536846930_Slide1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Pre-Migration Multilayer Network\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1745150/1745150_10523916_1550536846930_Slide1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Pre-Migration Multilayer Network\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Each layer represents a distinct network and the strength of relationship ties is modeled via color in a multilayer network model of social interrelationships in the pre-migration time period CIRV (circa 1200 - 1300 A.D.)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Andrew Upton</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Andrew&nbsp;Upton</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Pre-Migration Multilayer Network</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1745150/1745150_10523916_1550536915749_Slide1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1745150/1745150_10523916_1550536915749_Slide1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Post-Migration Multilayer Network\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1745150/1745150_10523916_1550536915749_Slide1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Post-Migration Multilayer Network\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Each layer represents a distinct network and the strength of relationship ties is modeled via color in a multilayer network model of social interrelationships in the post-migration time period CIRV (circa 1300 - 1450 A.D.)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Andrew Upton</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Andrew&nbsp;Upton</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Post-Migration Multilayer Network</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
