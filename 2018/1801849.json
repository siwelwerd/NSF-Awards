 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project explores questions in commutative algebra.  Commutative algebra is the study of solutions of polynomial equations, which are ubiquitous throughout science.  One way to study polynomial functions is to view them instead in a simpler clock-arithmetic-like setting (where for example, 6+7 = 1, in other words, 7 hours after 6 o'clock is 1 o'clock).  Translating between these two number systems has been a fruitful strategy for centuries, with applications on both sides; for example, this sort of mathematics is essential in modern secure communications systems.   This project aims to develop tools to help work directly in what is called a \"mixed characteristic\" setting, which sits between the classical numerical world and the clock-arithmetic-like setting.  These tools will help unify the classical and clock arithmetic settings. The investigator plans to develop packages for open source software and to write a book on these topics.  The project includes training of graduate students through involvement in the research.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to develop a theory of singularities in mixed characteristic commutative algebra, with an eye towards geometric applications.  This theory will unify and generalize the singularities coming from the minimal model program in algebraic geometry with the singularities coming out of tight closure theory in commutative algebra.  Recent advances in commutative algebra utilizing the theory of perfectoid algebras and spaces has made now the right time to develop this theory.  These tools should be able to replace Kodaira-type vanishing theorems in some applications where the latter do not apply.  Inspired by these connections, the investigator will also study characteristic 0 and characteristic p > 0 commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCommutative algebra and algebraic geometry are the study of polynomial equations and the shapes they define, for instance the equation y=x2 defines a parabola.  Within these fields, one active area of research is the study of singularities.  That is, when the equations define geometric singularities (for instance, if the graph crosses over itself).  Such singularities occur naturally even if the original geometric objects being studied do not have singularities.  For instance, they appear as the shapes are deformed (typically by changing the coefficients of the equations defining said shapes).\n\nIntellectual merit: This project is aimed at interpolating between the classical geometric picture and the modular arithmetic (or clock arithmetic) picture (which is a key part of modern communication systems). Modular arithmetic geometry studies geometry in a setting where numbers wrap back over onto themselves.  In particular, if the prime ones picks is p = 5, then 2+3 = 0, and 3+3 = 1, and 4+3 = 2, etc.  Such number systems change the way geometry works as well, simplifying some things, and making others more complicated.\n\nThere is an intermediate setting between the classical and modular arithmetic worlds where one studies geometry over the integers.  In particular, the PI studied equations over the integers (that is geometry over the whole numbers) and the singularities those equations defined.  This topic has aspects of both classical geometric singularities and the more exotic modular arithmetic setting.  It also connects the two worlds.  To do this, we utilized recent breakthrough results of Andre, Bhatt, Gabber, Kedlaya, Liu, Scholze and others from number theory.  Algebra and geometry in this setting is called mixed characteristic.\n\nSome specific outcomes include the development of a theory of singularities in mixed characteristic.  The PI and collaborators were then were able to use this theory to obtain important structural applications in mixed characteristic algebraic geometry.  They were also able to use these idea in other ways.  For instance, the PI and his collaborators were able to use our interpolation to prove that certain types of singularities in the classical setting were particularly simple (that they were rational singularities) by using a computer to check that the analogous equations were particularly simple in characteristic p&gt;0 (where the computer is able to check the conditions much more quickly).\n\nBroader impacts:  The PI has continued to train graduate students and he graduated Ph.D. students in 2019 and 2020, as well as a masters student in 2021.  He has run multiple REU projects with undergraduates focused on developing software for use in the above research projects which are publicly available on github and in most cases are already incorporated into the Macaulay2 build tree.  The PI has also mentored postdocs.  Finally, the PI has organized conferences during this grant.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/14/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Karl E Schwede"
