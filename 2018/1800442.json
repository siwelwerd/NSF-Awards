 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vaccines and antibodies are proteins. The effectiveness of every dose depends on maintaining the three-dimensional structure of the protein. At room temperature, dissolved in water, proteins can rearrange their structure, possibly denaturing them. The strategy most often employed to preserve protein structure is refrigeration. This slows but does not stop denaturing. The shelf-life of any vaccine is therefore limited, leading to spoilage of millions of dollars of vaccines and antibodies each year. Improving protein stability would provide a great benefit to human health, especially if high stability could be achieved at room temperature. This project will evaluate the use of novel solvents, called ionic liquids, as a means to stabilize proteins in solution. The ultimate goal is to maintain protein activity for extended periods of time. This project will provide research experiences to undergraduates and high school students, with a focus on recruiting participants from underrepresented populations. This outreach will strengthen the pipeline of students entering and remaining in science, engineering and technology (STEM) programs. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe state of a protein is defined by its local intra- and inter-molecular interactions. These include the effects of the solvent environment. The addition of ionic liquids (ILs) to the solution might further stabilize the protein. The project objectives are to determine the solvent role (i.e., IL-water composition) on protein stability and structure using spectroscopy and atomistic simulations, to understand protein solubility behavior, and to determine the activity of IL-recovered proteins. Specific goals include extending the time-window of protein stability at both ambient and elevated temperatures and increasing the retention of protein activity after extended storage in IL-containing solutions. This project should provide molecular-level insights into specific effects on protein structure and stability.  Simulations will amplify the interpretation of experimental results and also serve as a guide to future experiments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProteins affect our society through numerous ways.  They are critical components of medicines, diagnostics, food products, and even cleaning agents.  The function of many proteins is largely determined by their molecular shape, called structure.  Therefore it is imperative to understand and improve the maintenance of protein structure.  In this project we explored the use of ionic liquids, also called organic salts, as additives to help preserve protein structure and function.  These additives have the potential to eliminate the need for refrigeration during protein storage and therefore to mitigate spoilage losses.\n\nWe studied the effect of two ionic liquid additives using lysozyme as our model protein enzyme.  Our data support a picture where protein function can be inhibited due to excessive strength of local protein-ion interactions.  Nevertheless even at high concentrations the ionic liquids do not perturb the protein stability to the same degree as strong destabilizers such as urea.  In our following work we found that the protein secondary structure is maintained in ionic liquids for at least one year, therefore indicating that the inhibition of function is most likely due to blocking of the protein's \"active site\" (left panel, attached image).  Importantly, we also learned that the protein function could be restored by a simple rehydration process (right panel, attached image), loosely analogous to preparing instant Ramen noodles.  A consequence of this result is the potential for a rather easy method for functional protein recovery from non-traditional solvents.  It is of future interest for ourselves and other researchers to explore the generality of these results using other protein and ionic liquid combinations.     \n\nOver the course of this project, 1 post-doctoral scholar and 3 undergraduates received training in numerous research techniques.  They were also encouraged and given opportunities to present their work through oral and poster presentations in both local and national venues, which they did.  This work resulted in 2 published peer-reviewed journal articles with a third currently in preparation.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/18/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Harry Bermudez"
