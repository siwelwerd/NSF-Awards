Fundamental understanding of the quantum behaviors of these systems is crucial for developing novel materials and molecules with tailored properties and can also lead to the prediction of new states of matter.\r\n\r\nThe development of novel algorithms and software for solving the equations of quantum mechanics that describe systems of many interacting constituents remains one of the most important theoretical techniques. The PI is the inventor of one of the most prominent of these algorithms, the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), and continues developing ITensor, a widely used software library for carrying out these calculations. Building on the PI's work, a large international group of scientists has extended DMRG to a new field of physics, tensor networks, with applications ranging from chemistry to the physics of black holes and to the quantum theory of gravity. The PI's current work is focused on quantum spin liquids and on high-temperature superconductivity. Spin liquids are a novel state of matter whose unusual properties could enable building a quantum computer, which can solve certain problems exponentially faster than any currently existing computer. High-temperature superconductivity is important for both fundamental reasons as well as for applications. Conceptually, understanding how high-temperature superconductivity works is considered one of the most important problems in condensed matter physics. High-temperature superconductors are already used in a number of important applications, such as wireless communications and power transmission. Unraveling how high-temperature superconductivity emerges in certain materials might enable the creation of long-sought room-temperature superconductors.\r\n\r\nThis research provides excellent opportunities for training the next generation of theoretical scientists. The further development of the ITensor software library is making DMRG and tensor-network methods available and useful for a broad range of scientists that will not have to develop the software themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe Division of Materials Research and the Chemistry Division jointly fund this award, which supports research and education aimed at understanding strongly interacting quantum systems in condensed matter, cold atoms, and chemical systems. The work consists primarily of simulating model systems and of developing new algorithms for enabling these simulations. The primary application of the work is to frustrated spin systems and to doped fermion systems (such as the high-temperature superconductors), which suffer from the sign problem that makes quantum Monte Carlo methods ineffective. Of particular interest are spin liquid systems, a novel state of matter that can occur in frustrated spin systems. Spin liquids exhibit topological order, and their unusual properties could be used for eliminating decoherence, a requirement for creating a quantum computer. Experimental studies sometimes cannot distinguish between disordered spin systems and true quantum spin liquids; this project will clarify which systems are true quantum spin liquids. The project also involves studying high-temperature superconductors, in particular the competition between stripes and other inhomogeneities with superconductivity, and the nature of the pseudogap phase. Of particular interest is studying the effect of long-range Coulomb interactions between electrons and their effect on the competition between stripes and superconductivity.\r\n\r\nThe PI is the inventor of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), one of the leading algorithms for simulating 1D systems. Within the last decade, DMRG has become part of a larger field, tensor networks, and has become closely associated with quantum information science. The PI's work in algorithms now incorporates many of the ideas of tensor networks. The PI will further develop ITensor, a widely used software library for carrying out DMRG and tensor network calculations.\r\n\r\nThis research provides excellent opportunities for training the next generation of theoretical scientists. The further development of the ITensor software library is making DMRG and tensor-network methods available and useful for a broad range of scientists that will not have to develop the software themselves.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCondensed matter physics is the study of how materials form and what properties they have, based on the fundamental laws of physics. Of particular interest are materials with exotic and useful properties.  One of the most famous such properties is superconductivity, where electrical current flows without losses, due to quantum effects. Less known but also exciting are exotic quantum states of matter which may help us build quantum computers.  One such type of quantum state is called a spin liquid, which is built with the ingredients of a magnet, but has no magnetism due to quantum fluctuations.\n\nTo study such systems theoretically, one must overcome the exponential wall of quantum complexity: ordinary computer-based approaches would require an exponentially large and fast computer to study the systems of interest, and such computers do not exist.  An exciting application of quantum computers would be to overcome this wall directly.  However, with current, non-quantum computers there are also clever algorithms which can overcome the wall in many cases to a good approximation.  The PI is the inventor of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG),  one of the most powerful of these algorithms for studying quantum systems.  The PI's group applies DMRG to a variety of  frustrated spin and doped fermion systems, and further develops DMRG algorithms to improve their accuracy and performance.\n\n\nA key area of application of DMRG is to the high temperature superconducting cuprate materials.  To study these materials, models have been developed which when solved, overcoming an expontial wall, should describe these materials. The most famous such model is the Hubbard model.  The PI's group has applied DMRG to the Hubbard model, finding that many of the properties of the model closely match those of the cuprate materials.  However, in terms of superconductivity itself, the model was found to be nonsuperconducting in its simplest form.  This result was done in conjunction with another powerful algorithm, quantum Monte Carlo, to produce a more certain result.  This work now makes clear that corrections and enhancements of the Hubbard model are needed to unravel the secrets of the cuprate superconductors.\n\nAnother key area of application is to spin liquids and other exotic phases in antiferromagnets on triangular lattices.  The PI, in a collaboration with Sasha Chernyshev's group at UCI, laid out a broad picture and phase diagram of anisotropic-exchange magnets on ideal nearest-neighbor triangular lattices.  They investigated transitions between five principal phases: ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, a dual form of this antiferromagnetism, and two striped phases.  They found spin-wave instabilities to long-range spiral-like states, with a connection to a spin-liquid phase also existing in this model.\n\nThe algorithms developed by the PI and group continue to have broad application to chemistry, computer science, and numerical analysis. The group continues to develop their ITensor software library, which has become the leading DMRG and tensor software library.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven R White"
