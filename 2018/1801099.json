 "awd_abstract_narration": "California faces a shortage in qualified Science, Technology, Engineering and Math/Career and Technical Education (STEM/CTE) instructors who have the work experience, proficiency in academic subject areas, and pedagogical knowledge to effectively prepare high school and community college students for careers. With 32 trade and technical schools and 28 community colleges offering CTE programs in the San Francisco Bay Area alone, the need for well-prepared CTE teachers in this region is enormous. To meet the workforce needs of the science- and technology-focused economy of the San Francisco Bay Area, it is critical that CTE teacher preparation efforts include a commitment to increasing the pool of qualified STEM teachers at the secondary and community college level. The City College of San Francisco's \"Growing CTE/STEM Teachers\" project aims to ensure that clear pathways exist for future STEM/CTE teachers at the high school and community college levels. These pathways will include resources, support, information, courses, and partnerships with employers. The project will focus on those priority or emerging industry sectors identified by the California Community Colleges Chancellors Office. These include: advanced manufacturing; advanced transportation and renewables; agriculture, water and environmental technologies; energy efficiency and utilities; ICT/digital media; and life sciences/biotechnology. \r\n\r\nThis project will carry out four primary activities in pursuit of its goal of increasing the pool of qualified STEM teachers at the secondary and community college level. First, the project team will engage in outreach to recruit high school students, community college students, and individuals already in the workforce into CTE/STEM teacher preparation pathways. Second, the principal investigators (PIs) will provide student support services to increase persistence and completion rates. Third, the PIs will provide technical assistance and professional development to other colleges in the region and statewide and serve as a clearinghouse for technical assistance and professional development, especially in the area of CTE/STEM teacher preparation. Finally, the project will advocate for CTE/STEM teacher preparation as a vital part of the statewide infrastructure supporting STEM-based CTE industries.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The crisis is particularly dire in subjects most critical to building a competitive workforce: STEM and CTE. Growing CTE/STEM Teachers was launched in 2018 to respond to the crisis.  \nThe project\u2019s intellectual merit is an innovative approach to recruiting and preparing diverse CTE/STEM teachers. For decades, California\u2019s teacher recruitment projects and funds sought to identify and support CTE/STEM teaching candidates in their final years of college. This strategy is not effective.\nTargeting students in high school and early in their college careers, the project pairs City College of San Francisco\u2019s Teacher Prep Programs (TPP) hands-on approach to teacher education with the College\u2019s new and NSF-supported MakerSpace curriculum.  Students\u2019 interest in teaching is stimulated as they experiment in Maker courses, apply STEM and CTE skills and knowledge to build and innovate, and work alongside teachers in classrooms where they have a direct impact on improving learning opportunities for younger students in their own neighborhoods.  Hands-on experiences are supported with classroom content on teaching pedagogy, offered within the context that teaching is social justice in action  The project intentionally recruited diverse groups of students including African American, Latino/a students, women, Asian Pacific Islanders and students with limited STEM success and included high school students in dual-enrollment pathways and community college students who may not \"see\" themselves as CTE/STEM teachers.\nThe PI and Co-PI led regional initiatives to (i) grow and diversify the CA Bay Area\u2019s teaching workforce; (ii) increase awareness of and support for teacher recruitment and preparation; and (iii) utilize MakerSpaces as an entry point for STEM instruction.  During the project period, Teach for the Bay, led by the PI, became a major force in networking the region\u2019s teacher preparation programs and leveraging additional support for teacher education, including through innovative apprenticeship programs.  Outcomes included:\n\n Development of a Maker Studies program certificate and five courses including MAKR 33 specifically for teachers - 228 students\n\nFieldwork and work experiences courses in classrooms - 720 students \n\n\nChild Development and Education pedagogy courses -1,354 students \n\n\nCounseling, advising and career and employment workshops - 1146 students\n\n\n\n\nFree, virtual conferences open to the San Francisco Bay region for community college and high school students interested in teaching careers:\n\nTeach for the Bay #1- October 5-9, 2021 - 2774 enrollments \n\nTeach for the Bay #2 - October 6-8, 2021 - 1500 enrollments \n\nConference Presentations on the Role of Making and Makerspaces in Education:Nation of Makers, NACCE/ MakeShift, MIRA, NSF/ATE/PI, BA MakerFaire, CSU Making, ISAM\nConference Presentations onTeacher Preparation: NCATE, ACCCTEP, TPP, CCCAOE, CAN, BACCC    \n\n\n Publications/Awards: \n\n\nCommunity College and High School Career Technical Education (CTE) Shortages in the SF BAY Region;  July 2020\n\n\nATE Project Summary; September 2021\n\n\nReceived \"Pitch for the Trades\" award, NACCE and the Ratcliffe Foundation Award\n\n\nCOVID significantly impacted project from midpoint to end. All activities moved online. No courses were cancelled and Maker kits were mailed to students homes. Strategies to teach lab concepts in a distance education format were developed.\nEvaluation findings were used to make adjustments in implementation; document progress toward outcomes; and gather evidence to test the viability of the project\u2019s alternative approach to growing a diverse CTE/STEM teaching workforce.  Findings included:\n\nConsistent increases in students\u2019 interest in teaching/working with young people after completing education courses with classroom field experience.  In 2021, for example, 12% of 133 participants in the summer classroom fieldwork course reported an increased interest in teaching after taking the course. The surveys also found that among all participants black and brown students experienced the greatest increases. These results are consistent with findings from surveys and focus groups conducted by the evaluator during all three years of the project. \nHigh level of engagement in the MAKR courses developed with NSF support. Interviews with the PI and CO-PI found continuous efforts to strengthen, innovate and adapt when COVID moved the courses online. \nThe Teach for the Bay website and conference was monitored by the evaluator and were effective.The PI's established the \"Teaching is Social Justice in Action\" framework.\n\n\nSurvey and interview findings consistently found evidence supporting the project\u2019s alternative approach to teacher recruitment.  Students provided with the opportunity to work in classrooms and community-based programs became more interested in teaching and open to working with young people.
