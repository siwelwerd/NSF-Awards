 "awd_abstract_narration": "Each year in the Northern Hemisphere, birds, bats, and insects fly north in spring and south in autumn. These aerial migrations have fascinated people for millennia; however, given the difficulty of tracking animals flying through the open skies, little is known about the rules that govern life in the air. Human activities have local and global impacts on these migrations by eliminating stopover habitats where migrants rest and refuel during their hazardous journeys and by altering atmospheric conditions. This project asks whether aerial migrants can keep pace with these rapid changes and what traits make some migrants more adaptable to change than others. The collaborative team of biologists and meteorologists will develop and employ advanced animal tracking methods to reveal both the precise locations of birds during migratory flights and the atmospheric conditions they fly through. This tracking will include novel microsensors placed on birds and aerial vehicles to collect heretofore-elusive data streams that reveal the environment experienced by birds in flight. The research team will combine these new observations with weather radar data from across the U.S. that already captures massive quantities of data on migrating birds, bats, and insects as they fly over the countryside. This combination of new and existing data may yield novel insights into migrant behavior within their changing atmospheric habitats. By bringing together scientists across disciplines, this research will develop and test different ways to enhance communication, collaboration, and teamwork among the next generation of students and their teachers. Finally, this project will communicate to the public how the changing environment influences the timing of migration over and through their communities.  Workshops in schools and community centers and work with local landowners will foster \"citizen science\" and adaptive strategies to contribute to this national effort. \r\n\r\nTo uncover scaling rules that control phenology of life in the air, this study implements a research framework that integrates the spatiotemporal rescaling hypothesis and the metabolic theory of ecology. From this basis the study predicts that seasonal phenology of aerial migration is accelerating in response to environmental changes and that small-bodied migrants should have a greater capacity to speed up migration than larger-bodied migrants. The project studies the central flyway of North America and focuses on the impact of the central plains low-level jet on aerial migration patterns. The low-level jet is a prominent feature of the North American atmosphere to which many aerial migrants are known to be highly adapted. Recent evidence that the low-level jet is both expanding in geographic scope and intensity provides an ideal context for testing the study's predictions. The project team will leverage existing open-access and newly collected data from two coincident aerial migration systems; nocturnal bird and insect migration. Sensors for tracking location and atmospheric conditions will be placed on migratory birds that span two orders of magnitude in body size. Integrated biological and meteorological data will be used to improve our understanding of the rescaling of the low-level jet and to test predictions about how that rescaling impacts the phenology of life in the air.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project investigated the limits to which migratory species can cope with climate warming. This warming is speeding up many biological and biophysical processes such as snow melt, evaporation and transpiration of moisture, seasonal greening of vegetation. While these changes drive behaviors, adaptation, and evolution in many organisms, the limits to these mechanisms of coping with climate warming are not well known. This project focused on whether the speed of avian migration is constrained by relationships between body size and energy demand required for migration. One primary prediction is that small-bodied migrants will having more capacity to track the speed of climate warming than large-bodied migrants. Several approaches were used to address this question. First, we assembled archived migration tracking data of over 200 individual birds representing 19 species and a wide range of body sizes. For individuals, we compiled daily decisions as to whether birds undertook a long-distance flight or remained in the same area, and we examined whether local weather conditions were correlated to each fly/no-fly decision. We also collected new, detailed geospatial migration data on 2 species of waterbirds that migrate through the central plains of North. We used these data to assess optimal migration routes that take into account weather variables across a range of relevant altitudes. Yet another approach to our research question used long-term community-science data to investigate whether body size and migration distance influence migrant birds&rsquo; ability to respond to climate change. Finally, we used NEXRAD radar network to produce the first continental scale view of the spatial and temporal distributions of day-flying insects. Taken together, these research approaches supported our prediction that smaller migrants are potentially more responsive to ongoing climate-change trends.

The workshop was based on a &ldquo;Shiny app\" in the R coding language through which the teachers could visualize seasonal timing data for vegetation green up, insect emergence, and migratory bird arrival dates. Teachers simulated different timing mismatches and create hypotheses about the consequences of different mismatch scenarios. These scenarios formed the basis for lesson planning exercises in which teachers created classroom activities for their students to learn about the concepts of phenology, climate change and tropic interactions.

By incorporating some mechanical automation and computer-aided video analysis into the moonwatching paradigm, we can now observe the body orientations of individual birds in conjunction with their flight direction to infer the influence of crosswinds. Similarly, we published a novel account of social behavior (i.e. flying as groups) in nocturnally migratory birds, which challenged the long-held assumption that they fly singly. We also employed moonwatching in three separate radar validation studies that involved a mobile weather radar, a stationary WSR-88D (NEXRAD) radar, and a BirdScan radar designed to detect flying animals.
