 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award establishes a technician in the Hydrogeophysics Laboratory at the University of Wyoming.  The purpose of this technician is to provide a novel link between broad Earth science research and quantitative geophysical measurement to understand Earth processes experimentally, and to assist in training students and scientists. Revealing properties and processes about the near-subsurface environment - deeper than can be accessed with manual probes, in multiple space and/or time dimensions - is important to promoting the progress of environmental geoscience. Hydrogeophysics encompasses the observation and measurement of hydrologic processes and anomalies from the Earth's surface to the depth of the deepest groundwater that is connected to modern hydrologic systems. Research enabled by this diverse set of geophysical methods spans much of Earth science: glaciology, sedimentology, hydrology, ecology, and others. This award enables a range of scientists across the country to access resources of the Hydrogeophysics Laboratory and related measurement expertise. \r\n\r\nThe core mission of this project is to provide an experimental hydrogeophysical technician at the University of Wyoming who serves the broad geoscience community in support of experimental hydrogeophysical research. The objectives are to: 1) enable a broad range of scientists to benefit from hydrogeophysical measurements, 2) provide instrument and methodology training, 3) contribute to methodological advancements, and 4) enhance outreach. The technician performs measurements and assists visitors in using or designing experimental apparatus, and with sample preparation. The technician focuses on ground penetrating radar, electrical resistivity, and nuclear magnetic geophysical methods. In the lab, primary efforts are directed towards supporting experimental research and material property calibrations. Experimental hydrogeophysics work is also conducted outside the brick-and-mortar lab, and therefore the technician also provides support to related field experiments, particularly related to acquiring samples and ancillary measurements needed to develop material property transform functions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
