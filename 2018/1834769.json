 "awd_abstract_narration": "To improve student persistence in STEM majors, this project at Illinois College will adapt, implement, and enhance a model of supplemental instruction that was designed at California State Fullerton (NSF Award 1432829).  The enhanced supplemental instruction model will include training to help students develop a growth mindset, which includes the perspective that effort can overcome academic difficulties.  Advanced undergraduate students will be trained as supplemental instruction leaders and will work under faculty mentors to lead mindset training activities in science and math classes. It is expected that mindset training will help students develop learning skills that they can transfer from introductory to advanced courses, thereby increasing their academic confidence and success.  If successful in achieving its goals, this project's combination of supplemental instruction and mindset training may be applicable to any undergraduate STEM course. \r\n \r\nThe goal of this project is to determine whether the integration of peer supplemental instruction with mindset training activities (derived from research on student growth mindset, non-cognitive skills, and \"grit\") will improve learning outcomes and persistence of students in undergraduate STEM courses. The supplemental instruction activities will complement classroom and laboratory activities in both gateway and upper-level courses.  The project goals are to increase students' awareness of their learning experiences and to help them embrace the inherent challenge of learning, which is expected to translate improved learning outcomes for students and for supplemental instruction student leaders. Project objectives include: (1) determining the effectiveness of a supplemental instruction model for STEM courses that integrates Enhanced Mindset Instruction; (2) developing metacognition, self-efficacy, and growth mindset of supplemental instruction student leaders' so they can facilitate STEM students' persistence to STEM degree completion; and (3) developing metacognition, self-efficacy, and growth mindset of STEM students, to increase their persistence to STEM degree completion. Results of project assessment and evaluation will add to the body of knowledge about effective practices for student learning, especially in STEM courses.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
