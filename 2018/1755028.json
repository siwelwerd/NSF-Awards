 "awd_abstract_narration": "The spectacular diversity of spiders and their role as key predators across the globe can largely be attributed to their innovative uses of silk. For instance, a golden orb-web spider or a black widow can spin six different types of dry fibers and a wet adhesive silk. The wet adhesive silks made by these spiders and their relatives (the megadiverse superfamily Araneoidea) afford them greater prey retention for a lower material cost than the dry prey capture silk spun by other spider groups. Furthermore, these silk glues achieve adhesiveness in a wide variety of environments, including extreme humidity conditions that challenge commercial glues. A multidisciplinary team from three institutions will investigate how variation in adhesive protein components relates to variation in the glue's material properties. The wet adhesive silks of the 18 target species have significant variation in adhesiveness, material efficiency, and response to humidity. Thus, the discovery of constituent proteins will allow design of environmentally friendly glues with tailored properties. Furthermore, web-building spiders offer many opportunities for science educators to integrate biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics as they engage their students in the natural world. The team of investigators will mentor undergraduate and Master's students, as well as incorporate the research into undergraduate course curricula. Additionally, team members will offer science enrichment activities at rural Virginia public elementary schools, run workshops for middle and high school science teachers, and mentor New York City high school students to complete original research projects.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evolutionary diversity of spider aqueous glues offers a unique opportunity compared to other bioadhesives to determine how molecular building blocks contribute to different aspects of adhesion. By integrating transcriptomics, proteomics, and biomechanics within a phylogenetic framework, the proposed experiments will pinpoint protein characteristics that co-evolve with interfacial adhesion, intra-glue cohesion, and humidity responsiveness. Objective 1 identifies shifts in gene expression associated with the evolution of wet adhesive silk by profiling transcriptional diversity in each of the silk gland types of 5 divergent araneoid species and 3 outgroup taxa. It also investigates evolution of expression levels in the adhesive-producing silk glands of an additional 13 species that build different web types and forage under divergent humidity levels. Objective 2 identifies and quantitates the proteins that compose adhesive silks of all 18 species, as well as their post-translational modifications. Objective 3 measures wet adhesive silk material properties for the same 18 species at different humidities. These integrated experiments will contribute to understanding the origin and molecular underpinnings of a key innovation. Specifically, they will determine the degree to which gene expression shifts and new genes were required to make a novel type of silk. The proposed work will track evolutionary rates in glue protein characteristics, including post-translational modifications, which is currently poorly understood. Finally, glue material property measurements will test the hypothesis that humidity responsiveness of spider glue droplets has evolved for optimal performance at the humidity in which a spider species typically forages.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These water-based, natural glues are nontoxic and responsive to changes in environmental humidity, features that make them attractive models for engineering new adhesives. One objective of our study was to provide a more complete inventory of the elastic modulus, toughness, adhesion, and extensibility of the glue proteins of orb weaving spiders, a group that is comprised of 4,700 species, and to do so across humidities. A second objective was to determine if the glues of cobweb spiders, which include 2,800 species, have changed since this clade diverged from their orb weaving ancestors. These studies brought the number of species whose glues characterized in this way to 19 (Figure 1).</p>\n<p>The studies are reported in 10 peer-review publications and another two in preparation. One masters student was trained and ten undergraduate students were mentored. Public presentations introduced citizens of Virginia to the biology of orb weaving spiders and the features of their webs.</p>\n<p><strong>Orb web glue.</strong> Each tiny, regularly spaced glue droplet on an orb web&rsquo;s capture thread is formed of an adhesive protein core surround by a hygroscopic aqueous solution. Movies captured during droplet extension allowed us to construct stress-strain curves that described a droplet&rsquo;s behavior during extension. From these curves we determine a droplet&rsquo;s adhesive force, elastic modulus, and toughness. We found that glue droplets of species from exposed, weedy habitats where humidity drops during the day are very hygroscopic and have low elastic modulus and toughness even at lower humidities. In contrast, glue droplets of species from humid forests are much less hygroscopic and their adhesive proteins have greater elastic modulus and toughness. Forest edge species exhibited intermediate properties. These data allowed us to revise a model of droplet adhesion that explains how glue droplet spreading and cohesion interact to optimize adhesion and how this optimal balance differs among species (Figure 2).</p>\n<p><strong>Cobweb glue.</strong> Orb webs rely on regularly and closely spaced capture threads to retain flying insects, whereas cobwebs are formed of an upper tangle of non-sticky threads from which more widely spaced and randomly distributed stickily gumfoot line extend to a surface (Figure 3). These gumfoot lines are specialized to capture crawling insects. When an insect contacts and sticks to a gumfoot line, the line&rsquo;s weak pyriform anchor released from the surface, causing the taut gumfoot line to pull the insect from the surface and rendering its struggle to escape less effective.</p>\n<p>We compared the material properties of four cobweb species in the family Theridiidae: the eastern and western black widow, the common house spider, and the false widow. Each species glue droplets were analyzed at 20%, 37%, 55%, 72%, and 90% relative humidity. We discovered that glue droplets of the western black widow and the common house spider were most similar and that the eastern black widow and the false widow were most similar, differences that are best explained by similarities of the length and distribution of gumfoot lines and not their evolutionary relationships. The altered biomechanics of prey capture by theridiids did distinguish the material properties of their adhesive proteins. Instead, the material properties of cob web species fell at the lower range of orb web values. We attribute this to the fact that, unlike the capture lines of orb webs (see Additional study 2 below), material properties of gumfoot support lines and glue proteins do not appear to be linked.&nbsp; Gumfoot support lines are stiff major ampullate fibers, whereas orb web capture threads are supported by more extensible flagelliform fibers. Moreover, detachment of the gumfoot line limits the summation of droplet adhesion (see Additional Studies 2).
