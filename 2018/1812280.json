 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2018, Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Recently, the rise in anthropogenic (human-made) sensory pollution - noise and nightlight - present conditions that are unprecedented in the fossil record and could fundamentally disrupt the ways in which animals interact with the environment. Limited research has focused on the singular effects of noise or light on animal communication and reproduction. However, human-made noise and light typically co-occur in today's human-dominated world, thus understanding their combined influence is an urgent conservation priority. This research aims to understand how human-caused noise and light affects reproductive success among a community of birds. The fellow will study nest placement, nesting success, and fledgling survival across noisy and dark, bright and quiet, noisy and bright, and quiet and dark sites. By focusing on several species, the fellow will be able determine how the bird community changes with sensory pollution, how behaviors within species change (i.e. nesting timing, feeding rates, movement or avoidance behaviors), and which species are more likely to succeed in sensory polluted areas. Determining the consequences of sensory pollution caused by anthropogenic activities lays the groundwork for conserving wild places, species, and reconciling spaces where nature and humanity interact. Results will be used to inform partners at the National Parks Division of Natural Sounds and Night Skies and Bureau of Land Management to help protect species and reconcile human pollution with conservation. This project broadens participation of groups underrepresented or invisible in biology, including LGBTQ, minorities and Hispanic students by funding multiple diverse students, and allowing the fellow to engage in novel research in sensory ecology and educational outreach. The fellow will mentor diverse students as a part of her field crew and is developing sensory ecology workshops for underrepresented students in central California.\r\n\r\nThe fellow will test the effects of noise and light pollution on breeding success and fledgling survival of a community of birds in New Mexico by implementing a large-scale manipulative field experiment with four treatments (Noise, Light, Light + Noise, & Control). By measuring settlement patterns, reproductive success, and activity states, the fellow will test mechanistic pathways that link exposure to sensory stimuli to changes in fitness. Fledgling survival will be monitored with radio telemetry to test hypothesized direct and indirect, predator mediated consequences of exposure.  The fellow expects noise to decrease hatching and juvenile success, while light increases clutch size and provisioning rates but increases vulnerability to predation. Thus, the fellow expects Light + Noise will have mixed effects on fitness. The fellow will also recruit and train diverse students to gain biological field experience and develop outreach and workshops for underrepresented students in K-12 schools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Over evolutionary timescales the sensory environment has provided reliable cues for animals to entrain their physiology or interact with con- and heterospecifics. Recently, however, the rise in multimodal anthropogenic pollution, such as noise and nightlight, present conditions that are unprecedented in the fossil record and could fundamentally disrupt the ways in which organisms obtain and respond to environmental cues and interact with one another.

Here, the PI proposed to work with Dr. Clinton Francis of Cal Poly on a full factorial experiment to test the effects of noise and light pollution on breeding success of open cup and cavity nesting birds in New Mexico. To do this, the PI?s diverse undergraduate team implemented a large-scale manipulative field experiment with four treatments (Noise, Light, Light + Noise, &amp; Control). They measured settlement patterns and several metrics of reproductive success, plus important data on behavior and activity states with telemetry to test hypothesized mechanistic pathways that link exposure to sensory stimuli to changes in reproductive success.

Nesting densities differ by species and treatment.

These data suggest that light acts as ecological trap for open cup nesters. Supporting earlier work in this system, nest success is significantly higher on noisy plots compared to quiet plots due to less depredation across all species (GLMM: &beta; = 0.25, t = 17, SE = 0.08, p = 0.002). <strong>Effects of Sensory Pollution on Movement:</strong>&nbsp;The research team radiotagged&nbsp;24 adults and 45 fledglings over three years to assess movement responses to light and noise pollution.

SE) minutes earlier than those on control plots (LMM: t = 3.21, p = 0.01), suggestive of negative additive effects on sleep and incubation. Survival of fledglings does not significantly vary with preliminary data; patterns of movement as related to sensory pollution levels are currently being analyzed by a master?s student mentee for future publication.
