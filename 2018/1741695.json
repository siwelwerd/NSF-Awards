 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) program, the Academic Intervention, Social Supports, and Scholarships for Engineering Transfer Students project will support high-achieving, low-income students with proved financial need at the University of Tennessee Chattanooga (UTC). Over the course of this five-year project, twenty-eight students will receive two-year scholarships and eight students will receive three-year scholarships. This project aims to discuss the growing need for chemical, civil, electrical, and mechanical engineers. In Tennessee and elsewhere, engineering transfer students often arrive at four-year institutions with many community college credits, but without the prerequisites needed to take junior-level or major-specific courses. As a result, transfer students may need four more years in college to complete the classes needed for graduation, decreasing the likelihood that they will complete an engineering degree. The aim of this project is to ensure that transfer students complete their UTC studies within two years after transferring from a community college. The plan incorporates mentorship, summer coursework, and summer boot camps to ensure a successful transition. A Transfer Learning Community will provide students with a peer support system and help them adjust to university life and overcome academic challenges. A local advisory board for regional schools will help to coordinate curricula among the schools. The project's emphasis on faculty mentoring will help the project have a lasting impact on UTC practices. The project also has the potential for positive impact on the local community through strengthened industry ties and employment opportunities. This project is significant in its potential to find and give best practices to guide four-year institutions across the nation to support the success of transfer students. \r\n\r\nThe project will use a mixed methods study to compare quantitative and qualitative data gathered for scholars versus non-scholar transfer students, non-transfer students, and matched non-scholar transfer students. The study will investigate five research questions: (1) Does taking part in the Summer Boot Camp improve transfer students' academic performance and likelihood of matriculation? (2) Does regular participation in peer tutoring increase transfer students' academic performance and likelihood of matriculation? (3) Which activities most reduce \"transfer shock\" among scholars? (4) Which activities most improve career placement following graduation? (5) How does the academic preparation affect a student's likelihood of retention and on-time graduation? Information from this research study may increase understanding of interventions, such as learning communities, in improving the academic performance, retention rates and time to graduation for scholars compared to non-scholars. Through the Community College Advisory Board and the research study, this project aims to lay a foundation for a regional alliance that can promote curricular alignment between UTC and area community colleges, supporting a seamless engineering transfer pathway that may be replicable across the state and nation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Transfer students face unique challenges when moving from a 2 year degree program into a 4 year degree program, including transfer shock, poor curricular alignment between the 2 year and 4 year curriculum, financial hardship, and career awareness about engineering pathways. The overall mission was to promote community among the transfer students and enhance their ability to be successful in completing their engineering degrees within a two year time frame. Project goals included four main objectives: 1) improve retention and reduce time to graduation among engineering transfer students; 2) create a Transfer Learning Community (TLC) that provides scholarships and academic support through mentoring and career development activities; 3) investigate how program activities affect academic performance, retention and graduation; and 4) establish a model for supporting engineering transfer students. The ASSETS project employed evidence-based practices to support 3 academic cohorts of transfer students by establishing a cohort-based Transfer Learning Community (TLC) course where the engaged in formal faculty &lt;br /&gt;mentoring, peer mentoring, boot camps, and career development focused activities. Students received scholarships to support their focus on academics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A total of 37 transfer students were supported with scholarships, across the four academic years of the project. As a result of this project, 80% of the students were retained, which is a much higher retention rate than the average for transfer students. At graduation, 85% had obtained employment. The overwhelming majority of the students (90%) reported strong satisfaction with their degree program. At the program conclusion, more than half (55%) graduated from the program early or on time (within two years). These time-to-degree outcomes are better than that of the average for transfer students in engineering; the 4 year graduation rate for all Engineering students at UTC is about 35%. Ninety-one students completed the program within 3 years. The TLC course was institutionalized, and made available to all incoming transfer students in the engineering program. The most effective activities as reported by students were the financial support and the connections made through faculty and peer mentoring.&lt;/p&gt;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/09/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ignatius&nbsp;W&nbsp;Fomunung</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1741695/1741695_10538059_1696362521561_cohort3graduation-copy--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1741695/1741695_10538059_1696362521561_cohort3graduation-copy--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cohort 3 Graduation\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1741695/1741695_10538059_1696362521561_cohort3graduation-copy--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cohort 3 Graduation\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Graduation of cohort 3 of NSF ASSETS Scholars - photo op with program staff.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ignatius Fomunung</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ignatius&nbsp;W&nbsp;Fomunung</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Cohort 3 Graduation</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1741695/1741695_10538059_1696362251438_cohort3graduationwithDeanPack--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1741695/1741695_10538059_1696362251438_cohort3graduationwithDeanPack--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cohort 3 Graduation\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1741695/1741695_10538059_1696362251438_cohort3graduationwithDeanPack--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cohort 3 Graduation\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Graduation of NSF ASSETS Scholars photo op with the Dean of the College of Engineering & Computer Science, Dr Daniel Pack</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ignatius Fomunung</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ignatius&nbsp;W&nbsp;Fomunung</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Cohort 3 Graduation</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1741695/1741695_10538059_1696362763106_TourofWetStorageTank--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1741695/1741695_10538059_1696362763106_TourofWetStorageTank--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cohort 2 Field Trip\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1741695/1741695_10538059_1696362763106_TourofWetStorageTank--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cohort 2 Field Trip\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Some members of cohort 2 visited a construction site - wet storage tank at the Chattanooga storm and sewer treatment facility.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ignatius Fomunung</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ignatius&nbsp;W&nbsp;Fomunung</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Cohort 2 Field Trip</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
