 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into value-added products is of fundamental importance as a means of storing intermittent energy sources like solar and wind as chemical fuels.  One of the challenges in CO2 conversion is that the most active catalysts for this reaction tend to simultaneously produce a number of different products such as carbon monoxide, methanol, methane, ethylene, and the side product hydrogen gas (H2).  While the reduction of CO2 to any one of these chemicals is desired, the non-selective generation of multiple products is non-ideal due to problems in product separation and isolation. Using natural enzymes as inspiration, Dr. McCrory is creating synthetic systems in which catalysts are embedded within polymers that control the active site environment and reactant delivery to facilitate selective CO2 reduction to single products. The proposed research has significant broader societal impact in that it provides a framework for the development of new catalyst systems for CO2 recycling and energy storage.  Concurrently, Dr. McCrory is focused on increasing energy literacy in Michigan using a 3-step education plan involving 1) graduate student training in scientific communication, 2) community outreach through interactive demonstrations at public events, and 3) the development and implementation of an exhibit at the University of Michigan Natural History Museum focused on renewable energy storage.  Through this approach, Dr. McCrory is working to enable the broader community to better engage in energy policy and usage decisions.  \r\n\r\nWith funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Charles C. L. McCrory of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor is synthesizing new electrocatalytic materials for selective carbon dioxide reduction by controlling the primary, secondary, and outer coordination spheres surrounding the catalyst's active site.  The central hypothesis for this proposal is that the reactivity and selectivity of molecular electrocatalysts for multi-electron transformations such as CO2 reduction can be modulated not only by modifying the ligand framework surrounding the metal center, but also by modifying the catalyst?s chemical environment to control H+ and substrate delivery to the metal active site.  To test this hypothesis, Dr. McCrory is encapsulating planar transition metal complexes with macrocyclic ligands inside of coordinating polymers.  The coordination environment, electronic structure and catalytic activity of the resulting polymer-catalyst systems are studied using a variety of spectroscopic and electroanalytical techniques.  Through systematic modifications of the ligand, polymer, and reaction conditions, Dr. McCrory is independently controlling the primary, secondary, and outer coordination spheres surrounding the metal center and determining the effect of each coordination sphere on the overall catalytic activity and product selectivity.  The knowledge gained from this study is crucial for the development of new catalyst-polymer composite systems for selective CO2 reduction and has significant broader societal impact in the design of new electrocatalytic systems for renewable energy storage and CO2 mitigation.  In addition, Dr. McCrory is working to increase energy literacy in Michigan through the design of interactive demonstrations relevant to renewable energy storage for the general public and the development of an exhibit at the University of Michigan Natural History Museum highlighting progress and challenges in renewable energy storage. Together, the research and integrated education components of this proposal highlight a new approach to overcoming challenges in energy storage and carbon dioxide conversion and will impact the way these important issues are addressed, both at the scientific and societal level.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In biological enzymes like carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, the active site is buried within a protein scaffold that controls both the chemical microenvironment surrounding the enzyme active site and the rate of reactant delivery. This protein scaffold controls the rate and selectivity of the active site for specific reactions and products. With support from the Division of Chemistry (CHE), we studied polymer-catalyst composites for CO2 reduction that functionally mimicked biological systems in the control of reactant delivery and active site microenvironment, but with more easily modified synthetic systems. During the funding period, the project team investigated the cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) catalyst encapsulated within polyvinlypyridine polymers as active catalysts for CO2 reduction. \n\n\nEncapsulating CoPc within a poly-4-vinylpyridine (P4VP) polymer results in a CoPc-P4VP composite system that has enhanced activity for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and suppresses the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) compared to the parent CoPc system. The project team used various spectroscopic, electrochemical, and computational techniques to understand this activity and selectivity difference between CoPc and CoPc-P4VP. For instance, the team used in situ X-ray absorbance spectroscopy to show that the pyridyl groups in the P4VP polymer coordinate to the metal center in CoPc, and this coordination between the polymer and the CoPc in the CoPc-P4VP system enhances the activity for CO2 reduction. Using a combination of electrochemical kinetic isotope effect measurements and computational studies, the team was further able to show that the coordination between CoPc and the P4VP polymer increases the ability for the catalyst to bind and reduce CO2 in the CoPc-P4VP composite, and fundamentally changes the catalytic mechanism compared to the CoPc parent system without an encapsulating polymer. Electrochemical proton inventory studies and ex situ FTIR measurements were used to show that the P4VP polymer plays other important roles in breaking apart CoPc clusters leading to more catalyst active sites, and in controlling proton delivery to the CoPc active sites within the CoPc-P4VP composites which enhances reaction selectivity for the CO2RR over the competitive HER side reaction.\n\n\nThese studies have important ramifications for future catalyst development for CO2 conversion, and more broadly for other catalytic reactions.
