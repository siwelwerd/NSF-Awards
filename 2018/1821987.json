 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our Milky Way galaxy is surrounded by \"dwarf\" galaxies that orbit and occasionally collide with our galaxy.  We are part of a \"local group\" of large galaxies, each with its own swarm of dwarf galaxies.  One of the important unanswered questions in astronomy is how these galaxies formed and how they change in time.  Our current understanding of structure in the universe suggests that a large galaxy like the Milky Way should actually host a larger number of dwarf satellites than we observe.  To examine whether this is universal or merely a property of our local group, this program will conduct a detailed census of the regions surrounding two of our nearest galactic neighbors.  They will survey two types of galaxy -  spiral, like the Milky Way, and a large elliptical galaxy - and then measure the basic properties of these newly discovered systems. This involves a collaborative effort between three institutions and will use some of the largest and best ground-based telescopes.  All three PIs are active in education and public outreach. PI Sand's institution, Texas Tech University, has a new astrophysics research group and undergraduate concentration.  The science in this proposal will help establish TTU's astrophysics program and reach out to the larger Lubbock community.  In particular, two undergraduate astrophysics students will spend summers in California doing research for the program, allowing them to interact with the larger astrophysics community. PI Guhathakurta is very actively involved with several programs that provide mentoring and research experiences for high-school students.  \r\n\r\nThe three PIs, along with a postdoctoral researcher and students, will address the observed lack of faint dwarf galaxies associated with the Milky Way and M31 (compared Lambda-CDM  predictions for small-scale structure formation).  Using the Magellan and Keck telescopes, they will conduct a panoramic imaging study to measure the stellar stream and dwarf galaxy content in NGC 253, a Milky Way-like spiral in a filamentary environment, and NGC 5128, a massive central elliptical galaxy.  They will also use Keck+Diemos and newly-developed coaddition techniques to obtain spectra of tidal streams and dwarf galaxies.  If successful, this would enable kinematic and metallicity studies for the first time outside the local group.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSummary:  The goal of this program was to study two of our nearest galaxy neighbors -- NGC253 and NGC5128 -- to understand their satellite dwarf galaxy population and other signs of the interactions these galaxies have had in their past.  By building up this picture, we get a view of how galaxies in general form.  Our program was very successful, building stunning stellar maps of our nearest galaxy neighbors in a way that was only possible previously around the Milky Way.  Our data has added to the evidence that there are fewer dwarf galaxies around normal galaxies than expected in our current understanding of galaxy formation.\nIntellectual Merit: We have created stunning stellar maps of two of our galaxy neighbors, NGC253 and NGC5128, and found new satellite galaxies around them.  With this new data in hand, we have compared them with our own galaxy (the Milky Way) and expectation from theoretical models of galaxy formation.  We have also developed a new spectroscopic tool for measuring the velocities of our newly found dwarf galaxies which will be very useful for the next generation of very large telescopes.\nBroader Impacts:  Several broader impacts were the direct results of this NSF program. \nDuring the first portion of the award, Sand was at Texas Tech University, establishing a new astrophysics program.  This award was crucial in building that program, and allowed Sand to connect to the larger Lubbock, TX community.  He spent time at Frenship High School, giving presentations on his research, with a focus on the new dwarf galaxies found as part of this program.\nTwo postdoctoral researchers have been involved in this NSF program, and both have gone on to faculty positions -- we have trained the next generation of scientists.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/30/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David J Sand"
