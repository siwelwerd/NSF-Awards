 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at Lamar University provides 8 students a 10-week authentic research experience in the Department of Mathematics during the summers of 2018-2020.  Participants work in teams of four under the supervision of the PIs. An experienced research mentor and a junior faculty member lead each team. The REU site at LU aims to increase research opportunities for students at institutions where undergraduate research opportunities are limited or nonexistent. By recruiting underrepresented minorities, veterans and community college students, students are empowered to pursue degrees in STEM and to transition to advanced study or careers in STEM. The benefits of participating in a structured research program extend beyond the technical knowledge that students gain. Students increase writing and oral communication skills and are exposed to professional development opportunities in attending conferences to present their work. Furthermore, the faculty advisors continue to serve as mentors for the students beyond the ten weeks of the program. Each year, many students transfer to LU after having completed two-year degrees at local community colleges. The REU site at LU creates an opportunity for participants from local community colleges to meet other STEM students who successfully made the transition to a four-year university. Finally, pairing experienced research mentors with less experienced co-mentors on each research project gives the co-mentors the tools necessary to establish or expand undergraduate research programs.\r\n \r\nThe intellectual focus of this program is on interdisciplinary research at the crossroads of mathematics, statistics and computer science. In many applications, dimension reduction is imperative for efficient manipulation of massive quantities of high-dimensional data. Dimension reduction using matrix factorizations and graph theory can be used to ascertain the underlying structure of the data and to find correlations among the data attributes. Interest is increasing in the study of graph theory, singular value decomposition (SVD) and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) due to applications in various research areas of mathematics and computer science. SVD and NMF are both unsupervised learning tools currently used in big data analytics.  REU participants will gain exposure to the challenges and opportunities associated with big data. Students are introduced to the three Vs of big data: Volume, Variety, Velocity. Volume refers to the sheer quantity of the data, Variety refers to the different types of data, and Velocity refers to the speed of processing the data.  Students are allotted the opportunity to participate in (1) theoretical research, with students investigating properties of graph theory, SVD and NMF to generate conjectures, prove theorems, and investigate existing algorithms; and (2) programming related research, with students performing experiments on matrix factorizations and graph theory and writing algorithms to process large data sets.",

The program offered high-quality and accessible research experiences in matrix factorization, graph theory and statistics to non-traditional students.  In 2020, the REU program was conducted online in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  In 2021, with a no-cost extension, the online REU experience was refined in response to lessons learned during the previous year?s expereince.  \n\n \n\nA major concern about moving the REU online was to still maintain the sense of community that a traditional REU builds.  To this end, a graduate student was hired to meet with the entire group every morning.  She provided fun activites, talks, and experiences for the REU students to strengthen the relationship of the team.  Each week, one participant was asked to give a presentation to the group over something they had worked on in the past aside from talking about what they were currently working on.\n\nParticipants work in teams of 2-4 under the supervision of the PIs.  Students were exposed to the analysis of big data using techniques from linear algebra (singular value decomposition (SVD) and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), statistics, and graph theory.  Students developed their skills in mathematical writing and oral communication.
