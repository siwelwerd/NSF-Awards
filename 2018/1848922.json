The directors of the REU Sites that are funded primarily out of astronomy will get together for a meeting to discuss best practices and lessons learned for recruitment of students from smaller institutions and broadening participation from a diverse population of students. This proposal will support this meeting, to be held in Alexandria Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe REU Site directors meeting will be held in conjunction with the Council on Undergraduate Research that will be held October 29, 2018. The meeting will address issues of common concern among astronomy REU Site directors. Some of the main topics will include recruitment from lesser-known universities and small colleges, enhancing the participation and recruitment of female and under-represented minority students, and establishing connections with local programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
