 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental question in the study of many infectious diseases is how contact patterns and local disease characteristics combine to affect disease dynamics on networks.  Geography, demography, and behavior influence network structure, and are also associated with variation in disease characteristics such as time to treatment, immune response, and environmental conditions influencing pathogen persistence.  This project aims to develop new mathematical tools for understanding how local disease characteristics shape effective network structure and in turn influence disease spread.  Specific applications include syphilis dynamics on sexual contact networks, in partnership with Columbus Public Health and the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. \r\n\r\nA recently-introduced generalized inverse of the graph Laplacian is promising for understanding how network structure and node characteristics combine to affect disease spread on networks. This generalized inverse, called the absorption inverse, relates directly to disease invasion and the basic reproduction number for community networks, and also suggests broadly applicable structural measures that depend upon both graph structure and node dynamics.  Properties of the absorption inverse will be studied, and analytical tools developed for understanding disease dynamics on networks with heterogeneous node dynamics.  Biological contributions will include insight into basic questions such as how node dynamics affect core groups and community structure, and how the distribution of core groups within a network affect disease prevalence and outbreak size.  Mathematical contributions will be made in the areas of generalized inverses, random walks on graphs, combinatorial matrix analysis, and spectral graph theory.  Algorithmic development of structural measures using the absorption inverse will also contribute to network science, with potential application to dynamics on networks outside of biology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Intellectual merit:\n \nThis project has developed analytical tools for understanding disease dynamics on networks where the nodes differ in their pathogen dynamics.  We particularly focus on pathogen removal rates at the nodes, and examine how different removal rates impact effective network structure, which in turn can influence disease dynamics on the network.  Central to this project is a mathematical quantity called the absorption inverse which is connected with absorbing random walks on graphs.  Random walks are a fundamental dynamic process on networks, and many clustering algorithms for studying network structure are based on random walks.  One of our contributions from this project is to use the absorption inverse to devise clustering algorithms based on absorbing random walks.  We also introduce a way to use absorbing random walks to compare disease dynamics in two widely-used frameworks for modeling movement between spatial locations.  This project contributes understanding of disease dynamics on networks of different scales, ranging from sexual networks between individuals to mobility networks connecting villages and cities.  Theoretical advances include understanding how mobility sources and sinks interact with transmission hot spots to affect vector-borne disease dynamics.  Work from this project contributes to several different disciplines, including mathematics, epidemiology, disease ecology, and network science.\n \nBroader impacts:\n \nThis project has practical implications for disease dynamics and public health in several different settings, including specific case studies ranging from malaria in Namibia to syphilis among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Columbus, Ohio.  Our work on syphilis among MSM has been communicated to the Centers for Disease Control.  This project has provided training for students from undergraduate to postdoctoral.  In particular, training included a research experience for undergraduates opportunity to study network science and disease dynamics on networks.\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/21/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joseph Tien"
