 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines how the bio-machine named YidC inserts and folds proteins into the membrane bilayer. Protein insertion into membranes is one of the most critical processes in biology, and understanding the mechanisms by which proteins are transported across or integrated into membranes has enormous potential impact for understanding cellular and organismal structure, function and health. The project will yield, as yet undiscovered, fundamental information on the function of YidC, which is key to understanding how biological membranes are assembled, maintain their identity, and support many functions such as signaling and transport. The resulting new knowledge on biogenesis of membrane proteins could also impact human health-related research in the future since membrane proteins make up more than 50% of the known drug targets. The project will also provide opportunities for training students in a multidisciplinary research environment involving molecular biology, biochemical and biophysical approaches.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of the research is to determine how YidC functions to insert proteins into the cell membrane. YidC is novel as a membrane insertase as it contains a hydrophilic cavity that is crucial for its insertase and chaperone function. YidC can function on its own or cooperate with the Sec machinery to insert proteins. The project utilizes fluorescence spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance spin labeling, and single molecule approaches to examine the dynamics and structural relationships of membrane insertion events. The research specifically aims to determine the mechanism of action and dynamics of YidC in membrane protein insertion, elucidate the interactions in the YidC/Sec machinery complex, and identify features of membrane protein substrates that determine selection of YidC and Sec translocase pathways in E. coli. The project will advance the field of membrane protein insertion in bacteria and will impact understanding of similar pathways in human cells.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAll cells contain membranes made up of proteins and phospholipids.  Membrane proteins play crucial functions in many cellular processes, including respiration, metabolite transport, cell signaling, and signal transduction.  They can span the membrane many times and make up approximately 30% of the human proteome.  Membrane proteins are medically important and comprise up to 60% of the known drug targets.  Therefore, it is important to understand the biogenesis of membrane proteins and how they fold into their three-dimensional structures.\n\nThe translocation/insertion machineries are responsible for inserting proteins into the membrane.  The main machinery is the Sec translocase, which contains a membrane channel.  It functions to insert the transmembrane segments laterally into the lipid bilayer and translocate polar region across the membrane.  The other insertion machinery is the YidC insertase, which is fundamentally different from the Sec translocases, since it lacks a membrane channel.  The YidC family of insertases is found to mediate the membrane insertion and folding of membrane proteins in bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts.  The bacterial YidC can function with or without SecYEG translocase.  Interestingly, recently the YidC family has been shown to form an Oxa1 superfamily with members present in the ER. \n\nThe studies in this project were focused on how YidC, which lacks the membrane channel, accomplishes its insertion function.  Our studies so far revealed that the TM segments of inserting membrane proteins go up the YidC greasy slide and the substrate hydrophilic region to be translocated are transiently incorporated in the YidC hydrophilic groove open to the cytoplasm and inner membrane.  We found that YidC has a limited translocase activity.  This explains why the hydrophilic regions of YidC substrates are typically short.  If the polarity and charge in the substrate translocated region exceeds a certain limit, then translocation can still take place but only with the help of the SecYEG translocase.  Our results support the hypothesis that the YidC greasy slide region comprised of TM3 and TM5 is involved in the formation of the YidC-SecYEG complex, and that the membrane protein insertion process occurs at the interface of the YidC greasy slide and the SecYEG lateral gate.\n\nThe hallmark of the YidC family of proteins is that they possess a membrane hydrophilic groove exposed to the cytosol and lipid bilayer.  The hydrophilic cavity possesses a strictly conserved positively charged residue.  Our studies showed the positively charged residue functions to keep the hydrophilic groove hydrated.  This feature, along with several short TM segments, causes significant thinning of the membrane bilayer.  The presence of the hydrophilic groove in the membrane decreases the membrane crossing distance which makes it easier to translocate a substrate hydrophilic polypeptide chain.  This may be how the YidC family of proteins facilitate the translocation despite not forming a membrane channel.\n\nDuring the project period, the PI was involved in the training of undergraduates and graduate students, as well as outreach in Columbus schools.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/25/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ross E Dalbey"
