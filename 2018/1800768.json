 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Initiation Awards provide support for junior and mid-career faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are building new research programs or redirecting and rebuilding existing research programs. It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at the home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences. The award to North Carolina A&T State University has potential broader impacts in a number of areas. The goal of the project is to gain fundamental understanding of unarmed aerial vehicle (UAV) data processing and to develop a research program on remote sensing data processing for environmental management at the university. Undergraduate students and high school students will gain research experiences and the research will be integrated in a number of undergraduate and graduate courses.\r\n\r\nRemote sensing data have increasingly been used to develop flood modeling; however, traditional satellite-based techniques are challenging due to the presence of cloud cover, satellite revisit time, viewing angle limitations, and the complexity of urban landscapes. The recent development of UAVs has created a new tool for collecting data to use in geospatial research. Applying UAVs to collect data with an appropriate flight mode and optimized sensors offers the possibility of overcoming issues associated with using satellite-based sensor data. This project aims to investigate and evaluate the application of UAV data for flood modeling and management. More generally, this will improve GIS and remote sensing capabilities for UAV-based simulation and modeling of 3D dynamic phenomena such as floods, forest fires, and air pollution. The proposed project will contribute to the scientific literature by developing a novel method for 3D water surface reconstruction and delineation of flood boundary and water level measurements using UAV data. These measurements can be integrated with flood models to identify areas vulnerable to future flooding.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This was achieved through a systematic literature review, discussions with faculty collaborators, and consultations with flood experts at the North Carolina Geodetic Survey. We utilized various geospatial and remote sensing techniques, processing and analyzing UAV datasets collected during Hurricane Florence in Lumberton and Hurricane Matthew in Princeville, as well as new UAV optical and LiDAR datasets collected through the project. These efforts were aimed at developing and validating our flood mapping algorithms.</p>\n<p>To address the need for accurate flood mapping, this project investigated structure from motion (SFM) and image classification methods and applied them to automatic flood detection and extent mapping in 3D. The SFM method extracts 3D point clouds from multiple overlapping images and uses feature-based image matching methods for image-to-image registration and 3D surface construction. However, due to the homogeneous appearance of the water surface, it was challenging to process water bodies, as there were insufficient tie-points to reference the images resulting in image calibration issues. We also explored the use of machine learning (e.g. RF and SVM) and deep learning methods such as CNN to automatically generate precise flood maps (extent and depth) using optical remote sensing images. This project also investigates transfer learning to adapt a classier trained on an image set to another dataset having different underlying distributions. Deep learning approaches showed promising results for flood extent mapping. However, these methods cannot extract floods underneath vegetation canopy using the optical imagery. Thus, we developed an integrated CNN and region growing (RG) method for the mapping of both visible and underneath vegetation flooded areas. The CNN-based classifier is used to extract flooded areas from the optical images, whereas the RG method was developed to estimate the extent of floods underneath vegetation that were not visible from imagery using the digital elevation model. We also investigated the data augmentation technique for training the deep leaning models to improve the classification results.</p>\n<p>One PhD dissertation was completed on this research, earning the student the Raising Scholar Award from the College of Science and Technology. The project results have been published in 17 peer-reviewed publications and presented at 24 conferences and scientific events, including six invited talks. A research-based teaching model was developed for high school students and successfully implemented in the project summer camp in 2022. The outcomes were also integrated into classroom teaching, with two undergraduate courses in Geomatics and two new graduate courses developed.
