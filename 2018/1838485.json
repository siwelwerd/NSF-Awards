 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Congress on 3D Materials Science (3DMS) is the premier forum for presenting research regarding the newest advances in three-dimensional characterization, visualization, quantitative analysis, modeling, and investigation into the structure and structure-property relationships among materials. The Fourth International Congress on 3D Materials Science (3DMS 2018) will bring together researchers, professionals, and engineers and provide multiple settings for presentation, discussion, and networking. This atmosphere will facilitate rich interactions between the experimentalists, modelers, and computational and image processing experts who attend. Research within the 3DMS community has historically given rise to significant advances in materials science and engineering applications. 3DMS 2018 is the environment for leaders in this field to showcase research, interact with peers, and hold important discussions to continue to advance the state of 3DMS research. It is the goal of the organizers to ensure a high-quality conference that holds a strong international presence and aims to highlight the important advances in 3DMS research on a global scale. As with previous 3DMS congresses, student participation is greatly encouraged to give students exposure to recent advances in this field. This grant will support student, postdoc, and young faculty travel; the student poster session and awards; and other administrative costs. This meeting is open to all interested individuals and will attempt to provide the most advanced technical meeting possible, with a mixture of attendees from research and development, industry, and education professions.  \r\n\r\nThe field of 3DMS has revolutionized materials characterization and has enabled the examination and modeling of 3D microstructures, which is critical to understanding and predicting materials processing-structure-property relationships. As with previous iterations of the event, all materials classes will be considered as part of the congress. Metallic materials have greatly benefitted from 3D characterization, analysis, and modeling and research in this area will be presented along with additional materials classes such as polymers, ceramics, and composites. Technical sessions on the first two days of the conference will run in parallel, with two sessions on related topics following an all-conference plenary session of invited keynote speakers. The final day of the conference will also utilize parallel sessions, but the plenary session will follow the technical sessions this time, to close out the conference. This format provides the optimum balance of breadth of information with depth of discussion and interaction opportunities. All types of research institutions (academia, government, and industrial research laboratories) will be represented. This meeting is open to all interested individuals, with a mixture of attendees from academic research, industry and educational professions, representing both senior and junior investigators, post-doctoral trainees and students. The four overarching topical areas planned for this international congress include: methods for materials simulation, modeling, and characterization in 3D; 3D data processing and reconstruction algorithms; process-microstructure-property relationships in 3D; and materials dynamics in 3D.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
