 "awd_abstract_narration": "The biological carbon pump in the ocean is an important process by which atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) is effectively transported from the surface ocean to the deep ocean, and thereby removing CO2 from the atmosphere. This transport occurs in a multi-step process. First, phytoplankton carry out photosynthesis in the surface, sunlit waters of the ocean, taking up atmospheric CO2 and fixing it into particulate organic carbon. A portion of the organic carbon contained in the phytoplankton is packaged into larger clusters (aggregates) that can sink to the deep ocean. The deeper these aggregates sink, the longer the carbon contained in them is removed from the atmosphere. The depth to which aggregates sink varies greatly over time and space and are difficult to predict. In general, larger aggregates sink more quickly, and thus more deeply, than smaller particles. Processes that promote aggregation to larger particles should enhance the biological pump, and processes that promote disaggregation (breakdown of particle clusters) and regeneration (decomposition) of the organic carbon should decrease the strength and efficiency of the biological pump. Particle aggregation and disaggregation rates are thus crucial to understanding the variability of the biological pump, but are very difficult to measure directly. This project will use chemical tracers and a modeling approach to quantify the rates of these important processes. The investigators will apply the approach to a variety of oceanic environments and provide the first large-scale effort to quantify these rates in the upper 500 meters of the ocean. As part of this project, they will interface with the CalTeach program, which is a University of California Science and Math Initiative to place university science, math, and engineering majors in K-12 classrooms. Many of these CalTeach interns go on to become K-12 science teachers in California. Two undergraduate students enrolled in the CalTeach program at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) will participate as laboratory assistants and develop a hands-on teaching module on the carbon cycle and biological pump for K-12 classrooms. \r\n\r\nScientists from the University of California at Santa Cruz and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution propose to estimate the rates of particle aggregation and disaggregation in the mesopelagic zone through the inversion of observations of three chemical tracers, namely thorium (Th)-234, lithogenic particles, and particulate organic carbon (POC) distributed between small, suspended particles and large, sinking particles. The isotopes of Th have long been used to estimate rates of particle dynamics processes because of their known source function and particle-reactive behavior. Previous work has shown that lithogenic particles act as an inert, passive tracer of particle dynamics. The investigators will couple thorium and lithogenic particle measurements to measurements of POC to estimate particle aggregation and disaggregation rates from a wide range of oceanographic environments. Estimates of particle cycling rates deduced from the inversion of chemical tracer data provide a crucial quantitative constraint to which rates derived from other approaches can be compared. The main objective of this work is to estimate depth- varying (dis-) aggregation rates at each station of the EXPORTS and GEOTRACES cruises that are most consistent with the tracer data. This work will also produce depth-varying estimates of POC remineralization rates and particle sinking rates.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe biological carbon pump is one of the ways that the ocean takes up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and transfers it to the deep ocean, where it can be stored for decades to centuries. This occurs when phytoplankton that live in the sunlit surface ocean photosynthesize, turning carbon dioxide into organic carbon. Phytoplankton can then have several fates: they can be respired back into carbon dioxide, returning the carbon to the atmosphere, they can be consumed by zooplankton, or they can aggregate into larger particles that can sink (gravitationally) into the deep ocean. Zooplankton can also migrate to depth and excrete a portion of what they eat, also transferring organic carbon into the deep ocean. Large particles can break up and disaggregate, which essentially slows down the descent of particles and hastens respiration back to carbon dioxide. The rates at which these various processes occur determine how effective the biological pump is at transferring carbon from the atmosphere to the deep ocean. Processes that favor aggregation and sinking increase its effectiveness; processes that favor respiration and disaggregation decrease its effectiveness. Despite their importance, these particle cycling rates are notoriously difficult to measure directly.\r\n\n\nThis projects contribution was to develop and apply inverse methods that can quantify these particle cycling rates using a simple particle cycling model combined with field observations of particulate organic carbon in two size classes: a small, mainly suspended size class of particle, and a large, mainly sinking size class of particle. We applied this method to data collected from three major oceanographic expeditions funded by NASA and the NSF: 1) the EXPORTS North Pacific cruise, 2) the GEOTRACES Pacific Meridional Cruise, and 3) the EXPORTS North Atlantic cruise. These oceanographic expeditions spanned many ocean biomes, allowing us to contrast particle cycling rates from low and high productivity areas on a long transect from Alaska to Tahiti (GEOTRACES), as well as areas that are relatively invariant (EXPORTS North Pacific) and those that have dramatic phytoplankton blooms and declines (EXPORTS North Atlantic). During the EXPORTS North Pacific cruise, which was a low productivity site dominated by small phytoplankton, we found that small particles contributed a significant fraction of the total gravitational sinking fluxa surprising result since small particles were not thought to sink on their own. On the Pacific Meridional Transect, we found that higher productivity areas had larger sinking fluxes, but we were surprised to find that the fraction of biological production that sank out of the surface was low relatively constant throughout the transect, regardless of productivity. This may have been because we sampled this transect in the autumn season, whereas most oceanographic expeditions from which we build out intuition are conducted in the spring and summer seasons. This demonstrated the value in sampling at different times in the seasonal cycle. The long transect down the Pacific originating in the cold, low oxygen waters of Alaska and ending in the tropical waters of Tahiti allowed us to examine the effect of environmental variables on particle cycling rates.
