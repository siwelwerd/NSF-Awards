 "awd_abstract_narration": "Every year a number of earthquakes cause devastation, much of it due to collapsing buildings, with economic impacts in the United States alone adding up to about $4.4 billion dollars a year.  Earthquake cycle monitoring and earthquake forecasting is an active topic of geological research, and is crucial to guide our efforts to both prepare society and its infrastructure for earthquakes, and to also mitigate the impacts. It is not currently possible to make deterministic predictions of when and where earthquakes will happen. It is however, possible to make probabilistic forecasts about the likelihood of earthquakes happening in a specified area over a specified period. The accuracy of these statistical estimates is strongly dependent on our understanding of the history of a particular fault system, its current state, and its likely evolution. This picture is generated through historical records, current observations of the accumulation of stresses in the crust, and models that guide our understanding of where stresses are being stored and how a fault is likely to respond to them. Although each major fault has its own unique context, what we learn from studying one fault in detail moves our understanding of the broader processes forward. The frictional properties of a fault, and how these vary spatially and temporally throughout the earthquake cycle, are key parameters for understanding its likely behavior. The researchers will leverage the wealth of modern and historical geodetic data from the south flank of Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii, covering 100+ years, and use both analytical and numerical models to investigate the temporal evolution of the frictional properties of the underlying decollement and its relationship to the earthquake cycle. The Broader Impacts of this project span hazards, collaborations with the USGS and support for undergraduate and graduate students. Kilauea's decollement is a major source of natural hazards to the state, as it generates major earthquakes, like the May 4, 2018 Mw6.9 Leilani Estates earthquake, and also fatal tsunamis. Understanding its evolution and relationship to the catastrophic landslide features found throughout the islands is of great societal importance.\r\n\r\nCurrent interpretation of geological and geophysical observations from Kilauea's south flank suggests that continuous creep, slow slip events (SSEs), and major earthquakes are all occurring on the same fault plane, with combinations of at least two of these processes operating simultaneously. How these processes are connected and interact, and the implications for the mechanics and evolution of the wedge and its earthquake cycle, are fundamental questions that must be answered to improve our understanding of these processes. The physical conditions at the shallow depths of the decollement make Kilauea an extremely unusual outlier compared to most other convergent margin sources of slow slip events. In addition, the SSEs here appear to occur up-dip of the locked zone, a region largely inaccessible to geodetic measurements in subduction zones. This study, therefore, offers an opportunity to gain new insights through comparing and contrasting fault processes with those elsewhere. Preliminary modeling of the current secular surface displacements suggests that the patches of the decollement creeping in these motions outline the zones that currently exhibit SSEs. This implies the currently active portion of the decollement can be mapped into four distinct zones with frictional properties that span velocity-weakening to velocity-strengthening behavior and include the transitional zone(s) that are thought to support SSEs. This project suggests that friction on the decollement can be described using a rate-and-state formalism. They will model geodetic data from different eras within the earthquake cycle to test this hypothesis and answer the following questions: 1) What ranges of parameters for the fault plane rheology adequately predict the observed secular creep rates, SSEs, and microseismicity? 2) How have these parameters evolved from the locked state prior to 1975 through to current? 3) What magmatic overpressures in the lower rift zone are compatible with flank deformation rates?\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The low-angle fault underlying the volcano has consistently been moving it southward, and has a high hazard potential due to large magnitude earthquakes. The complexity of this region leads to questions about the evolution of deformation and its seismic cycle. The 1975 Mw7.7 Kalapana d&eacute;collement earthquake is of particular interest because large magnitude ruptures can dramatically alter the state of stress within a region. We therefore explore both the deformation and stress changes of K&#299;lauea&rsquo;s d&eacute;collement from 1898-2018 by collating a wealth of surface displacement observations. We create a model to reproduce the observed displacements throughout time and to identify key structural features causing the deformation, such as fault planes, rifts, and magma chambers. Multiple deformation sources were needed to model the observations, with more of these sources required prior to the 1975 Kalapana earthquake than afterwards.&nbsp; We find increased stress along the K&#299;lauea d&eacute;collement and decreased stresses across the East Rift Zone before 1975, promoting favorable conditions for both rifting and magmatic intrusion leading up to the Kalapana earthquake. Variable stress changes along K&#299;lauea&rsquo;s d&eacute;collement after 1975 do not suggest a strong promotion of decollement failure, but large decreases in compressive stress are noted along the East Rift Zone. Therefore, subsequent seismic events (such as the 2018 M_w6.9 earthquake) are more likely to have been triggered by East Rift Zone intrusions favored by this stress change. Numerical models examining slip on the decollement indicate that changes in the frictional properties are able to reproduce key observed characterics of both the regular earthquake cycle as well as slow slip events. The slip models are also broadly consistent with the first order evolution of slip over time found in our analysis of the geodetic data.<br /><br />K&#299;lauea&rsquo;s south flank extends underwater as a major submarine landslide that would cause an eastern Pacific-wide tsunami should it collapse catastrophically. Improved understanding of this feature and its mechanical and dynamical behavior from this project will significantly assist hazard assessments. The research efforts in this project have involved 4 students, contributing to 2 completed PhD dissertations from young women scientists, and provided the topic for one undergraduate research project. <br /><br /></p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 04/17/2025<br>\nModified by: James&nbsp;H&nbsp;Foster</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1824114/1824114_10579889_1744899510627_Figure9_complex_refined_ALL_1896_1974--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1824114/1824114_10579889_1744899510627_Figure9_complex_refined_ALL_1896_1974--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Kilauea Decollement Slip model 1896-1974\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1824114/1824114_10579889_1744899510627_Figure9_complex_refined_ALL_1896_1974--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Kilauea Decollement Slip model 1896-1974\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Map view of fault slip rates based on available geodetic data for 1896-1974: Triangulation, EDM and leveling datasets</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Lauren Ward Yong</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">James&nbsp;H&nbsp;Foster\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Kilauea Decollement Slip model 1896-1974</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1824114/1824114_10579889_1744900007744_Figure12_Stress_Overview_update_1976_2018--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1824114/1824114_10579889_1744900007744_Figure12_Stress_Overview_update_1976_2018--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Kilauea Stress Model 1976-2018\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1824114/1824114_10579889_1744900007744_Figure12_Stress_Overview_update_1976_2018--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Kilauea Stress Model 1976-2018\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Simplified schematic of active sources and the resulting Coulomb stress changes they create for 1976-2018.
