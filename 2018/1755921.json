 "awd_abstract_narration": "Error-resilient communication lies at the backbone of modern computer networks and storage systems.  Such schemes have the property of being pseudorandom in that they are explicitly constructed without randomness (which can be important, such as for efficient decoding), and yet (almost) share the error-resilience afforded by truly-random communication protocols.\u00a0\u00a0The construction and analysis of such schemes often uses linear algebra, and recently it has been shown that one can improve such schemes (in particular, list-decodable codes) by constructing certain pseudorandom linear-algebraic objects.  Such linear-algebraic pseudorandom notions have turned out to be interesting independent of their coding-theoretic applications, as they mirror many well-studied notions in statistical (min-entropy) pseudorandomness, have applications to improving the time- and randomness-efficiency of linear-algebraic algorithms, and have connections to the polynomial method in mathematics.\u00a0\u00a0This research will study the foundations of linear-algebraic pseudorandomness by attacking its main open problems, strengthening known connections, and discovering new connections.  This project also has a broader impact through course design, organization of workshops, and training of undergraduate and graduate students.\r\n\r\nThis project has two main focuses.\u00a0\u00a0The first is on explicit constructions of linear-algebraic pseudorandom objects. In particular, this project studies rank extractors (a small collection of dimension-reducing linear maps that will preserve the dimension of a linear space on average), subspace-evasive sets (a large set which has small intersections with any small-dimensional linear space), and dimension expanders (a small collection of linear maps which increase the dimension of any small-dimensional linear space).  While rank extractors and dimension expanders now have good constructions known, they lack optimality in several parameter regimes, and this project seeks to close these gaps, for example by tightening current analyses.\u00a0\u00a0In contrast, all known explicit constructions of subspace-evasive sets are far from optimal, and this project seeks new avenues of construction.\u00a0\u00a0Further, the project will explore the many relationships of these objects, such as with recent work on two-source (min-entropy) extractors, and known applications of expander graphs.\r\n\r\nThe second focus on this project is on the polynomial method, a method in mathematics which has yielded dramatic solutions to problems in combinatorics and number theory.\u00a0\u00a0It turns out that the linear-algebraic tools used in the analysis of the above pseudorandom objects has a natural phrasing in the language of the polynomial method.  This project will sharpen these linear-algebraic tools to obtain new results via the polynomial method.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project aimed to understand the power of linear-algebraic arguments for establishing (or disproving) the existence of polynomials with certain properties, an area broadly termed \"the polynomial method\".  In particular, this project centered on the polynomial method's use in the explicit construction of algebraic objects that share desirable properties with random constructions (\"pseudorandom\" objects).  Additionally, the project sought to understand the role of the polynomial method in the least-quadratic residue problem from number theory.\n\nThe project produced several results, comprising its intellectual merit.  One such project was in understanding proof systems, where a computationally weak verifier asks an computationally unbounded prover to provide a \"proof\" of a statement, while still being able to spot flaws in any potentially incorrect argument.  Such proof systems often use statements about polynomials as a key component.  One result was to show how when the prover has a \"large\" polynomial in mind, the verifier cannot \"learn\" too much about it when the interaction with the prover is limited.  This \"learning\" is quantified using linear-algebra.  This can then be used in establishing that the prover does not accidentally reveal \"too much\" in proving a specific claim, and is hence zero-knowledge (an important property in cryptographic proof systems).  This framework was in particular used for establishing zero-knowledge proof systems for multi-prover quantum proof systems, which were not previously known.\n\nAnother result was an improved algorithm for interpolating interesting coefficients in a polynomial, which is a purely linear-algebraic statement.  By establishing that a certain restricted class of algebraic circuits necessarily reveal their structure on such \"interesting\" coefficients, this interpolation algorithm yielded an optimal derandomization result for the polynomial identity testing problem in a non-trivial regime of parameters.\n\nThe broader impacts of this project as felt in several ways.  Results are disseminated via online preprint servers and conference proceedings, and seminars are given at conferences and workshops.  Additionally, two graduate students were trained through the support of this project.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/18/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael A Forbes"
