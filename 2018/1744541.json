 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF INCLUDES Design and Development Launch Pilot will improve math achievement among elementary school students of color in public schools in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Recognizing the need to coordinate efforts related to students' math and science achievement, key stakeholders formed the NM STEM Ecosystem, a dynamic network of cross-sector partners committed to making real impact on STEM education and degree attainment in Albuquerque. The NM STEM Ecosystem identified the math achievement gap between low-income students of color and their more economically-advantaged peers as the Broadening Participation (BP) Challenge it would address first. While math achievement gaps between students of color and Caucasian students appear nationally, the situation is particularly dire in New Mexico. In order to keep doors open to future STEM careers, it is crucial that learning pathways for math are articulated early and that these pathways honor families' cultural ways of knowing. The innovative strategy of Math Families & Communities Empowering Student Success (Math FACESS) is to use a collective impact approach to close the math achievement gap by connecting formal and informal STEM educators around a coherent, multi-faceted program of early mathematics teaching and learning that empowers parents and teachers to support children's mathematical development. Implementation of Math FACESS includes four major components: 1) Teachers at two pilot schools will participate in professional development related to Math Talk and Listening; 2) Parents at the pilot schools will participate in parent workshops and community-based activities focused on supporting their children's math achievement; 3) Project partners will implement community-based family activities organized around a theme of Twelve Months of Math; and 4) Ecosystem partners will study what worked and what didn't, in order to identify best practices that can be shared with system leaders to scale effective practices and increase impact.\r\n\r\nThe near-term objectives for Math FACESS are: 1) improve students' attitudes, practices, and achievement in math; 2) improve parents' attitudes, practices, and confidence in math and increase their utilization of family math resources; 3) improve data-sharing among partners related to math participation and achievement; and 4) create pathways within the Ecosystem for family math learning. The effectiveness of the collective impact model and impacts on partner organizations also will be assessed. Through the math FACESS Launch Pilot, the NM STEM Ecosystem plans to: 1) demonstrate the power of a collective impact social innovation framework to address a systemic community condition -- in this case, the math achievement gap; 2) contribute to theory-of-change research that demonstrates student achievement can be affected by working with parents and teachers; and 3) provide a model that values different ways of knowing and uses cultural context in the design of STEM learning opportunities for students, families, and schools.",

Using a collective impact framework, Math FACESS brought together the cross-sector New Mexico STEM Learning Ecosystem (STEM-NM) and several ?Action Partners,? to define and implement a series of pilot programs with the near-term objectives to: 1) improve students? attitudes, practices, and achievement in math; 2) improve parents? attitudes, practices, and confidence in math and increase their utilization of family math resources; 3) improve data-sharing among partners related to math participation and achievement; and 4) create pathways within the local STEM Ecosystem for family math learning.</p>\n<p>The project was developed based on research conducted by Mission: Graduate (an initiative of the United Way of Central New Mexico), which identified early math achievement among Albuquerque?s low-income students of color as an area of critical need. Low math achievement also was identified by partners at UNM as a major barrier to students? persistence and graduation in STEM courses and degrees. STEM-NM partners knew that narrowing the achievement gap would require not only working with schools, but also creating pathways within the Ecosystem to support family math learning. Math FACESS<em>&nbsp;</em>used a collective impact approach (Kania and Kramer, 2011) to build and sustain public-private cross-sector organizational partnerships. Math FACESS included three major areas of work:</p>\n<p>1. Teachers at three pilot schools in the Albuquerque Public Schools system participated in research-based professional development, related to visual mathematics, growth mindset, and Math Talk and Listening. The workshops for both teachers and parents (below) were co-developed by Explora, the local hands-on science center; the UNM College of Education; APS Title I Math Recovery; and the NM PTA. Math FACESS teacher workshops connected formal and informal STEM educators around early mathematics teaching and learning and were designed to foster mathematical identity and confidence, create and solidify pathways, and promote a sense of community around math education.</p>\n<p>2. Parents at the same three pilot schools participated in parent workshops (similar to the teachers?) and in community-based family math activities, all focused on supporting their children?s math achievement. Families at the pilot schools were predominantly Hispanic, and nearly all qualified for free- or reduced-price lunch.</p>\n<p>3. The Project Team and Action Partners (local corporations and STEM employers) implemented monthly family activities for the public, organized around a <em>12 Months of Math</em> (12MoM) concept. For 12MoM programs, corporate partners and STEM employers related to the months? themes participated in collaborative activity planning, organized around the shared vision and goals. These partners provided content expertise and shared activities and career stories with a diverse, all-ages audience. For example, for <em>Math in Finance Month</em>, Fidelity Investments created and presented financial literacy activities for elementary and middle school students and families at Explora.</p>\n<p>The project team also connected elementary school students with near-peer mentors; the team worked with the STEM Collaborative Center at UNM to recruit and train undergraduates to develop and facilitate hands-on activities for younger students. These were presented at STEM Activity Day at one of the pilot schools. Undergraduates, project staff, teachers, and students all commented on the fun, engaging activities and conversations at the successful event.</p>\n<p>Though the Math FACESS interventions fell short of improving students? attitudes, practices, and achievement in math, an external evaluation done by the UNM Cradle to Career Policy Institute demonstrated evidence that the parent workshops did result in improving parents? attitudes, practices, and confidence in math, while increasing their utilization of family math resources. The majority of parents reported that, as a result of the Math FACESS workshops, they are more likely to show an interest in their children?s math work and more able to understand it. Similarly, teachers also showed significant changes; they were less likely to think that some students are better at math than others, and more likely to believe that anyone can become good at math given proper guidance and support. Many teachers indicated that they adopted behaviors consistent with the mathematical mindset promoted in project activities, like helping students develop a deeper understanding of the ?how? and ?why? of solving problems, rather than simply getting the answer right.</p>\n<p>The three major partners involved--UNM, APS, and Explora--established new data collection methodologies that increased their long-term capacity to share data related to math participation and achievement. Finally, this project helped create new pathways within the local STEM Ecosystem for family math learning and increased capacity for aligning and co-developing programs. Addressing the math achievement gap is no small feat; however, through the NSF INCLUDES-funded Math FACESS project, STEM-NM and its project partners made inroads into the systemic change that will be needed to create equity in local math education, opportunity, and achievement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/07/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Joseph&nbsp;L&nbsp;Hastings</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1744541/1744541_10525852_1599507639913_Explora_12MonthsofMath2017-10-0609.51.17--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1744541/1744541_10525852_1599507639913_Explora_12MonthsofMath2017-10-0609.51.17--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Family Math at 12 Months of Math\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1744541/1744541_10525852_1599507639913_Explora_12MonthsofMath2017-10-0609.51.17--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Family Math at 12 Months of Math\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">During Math in Air & Space Month, families engaged in math activities with STEM-NM partners at the hot air balloon museum.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Courtesy of Explora</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Joseph&nbsp;L&nbsp;Hastings</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Family Math at 12 Months of Math</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1744541/1744541_10525852_1599507817431_12MOMbrandedflyer--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1744541/1744541_10525852_1599507817431_12MOMbrandedflyer--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Family Math Resources\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1744541/1744541_10525852_1599507817431_12MOMbrandedflyer--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Family Math Resources\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The STEM-NM 12 Months of Math project provided public access to family math resources, including career connections and daily math activities and resources for parents and students.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Courtesy of Explora</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Joseph&nbsp;L&nbsp;Hastings</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Family Math Resources</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1744541/1744541_10525852_1599508681261_NSFINCLUDESposter_May2019--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1744541/1744541_10525852_1599508681261_NSFINCLUDESposter_May2019--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Math FACESS Project Overview\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1744541/1744541_10525852_1599508681261_NSFINCLUDESposter_May2019--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Math FACESS Project Overview\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Math FACESS poster, used for conference presentations, detailing project activities and partners</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Courtesy of Explora</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Joseph&nbsp;L&nbsp;Hastings</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Math FACESS Project Overview</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
