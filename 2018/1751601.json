 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wildfires and prescribed fires are the largest source of fine particulate matter emissions in the United States. Smoke from these fires exposes millions of individuals to unhealthy air quality each year. In spite of this, fire is an essential component of many natural ecosystems where fire suppression has proven to be an unsustainable practice that harms the natural balance. The PI will develop computational tools and innovative assessments to help US land managers lessen the impact to human health of air pollution from smoke, while at the same time restoring the natural fire cycle to improve ecosystem health. Concurrent with this applied research initiative will be an educational program to train specialized environmental engineers and inform different segments of the US public about the benefits and challenges associated with wildland fire. \r\n\r\nWildland managers routinely manipulate fire, through prescribed burns and mechanical land treatments, to reduce the risk of hazardous wildfire and achieve important ecological objectives; however, these fire projects often fail to quantitatively account for the health impacts of smoke exposure. In contrast, air quality regulations seek to mitigate the negative effects of air pollution on public health but can overlook the value of active land management. Through computational modeling, environmental engineering education, and outreach the PI aims to align these air quality and land management objectives. To pursue this aim, the project includes the following goals: 1) enable fire management based on potential health impacts; 2) incorporate air pollution externalities into prescribed fire planning; 3) develop integrated land management and air quality scenarios; and 4) change perceptions of fire and smoke through environmental engineering education.  New modeling tools that encompass aspects from emissions to air pollution exposure will facilitate fire project management while minimizing potential health impacts. High-performance computing and ensemble modeling will be used to generate geographic assessments of the public health externalities of prescribed fire, facilitating their inclusion in regional wildland fire planning. The PI will also develop integrated land management and air quality scenarios that jointly consider wildfire risk, land treatments, air quality, and public health impacts. These scenarios will provide a basis for comprehensive integrated assessment modeling of wildland fire beyond smoke impacts. The PI will seek to change misguided perceptions of fire and smoke among scientific and broader communities by establishing an educational partnership with the North Carolina State Division of Parks and Recreation centered on wildland fire and smoke. A key outcome of this work will be the formation of graduate and undergraduate environmental engineers trained in simulation of complex environmental systems and effective science communication. In addition, summer research experiences will expose high school students to environmental research and encourage the participation of students from underrepresented groups in engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
