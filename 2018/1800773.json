 "awd_abstract_narration": "The core of this project is the problem of incomplete data: situations where we only have partial information and need either to estimate the missing data or to find ways to solve the problem based only on our fragmentary knowledge.  In this project, we use tools from geometry as well as from combinatorics, namely the sophisticated counting techniques that allow us to analyze patterns in diverse applications from DNA sequencing to optimization.  The work contributes significantly to developing a more diverse workforce in mathematics, both increasing the pipeline for women and underrepresented minorities and strengthening retention further downstream. This includes incorporating student researchers at all stages of their careers into the PI's lab.\r\n\r\nThe specific research addressed in this proposal is: 1) combinatorially analyzing the transition matrices between two important bases of irreducible symmetric-group representations, the web basis and the tableau basis; 2) describing the geometry and topology of components of Springer fibers and, more generally, Hessenberg varieties; 3) computing the (equivariant) cohomology rings of Hessenberg varieties; and 4) describing generalized splines for different edge-labeled graphs.  The PI is an expert in Hessenberg varieties and the GKM approach to equivariant cohomology; a sequence of the PI's papers on these subjects, together with new work by Harada, Rhoades, and others, leave the field poised on the brink of new discoveries.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "This project analyzed complicated geometric objects using a simplified \"skeleton\" called a graph.  Graphs allow us to analyze and even optimize different features of the original object much more quickly and easily than direct manipulation.  Splines form one important family of labeled graphs.  Engineers developed splines as a kind of approximation for use in the design process: pick key points on the geometric object (boat, say) and connect them with thin strips of wood or metal to get a ``popsicle-stick\" model that can be tested and rescaled both quickly and cost-effectively.  The mathematical descriptions of splines are now used in fields as varied as computer graphics, data interpolation, engineering, numerical analysis &mdash; anywhere we find either partial data that we want to complete, or overly-detailed data that we want to compress to its essentials.  \n\n \nIn this project, we studied what are called \"generalized splines,\" using mathematical abstractions to identify key structures within splines then developing algorithms to concisely generate all splines.  This work was motivated by a longstanding open question in analysis called the Upper Bound Conjecture, upon which we made notable progress.  An important theoretical application of splines describes the symmetries of geometric objects via a construction of equivariant cohomology called \"GKM theory.\"  These symmetries are kinds of representations.  This research in this part of the project developed key steps towards a GKM-theoretic solution to an open question called the Stanley-Stembridge conjecture, which aims to identify the fundamental building blocks of representations.  \n\n \nA second part of this project used similar mathematical tools and approaches to analyze a family of geometric objects called \"Springer fibers\" and their generalization, Hessenberg varieties.  Springer fibers themselves parametrize what can be called the fixed points of a multidimensional function called a matrix.  We discovered a \"skeleton\" of the Springer fibers, certain labeled graphs that concisely encode the geometry of Springer fibers more effectively than any other method known to date.  These graphs arise in knot theory and certain sorts of theoretical physics.  Thus, the ideas promise to extend to a larger class of geometric objects, and to provide a kind of dictionary that translates between geometry, knot theory, and representation theory.\n\n \nFinally, a core goal of this project is to build and sustain diversity amongst mathematicians and those working in quantitative fields, more generally.  Some of the publications and presentations from this work focused on professional development for junior mathematicians, especially for those without a large professional network to guide them.  In addition, the project developed talent directly through a large lab of undergraduate and postbaccalaureate students who worked on different aspects of this research.  Through the research lab as well as the PI\u2019s work codirecting the postbaccalaureate program at Smith College, this project has expanded access to graduate programs in the mathematical sciences, especially among students who don\u2019t fit the stereotype of a mathematician.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/20/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Julianna Tymoczko"
