 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research training for the next generation of marine scientists and oceanographers is an important focus for the Division of Ocean Sciences. The Mote Marine Lab (MML) in Sarasota, FL will host  a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program from 2018-2020. The program will bring ten undergraduates to MML each summer for a 10-week internship. The intellectual focus of the internship is on estuarine, coastal, and marine sciences. Research at the laboratory encompasses the diversity and interconnectedness of ocean and coastal resources and includes basic and applied research on biological and chemical features of estuaries and nearshore waters, and on behavioral and physiological aspects of species inhabiting these ecosystems \r\n\r\nStudents will conduct independent research projects with the guidance of research mentors and will participate in a variety of professional development activities, including workshops on scientific ethics, scientific writing, the graduate school experience and career options, as well as a seminar series, field trips and outreach events. The program conducts a national search for applicants and seeks to engage students who are from schools with limited research opportunities. Most of the funding provided supports student stipends, housing and travel to attend the program. This project supports the national goals of developing the next generation of scientists and the scientific workforce. \r\n\r\nThe MML REU Site will provide a total of thirty undergraduates with internships over the three-year period. Student will work with mentors who have a wide range of ongoing research on topics such as ocean acidification, effects of Deepwater Horizon oil spill and responses of estuarine or coastal communities to changes in environmental parameters (e.g. temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
