 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the National Science Foundation's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (S-STEM) program, the ACCESS: Achieving Commuter Engagement and Success program is providing support to low-income students with demonstrated financial need and academic promise to succeed in STEM disciplines at Wayne State University. The project is funding 84 scholarships over 5 years for students who are pursuing bachelor's degrees in Engineering.  The ACCESS program will focus on addressing the unique needs of students who commute, and seeks to generate knowledge on the factors that affect the engagement of commuters with the campus community.  Program elements such as a summer engineering boot camp, peer and faculty mentoring, experiential learning through internships and co-ops will be implemented to support student success.  \r\n\r\nThe goals of the ACCESS program are to increase the retention and six year graduation rates of commuter students with low-income socioeconomic status. Wayne State University (WSU) is located in downtown Detroit, Michigan, and serves a population of low-income students who commute to campus.  These commuters are at great risk for withdrawal and poor academic progress due to their need to balance academics with many off-campus commitments, most notably work. Through combined research and educational activities, this work will address the following questions: 1) what are the barriers to commuter student participation in engagement and academic support activities, 2) how well do virtual activities promote the engagement and student success compared to in-person activities, 3) are there barriers to participation in virtual activities for students of low socioeconomic status, and 4) are these barriers to participation different among different ethnic groups?  The project will be evaluated through surveys, academic performance in success marker courses, retention rates, and four- and six-year graduation rates.  The results of this work will be disseminated to the campus community and to the wider global audience through peer reviewed publications and oral presentations at national meetings.  The results of this work will be used to inform the development of new programs with increased effectiveness in promoting the engagement and academic success of students who commute.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe primary objective of program known as ACCESS (Achieving Commuter Engagement and Success) was to increase the six-year graduation rate of students in engineering and computer science majors. The ACCESS program served 41 students and 25 students graduated with degrees STEM by the completion of the award. The first two cohorts of this program had 6-year graduation rates that were approximately 40% higher than engineering students at our university who did not participate in the program. \n\n\nThis S-STEM had a specific focus on developing mentoring, peer-interactions, and programs that were well suited to students that commuted to campus on a regular basis. Commuter students are known to have a greater risk for withdrawal and poor academic progress than residential students due to their need to balance academics with many off-campus commitments, including work. While many universities, including ours, have programs to support student success, many are focused on the needs and behaviors of residential students. As a result, participation by commuter students in these programs is low.\n\n\nUnderstanding that a rigid set of required activities or events was poorly suited to commuter students with disparate schedules and out of school activities, we developed a flexible programming model. In this model, students were provided with a range of different activities, offered in different modes (for example, offered on campus or virtually) to chose from. The benefits of this model were obvious, as student participation in extra-curricular activities increased. This was a significant achievement of the work, since it is known that increased campus engagement is correlated with improved academic success. The flexible programming model allowed the team to identify the types of events students found the most valuable through review of student activity reports. Essentially, in this model, students voted with their time. Another significant benefit of this model is that it is easily transferable to other universities.\n\n\nWith respect to online vs. in-person events, it was found that certain types of activities could be done in an impactful way in a virtual environment. Most notably, career exploration and professional development type activities. The online nature of these events allowed us to better accommodate the schedules of both our students and working professionals. However, it was challenging to build relationships within the ACCESS program through virtual environments. This was shown clearly during the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced our university into remote operations for over a year. Students who entered the ACCESS program before the pandemic were able to participate in face-to-face events, including team building exercises when they matriculated to the university. The early cohorts were shown to have a substantially greater sense of belonging than cohorts that entered the university during the pandemic. Through the pandemic they were able to maintain the relationships they had originally built through in person interactions in a virtual environment. The last two cohorts were not able to participate in similar in-person activities, however, and found it difficult to build relationships with classmates until 2022 (1-2 years post matriculation) when the pandemic had largely abated. Therefore, it is hypothesized that even for commuter students, any student support program should include some in-person components to build a sense of community.\n\n\nAnother key question studied by the project was are there barriers to participation in virtual activities for students of low socio-economic status? Data obtained were mixed on this question. All students in the program had appropriate equipment, e.g. laptop computer with webcam, and/or cell phone. The primary barrier that we became aware of during the pandemic was access to stable high-speed Internet. Had their Internet service not also been used for full-time coursework, it likely would have been sufficient for virtual program activities.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/24/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JeffreyJPotoff\n"
