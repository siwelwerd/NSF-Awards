 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide support for the special symposium, Population Biology of Vector-borne Diseases, which will be held February 24th, 2018 in Athens, GA. In recent years, the emergence of viruses such as West Nile virus, Chikungunya virus, and Zika virus have led to public health crises in several countries including the United States. The new problems introduced by these emerging diseases, coupled with the continued devastation caused by diseases such as malaria and dengue, have led to rapid development in the study of vector-borne diseases.  This symposium is expected to result in increased understanding of the mechanisms in which vector-borne diseases spread, evolve and respond to host conditions, as well as provide a catalyst for future collaborative research across disciplines. This will in turn promote new strategies for vector-borne disease prediction, management, and elimination. The majority of the requested funds will be used in partial support of the travel costs for presenting scientists and to provide travel scholarships to students who may otherwise face barriers to participation. Efforts will be made to recruit participants of under-represented groups.  The work discussed in this symposium will be published as Population Biology of Vector-borne Diseases, the second volume in the new Oxford series Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases, and will serve as the only comprehensive survey of this field. \r\n\r\nVector-borne pathogens of animals and plants are key areas of study across a variety of disciplines and perspectives. From an applied perspective, many vector-borne pathogens cause severe disease, which results in high economic and social costs, while from a fundamental perspective the complex interactions that evolve between vector organisms, pathogens, and terminal hosts have provided key insights on how pathogens function and evolve.  In the case of vector borne diseases of humans, studies of malaria and dengue remain national priorities while emerging viruses have introduced new scientific questions and practical problems. While a diversity of applied therapeutic initiatives are in progress, many important organismal and suborganismal questions remain unclear and hinder understanding of disease transmission and evolution.  Addressing these questions requires expertise in multiple scientific disciplines and integrative approaches to future research, thus presenting an imminent need for forums that bring together scientists and students across disciplines to synthesize information and plan for future research. The symposium, Population Biology of Vector-borne Diseases, will bring together a group of leading scientists in the study of vector-borne diseases, representing multiple countries and both industry and academic sectors. Collectively, these speakers represent a multitude of perspectives including biology, ecology, veterinary medicine, entomology, epidemiology, biostatistics, computer science and geography.  This symposium will provide a forum for scientists and students to synthesize existing knowledge across disciplines, develop a vision for future research, and initiate plans for future collaborative studies from an integrative biology perspective.",

The symposium concluded with a poster session and reception, in which 24 attending students, postdoctoral associates, and faculty members shared their research and sought feedback and critique.\n\nThe 14 guest speakers represented expertise in the fields of biology, ecology, veterinary medicine, entomology, epidemiology, biostatistics, computer science, and geography and included speakers representing both academic and private industry sectors.  Symposium speakers represented institutions in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia.  This wide range of perspectives contributed to an integrative biology perspective, which allowed attendees to both strengthen their proficiency in their own discipline while learning of research and resources available through related disciplines.\n\nThe symposium provided ample opportunity for attendees to network and plan for future collaboration, during coffee/meal breaks, and the closing reception.  In addition to informal networking during these breaks, a student breakout session was held during lunch, in which UGA PhD Students met with visiting students to discuss their academic careers, research, and opportunities for collaboration with the CEID.  Undergraduate and graduate students represented 50 of the 105 attendees, providing a strong balance between seasoned researchers and those in the early stages of their scientific career. This led to substantial opportunity for skills transfer to rising scientists, who had the opportunity to not only learn from vector-borne disease experts, but also explore opportunities for future collaboration, internships, graduate school, postdoctoral positions, and jobs through interaction with fellow attendees.  These attendees represented 26 colleges and Universities, 2 private industry organizations, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n            During the panel discussion, guest speakers identified three major needs for the advancement of vector-borne disease research.  These were:\n\n1)     The need to improve data collection and reduction of bias in surveillance data\n\n2)     The need for making data more available\n\n3)     The need for ongoing interdisciplinary workshops and working groups for the exchange of new ideas across multiple perspectives\n\nThe CEID seeks to respond to this final need by making an interdisciplinary symposium an annual occurrence, with the specific topic to change from year to year.  The audience was enthusiastic to this prospect, and the post-symposium evaluation solicited suggestions for the next topic.  Many topics were suggested, and the CEID has begun preliminary plans for a 2019 symposium.  Also of note in the evaluation, 90% of responses indicated that the attendee was either satisfied or very satisfied with the overall event.  Narrative feedback was also provided, with one attendee noting, \"I loved the fact that the symposium covered topics such as theoretical, empirical, and social science. I truly appreciated the fact that a lot was mentioned regarding bridging these fields rather than arguing that one is better than the other. The highlighted importance of collaboration could not have been made clearer.\"  Another noted, \"This was a fantastic event and really shined a spotlight on what a vibrant research community UGA has in this field.\"  The CEID is excited by the success of this event, and looks forward to continued activities in the advancement of disease ecology research.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/22/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John M Drake"
