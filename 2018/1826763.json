 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation program is an alliance-based program.  The program's theory is based on the Tinto model for student retention.  The overall goal of the program is to assist universities and colleges in diversifying the nation's science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce by increasing the number of STEM baccalaureate and graduate degrees awarded to populations historically underrepresented in these disciplines:  African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.\r\n\r\nThe Kentucky-West Virginia Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (KY-WV LSAMP) STEM Pathways and Research Alliance (SPRA) project consists of ten institutions that include both two- and four-year institutions of higher education.  These are the: University of Kentucky (Lead Institution), Bluegrass Community and Technical College, Centre College, Jefferson Community and Technical College, Kentucky State University, University of Louisville, Marshall University, West Virginia University, West Virginia State University, and Western Kentucky University,  The KY-WV LSAMP project will continue to utilize evidence-based techniques to aggressively increase the competitiveness quality and number of students from traditionally underrepresented minority (URM) populations who receive degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines; and 2) partner with social sciences researchers to examine the impact of LSAMP activities and pedagogical techniques on LSAMP participant academic success and graduation. Activities focus on providing URM students with the skills, background knowledge, and professional networks to become successful leaders in academia, government and the private sector. Emphases will be placed on activities that enhance cognitive and non-cognitive skills to improve academic success by increasing 1) professional skills, through research experiences and faculty mentoring; 2) leadership skills through peer mentoring and K-12 mentoring opportunities; and 3) professional networks through access to research and presentation opportunities in Kentucky, West Virginia, nationally, and internationally. KY-WV LSAMP administration, staff, and faculty mentors and researchers will have knowledge of and access to a wealth of tested program components, shared expertise, insights, local best practices, and teaching/learning resources.\r\n\r\nThe research study will help the Alliance reach goals and attain outcomes by examining the impact of LSAMP programs on non-cognitive factors related to academic success and graduation, including academic motivation; STEM self-efficacy, identity, belonging, and attitudes; and experiences of racial micro-aggressions over the course of participation in the LSAMP program relative to their non-LSAMP peers. Project findings from evaluation activities will be disseminated via social media, websites, STEM conferences and the development of new scholarly publications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
