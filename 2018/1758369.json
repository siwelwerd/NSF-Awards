 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program Capacity Building project will address a severe shortage of science teachers in Maine. The overarching goal of the project team is to create a plan to enable high-needs schools in the state to \"grow their own\" science teachers by recruiting and training students from these schools and having them potentially return to that school as teachers. Three project objectives will guide the work of the principal investigators. First, they will develop new ways to increase student awareness of science teaching careers. Second, they will create smoother pathways to enter the science and secondary education programs at Saint Joseph's College (SJC). Third, they will establish connections between SJC and high-needs Local Education Agencies (LEAs) to enable recruitment of potential teachers, placement of apprentice teachers, and support of new teachers in those schools. Innovative features of the project include the piloting of a no-cost, college credit-bearing, online \"Introduction to Education\" course, a series of career exploration workshops, and a study of the barriers to entering science teaching that community college students face. Taken together these efforts will build SJC's capacity to attract students to their science teacher training programs.\r\n\r\nThe project will develop partnerships between SJC and high-needs LEAs Biddeford, Bonny Eagle, Caribou, Fort Kent, Gray-New Gloucester, Lewiston, Westbrook, and Windham school districts. Southern Maine Community College and Central Maine Community College will serve as community college partners. These partnerships will support the \"Grow Your Own\" model by facilitating communication among the members so that the model can be continuously improved and so that students can remain engaged throughout their training and first years of teaching. The proposed online course, career exploration workshops, and study of barriers to entering science teaching among community college students will generate new knowledge of interest to the STEM education community about effective practices to increase the number of high school science teachers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGrowing Future STEM Teachers in Maine (GFSTM) is a collaboration between Saint Joseph's College (SJC) and Southern Maine Community College (SMCC) and was initiated as a result of this capacity building award. \n\n\n\n\n\nGFSTM seeks to bridge the gap between the need for qualified and diverse STEM teachers in high-need school districts and the capacity of SJC to 1) recruit, 2) prepare, and 3) support new science teachers placed in high-need districts. This capacity building project generated interest in STEM teaching among Saint Joseph's College, Southern Maine Community College, and partner high school populations, developed relationships between these organizations, and created infrastructure for the long term success toward the goal of growing highly qualified STEM teachers to serve in high needs schools.\n\n\n\n\n\nActivities focused on sparking interest and creating opportunities for students to consider secondary STEM teaching as a career and to develop new pathways into the profession.  A study of the perceptions of the profession and pathways into it held by SJC and SMCC students informed the design of such activities.  For example, most students with at least some level of interest in teaching stated that giving back to the community was a key upside/motivator to entering the profession which informed our communications.  Formal teaching experiences and flexible course formats were also encouragements which informed in our development of the Teaching Experiences Short Course and Educational Fourndations, described below.   \n\nThe experiences that were designed and delivered include 1) recurring Careers in STEM Teaching Workshops, where secondary STEM teachers from partner school districts discuss with students their career paths and tell stories illustrating their work, 2) an online version of the SJC introductory course Educational Foundations, and 3) a week-long intensive Teaching Experience Short Course.  Each was successful in recruiting students into STEM &amp; Secondary Education programs at SJC and elsewhere.  \n\nA strong relationship between SMCC and SJC developed as evidenced by the creation of three articulation agreements, and the first participant taking advantage of the smooth transfer between the two insitutions.  The Educational Foundations course, offered in a flexible online modality during the summer is a key stepping stone for students entering the programs from community colleges or traditional STEM majors.  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/19/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Emily Lesher"
