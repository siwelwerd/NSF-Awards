 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will enable cohorts of students from engineering, anthropology, and other sustainability-related disciplines to collaborate and study the efficacy of sanitation and wastewater treatment technologies as well as the role of culture and local perceptions on the safe recovery of energy, nutrients, and clean water from human excreta and wastewater. Over the course of three years, a total of 18 US students will be supported to study the performance of different technologies at the Center for Research and Training in Sanitation (CePTS) in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. This facility, which is co-managed by the Federal University of Minas Gerais and the State Wastewater Company of Minas Gerais, contains pilot-scale reactors that treat real wastewater from the city of Belo Horizonte. Considered one of the most important research and professional training centers of its kind in the Americas, it is used as a test site to evaluate the effectiveness of new technologies and train wastewater system operators. In addition to broadening students' perspectives about sanitation, resource recovery, and risk within an interdisciplinary team setting, this project will also allow students to improve their intercultural abilities. The researchers will seek to recruit students that reflect our demographics as Title V Hispanic Serving Institutions, with a particular focus on underrepresented groups in the sciences and engineering. Students will participate in a five-day intensive crash course on Brazilian culture and Portuguese language, led by the San Diego State University Program on Brazil, where they will learn to articulate the opinions and perspectives of people from different cultures and backgrounds. They will gain an awareness of international, interdisciplinary, and community perspectives on the role of engineering and technology in the management of water, energy, and food systems. After participating in the research experience, students will share their experiences by engaging in local outreach activities at K-12 schools in Southern California.\r\n\r\nThe integration of water reuse and resource recovery into wastewater treatment and sanitation systems provides opportunities to simultaneously meet several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. However, the challenges of choosing appropriate and sustainable technologies are just as much social as they are technical. Inadequate assumptions about local attitudes and the role of technology in development can lead to the failure of systems. Thus, there is a need to integrate studies of the efficacy of sanitation and resource recovery technologies with assessments of social and cultural factors that influence perceptions about these technologies, as well as the perceived value and risk of recovering resources from wastewater and excreta. This three-year International Research Experience for Students (IRES) project will send interdisciplinary cohorts of six students each year (from Engineering, Anthropology and an interdisciplinary Sustainability Program) to Belo Horizonte, Brazil, to participate in a research experience with foreign mentorship at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG). Students will study the removal of emerging contaminants and characterize the risks associated with resource recovery from pilot-scale established and emerging wastewater treatment technologies at the Center for Research and Training in Sanitation (CePTS), which is co-managed by UFMG and the State Wastewater Company of Minas Gerais. Students will also investigate perceived values and risks through ethnographic research with community members and local stakeholders in the water and wastewater sector. The results of this research will support a new and growing field of interdisciplinary scientific literature on the topic of water, culture, and sustainability.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Two additional students completed research in Brazil with IRES participants, but with funding from the SDSU Behner-Stiefel Center for Brazilian Studies. Two other students could not travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but completed local projects while interacting remotely with Brazilian colleagues. Therefore, the project directly impacted 19 US students&mdash;58% of them were first generation college students; 53% qualified for need-based financial aid; 74% were women; 68% were Black, African-American, Hispanic, and/or Latinx; 68% studied Civil or Environmental Engineering; 32% studied Sociology, Anthropology, Public Health, Urban Planning, or Geography.</p>\n<p>Many cities in the Americas have experienced rapid urbanization. Land inequality and the lack of affordable public housing programs in Brazil caused the formation of densely-populated, low-income urban communities, including <em>ocupa&ccedil;&otilde;es</em> and <em>favelas</em>, which have been catalysts for grassroots water and sanitation infrastructure innovations, (e.g., simplified sewers). UFMG&rsquo;s faculty are global leaders in energy-efficient and natural wastewater treatment systems (e.g., upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors, high-rate algal ponds (HRAPs)). They have advanced technologies from the laboratory and pilot-scale to full-scale implementation. This environment provided for robust traineeship opportunities for the US student participants, who were mentored by graduate students, postdocs, and faculty from UFMG.</p>\n<p>Research placements for US student participants were field-based or lab-based, and many involved close interactions with community members and local professionals (e.g., sanitation district engineers). Most also included cross-disciplinary experiences (e.g., engineering students visited <em>favelas</em>, social science students visited labs or assisted with water sampling in the field). Some participants evaluated water quality in rivers and assessed the potential for river sampling to monitor COVID-19 trends in communities without centralized sewer connections. Other participants measured microplastics and antibiotic resistance in wastewater and surface waters, and compared these findings with community perceptions of water quality. At UFMG&rsquo;s state-of-the-art wastewater testbed facility, participants studied the performance of energy-efficient treatment technologies. Inspired in part by this facility, researchers from SDSU successfully secured funding to build a living learning laboratory and wastewater testbed facility in San Diego. Through qualitative, ethnographic research, participants discovered that while decisions made about sanitation in communities were primarily driven by an urgency to meet basic needs, they sometimes conveyed political strategies. For example, some members of social movements, including architects and engineers, viewed sanitation infrastructure as an essential tool to forge a path towards urban formalization and citizenship.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Results were shared with community partners and the scientific community. Seven US student participants presented at conferences, including the Southern California Conferences on Undergraduate Research, the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors conference, an American Water Works Association conference, and a national conference on antimicrobial resistance. One student presented her work about the alignment between community perceptions and water quality in a fishing region of Brazil. Another student presented research about the impact of sludge emptying frequency on solids concentrations in a UASB reactor. Three participants integrated Brazilian perspectives into their thesis or dissertation, and five published their work in peer-reviewed journals&mdash;two US student participants published an article with Brazilian PhD students on the reduction and partitioning of viruses and bacteria with solids in a UASB reactor and HRAP. SDSU faculty and UFMG colleagues developed interdisciplinary research collaborations, resulting in a new grant from the Brazilian government agency (CNPq), and a Fulbright US Scholar, who will be hosted at UFMG. All participants engaged in outreach with students from middle schools and high schools in East Los Angeles, from tribal communities in southern California, and from community colleges in San Diego, with the objective to inspire the students to pursue careers in sustainability-related STEM fields. Events included hands-on activities (building water filters) and discussions about the benefits of undergraduate research.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pre- and post-trip surveys and interviews with participants revealed increases in research self-efficacy and intentions to pursue careers in sustainable development. Many participants already had high perceived senses of belonging in their fields and strong intercultural competencies before the international experience, and there was no significant increase in those measures after their trips. These findings were published in a conference paper through the American Society for Engineering Education. After their research experience, some US student participants went on to pursue graduate degrees while others have applied their intercultural competencies at engineering firms, philanthropic organizations, and government agencies. For example, one participant went to work at a health surveillance firm on projects to improve antimicrobial resistance surveillance in southeast Asia and Africa.
