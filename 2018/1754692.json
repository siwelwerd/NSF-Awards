 "awd_abstract_narration": "Whether a newly emerged pathogen will become more or less harmful to its host over time is key to predicting the severity of disease outbreaks.  When new infectious diseases emerge, the effects on humans, agriculture and wildlife are sometimes devastating, as exemplified by Ebola, avian influenza, and West Nile virus.  However, other emergent diseases are much less severe, and may even go unnoticed.  The ability to predict the level of harm (i.e. virulence) that an emergent pathogen will cause is limited. This project will improve our ability to predict the severity of emerging diseases by identifying the factors that influence changes in virulence after the infection of a new host species. An extensive body of work has attempted to address this question. Almost all this work has the same shortcoming, key data are not available from the very start of the host-pathogen interaction. Host jumps mark the beginning of a host-pathogen interaction and they therefore provide the only opportunity to study entire trajectories of virulence evolution. The fish virus IHNV (infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus) in rainbow trout and salmon is one of the few systems where samples are available to look at these changes from the beginning for two, independent host jumps, making it an ideal research model.  Insights from the study of these host jumps will inform how best to allocate resources to combat the public health, economic, and biodiversity impacts of emerging diseases.  The project will also involve building capacity for the management of infectious disease through the education and training of graduate students, undergraduates, and technicians, with a focus on under-represented groups. \r\n\r\nWhether the virulence of a pathogen will evolve upwards or downward after emergence in a new host, is a foundational question in evolutionary ecology and infectious disease management. Suitable systems for such studies are rare because they require 1) an extensive collection of pathogen isolates sampled before and after host jumps, which span enough time for evolution to occur, 2) ecologically relevant ancestral and new hosts in which to do common garden experiments, and 3) the ability to measure virulence and key fitness components such as transmission potential in these experiments. The virus IHNV is one of the few pathogens that meet these requirements.  IHNV has been both endemic and epidemic in many salmonid fish populations of the Pacific Northwest since the 1950s, and made two independent host jumps into rainbow trout.  This research will utilize a collection of 3000 IHNV isolates that covers the two host jump events and five subsequent decades to pursue four research foci. (1) Experimental determination of viral virulence throughout emergence (2) Experimental determination of viral transmission potential throughout emergence. (3) Whole genome sequencing to determine genetic correlates of virulence and transmission potential. (4) Mathematical modeling to dissect the selective forces driving virulence evolution and assess the evolutionary risks of environmental change.  The research is expected to show that interactions between virulence, transmission potential, and the ecological setting can be used to explain changes in the virulence of an emerging pathogen over time.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Theory ascertains that pathogen should decrease in virulence as they adapt to new host types. But this theory is largely based on just one system, myxoma virus, which was introduced as a method of biocontrol for rabbit populations in Australia. Although myxoma evolved decreased virulence after its introduction, studies from other system, such as HIV in humans and mycoplasma in birds, suggest that this may not always be the virulence evolution trajectory. Much of this previous work is based on observational studies, where it is difficult to control for confounding management strategies such as vaccination or antibiotics. A wealth of mathematical modeling studies have also been published, evaluating possible mechanism of virulence evolution, but conclusions based on controlled experiments are lacking. Such empirical studies are needed to infer the trajectory and drivers of virulence evolution after pathogen emergence. This is critical for predicting which pathogen emergence event pose the greatest health threats. We conducted such empirical studies with infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus, which made a host jump from wild sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) to rainbow trout (O. mykiss) in fish farming in the 1960s, due to aquaculture practices. Since this host jump, the virus adapted to rainbow trout, rapidly diversifying and spreading worldwide through aquaculture. At present day, IHNV represents one of the primary pathogens causing loses for the rainbow trout industry and the virus has devastating impacts on salmonid fisheries and conservation.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nWe used 16 viral isolates collected spanning 50 years from the time of the host jump to nearly present day. The virus isolates included genogroups adapted to the ancestral sockeye salmon host as well as the novel rainbow trout host. Through highly replicated experiments, we exposed both host types to one of each of the virus isolates and measured fish survival to estimate virulence. We replicated these experiments at two research facilities, two temperatures, two dosages, and two host species. The work demonstrated that virulence has continued to increase through time as IHNV has adapted to its novel host (Fig. 1). No evolutionary changes were observed in the ancestral host (Fig. 2). Evaluation of viral shedding kinetics, direct host-to-host transmission, and infectivity also indicated that more recently collected viral isolates had higher fitness than more ancestral ones (Fig. 3). This provided a plausible mechanism for the observed virulence evolution. We then evaluated an expanded set of 51 viral isolates of the emergent virus genogroup to determine how virulence evolution depending on virus genetic lineage. We observed that the general pattern of continually evolving increased virulence (Fig. 4) and shedding (Fig. 5) remained, however the pattern was stronger across some lineages than others. To increase the inferential power of our collective data, we developed a robust statistical and modeling framework for elucidating virulence evolution and its association with viral fitness. We also produced full genome sequences of 99 viral isolates across the ancestral and novel host lineages and identified specific genes that were associated with the host adaptation and possibly virulence (Fig. 6).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThis project is one of only a handful that has empirically tested virulence evolution theory and demonstrated that pathogens can evolve increase virulence after emerging in a new host species. The results confirm findings from other observation studies is systems such and HIV and SARS-CoV-2. Understanding the trajectory and drivers of virulence after pathogen emergence is powerful management tool. Focus on pathogens prone to high virulence will allow for more prudent allocation of limited management resources.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThis project trained a large number of individuals in important infectious disease research skills. This included four senior personnel, two graduate students, five technicians, and over half a dozen undergraduate students. These individuals spanned a broad range of expertise and backgrounds. Senior personnel gained experience in the management of large teams, project oversight, budget management, and personnel supervision. Students and technicians gained training in microbiology, virology, molecular biology, statistics, mathematical modeling, bio-informatics, experimental design, publication, science communication, and mentoring. Several individuals advanced in their careers during this project. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nWe disseminated our results through 5 peer-reviewed publications, with at least half-a-dozen additional manuscripts in preparation. We also presented our results at dozens of professional meetings reaching academic, government, health profession, and industry audiences. Importantly, we directly communicated our results to industry partners and fish health managers, so as to bolster aquaculture production, fisheries, and conservation. We developed and implemented a course for faculty training in effective teaching practices, to enhance educational capacity in STEM. Course materials for various undergraduate and graduate courses were also developed as part of the project. Overall, this project contributed to the much-needed workforce capacity building for the management of wildlife, agriculture, and human pathogens.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/07/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: AndrewRWargo\n"
