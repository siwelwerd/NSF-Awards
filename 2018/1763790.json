 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project funded by the Special Projects Program in the Chemistry Division of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate. This work is for the core support of the Chemistry Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Leadership Group (LG). The intent of the group is to enhance the impact of the Chemistry REU community. This goal is addressed through three approaches. These include (1) strengthening communication across the CHEM REU community by maintaining an informative and resource-laden website (https://chemnsfreu.com) utilizing social media, and employing a centralized email; (2) broadening participation in the CHEM REU Program through recruitment and professional development at national conferences of minority-serving science societies; and (3) encouraging the exchange of ideas and sharing of best practices between the LG, current REU principle investigators (PIs), and potential PIs at symposia/workshops held at the Spring American Chemical Society National Meetings and the PI meeting, a triannual in-person meeting of the REU community, organized by the LG.\r\n\r\nThe activities leverage the previous success of the LG, while introducing new methods for achieving the defined objectives. Under this project, the LG meetings and leadership structure allow for year-round planning, development, and action upon ideas critical to the REU community. Through improved technology (updated website, social media presence, and centralized email), expanded educational and tracking initiatives (webinars, LinkedIn Groups, conference booths), and partnerships with other NSF-wide leadership groups, the CHEM REU LG strengthens communication with the REU community, shares best practices, and supports potential PI proposal preparation. Along those lines, the 2021 Chemistry PI Meeting allows face-to-face meetings among REU Site PIs, prospective REU PIs, and NSF program directors to share best practices, increase communication within the community, facilitate collaboration across disciplines, and increase efficient use of NSF resources. Broadening participation of underrepresented students at the REU sites is increased through outreach efforts at regional ACS meetings and national meetings of minority serving organizations. The diversity of Chemistry REU sites is increased through outreach to potential PIs at meeting booths, workshops, symposia and at the triannual PI meetings. This broad-based approach, addressing students, faculty, and Sites increases participation across the CHEM REU enterprise.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
