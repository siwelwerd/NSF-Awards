 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project compares different techniques for assisting individuals with stroke-related mobility impairments using a robotic ankle orthosis. Several promising assistance techniques have been developed for robotic prostheses and rehabilitation platforms, which have been extended to exoskeletons - worn at the ankle joint, and adapted for individuals with stroke. An ankle exoskeleton test bed is used to emulate each assistance technique, allowing comparisons of efficiency and effectiveness within the same platform. Each technique is first programmed and verified in pilot tests with this emulator, followed by multi-dimensional parameter studies, conducted first on subjects without neurological impairment and then on subjects with hemiparesis following stroke. The results for each technique are used to identify ideal parameters and their settings, which facilitates across-technique comparisons and development of a standardized set of quantitative performance metrics, including measures of effort, preferred speed, and stability. These studies will contribute to a scientific foundation for the design and prescription of robotic ankle-foot orthoses that will benefit the millions of impaired individuals.",

Prior to this project, however, no exoskeleton had demonstrated the capacity to substantially improve a person?s energy economy. The purpose of this project was to learn about the best ways of reducing energy expenditure using exoskeletons worn on the ankle. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and Stanford University first developed a new type of versatile exoskeleton ?emulator?, which allowed for many different forms of assistance to be tested using the same hardware. They then developed a new way of automatically customizing exoskeleton assistance to an individual user?s needs, called ?human-in-the-loop optimization?. They used these new tools to identify the best ways of assisting unimpaired walking, finding that the right form of assistance could reduce energy cost by about 25%, a major improvement over prior approaches.</p>\n<p>This project has had a profound impact on exoskeleton research and promises to lead to technologies that improve people?s everyday lives. Emulation and optimization methods developed in this project are now used by many lower-limb exoskeleton research groups, speeding the development of new assistive technologies. One of the students trained through this project started a company, HuMoTech, to commercialize the exoskeleton emulators. They now have six full-time employees and have sold systems to more than ten research laboratories. They are developing new devices to improve clinical prescription, which could lead to better outcomes for people using lower-limb orthotics. The ankle exoskeleton assistance techniques identified in this project are also being commercialized by other industry partners, which may soon allow consumers to purchase devices that make walking long distances easier. These technologies are also expected to lead to devices that improve speed and safety for soldiers and first responders, and eventually to devices that help people with disabilities.</p>\n<p>During the course of this project, researchers also discovered that it is possible to reduce the energy cost of human walking with exoskeletons that use no power themselves. This showed that improvements to the overall efficiency of human walking are possible, and may lead to new products that improve mobility without bulky motors or batteries. In trying to improve these low-power exoskeletons, researchers developed a new ultra-low-power way of actuating robotic devices based on electrostatic adhesion. Robots incorporating this technology could use much less electrical energy to perform some tasks, with minimal increase in size or complexity. One of the students trained through this project started a company, ESTAT Actuation, to commercialize this technology.</p>\n<p>This project provided substantial educational experiences to dozens of young people, many of whom are now employed in the robotics industry or pursuing higher education. During the six-year project, nine PhD students, four master?s students and fourteen undergraduate students, about two thirds of whom were women and about one quarter of whom were from underrepresented minority groups, played a role in conducting this research. These students regularly received technical instruction and professional guidance from the professor leading the project and presented their work at national and international conferences where they met and learned from other researchers. They have gone on to graduate studies at top-tier institutions, to technical jobs in industry, to start their own companies, or to become faculty themselves. As part of the outreach component of this project, ten students from a Pittsburgh high school serving underprivileged neighborhoods participated in year-long robotics design projects, advised by the professor and teams of undergraduate students from Carnegie Mellon.

First, it was found that training of exoskeleton users was essential to augmenting performance, but little is known about the best way to provide this training. Second, it was found that people with disabilities such as stroke or amputation were not able to adapt to device assistance as well as unimpaired individuals. Further study of training and motor learning is needed to achieve similar improvements in mobility for people with disabilities.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified:
