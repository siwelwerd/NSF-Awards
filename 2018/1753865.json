 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many organisms can respond to changes in their environment by dramatically altering their morphology, behavior, or physiology, and the widespread occurrence of this ability has provoked a spirited debate. On the one hand, many biologists maintain that the flexibility to change appearance, behavior or physiology are of no relevance to evolution, because evolution requires genetic change. On the other hand, a growing number of researchers have suggested that such flexibility plays a critical role in evolution by jump-starting genetic change. This research will help resolve this controversy by investigating whether changes in appearance, behavior and/or physiology precede (and enable) the evolutionary origins of major, new, genetically-encoded features. The research will specifically evaluate whether pre-existing, diet-induced flexibility has contributed to the evolution of a novel, complex body form in spadefoot frogs. Thus, not only will this research provide important insights into the evolutionary process, it will also shed new light onto one of biology's enduring mysteries: how complex features originate. The research will also promote educational outreach by training school children and undergraduate students and by organizing public talks at museums.\r\n\r\nThis research will test the Plasticity-First hypothesis of adaptive evolution. To do so, the proposed research will focus on spadefoot toads. Like most frogs, tadpoles in the genus Scaphiopus develop only into a typical 'omnivore' morph. By contrast, tadpoles in the genus Spea exhibit striking plasticity: depending on their diet, they develop into either omnivores or a novel 'carnivore' morph. Interestingly, certain components of this distinctive carnivore morph can be diet-induced in Scaphiopus. Moreover, some Spea populations have secondarily lost the omnivore-carnivore plasticity and become monomorphic. Indeed, in some populations, selection has favored the near fixation of the carnivore morph. Thus, as a group, spadefoots appear to represent different stages in the evolution of the novel carnivore morph: from its possible initial induction (in Scaphiopus), to its refinement as part of a novel developmental 'switch' (in many Spea populations), to its ultimate fixation (in some Spea populations). The planned research will evaluate whether this novel carnivore phenotype arose through plasticity-first evolution by contrasting development, genetic variation, and performance in different species/populations that serve as different evolutionary stages in the origins of this distinctive form. In doing so, the research will evaluate the critical predictions of the plasticity-first hypothesis. This research will thereby help to clarify plasticity's role in evolutionary innovation and provide a roadmap for others to test the plasticity-first hypothesis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

On one side, many biologists argue that phenotypic plasticity is irrelevant to evolution because it necessitates genetic change. On the other side, some researchers propose that plasticity plays a pivotal role in evolution by catalyzing genetic change. To significantly advance our understanding of how plasticity impacts evolution, this research investigated whether plasticity precedes and facilitates the evolutionary origins of major, new features through a process known as plasticity-led evolution (<strong>Figure 1</strong>).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\">To do so, the research asked whether pre-existing, diet-induced plasticity has contributed to the evolution of a novel, complex body form&nbsp;in a fascinating group of amphibians: spadefoot toads. Spadefoots are found throughout the United States and northern Mexico, occurring even in deserts. To cope with arid environments, they have evolved numerous adaptations. Among these is that the tadpoles of several species have evolved a unique form of plasticity (<strong>Figure 2</strong>): although they normally develop into a round-bodied omnivore morph, if they eat meat (such as fairy shrimp), they may develop into a carnivore morph. This form, which specializes on meat, sports a large head, a serrated keratinized beak, and a short gut. Because they develop rapidly, carnivores are more likely to escape a drying pond.</p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\">To test whether this novel carnivore morph evolved through plasticity-led evolution, the PI and his students studied different species and populations of spadefoots that appear to represent various stages in the evolution of the carnivore morph. The team focused on five different species and populations of spadefoots:&nbsp;<em>Scaphiopus couchii&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Scaphiopus holbrookii</em>, which do not produce the carnivore morph;&nbsp;<em>Spea bombifrons&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Spea multiplicata</em>, which both produce the carnivore morph as part of a polyphenism; and certain populations of&nbsp;<em>Spea bombifrons</em>, which appear to be &lsquo;fixed&rsquo; for producing carnivore only; that is, the carnivore morph seems to have undergone &lsquo;genetic assimilation&rsquo; in these populations. When the team compared tadpoles reared on the plant-based diet of omnivores or the meat diet of carnivores, they found subtle but significant diet-induced plasticity in both<em>&nbsp;Scaphiopus</em>&nbsp;species. Because these two species exhibit the &lsquo;ancestral&rsquo; condition, in that they do not produce carnivores, this finding suggests that pre-existing plasticity might have been present in the ancestors of the modern-day genus&nbsp;<em>Spea</em>, the group that does produce carnivores. The research also uncovered evidence of adaptive refinement of this plasticity in both&nbsp;<em>Spea&nbsp;</em>species; for example, they grew equally well on both plants and meat, in contrast to both<em>&nbsp;Scaphiopus</em>&nbsp;species, which tended to grow poorly on a meat-based diet. Finally, the team found further refinement of the carnivore morph in&nbsp;<em>Spea bombifrons&nbsp;</em>populations that produce only carnivores. For example, these populations produced a version of the carnivore morph that was competitively superior to those produced by any other species or populations of&nbsp;<em>Spea bombifrons</em>. In short,&nbsp;this research suggests that the novel carnivore morph arose via plasticity-led evolution (<strong>Figure 3</strong>).&nbsp;More&nbsp;generally, this research indicates that knowledge of plasticity can enhance our understanding of evolution by emphasizing how the environment can both select on phenotypic variation and help generate that variation in the first place.</p>\n<p>This grant promoted educational outreach by training schoolchildren, undergraduate students, and graduate students. It supported over a dozen high school and undergraduate students, many from groups underrepresented in STEM. In addition, the grant enabled the PI and his team to organize and present public talks at several museum events. The PI also used the funding from this grant to make a book on plasticity (<em>Phenotypic Plasticity: Causes, Consequences, Controversies</em>), &lsquo;open access,&rsquo; so that anyone with an internet connection could download it for free. He also wrote an article on plasticity for the public in&nbsp;<em>American Scientist&nbsp;</em>magazine, which was later translated into German, French, and Italian to reach an even wider audience.
