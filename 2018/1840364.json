 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of global competencies in advanced degreed holders in STEM fields is critical to innovation, competitiveness, and economic development in the increasingly international marketplace of science and engineering.  This workshop brings together experts from different types of organizations (universities, non-profit entities, funding agencies, private sector) that participate, engage in, or have significant roles in STEM graduate education/training programs to formulate a series of recommendations on how best to structure programs that provide international experiences for graduate students.  The goal would be to identify the most efficient ways to support graduate students in their development of global competencies that will not increase time-to-degree or detract from their technical contributions.  The workshop also explores related topics such as how to provide international research experiences to students from under-represented groups and those who are economically disadvantaged. This event addresses concerns common to international research experiences for graduate students across all STEM disciplines.  Attendees/participants include representatives from the natural sciences, biological sciences, physical sciences, engineering, and social sciences; experts in educational psychology, program evaluation, and international relations add to the breadth of the conversation.\r\n\r\nThe main goals of the workshop are to address the following topical research questions;\r\n-- What is the appropriate role of the student's faculty research advisor (research mentor) in identifying, defining, permitting, and evaluating the advisee's international research activity?\r\n-- What are the appropriate timing and duration for introductory, follow-on, and subsequent international research experiences during a STEM PhD student's education/training?  What about a STEM master's student?\r\n-- What are the appropriate entities/metrics for assessing the international research activity experiences, defining the appropriate assessment tools, collecting and archiving data, and conducting longitudinal studies on international research experiences?\r\n\r\nPresenters/attendees are selected by the organizing committee to reflect as broad a view as possible, including those calling for major changes in how international research activities are structured and funded.  The outcomes of the workshop will be a publicly-accessible report with recommendations to the higher education, industry, non-profit, and governmental agency communities on how to improve global skills development in STEM advanced degree holders through effective international research activities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe primary goal of this project was to hold a workshop on best  practices in international research experiences for U.S. graduate  students abroad in order to better understand how these projects are  effectively structured and how their long-term effects can be tracked. A  supplemental award was given to study the immediate effects of the  COVID-19 pandemic on implementation of NSF-funded international research  experiences programs.\n\nFinal reports for the Workshop and follow-on Roundtable were prepared and are available on the workshop website.  A series of recommendations were made, highlights of which include the following:\n\nAn evaluation of the student's interpersonal and cognitive skills  development should be undertaken in order to determine their readiness  for the international experience.\nA  decision-tree approach should be used to assist students in determining  the optimal timing and duration of an  international research visit.\nA graduate student\u2019s research advisor  should serve as an advocate for their advisee\u2019s international research  experience.\nInstitutions should provide  training for research mentors on how best to facilitate international  research experiences for their graduate students\nThe academic community should develop  and  administer  surveys   on  international  research  experiences  to  current  and  former   graduate students, faculty, and university administrators.\n\n\nResults of the COVID-19  survey were analyzed presented to NSF program directors. Survey findings  indicate that PIs are mostly putting their international projects on  hold and waiting out the pandemic.  Of those interviewed, none were able  to travel for their projects in 2020, yet over half indicate that they  intend or hope to travel to the foreign site in 2021.  Over 360 undergraduate and 280 graduate  students participating in these reporting programs have been impacted by  the inability to travel due to COVID-19 restrictions.  Extrapolation to  include students from all active awards eligible to participate in the  survey indicates that over 1500 students were impacted by their  inability to complete the international component of their project in  2020.  Half of the PIs interviewed indicated that they were able to  continue their projects through virtual activities, with monthly  workshops with participants and foreign hosts being the most common.   Virtual activities included introductions to the host country, videos  from past participants, training lectures, and journal clubs.  In some  instances, student participants were given data from previous years or  from foreign hosts to analyze as part of home-based participation.   Planning for when travel resumes was a common activity.  Although  substitution of foreign partners with another to facilitate travel did  not occur, some projects created substitute activities such as focusing  on outreach rather than international research collaborations.   Nevertheless, many of the interviewed PIs expressed concern that the  inability to travel and meet with foreign hosts in person during 2020  negatively impacted the development of global and intercultural  competencies in their student participants, based on anecdotal  comparisons with previous cohorts who were able to travel.\n\nA beta  version of the international research opportunities decision tree is  also available on the workshop website.  It collects a series of  information including year in school, degree sought, major field of  study, and geographical areas of interest.  It then returns recommended  duration of stay and specific opportunities as pulled from an exisiting  website on international fellowship opportunities.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nInternational collaboration and cooperation permeate all of every-day  life, including the import/export of goods and services, social media  ethics and standards, and researcher mobility.  These initial  investigations into the foundations of global competence development  have implications into all areas of society.  As we understand what  leads to more effective international research collaborations, we can  better understand the societal implications of that research around the  world.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/09/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian S Mitchell"
