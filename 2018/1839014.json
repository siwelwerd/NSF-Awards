Progress requires bringing together experts in data curation with experts in Artificial Intelligence (AI) to begin a dialog and collaboration on AI tools to span the gap between data and its reuse.  The PIs will organize the conference \"Challenges and Opportunities in Scientific Data Discovery and Reuse in the Data Revolution: Harnessing the Power of AI\"; the objective is to bring together diverse stakeholders including research librarians and data managers, the AI community, and users and consumers of scientific data to dialog around critical places in the data lifecycle where AI could be groundbreaking.  \r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the National Science Foundation?s Public Access Initiative which is managed by the NSF Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure on behalf of the Foundation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
