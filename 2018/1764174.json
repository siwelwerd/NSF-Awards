 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental problem encountered throughout mathematics is to completely classify some type of mathematical object by invariants. Descriptive set theory gives a general framework for studying such classification problems and comparing their relative difficulties. The PI proposes research in descriptive set theory and its connections with geometrical paradoxes and computability. The main areas of study are constructive solutions to geometrical paradoxes, and the complexity of classification problems in mathematics viewed through the lens of definability.\r\n\r\nThe PI proposes studying geometrical paradoxes using advances made in descriptive graph combinatorics, and work classifying the complexity of actions of countable groups in ergodic theory and descriptive set theory. Recent progress in these fields particularly in the theory of definable flows in graphs and on the hyperfiniteness of actions of amenable groups, has led to progress in geometrical paradoxes such as a constructive solution to Tarski's circle squaring problem. The PI proposes building on this work to study further problems in this vein such as the uniqueness of Lebesgue measure as a finitely additive rotation invariant Borel probability measure on the n-sphere.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
