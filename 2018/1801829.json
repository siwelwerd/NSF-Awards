 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) program supports work by Professor Kenneth Knappenberger at Florida State University -endowed to develop advanced spectroscopic techniques for the investigation of the size-dependent and structure-specific optical properties of gold nanostructures ranging from quantum-confined clusters (< 2 nm) to plasmon-supporting particles (> 2 nm). Specifically, the PI, along with graduate students, will develop femtosecond time-resolved magneto-optical techniques to study both the electronic structure and excited state-dynamics of size-selected gold nanoclusters. The PI will also develop a nonlinear microscopy platform capable of single-particle measurements. These data will inform on plasmon modes that result from hybridization of gold nanostructures in both small aggregates and lithographically formed arrays.  Advances made in these two areas will be merged to describe plasmon-mediated electric-dipole transitions, and the nonlinear imaging facility will be extended to a magneto-optical platform capable of state-resolved plasmon-enhancement measurements. \r\n\r\nThe award will allow Professor Knappenberger to develop advanced measurement technologies to investigate systematically the nanoparticle structure-function interplay. This research will impact several technical areas: solar-energy conversion, national security, trace-level analysis and high-contrast biomedical imaging. Moreover, new facilities, capable of providing temporally and spatially resolved magneto-optical data, will be established. As a result, the group will establish a unique expertise that can be applied to problems in many areas of science and technology that require spin and oxidation state information. \r\n\r\nThis program will educate both undergraduate and graduate students in an interdisciplinary environment at Florida State University and will benefit from close interactions with the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. Also, in an effort to improve understanding and stimulate interest in science and technology among a diverse group of high school students, Professor Knappenberger will work closely with a high school teacher to introduce new instrumentation into an image-based chemistry curriculum.  Finally, as an extension of the investigator's classroom teaching, a series of instructional visual materials will be developed to describe proper use of scientific instruments to a diverse audience.",

Our research under this award has led to many key new understandings of how metal structure on the atomic to nanometer length scale affects fundamental properties related to these applications. In order to make these advances, it has been necessary for our research team to develop new experimental capabilities that provide atomic-level descriptions of metals. Some examples of our advances in experimental capabilities include the development of nonlinear optical microscopes that combine the highest possible spatial accuracies (10<sup>-9</sup>meters) and temporal resolutions (10<sup>-15</sup>seconds). Other examples include the development of energy- and time-domain measurements that use high applied magnetic fields (17 T), which are approximately 1700x larger than a common refrigerator magnet. This strong field has allowed us to resolve details about electron spin in metals, which can be important for spintronics and other quantum information applications. Our breakthroughs in experimental measurements have been described in several peer-reviewed publications and research presentations at universities, scientific conferences, and national laboratories. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>I will highlight key findings that occurred in three primary areas during the activities related to this award. They include describing the optical (plasmon) modes of nanoparticle assemblies, establishing new benchmarks for near-infrared nonlinear optics, and understanding mechanisms that lead to large degrees of spin polarization in metal clusters. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Throughout the course of this program, we have developed descriptions of the plasmonic excitations that form when multiple nanoparticles are arranged into a network. These networks exhibit electronic excitations that result only upon assembly &ndash; they are not a property of the isolated particle. Therefore, these modes can be considered as hybrid resonances whose properties can be tailored by network symmetry. We have published several papers demonstrating these effects, which include the generation of optically excited magnetic resonances, chiral and polarization rotating modes, and high-order resonances that can be described as having large quality factors. These large quality factors are especially important because increases of this value translate to more efficient use of light. This increased efficiency is important for developing optical microscopes with high spatial resolution and for better performance of nonlinear optical processes such as wavelength conversion and optical switching. These nonlinear optical phenomena can provide the basis for designing integrated optical circuits. In the case of plasmonic nanorods, we have learned that the appropriate arrangement of these particles into a trimeric &ldquo;dolmen&rdquo; structure can result in a 400% increase in the nonlinear optical yields of the structure (Figure 1). It is important to emphasize that this accomplishment was made possible by our experimental advances in correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) measurements.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Building on our fundamental research on nanoparticle networks, we have also worked to understand the nonlinear response of atomically thin 2D metals. This work was motivated, in part, by our desire to translate our fundamental findings on the metal networks to a scalable platform. The 2D metals can be formed reproducibly and uniformly over large areas, and they can be arranged in vertical stacks to form hybrid resonances similar to those of 3D colloidal networks. One further advantage of the 2D metals is that they can be formed from a large range of metals, which include earth-abundant elements, such as aluminum. We have demonstrated that these systems exhibit the largest known near infrared second-order chi<sup>(2)</sup>responses. In fact, the responses from these materials are 500x larger than those of industrial standards, such as lithium niobate, and 2000x larger than those of the gold colloids described in the previous paragraph (Figure 2). Using CLEM, we determined that the origin of this unusually strong response is a combination of out-of-plane quantum confinement and symmetry breaking. Based on this response, the 2D metals establish a new standard for evaluating nonlinear optical materials in the near infrared &ndash; a wavelength range that is essential for telecommunications applications. In future research, we will work to improve the efficiencies of these materials even further by the formation of layered heterojunctions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;We have also demonstrated that large degrees of spin polarization can be achieved in quantum metals when their structure is controlled at the atomic level. In the case of a twenty-five-atom gold cluster, we achieved 35% spin polarization, which is approximately 2x typical values for leading quantum materials. These properties can be used for quantum information applications.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;In addition to these research efforts, I also contributed to education in nonlinear optics and nanoscience. This work resulted in the graduation of six PhD and several undergraduate students, all of whom are now gainfully employed in academic, industrial, and government sectors.
