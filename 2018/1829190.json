 "awd_abstract_narration": "Roughly 1 TW is input into the ocean circulation by wind-work. How this balanced energy is dissipated to maintain steady state remains uncertain but is important for correctly modeling balanced energy pathways in ocean general circulation models. Loss to lee-wave generation followed by turbulence production has been hypothesized to account for 20-75 percent. The research will clarify lee-wave generation and the waves' role in dissipating vs. redistributing balanced energy. Results from this project will be presented at conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals to make them available to the wider scientific community. Data will be archived at public sites at University of Washington (UW) Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) and Northwest Research Associates. An improved model parameterization for the dissipation and redistribution of balanced flows and induced mixing by lee-wave generation is an expected outcome. The project will support a postdoctoral researcher in data analysis and internal-wave physics. Seattle K-12 classroom visits and active engagement with UW and local science centers is planned. The project will also contribute to the summer program for UW undergraduate students and the annual Pacific Science Center Polar Science Weekend.\r\n\r\nLee-wave generation (0.2-0.75 TW) and bottom drag (~0.25 TW) are two hypothesized sinks. The passage of the Kuroshio through Tokara Strait affords an accessible case to evaluate lee-wave generation and dissipation that impact a major western boundary current. It has been assumed that lee-wave generation is lost to turbulence. However, measurements in Antarctic Circumpolar Current jets find that turbulent dissipation rates fall short of predictions by as much as an order of magnitude. Measurements will be made to study internal lee-wave generation and evolution, hydraulic jumps, turbulence and water-mass transformation where the Kuroshio crosses a seamount chain in Tokara Strait. Line-arrays of chi-augmented EMAPEX profiling floats will be deployed at across-stream locations upstream of the seamount chain to be swept across by the Kuroshio, obtaining along-stream/depth sections from the surface to the bottom (< 600 m depth), and from up- to downstream of the shoal topography with a focus on the flow structure and turbulence in the lee.  These measurements will address whether lee-wave generation and bottom drag represent major sinks for balanced flows. These measurements will offer a more complete assessment of lee-wave generation and the fate of lee waves than has hitherto been performed.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nWhile wind forcing of the ocean's gyre-scale and mesoscale flows is relatively well-quantified, how this balanced circulation is dissipated is far less understood. Lee-wave generation, bottom drag and boundary forward energy cascades to dissipative scales have been proposed as dominant energy sinks with Ffow/topopraphy interactions thought to be the dominant energy loss mechanism. Toward better understanding of flow/topography interactions, measurements were made in the wake of a seamount in the path of the Kuroshio southeast of Japan. The seamount wake is much more nonlinear than most of the stratified ocean interior with dramatically elevated and modified internal-wave and turbulence fields. The turbulent wake has been shown to extend ~100 km downstream of the seamount. Turbulent dissipation and mixing in this wake are almost 1000 times larger than typical of the open ocean. If similar turbulence levels are found along the Kuroshio path from its encounters with island and seamount chains off Taiwan through Okinawa Trough to Tokara Strait, such flow/topography generated turbulence can account for up to 10% of the required dissipation for the North Pacific subtropical gyre. Three independent finescale parameterizations for turbulence were validated with this data which will allow quantification of turbulent dissipation and mixing along the path of the Kuroshio to determine where and how the wind-driven subtropical North Pacific gyre dissipates and how mixing supplies nutrients to the sunlit upper ocean to feed biological productivity which is key to maintaining western North Pacific fish stocks.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/02/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: EricKunze\n"
