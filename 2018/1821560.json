 "awd_abstract_narration": "The need for professional cybersecurity experts is well established.  To address this need, students must have exposure to the various forms of digital forensics training materials, before being exposed to the complex world of cybercrimes.  Current approaches used to teach digital forensics lack practical considerations.  This project will develop a collaborative learning platform to enhance cybersecurity pedagogy, promote an understanding of how to defend against cyberattacks, and explore effective incident response techniques to address cybersecurity incidents.  Deliverables of the project include instructional modules along with hands-on experiences and tutorial videos on recent digital forensics cases and cyber incidents.  The goal of the project is to increase the number of professional individuals, students, and educators who are interested in cybersecurity knowledge and careers.\r\n\r\nThis project will enhance cybersecurity education by:  1) Creating an online repository of cybersecurity learning resources and open-source tools with a focus on digital forensics and security incidents.  2) Developing a number of instructional modules along with hands-on experiences and training videos for open-source digital forensics tools.  3) Implementing a collaborative educational capture-the-flag tool with the capability of continuous creation and integration of cyber incidents scenarios.  4) Including a set of cyber-attack scenarios based on recent real-world incidents that leverage the use of puzzles in the capture-the-flag tool.  This project will advance cyber security education by directly impacting the way digital forensics is taught by introducing hands-on experiences, course modules, and tutorials for publicly available and open-source security tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The daunting challenge in building such an educational platform was to enable educators adapt educational technology in their own courses with \"minimal to no cost\", since resources at these educational institutes and more importantly community colleges are limited and scarce. The second challenge was the choice of infrastructure with minimal learning curve and avoiding complex settings and technical needs for adapting this educational tool in a course without requiring the instructors/students of such course learn the technical \"installation\" infrastructure. In the end, the research team built a framework based on publicly available cloud-based environment including GitHub and emailing to build such an educational Capture-the-Flag platform for practicing digital forensics challenges. The capture-the-flag tool built was named as \"DigitalFIRE\", Digital Forensics and Incident Response Exercises. The benefits of using free cloud-based platform for deploying DigitalFIRE include (a) making the tool public in its web-formed interactive and ready to use form without any additional settings and expensive infrastructure, (b) enabling easy extensions and updates of the modules, and (c) capturing the answers for each capture-the-flag challenge through emailing and thus avoiding the needs for setting up additional databases for recording students answers to challenges. The tool also enables collaboration through forming red (attackers) and blue (defenders) teams and game settings. Students can also collaborate on different topics related to various topics such as reverse engineering, disk forensics, and malware analysis. The use of DigitalFIRE imposes no financial and technical charges and burden on students and teachers and it is free and extendible.</p>\n<p>II) To accomplish the second, third, fourth, and fifth objectives, the Principal Investigator created (a) several video tutorials on Android forensics, (b) over 15 tutorials on open source digital forensics tools, and (c) over 30 hands-on experiences for malicious files creation (a red team and attack activity) and analysis (a blue team and defense activity). The tutorials range from malware and mobile forensics to disk, memory, and network forensics. These hands-on experiences, tutorials, and videos are hosted online for public use mainly on a course repository, called \"A Course on Digital Forensics\", hosted on PI's GitHub and YouTube channel. Several undergraduate and graduate students (over 80 students) contributed to the creation of these instructional modules through independent studies and also by taking a course on Digital Forensics offered by the Principal Investigator. The course was well received by the students.</p>\n<p>III) To accomplish the sixth, seventh, and eight objectives, the Principal Investigator and an independent evaluator shared the course materials and also the online educational tool DigitalFIRE with over 15 professional college teachers who had interests in developing and teaching digital forensics and malware analysis. Their feedbacks were collected and the materials including the educational platform DigitalFIRE were updated according to the feedbacks. A malware visualization tool was developed and posted online and the manuscript titled \"MalView: Interactive Visual Analytics for Comprehending Malware Behavior\" was published in IEEE ACCESS. Also another article was published by the research team in Elsevier Computers and Education titled: \"Using Experiential Learning to Teach and Learn Digital Forensics: Educator and Student Perspectives.\" The evaluator of the project also conducted several offline surveys and collected useful information with the goal of (a) identifying the challenges professional teachers face when introducing a course in digital forensics, and (b) improving the course materials. The results of the workshop evaluation and survey questions are under submission for publication.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/23/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Akbar&nbsp;Siami Namin</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1821560/1821560_10572504_1671832225837_ScreenShot2022-12-23at3.49.15PM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1821560/1821560_10572504_1671832225837_ScreenShot2022-12-23at3.49.15PM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"MalView\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1821560/1821560_10572504_1671832225837_ScreenShot2022-12-23at3.49.15PM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"MalView\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A tool for analyzing malware based on dynamic analysis</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">100</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Akbar&nbsp;Siami Namin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">MalView</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1821560/1821560_10572504_1671832062682_ScreenShot2022-12-23at3.42.52PM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1821560/1821560_10572504_1671832062682_ScreenShot2022-12-23at3.42.52PM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"DigitalFIRE -
