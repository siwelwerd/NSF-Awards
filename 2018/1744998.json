 "awd_abstract_narration": "In contrast to the Arctic, sea ice cover in most Antarctic regions has increased since 1979. The area-integrated total sea ice extent grew to record maximum values in four of the last six years, yet the 2015-16 summer was marked by record low ice cover. While impressive, it is difficult to assess the significance of these very recent records in the context of longer term variability, since the continuous satellite record only dates back to 1978. The limited length of the continuous sea ice record, is a significant confounding factor in ascertaining whether the observed current changes are due to natural variability alone, or represent a forced anthropogenic response. As a result, the scientific understanding of the Antarctic sea ice trends remains poor, as does confidence in projections of future Antarctic sea ice trends. \r\n\r\nTo address this challenge, this project seeks to reconstruct sea ice extent and sea ice concentration, using the relationships between satellite-observed sea ice, sea level pressure, tropical sea surface temperature, ENSO indices, some proxy data (ice cores, etc.), and in situ Southern Ocean temperature data. The aim of the study is to collect and combine these ancillary records as accurately as possible while retaining the variability associated with the intrinsic uncertainty in the available field data.  \r\nA range of statistical methods for modelling the relationship between satellite era sea-ice data  using flexible regression, Bayesian and  multivariate dynamic spatial temporal (MDST) methods will be used.\r\n\r\nThe study will entrain cross-disciplinary training of undergraduate and a graduate student at UCLA and Ohio University.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nSatellite observations of Antarctic sea ice extent, the area of sea ice surronding Antarctica with at least 15% ice coverage in a 25x25km area, show an interesting aspect of variability and change. Up until around 2016, Antarctic sea ice extent was increasing around Antarctica, opposite to marked decreases occuring in the Arctic. Total Antarctic sea ice then dramaitcally declined after this long-term increase. When this project was funded in 2018, Antarctic sea ice had just reached its first record low in 2017. However, since satellite observations of Antarctic sea ice extent start around 1979, very little is known about the historical significance of these recent changes: have they happened in the past? Has Antarctic sea ice extent been higher before?\n\n\nThe main goals of this project were to provide statistical reconstructions of both Antarctic sea ice extent and concentration through the early 20th century. These reconstructions were based on relationships the sea ice shares with other measures of climate across the Southern Hemisphere, particulalry temperature and pressure. The Ohio University portion of this collaborative award created reconstructions based on linear statistical models.\n\n\nThe main outcomes of this award are 1) new datasets of reconstructed seasonal Antarctic sea ice for the entire Antarctic, as well as for separately for 5 distinct geographical sectors around Antarctica (see primary figure); 2) several publications that analyze and assess these reconstructions, including a paper in Nature Climate Change that first presented the reconstructions; 3) four completed Master's theses and one undergraduate honor's thesis at Ohio University where research on various aspects of this project work were conducted; 4) several scientific presentations at conferences, classrooms, university departments or science cafes, and within the public; and 5) yet unpublished new datasets on monthly Antarctic sea ice extent reconstructions and spatial Antarctic sea ice concentration reconstructions.\n\n\nMost of the new datasets are available on figshare. However, to increase the accessibility and use of these reconstructed data for the larger scientific community, the project has also made the data accessible through the National Snow and Ice Data Center, the world's leading resource for snow and ice data. It is hoped that the scientific community can utilize these reconstructions for their own research, especially since the Antarctic sea ice has displayed anomalous low behavior, far below anything seen in the satellite observations that begin in 1979, during the entire 2023 calendar year.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/11/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RyanLFogt\n"
