 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in a series of summer schools in computational number theory. The upcoming summer school, to be held at the University of North Carolina - Greensboro, summer 2019 we be on the topic of Buildings. The aim of the one-week summer school is to complement the traditional training that graduate students receive by exposing them to a constructive and computational approach to many objects in number theory. This furthers their knowledge and gives the students additional tools for their research. Furthermore, the school provides the students the opportunity to work closely with experts in the field.\r\n\r\nThe Bruhat-Tits building associated to a p-adic reductive group is a simplicial analogue of the classical symmetric space associated to a semi-simple Lie group. The study of these buildings has been an important tool in understanding p-adic groups as well as arithmetic lattices. Buildings have enjoyed playing key roles in several areas, including number theory, geometry, algebra, and combinatorics. The summer school is valuable to students for their careers as researchers and in their post-doctoral lives, since the event helps to create research communities. By meeting and working with other graduate students in their field, the students lay the foundation for future collaboration. In the years after the summer school, they will have opportunities to meet again at one of the regional conferences, including the Palmetto Number Theory Series and the South Eastern Meeting on Numbers. Additionally, by introducing the students to a computational approach to number theory, this project will enhance the next generation of mathematicians by increasing their ability to use computing technology in their research.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see http://www.uncg.edu/math/numbertheory/summerschool/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nThe goals of the project are\n1) to educate graduate students\u2019 in a focused topic of mathematical research\n2) to bring graduate students and the school\u2019s speakers together so that they can make professional contacts with one another\n3) to foster graduate students\u2019 education and skills with small group problem solving sessions mentored by the school\u2019s speakers and other established mathematicians who are also attending the school\n\n\n\n \n\nAll three goals were met during \nSUMMER SCHOOL 2021: APPLICATIONS OF EXPANDER GRAPHS TO NUMBER THEORY AND COMPUTER SCIENCE, MAY 24-28, 2021.\nSpeakers\n\nIrit Dinur, Weizman Institute of Science\nAlex Kontorovich, Rutgers University\nEmmanuel Kowalski, ETH Z&uuml;rich\n\n\nAbstract:\n\nFrom May 24 to 28, 2021, the University of North Carolina Greensboro will host the UNCG Summer School in Computational Number Theory and Algebra: Applications of Expander Graphs to Number Theory and Computer Science.\n\nExpanders are graphs satisfying very strong connectivity properties. There are precise definitions, but, roughly speaking, every \"small\" set of vertices in an expander has \"many\" neighbors outside that set.  We will introduce expanders and then explore the many connections they have to topics in number theory and computer science.\n\nThe school will run in morning and afternoon zoom sessions for the five days between May 24 and May 28, 2021.  In each session, one of our well-known speakers will give a lecture.  Then everyone will break into small zoom groups to work on problem sets together with mentors.  All problems are aimed at increasing the students\u2019 understanding of the material by working with it.  At the end of each session, the whole school will reconvene to talk over the results and for further insight.    The talks early in the week will introduce the students to the subject and those later in the week cover related areas of current research and unsolved problems.\n\nThis school is targeted primarily to early stage graduate students in mathematics with an interest in number theory.\n\n \n\n40 students attended virutally and a permanent conference site with papers and talk videos was created: https://mathstats.uncg.edu/number-theory/summer_school/summer-school-2021-applications-of-expander-graphs-to-number-theory/\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/13/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brett Tangedal"
