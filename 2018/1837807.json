The travel support is aimed at attendees of the Doctoral Symposium and first-time attendees, who will participate in a mentorship program provided by the organizers. The grant enables  participants to engage in technical exchange of information and research conversations/collaborations leading to advances the field.  Participation is an important education, training and mentoring experience. The international nature of this conference helps develop a globally-aware workforce of research and educators within the US and helps build the community of researchers in the field of Software Engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
