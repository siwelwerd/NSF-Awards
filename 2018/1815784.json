 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will simulate the effect of magnetic fields on the stars forming in interstellar clouds. These clouds are the birthplace of stars. The investigators will compare their theoretical results with recent observations, with the aim of understanding the importance of magnetic fields in controlling the birth of stars.  Their results will also help us understand origin of our solar system. The team plans a range of educational and outreach activities. For example, they plan to animate movies of their star formation models, for use in public talks and astronomy classes. This program will also support and train women scientists during the early phase of their careers.\r\n\r\nThe investigators will carry out a series of three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic simulations to follow the evolution of the magnetic field structure on a range of scales, from the interstellar clouds to proto-stellar systems. They will make theoretical predictions of the dust polarization based on the simulations.  They will compare their predictions to observational data from the several experiments, including the Balloon-borne Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope for Polarimetry (BLASTPol), and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and future data from NSF-funded TolTEC instrument on the 50-meter Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT). The goal is to determine the strength of the magnetic field in the interstellar clouds and its role in the formation of stars. A salient feature of the proposed program is the close collaboration between theorists who perform cutting-edge computer simulations and observers who are leading the effort to produce the most detailed polarization maps of star-forming clouds using BLASTPol and TolTEC on LMT. Through the most comprehensive comparison between theory and observation, the team will test their models for the role of magnetic fields in star formation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
