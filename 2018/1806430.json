 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has and why there is no antimatter in the universe. An important area to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be, and why it is the way it is, is to study rare decays of kaons, as a probe of science Beyond the Standard Model (BSM).  Kaons are the lightest particles containing a strange quark. The kaon physics program at the CERN Laboratory, Geneva, Switzerland includes measurements of the ultra-rare decays of kaons, including precision investigations of the weak interaction, and searches for violations of and for signatures of physics beyond the Standard Model.  This project will focus on the study of ultra-rare decays.\r\n\r\nThe George Mason University group is a key participant and the sole U.S. group in the CERN NA62 experiment, whose primary objective is to measure the rate of an ultra-rare decay of charged kaons, through the flavor-changing neutral current to a charged pion and a pair of neutrinos.  The rate of this transition is predicted in the Standard Model, while alternative models predict very different rates.  Hence this challenging measurement has the potential to provide important evidence for new physics beyond the Standard Model.    George Mason has been fully engaged in the experimental design, construction, operations and analysis of data from this experiment. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the George Mason program are extensive, providing extensive summer research experiences for undergraduate students through the CERN Summer Research Programme, and in providing leadership and mentoring for the Virginia QuarkNet Center, which attracts high school teachers and students to the excitement of particle physics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNSF award 1806430 - Experiments with Kaons at CERN was a three-year grant extended to five years due to the preclusion of the principal investigator (PI) and his students from coming to CERN during the COVID-19 Summers of 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe award supported the PI and students' participation in CERN experiment NA62, which studies with very high precision, the behavior of a particle called a Kaon, the lightest object in nature containing a strange quark, the next heaviest quark to the up and down quarks that comprise most of ordinary matter, such as protons and neutrons.  Because of its strange-quark content, Kaons transform to ordinary matter due to the weak interaction, the process responsible for radioactive decay, and the various ways this transformation can occur offer a view of how the early universe likely evolved into its present state.  Such investigations of Kaons can help to understand the fact that there is so little antimatter relative to ordinary matter in the universe; to discover candidates for dark matter--thought to comprise up to 85% of matter in the universe, but thus far unidentified; and to better understand the mechanisms resulting in particle transitions, perhaps in a way that supersedes the Standard Model, particle physics' description of Nature's fundamental particles and processes.\n\nDuring the five-year period under this award, NA62 published eighteen articles in peer-reviewed journals and made more than 100 presentations at international conferences.  Among the experiment's most important findings was the verification of a Kaon transformation hypothesized by the Standard Model to occur only once in 10 billion Kaon transformations.  It also set new limits on dark matter candidates.  During the period, designs were made for future experiments with Kaons, and a proposal, with the PI as a co-signatory, was submitted to CERN's review committee for consideration.\n\nThe award supported 10 students who had the opportunity to contribute to the experiment during 8 weeks in the Summer.  The award also made possible an associated (International Research Experience for Students) award that offered around 20 additional students CERN-related research experience.  The award also enabled the PI to be involved in QuarkNet, a national teacher development program, involving high school teachers and students.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/23/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Philip D Rubin"
