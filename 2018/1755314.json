 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three types of muscle cells (smooth and the cross-striated cardiac and skeletal muscles) are well known from any introductory text, yet few biologists are familiar with obliquely striated muscles.  Obliquely striated muscle cells are common in soft-bodied animals, occurring in members of at least 17 phyla, yet the implications of oblique striation for the function and performance of this important muscle type are unknown.  It has been assumed for decades that oblique striation permits relatively high force output over an extraordinary range of muscle lengths.  Recent work, however, suggests that the contractile properties and operating length ranges of obliquely striated muscles are very diverse, even among muscles within the same individual animal.  The project will investigate the contractile properties and operating length ranges of obliquely striated muscles from diverse animals.  This research is likely to reveal fundamental new principles of the structure and function of muscle that would otherwise remain obscure, and provide new insight into the diversity of function and the evolution of this fiber type.  The project will provide opportunities for undergraduates, especially first-generation college students and those from underrepresented backgrounds, to gain experience in physiology, biomechanics, and science communication.  In partnership with the Maine State Aquarium Discovery Center, the project will develop programs for K-12 students and the general public.  The project will also impact secondary education through collaboration with the UNC Baccalaureate Education in Science and Teaching (UNC-BEST) program, which offers undergraduate Biology majors opportunities to obtain licensure as a secondary school teacher in North Carolina.\r\n\r\nAlthough obliquely striated muscle occurs in at least 17 animal phyla, the functional implications of this striation pattern remain unclear.  Early studies suggested that oblique striation allows high force output over a much wider range of muscle lengths than possible in cross-striated muscle.  Recent work, however, shows that many obliquely striated muscles are incapable of such wide operating ranges and instead, there is considerable variation in this parameter.  The current understanding thus fails as a general explanation for the functional significance of oblique striation.  The goal of the investigation is to test a new model, based on mathematical analysis of the geometry of the myofilament array, which suggests that oblique striation evolved to allow adjustment of the length-force relationship in animals with hydrostatic skeletons.  The model predicts that the length-force relationship can be adjusted by altering the stagger angle (i.e., the degree of stagger of the myofilaments), with greater stagger resulting in a wider operating range.  Measurements of length-force properties, in vivo muscle activation and length changes, and muscle fiber ultrastructure will be used to test the model predictions and assess the functional significance of oblique striation.  The initial investigation will focus on the myofilament stagger and the length-force relationship of muscles in the squid Doryteuthis pealeii that vary widely in function and operating length range.  In addition, muscles with similar roles and length-force relationships among select taxa that span the range of Bilaterian diversity will be studied, thus identifying structural and functional convergence in obliquely striated muscles.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nOur understanding of muscle structure and function is dominated by research on the cross-striated skeletal muscle of animals, such as vertebrates (e.g., fish, reptiles, mammals) and arthropods (e.g., insects and crabs), that possess rigid, jointed skeletal support systems. Relatively little is known, however, about obliquely striated muscle, which is ubiquitous in soft-bodied invertebrate animals (e.g., squid, octopus, worms), occurring in members of at least eighteen different phyla. The jointed skeletal support systems of vertebrates and arthropods allow for the evolution of a diverse array of movements by altering the location of muscle attachment points (and thus the length of the input arm of the lever system) relative to a given joint. This mechanism of altering movements is essential because cross-striated muscles have limited lengthforce relationships (i.e., they can produce force over only a relatively narrow range of muscle lengths). Such adjustments are not possible in soft-bodied animals because they lack jointed lever systems. Instead, the muscle contractile properties must be altered during evolution to accommodate the range of length changes that occur during movement, as this range is determined by the shape and relative dimensions of the animal and the orientation of the muscle fibers in question. In other words, if a soft-bodied animal experiences large length changes, their muscle fibers must undergo identical changes in length.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nWe hypothesize that obliquely striated muscle evolved in soft-bodied invertebrates to accommodate extensive variation in the magnitude of elongation and shortening that their muscles experience. We focused our research on obliquely striated muscles from the Longfin Inshore SquidDoryteuthis pealeii, since the various muscle groups in this animal experience a wide range of elongation and shortening, including those that operate essentially isometrically (producing force without changing length) to those that undergo more than a doubling in length (termed superelongation). We measured the contractile properties of five different obliquely striated muscle groups in squid and showed that their contractile properties varied, in particular with respect to their length vs force properties. We used transmission electron microscopy to test the predictions of a previously developed mathematical model that the length vs force properties may be adjusted through a simple change in the geometry of the myofilaments (the striation angle) that compose the muscles. The results were consistent with the predictions of the model, suggesting that oblique striation evolved to allow adjustment of the operating length range of the muscle fibers. Although previous research had suggested that oblique striation evolved to produce superelongation, we found only one example of a muscle inDoryteuthisthat has this characteristic. Based on the muscle fibers sampled and a review of previous research on obliquely striated muscle from other invertebrates, it appears that superelongation may instead represent a specialized form of obliquely striated fibers and therefore a secondary adaptation. Our work has thus provided important new insights into the structure, function and evolution of striated muscle, insights that alter our understanding of muscle as a tissue.\r\n\n\nIn addition to revealing fundamental aspects of the structure and function of striated muscle, the project provided scientific training for 15 undergraduate students and 1 postdoctoral scholar, including 12 women, 5 first-generation students, and 5 from groups underrepresented in the sciences.
