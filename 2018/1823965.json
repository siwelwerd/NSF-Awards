 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine the multifaceted ways in which African American ethnic identity and racial identity (ERI) - the personal significance and meaning of race and ethnicity to an individual - shapes the association between racial discrimination experiences and biopsychosocial development during the transition to adulthood. Specific aims of the study are to investigate whether ERI mitigates or worsens the association between racial discrimination and development as well as identify mechanisms by which ERI influences development during the transition to adulthood. This project will improve understanding of how ERI operates and the role social context plays in the associations between racial discrimination and development. The project will also address theoretical debates about the presumed positive impact of ERI.  Developmental outcomes during the transition to adulthood will be assessed using questionnaires and physiological stress reactivity tests. Broader impacts are significant, because findings can be used to improve the social and psychological well-being of vulnerable youth. Moreover, findings can potentially support and further evidence-based prevention-intervention efforts aimed at fostering positive youth development.\r\n\r\nRacial discrimination constitutes a significant risk to the healthy development of African American youth during the transition to adulthood. Some evidence suggests that ERI protects against the harmful effects of racial discrimination, but there have been few systematic attempts to disentangle mixed findings. Participants will be African American young adults attending a southeastern, predominantly White institution and a mid-Atlantic historically Black college/university. Students will complete a series of questionnaires assessing key study variables followed by two laboratory challenges, once a year, for three consecutive years. Autonomic reactivity (as indexed by cardiovascular psychophysiology) will be assessed during the laboratory challenges. The central questions of the study are whether the protective or vulnerability function of ERI is influenced by the social context in which the youth are embedded and whether the impact of ERI on biopsychosocial development can be explained by coping skills, self-esteem, and perceptions of racial discrimination. Key hypotheses are: 1) ERI will act as a vulnerability factor in the link between racial discrimination and development in contexts with lower levels of diversity; 2) Initial levels of racial discrimination will lead to changes in ERI, which, in turn, will be associated with changes in development; and 3) Racism appraisals and coping will explain the association between ERI and changes in development during the transition to adulthood. Hypotheses will be tested using latent growth curve modeling. These results will be used to inform recommendations for the development of a contextually-tailored pilot ERI intervention.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Students (N = 275) reported in person to the survey phase of the study in groups of ten or fewer.  They completed measures of stress and wellbeing, encounters with racism, and Black identity.  As anticipated, experiencing racism was associated with a reductions in the sense of wellbeing and increases in stress levels.  However, racial identity modified these relationships.  The impact of racist events was mitigated by public regard identity&mdash;recognizing that negative views of African American still exist in society at large, and by strong beliefs in Black culture and competence (Black Nationalism).  In another examination of the data we found that reports of less than traumatic and well-managed racist events, enhanced the sense of general wellbeing.\n\nThe second group of studies focused on arterial blood pressure as an objective index of wellbeing.  We recorded five blood pressure readings of 150 participants who came to the individually about one week after completing the surveys.  We obtained electrocardiograph (EKG) and impedance cardiograph readings.  The cardiac measures provided a detailed picture of the nervous system\u2019s control over heart functions.  They were taken continuously as participants rested, performed reaction time tasks, and imagined racist and neutral social events. We measured blood pressure at rest and immediately following these tasks. \n\nHeart rate responses to the reaction time tasks were related to both blood pressure levels and to fluctuations in blood pressure across the five readings.

People with more dominant parasympathetic cardiac input reported managing stress better.  The scores based on items that reported frequent unmanageable stress were associated with faster resting heart rate. \n\nPhysiological indices of wellbeing and cardiac functioning may show stronger correlations as investigators take measures that are more nuanced and precise in both domains.  Continued refinement of measures of subjective and objective measures of stress will provide a more wholistic view of wellbeing and adjustment. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/12/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jules P Harrell"
