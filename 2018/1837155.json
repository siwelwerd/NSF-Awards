A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference.  This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference.   The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.   More information will be made available at: http://mwaa.math.iupui.edu/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes Report (for the MWAA at IU-Bloomington in 2018)\n\nOur goals for the Midwestern Workshop on Asymptotic Analysis (MWAA) in 2018  were to foster cooperation among mathematicians in certain areas of analysis represented in the midwest, and to expose attending graduate students to different areas of analysis.  There were eleven talks at the October 2018 conference in Bloomington, IN, given by researchers in approximation theory, mathematical physics, harmonic analysis, potential theory, and several complex variables.  Four of the speakers were recent PhDs; one was a PhD student; and four were women.  In addition, there was a student research poster display.  There were over 40  participants altogether, including 15-20 graduate students from mostly midwestern universities.\n\nWe cite specific examples of the success of the workshop: a collaboration between a PhD student from UIUC and a faculty member at PFW was started, resulting in two papers; and a collaboration between one of the speakers (the PhD student) and one of the organizers began.  This latter collaboration continued at an AIM Workshop this past summer.\n\nThe MWAA series was previously at Indiana University in Bloomington in 2015, at PFW in 2016, and at the IUPUI campus in 2017.  Abstracts and slides from the talks and posters from students are available through the Workshop web site, http://mwaa.math.iupui.edu/\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/01/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Norman Levenberg"
