It should foster collaboration across disciplines, and between theoreticians and practitioners working in academic or industrial settings. This workshop could have a transformative impact on society by getting closer to achieving Internet freedom in countries where accessing and sharing of information are strictly controlled by censorship.\r\n\r\nThe topics of interest in this workshop include censorship detection, censorship circumvention\r\ntechniques, linguistically inspired countermeasures for Internet censorship, and techniques to\r\nempirically measure Internet censorship across communication platforms. The workshop includes researchers working in the field of NLP, computer science and social sciences. Graduate students, faculty, and researchers from industry will participate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
