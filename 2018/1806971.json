 "awd_abstract_narration": "Placing ordinary matter in extraordinary circumstances can create fascinating new phenomena and applications in physics.  For example, it was realized some time ago that certain gases could be reduced to temperatures just a tiny bit above absolute zero, but without condensing into liquid drops.  This new discipline of \"ultracold\" gases has led to a wealth of new understanding of quantum mechanical behavior of collections of simple atoms.  Now, a new set of experiments seeks to enrich this discipline by introducing atoms and molecules with internal complexity.  Doing so will lead to unprecedented detail in understanding and controlling chemical reactions, with applications yet to be dreamed of.  Amazingly, it will in certain cases also allow for a deeper understanding of the fundamental rules of the universe than even the largest particle accelerator can provide.  To carry out such experiments, it is necessary to thoroughly understand the dynamics of a complex, ultracold gas.  This work will explore the role of complexity in the gas, considering phenomena such as basic thermodynamics, in which the propagation of heat or of sound can be different in different directions, or may depend on (and thus reveal) chemical reactivity.  It will also consider the possibility, conjectured but not yet demonstrated, that molecules in the gas can stick to each other for brief amounts of time.  Properties of this self-adhesive gas must be thoroughly understood before ultracold gases can be harnessed for applications.\r\n\r\n\tTo do so, the work will investigate in detail the role of quantum chaos in the two-body collision dynamics.  Chaos has already been demonstrated, or at least suspected, in ultracold collisions of lanthanide dimer atoms as well as alkali dimer molecules.  The first steps have been taken, but a complete analysis, including the statistical distributions of energy levels and resonance widths, as well as the influence of magnetic fields, must still be undertaken.  This analysis will be carried out using models of various degrees of complexity, to reveal the essential physics of the phenomena.  Moreover, while the differential scattering cross sections of dipolar atoms and molecules are known, their complete influence on the thermodynamics of the gas remains largely unexplored.  Dynamics of an ultracold dipolar gas will be undertaken, using Monte Carlo calculations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIt is a fundamental notion that simple things can combine into more complex things, and this complexity underlies the rich variety of phenomena that we see in nature.  It is therefore important to the progress of science to understand this richness and complexity in as many environments as possible; from many examples will come general ideas about the intricacies of how the world works.\n\nIn this project, we recognize that things as seemingly simple as atoms and small molecules can present surprisingly complex behavior.  In the unusual (but achievable in the lab) environment of a gas at one millionth of a degree above absolute zero, molecules do not simply bounce off one another, but can become intertwined, as they find many ways to re-arrange their atoms that do not result in fragmentation back into the original molecules.  These elaborate machinations allow us to investigate the complexity of chaotic dynamics on one of the tiniest scales it has been seen.  Even more interestingly, for certain atoms at the same incredibly small temperatures, the motion of the atoms is sometimes chaotic, sometimes not.  This allows us to gain insights into how, when, and why complicated motion becomes chaotic, or put another way, how to identify order among the chaos.  Our work is therefore an exercise in understanding the capabilities and limits of engineering atoms to particular purposes, such as quantum computation or quantum simulation of condensed matter systems.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/01/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John L Bohn"
