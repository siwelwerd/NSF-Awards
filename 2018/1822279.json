 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the first annual Symposium on Machine Learning in Science and Engineering (MLSE), held in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, June 6-8, 2018.  The meeting, initially organized by Carnegie Mellon University and Georgia Tech, is the first comprehensive and open annual conference bringing together leading researchers in science and engineering whose work benefits from advances in machine learning and data science.  While machine learning has revolutionized many areas of biological and biomedical research, its impact across the sciences and engineering is at an early stage. This symposium will bring together researchers in a diversity of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) areas focused on applying machine learning to problems of fundamental or applied nature. Presentations will focus on adapting existing machine learning methods to current research areas, developing new machine learning algorithms specific to science and engineering, and identifying new frontiers of research that may only be pursued using a data-driven approach. The symposium will offer attendees focused short courses taught by experts in machine learning on a variety of cutting-edge tools that are critical in advancing these fields. The MLSE symposium will help catalyze machine learning methodologies and collaborations across the sciences and engineering, bringing together researchers in a diversity of STEM areas focused on applying machine learning to fundamental and applied problems. Presentations will focus on adapting existing machine learning methods to current research areas, developing new machine learning algorithms specific to science and engineering, and identifying new frontiers of research that may only be pursued using a data-driven approach.\r\n\r\nThe symposium is anticipated to reach, in its first year, at least 400 direct participants and attendees, including under-represented minorities, those attending Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), and low income students local to the conference venues, or selected to travel to the event based on merit and need. Several groups within the research community are involved, including a diverse group of students, early career researchers and faculty. Information will be widely disseminated on a continuing basis through news items published via community-specific and broad news release venues. Partial support is being provided primarily to enable participation by students and young researchers, in addition to a limited number of tutorial and plenary speakers.  The organizers are committed to promoting participation among underrepresented groups, junior researchers and students, and including tutorials to widen accessibility to as large a group of attendees, as possible. The organizers will have an open competition for these travel awards, selected by a diverse committee, and the opportunity to apply will be widely disseminated across the relevant disciplines.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The conference provides training at all levels, allowing an opportunity for each discipline to identify central challenges in how machine learning enables broad advances in each discipline as well as the opportunity for cross-disciplinary collaboration.\n\nThe conference was held at CMU in June 2018.  With funds from this grant, we were able to fund student participation and offset some of the invited speaker costs.  The conference had more than 400 attendees and set the stage for future annual meetings, including MLSE 2019, held at Georgia Tech, and MLSE 2020, to be held at Columbia University.\n\nThe novelty of the conference is that participants attended talks in 9 parallel sessions representing the applications disciplines in science and engineering.  This allowed more focused discussions and dissemination of results within traditional fields, as well as a platform for computer scientists and statisticians to learn about the difficulties arising in various fields of science and engineering using techniques from Machine Learning.  Over two-thirds of the participants who responded to a questionnaire about their experience indicated that they attended multiple tracks, so the participants were not siloed.\n\nIn addition, there were 5 plenary talks by leaders in academia and industry, two short courses, and a tutorial on Bayesian statistics given at the beginning.  Poster sessions by students and tables of corporate sponsors helped further facilitates dissemination of results and networking opportunities.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/10/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dana J Randall"
