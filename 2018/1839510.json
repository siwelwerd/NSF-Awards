 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is inspired by the blue whirl, a small, spinning blue flame that was first observed when it evolved naturally from a fire burning a liquid fuel puddle poured onto the top of a flat pan filled with water. Once the blue whirl forms, it remains in the steady, stable, completely blue state, in which no soot is formed. Once it forms, all of the turbulence in the original fire disappeared and the spinning top burned silently until there was no fuel remaining on the water. Since its discovery, there has been considerable theoretical conjecture about what this flame actually is, how it evolves, and how, if at all, it could be useful. Experiments have provided many clues. For example, almost any liquid hydrocarbon including crude oil, can create the blue whirl, it can be made on a smooth metal pan with no water, and the temperature in the purple haze at the top of the flame is very hot at 2000K. What is needed, however, is an understanding of the fluid dynamics and chemistry leading to and controlling the blue whirl. What is needed to further this understanding is a simulation that will show how the flame evolves and provide some guidance to experiments and theoretical analyses. This blue flame could potentially inspire an ideal burner that consumes any liquid fuel with no soot and minimal pollution.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this proposal is to create a numerical model capable of simulating the blue whirl, from its inception as a small fire, through to the evolution into a fire whirl, then through the complex transition to the blue whirl. This is a complex physical and chemical problem involving evaporation of liquid fuel, formation of a fire whirl, and then the dynamic vortex breakdown of the fire whirl that leads to the blue whirl. The most stringent requirement of this model is that it must be optimized so that it can perform enough simulations to explore the physicochemical parameter space of the liquid-burning fire whirl and blue whirl. To accomplish this, it will be necessary to have a model that solves the governing reactive-flow conservation equations and adequately resolves the fluid dynamics, chemical reactions and energy release, heat and mass diffusion, and perhaps the multiphase problem of hydrocarbon liquid evaporation. The numerical model must be capable of simulating hydrocarbon flames through a range of stoichiometric from lean to rich. To accomplish this objective, a three-dimensional unsteady fluid model that allows transitions from flow regimes of incompressible to fully compressible flows, based on the barely implicit correct to flux-corrected transport, will be developed and tested. In addition, a chemical-diffusive model will be developed for liquid fuels and tested for diffusion flames. Intermediate steps in the project include simulations of fire whirls for benchmarks and three-dimensional vortex breakdown in compressible gases.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The blue whirl - a stable, spinning blue flame - is a recently discovered state of combustion that has an unexploited potential for clean, efficient combustion of liquid heavy hydrocarbon fuels, such as heptane, iso-octane, gasoline, and even crude oil. Since its discovery in 2016, the blue whirl has garnered significant interest from both academics and the media. Despite the interest, its fundamental structure and formation mechanism has remained unknown due to limitations in experimental diagnostics and simulation capabilities. The research in this project uses high-performance computing to simulate blue whirl from first principles, and then used the results to explain structure and dynamics of the blue whirl. Understanding the structure is the first step to controlling and using it for new ways for fuel-spill remediation, reduced-pollution combustion, and fluid mechanics research.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The blue whirl was discovered serendipitously while investigating the combustion and burning dynamics of fire whirls on water. A fire whirl, composed of flames and a strong spinning vortex, often occurs in fires in wildlands, urban environments, and natural disasters. When fire whirls form in the wild, they can be uncontrollable and threaten life, property and the surrounding environment due to their large flame structures, intense burning rates, and fast moving speeds. While researchers often focus on stopping or preventing fire whirls, a research group from the University of Maryland wanted to harness the power of fire whirls for a practical use. Fire whirls on top of water were studied to evaluate their potential for cleaning oil spills. During the experiments, a small, quiet, and stable blue spinning flame formed spontaneously from a large fire whirl. This blue spinning flame burns cleanly and efficiently until all of the fuel is consumed, forming no soot at all. The blue whirl consists of a blue spinning flame at the base, a bright-blue ring at the center, and a faint conical violet flame sitting above (Fig. A). This form of combustion was not reported previously.
