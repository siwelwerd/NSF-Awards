 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will promote the progress of science and contribute to the national prosperity and welfare by advancing analytical decision tools tackling the operational challenges of refugee resettlement in the United States. The goal of resettlement is to progressively integrate refugees into host societies, while balancing limitations of communities with the needs of refugees. This research will augment current manual refugee resettlement decision-making by using analytical methods that include machine learning and mathematical optimization. These technologies will improve humanitarian decision-making and have the potential to transform how domestic and worldwide resettlement decisions are made. Host communities will benefit by integrating refugees that bring new skills, youth and diversity to the matched communities. An established collaboration with a US-based refugee organization will guide the research and enable validation of the developed models in a real-world setting.\r\n\r\nThis project will make two main methodological contributions. First, it will explore the algebraic and geometric properties of integral monoids to better understand and capitalize on their structure. It is believed that integral monoids can excel in contexts with flexible capacity and multiple objectives. This research will develop appropriate algorithms and data structures to efficiently and judiciously encode and retrieve monoid information, and will include algorithmic analyses to ensure the computational tractability. If successful, this research will contribute to new advances in optimization methodology, specifically the algorithmic use of integral monoids to solve other hard linear and nonlinear matching, knapsack, generalized assignment, and packing problems. Second, this research will construct novel objective functions by leveraging supervised machine learning techniques on existing refugee placement and integration (outcome) data. These new objective functions will guide the search toward more successful resettlement outcomes. The predictive modeling will also reveal previously undiscovered insights into how demographic and regional factors contribute to refugee integration.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In the United States, this process is typically carried out by nine resettlement agencies that partner with federal agencies and work with refugees to secure housing, employment, healthcare, and education. This process has traditionally been done manually by expert resettlement staff with in-depth knowledge of the communities in which they work, yet limited knowledge of the individual refugees arriving at any given time.</p>\n<p>To partially automate this process and better match refugees to communities, we developed advanced analytical methods using machine learning and optimization. Our goal was to empower resettlement staff with recommendations for refugee-community matches that would improve the chances of successful resettlement outcomes. To do this, we used predictive models to estimate the likelihood of employment for incoming refugees across different communities in the United States. These likelihood estimates were then used in constrained optimization problems to match refugees to communities in a way that maximizes the total expected employment. The constrained optimization problems we formulated were multiple multidimensional knapsack problems, ensuring that community capabilities and capacities for refugees were respected.</p>\n<p>While knapsack problems are computationally challenging, we were able to develop solvable prescriptive optimization models that were embedded in decision support software. This software was deployed and is currently in active use at a major US resettlement agency. It provides complete autonomy to the decision-making process, by recommending refugee-community matches and yet allowing interactivity to refine placement recommendations through expert judgement, and subsequently re-optimize to converge upon a final match outcome. Our computational studies estimate that our approach resulted in gains of nearly 30% over the manual placement process.</p>\n<p>In addition to automating the refugee matching process, we also extended our software to incorporate dynamic capacity management. This is important because while resettlement agencies place refugees into communities on a roughly weekly basis, community capacity is set annually by the Federal government. By simulating future arrivals throughout the rest of the year, we were able to estimate the marginal value of an additional slot of capacity and adjust the value obtained for placing a refugee into a community in the current placement period. This allowed us to effectively manage community capacity that is particularly valuable, such as those where employment tends to be more likely, throughout the year. Our methods were able to obtain over 98% of the hindsight optimal total employment. The figure below depicts a view of the developed interactive optimization software.</p>\n<p>We also explored new approaches for solving integer programs using level set approaches based on integral monoids. These approaches are useful for integer optimization problems where right-hand sides, such as capacity, are uncertain. In such cases, it can be helpful to consider the integer programming value function, which is defined as the optimal objective function of an integer optimization problem parameterized by its right-hand side. For problems like the multiple multidimensional knapsack problems we considered, the structure formed by the constraints can be leveraged to store solution information, which enables us to solve the problems more efficiently. The figure below depicts the integer programming value function for an integer program with two constraints, as the value of the right-hand side in each dimension is incremented.
