Through this one-year project, Fort Valley State University seeks to redesign/upgrade its curricula to integrate biotechnology, genomics and cyber-infrastructure [Anywhere, Anytime Learning]. The proposed project will invigorate existing courses by integrating biotechnology applications into the curriculum and pedagogical practices. Cyberinfrastructure and learning will also be infused in laboratory activities, in which bioinformatics tools are used.\r\n\r\nThe project goal is to redesign and integrate biotechnology and cyberinfrastructure components into core courses, specifically Biotechniques, Cell & Molecular Biology and Genetics. This will provide students with an in-depth understanding of the cycle of scientific problem solving, the nature of iterative experimental design and the role of an adaptive approach that will uniquely prepare them for graduate study or the biotechnology workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
