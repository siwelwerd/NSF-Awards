 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses a high priority need for water research communities: interoperability among a wide variety of data sources and models, and integration of different computational models into water research communities.  The project will develop an open and sustainable software framework enabling integration of hydrologic data and models for interdisciplinary teamwork and discovery.   The models and datasets cover fields such as hydrology, biology, environmental engineering and climate.  The project also addresses one of the key issues for extreme-scale computing:  scalable file systems.  The collaboration draws upon computing, modeling, and hydrology expertise at six institutions: University of Pittsburgh, University of Iowa, Ball State University, North Carolina State University, Indiana University, and the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI).  \r\n\r\nThe project develops CyberWater, a community-driven software framework that integrates a wide range of models and datasets across disparate temporal and spatial scales. The CyberWater framework allows scientists to bypass challenges associated with model and dataset complexity.  The project designs a model agent tool enabling users to generate model agents for common model types without coding, and integrates multiple existing software codes/elements that provide for broad-scale use.  To develop such a diverse modeling framework, the project brings together hydrologists, climate experts, meteorologists, computer scientists and cyberinfrastructure experts.  The project builds upon an existing prototype developed by the lead investigator;  basic elements for the system were developed, consisting of plugged-in models and data sources with corresponding agents and a workflow engine allowing user workflow control.  The prototype was successfully demonstrated for two models, making use of datasets plugged in from NASA, USGS and CUAHSI.  For the current project, new models and datasets are added to the framework; the ability to use high performance computing resources is also incorporated.  The team will use the CUAHSI HydroShare System to distribute CyberWater software and its associate model agents, including instructions on how to establish a local CyberWater environment, models and model agents. The project will enable substantial scientific advances for water related issues, and the solution can be applied to other research disciplines. \r\n\r\nThis award by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the NSF Directorate for Geosciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Scientists often have to integrate different computational models to obtain a broader and deeper view of a water system under investigation. As water science straddles many diverse scientific disciplines, gathering and representing heterogeneous data in a standardized way for analysis and modelling can be challenging. This is further complicated by the fact that often, various data providers offer their data products in different formats, structures and organizations (e.g., ASCII, Binary, Geotiff, GRIB/GRIB2, HDF5, HGT, NetCDF and XML), as well as data access protocols (e.g., FTP, HTTP/HTTPS and OPeNDAP). On top of this, different models are usually developed by individual and independent research groups in their own domains rather than being standardized across an area of scientific study. This makes it very difficult for scientists wanting to make use of these data with their own models or their data with other models. As Water science suffers from this abundance of incompatible data and models, it is not surprising that when research groups attempt to combine models written by different groups, they have to write some kind of &lsquo;glue&rsquo; code to integrate the models together. This process is difficult and time-consuming, with each pair of models having to have separate glue code written for them. This is bad enough when using two models but quickly becomes a huge task when researchers are trying to get multiple models to work in sync with each other.</p>\r\n<p><strong>CyberWater Project Outcomes:</strong></p>\r\n<p>To address such challenges, the CyberWater project is to build an open-data open-model framework for easy and incremental integration of heterogeneous data sources and diverse scientific models across disciplines in the broad water domain. The CyberWater framework builds upon our open-data open-model framework core called Meta-Scientific-Modeling (MSM) that enables automatic data access from various and heterogeneous data sources over the Internet, and provides a system-wide data and model integration platform. On top of MSM, the CyberWater framework provides a set of toolkits, and external system integration engines, to further facilitate users&rsquo; scientific modeling and collaboration across disciplines. For example, the developed generic model agent toolkit enables users to integrate users&rsquo; computational models into CyberWater via graphical user interface configuration without coding, which further simplifies the data and model integration and model coupling. CyberWater adopts a graphical scientific workflow system, VisTrails, ensuring data provenance and reproducible computing. In particular, CyberWater supports novel access to high-performance computing (HPC) resources on demand for users&rsquo; computational expensive model tasks, establishing a novel computing ecosystem with a desktop orientation.
