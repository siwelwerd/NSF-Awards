 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many Arab countries are making significant investments in science and technology and have unique facilities and resources. However, there are few mechanisms for U.S. researchers to learn about research efforts in this region. This meeting provides an exceptional opportunity for U.S. scientists to interact with promising young researchers in the Middle East to develop new ideas and approaches to apply to ongoing research and discover opportunities for collaboration. \r\n\r\nThis project will help support the sixth conference of the Arab-American Frontiers program series, to be held in Kuwait City, Kuwait in fall 2018. The event will provide an opportunity for approximately 35 early-career US scientists to attend a three-day conference of approximately 100 total attendees that seeks to: enhance scientific dialogue and exchange between young US and Arab researchers; encourage the transfer of techniques and approaches across disciplines, strengthen science and engineering collaboration within and beyond the US and the Middle East/North Africa region, and also empower young scientists, engineers and medical professionals to assume leadership roles in their fields and beyond. Participants are selected through a competitive application process, ensuring a meeting of research-active scientists and engineers who are ready to capitalize on the ideas and relationships developed at the conference. The event is co-organized by the Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Science and NSF funds leverage their significant support.  \r\n\r\nThe conference purposely focuses on several topics that are not directly related to encourage the participants to make connections beyond their field of study and to facilitate interdisciplinary dialogue that may offer new, unexpected insights. Participants at previous workshops have highlighted this broad interdisciplinarity as an intellectual highlight of the meeting. The focus areas for this meeting were developed by the volunteer organizing committee and represent globally important topics in which the Middle East has valuable expertise and is investing important resources. All five topics represent research challenges that require the insights of multiple disciplines.\r\n- Big Data \"Data by and for the people\"\r\n- Water Systems \"Innovation for the safe, reliable and efficient provision of water\"\r\n- The Microbiome\r\n- Air Quality\r\n- Next Generation Buildings and Infrastructure\r\n\r\nFurther development of ideas for cooperative work that develop at the conference will be facilitated by small collaboration grants for which participants may apply after the meeting.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The sixth symposium was held in Kuwait in 2018 in partnership with the Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Sciences (KFAS). The program has enhanced scientific dialogue and exchange among young researchers in Arab countries and the United States; strengthened scientific collaboration and the transfer of techniques and approaches across disciplines within and beyond the region; and empowered young researchers to assume leadership roles.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong>The sixth Arab-merican Frontiers symposium was an unprecedented opportunity for U.S. and Arab scientists to share state of the art knowledge under the topics of big data, water systems, the microbiome, air quality and next generation buildings and infrastructure, and explore how these findings apply to the regional context. The session presentations, discussion panels, and daily poster sessions generated new ideas for cross disciplinary innovation that do not usually take place in regular, single discipline-focused conferences. Speakers were selected based on their strong communication skills and were given clear instructions to prepare presentations that not only focus on the novelty of their research, but also set the broader context for their field and how it can bridge out to other disciplines. For example, the water session featured four young, US and Arab researchers from multiple science and engineering disciplines who shared their recent research under the theme of Innovation for the Safe, Efficient, and Reliable Provision of Water. Prof. Mahad Baawain (Sultan Qaboos University, Oman) presented on sustainable reuse options of wastewater in Oman while Dr. Mansour Ahmed (KISR, Kuwait) gave a local perspective on innovative desalination technologies in Kuwait. From the US side, Prof. Manish Kumar (Pennsylvania State University, US) presented on new technologies for sustainable bioinspired water purification and Prof. Ameet Pinto (Northeastern University, US) established links with the Microbiome session by highlighting recent critical insights into factors regulating microbial communities at the tap across multiple drinking water systems. Based on the latest post-symposium survey, 69% percent of the participants learned about new developments in their fields, while nearly 88% percent of the participants believed the symposium gave them access to ideas and inspiration outside of their field that they plan to pursue.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong>The sixth Arab-American Frontiers symposium served as an excellent opportunity to build new collaborations and establish research partnerships. Our most recent survey indicated that 76% percent of the US respondents did not have any interaction with Arab scientists prior to their participation to the Arab-American Frontiers symposium. The same survey indicated that for 100% percent of the U.S. attendees identified potential collaborators at the Frontiers symposium.The Arab-American Frontiers fellowships in particular are an excellent opportunity for training and developing new research networks for both visiting and host fellows. Ten fellowships were awarded to pairs of participants who identified research areas of mutual interest. Visiting fellows were exposed to new research ecosystems and they had the opportunity to interact with members of the host fellow's research group and department. They also further explored how advancing research in the fields covered by the plenary sessions could have major societal impacts and improve lives in the U.S. and the Arab region For example, Hussam Mahmoud, Colorado State University, visited the lab of Rafik Talib, University of Blida 1, Algeria, to initiate a collaboration on seismic resilience between their institutions. The two fellows have initiated a project to explore resiliency in Blida City and Dr. Mahmoud will also jointly supervise two PhD students from the University of Blida. Similarly, William Tarpeh, Stanford University, who visited Mahad Baawain, Sultan Qaboos University, Oman, to jointly explore resource recovery from wastewater. They plan to apply their research to industry in San Francisco and Muscat. George Wells of Northwestern University also visited Ramy Aziz of Cairo University, Egypt, to jointly explore metagenomics. The researchers laid out a plan to sequence preliminary samples in the US, and then use resulting preliminary data as the basis for a joint proposal to the US-Egypt Science and Technology Joint Fund.&nbsp;Finally, the symposia provided a platform to young scientists from the Arab world and the US to be more visible, grow professionally, and learn useful leadership skills. The symposium is participant-driven and is therefore an excellent opportunity for attendees to strengthen their leadership, communication skills, and expand their professional network. According to our recent survey, 83% of the respondents said that the symposium was useful for their professional development.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/29/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Dalal&nbsp;Najib</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1848831/1848831_10573627_1609283643031_KFAS-groupPhoto--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1848831/1848831_10573627_1609283643031_KFAS-groupPhoto--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Group Photo\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1848831/1848831_10573627_1609283643031_KFAS-groupPhoto--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Group Photo\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Sixth Symposium Group Photo</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">KFAS</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Dalal&nbsp;Najib</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Group Photo</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1848831/1848831_10573627_1609275342517_IMG_1487--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1848831/1848831_10573627_1609275342517_IMG_1487--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Water Panel\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1848831/1848831_10573627_1609275342517_IMG_1487--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Water Panel\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Discussion during the Water Panel</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">KFAS</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Dalal&nbsp;Najib</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Water Panel</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
