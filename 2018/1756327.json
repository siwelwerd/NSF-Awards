 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will enhance physical and on-line data access to the Charles W. and Lois B. O'Brien insect collection, with an estimated 1,000,000 specimens of weevils and 250,000 planthoppers.  This collection has particular strengths in New World tropical groups, where 60-90% of the known genera and species of these megadiverse plant-feeding insects are represented.  The project will raise Arizona State University's profile as a center for understanding the systematics and evolution of two highly diverse and economically impactful insect groups.  The collection transfer and mobilization will involve multi-generational specialists and train diverse populations of students and citizen scientists.  Media-based outreach will include a series of podcast episodes about specialized life histories of weevils and planthoppers, and sharing of high-quality specimen photographs through the #YourDailyWeevil Twitter hashtag.  \r\n\r\nTo house the O'Brien collection at Arizona State University, the project will acquire and install 30 entomological double cabinets and matching Cornell-sized drawers and unit trays.  All specimens will be reorganized into the new infrastructure according to a single, well-referenced classification.  The collection's impact is reflected in more than 300 publications, nearly 400 primary types that anchor species names, rare specimen material pertaining to multiple thousands of species new to science, and a legacy of expert mentorship. Existing identifications will be updated, and the legibility and consistency of identification labels for unit trays and pinned specimen sets will be improved, thereby resolving current challenges to access.  Focusing on the biologically distinctive weevil sub-families Dryophthoridae, Conoderinae, and Entiminae from Central America, all unique taxon/collecting event instances will be digitized; representing an estimated 1,200-1,500 species and 8,000-12,000 specimens.  Digitization will include georeferencing and the production of high-resolution species images.  The occurrence data and images will be published as a Symbiota Collections of Arthropods Network (SCAN) checklist, shared with iDigBio, and submitted upon completion to a biodiversity data journal.  The checklist will be promoted as a first specimen-based update of the seminal Biologia Centrali-Americana for weevils, published more than 100 years ago.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The Charles W. and Lois B. OBrien Collection jointly comprise nearly 1.25 million specimens of plant-feeding beetles in the weevil (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea) and planthopper superfamilies (Hemiptera: Fulgoroidea), which were expertly identified but otherwise in imminent danger of losing accessibility and future impact. The project acquired andd installed a new, permanent specimen storage infrastructure comprised of 38 Cornell-style double cabinets, 1,800 insect drawers, and nearly 30,000 unit trays. Approximately 80% of the specimens were individually recurated while being transferred into this new infrastructure; with the remaining specimens compromising mainly loans or active research projects. All curated specimens were taxonomically reorganized and explicitly relabeled to reflect a consistent, globally applied taxonomic structure facilitating future retrieval and research. The project has provided employment and mentorship for a research technician, three graduate students, and 12 undergraduates at Arizona State University, while also leveraging the contributions of four volunteers. Focusing on three weevil subfamilies in Mesoamerica, the project managed to produce nearly 19,000 new, individual (specimen-level) occurrence records (99% georeferenced; 91% identified to species) and 2,000 images &ndash; in each case exceeding the original goals. These digitization results are publicly accessible through the Ecdysis and SCAN collections portals, and are furthermore aggregated in the iDigBio and GBIF networks for global public access. The collections and their original owners were prominently featured in an award-winning documentary \"The Love Bugs\", which generated inter-/national awareness and recognition for these collections and activities. Arizona State University's Biocollections will continue to advance the curation and accessibility of the O'Brien Collections, and will therefore remain a critical resource for these highly diverse and specialized, economically impactful, plant-feeding insect groups for current and future generations of systematic, evolutionary, and ecological researchers.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/08/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Nico&nbsp;M&nbsp;Franz</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1756327/1756327_10532606_1625716180567_Mfausti_lateral_edit_1508519222--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1756327/1756327_10532606_1625716180567_Mfausti_lateral_edit_1508519222--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Macrocopturus fausti (Heller, 1895)Macrocopturus fausti (Heller, 1895)\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1756327/1756327_10532606_1625716180567_Mfausti_lateral_edit_1508519222--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Macrocopturus fausti (Heller, 1895)Macrocopturus fausti (Heller, 1895)\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Macrocopturus fausti (Heller, 1895); Panama.
