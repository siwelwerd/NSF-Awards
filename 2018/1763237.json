 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry is funding Dr. Susan Wang at Washington State University to characterize the unusual chemistry used by two enzymes that methylate phosphorus atoms:  the \"P-methyltransferases\", PhpK and SD 1168.  Compounds containing bonds between carbon and phosphorus (C-P) play important roles in agriculture, industry, and medicine.  The C-P bond is resistant to being broken by water, making compounds that contain this stable structural feature commercially useful.  In addition, it has been suggested that C-P formation may provide a mechanism for marine organisms to store, preserve, and cycle phosphorus.  This project will investigate the physiological roles of the only known enzymes that form carbon-phosphorus-carbon (C-P-C) linkages, the \"P-methyltransferases.\"  Undergraduate and graduate students will receive broad multidisciplinary training in chemistry and biology.  These trainees will also participate in an outreach program introducing rural and/or low-income preschool children to the life sciences as a potential career path.\r\n\r\nThe focus here will be on two\"P-methyltransferase enzymes, PhpK and SD 1168, that methylate phosphorus atoms. Both enzymes are capable of producing precursors for the important natural product phosphinothricin, a broad-spectrum herbicide with antibiotic properties.  Both PhpK and SD 1168 are believed to utilize a combination of vitamin B12 and free radical chemistry to form C-P-C bonding sequences.  SD 1168, from the marine bacterium Shewanella denitrificans, exhibits broader substrate specificity than PhpK.  While its true biological function remains unknown, SD 1168 is a potential candidate for future engineering efforts to produce new C-P-C compounds.  A multifaceted, collaborative approach combining spectroscopic, synthetic, molecular biology, microbiology, and crystallographic techniques will be used to determine the enzymatic mechanism for P-methylation and to pinpoint the physiological role of SD 1168 in its host organism.  The results of the proposed research will provide insight into unusual, difficult chemistry and have implications for the biosynthesis of C-P natural products and related compounds.",

Many natural products play important roles as antibiotic treatments, and ultimately the oceans may be one of the few remaining sources of natural products with clinically and/or industrially relevant properties.  The focus of our laboratory has been the mechanistic study of an unusual, poorly-understood group of vitamin B12 dependent enzymes (C- and P-methyltransferases) that add methyl (-CH3) groups to unreactive carbon and phosphorus atoms, respectively, as part of the biosynthesis of a variety of bioactive natural products. The relative stability of the atoms modified suggested the need for a \"new\" catalytic mechanism, potentially the transfer of a methyl group as an organic radical as had been shown through model chemistry by others.  Such chemistry is thought to be facilitated by members of the \"radical SAM\" (S-adenosyl-L-methionine) superfamily of enzymes, a diverse group of proteins that is currently known to comprise several hundreds of thousands of members.  The vast majority of these enzymes either have unknown and/or as-yet uncharacterized functions. \n\nWhen we first became interested in these projects over 15 years ago, very little was known about these types of methyltransferases, which were thought to be quite unusual. With the explosion of genome sequencing, an increasing number of related enzymes of unknown purpose and function bearing similarity to the first-discovered B12-dependent C- and P-methyltransferases have been found.  Some of these related enzymes are found in marine microbes, suggesting that P-methyl transfer in particular may have an important but still unknown role in secondary metabolism.\n\nOur major results over the funding period include:\n\nOptimization of mass spectrometry conditions for the analysis of P-methyl transfer to probe the formation of potential reaction intermediates.\n\nGrowth, preparation of, and examination of the marine microbe, Shewanella denitrifcans, by magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to gauge the importance of phosphorus methylation in cell envelope biosynthesis.\n\nPublication of a detailed, comprehensive review article assessing progress in the radical SAM methyltransferase field as of 2018.\n\nEnhancement of research and teaching infrastructure at Case Western Reserve University with the addition of a triple-quad liquid chromatography/mass spectrometer (LC-MS) and a rapid quench instrument.\n\nEstablishment of a new, hands-on laboratory series in biotechnology, a master's concentration in biotechnology, and a biotechnology graduate certificate incorporating mass spectrometry coursework at Case Western Reserve University.
