 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rivers are generally very old waterways that have been carving through canyons and valleys for thousands of years. Because new streams and rivers are rare, little is known about how they form. One place we can learn about this process is within volcanic landscapes. After catastrophic volcanic eruptions, water from springs and snowmelt carve fresh stream channels. The trees that line the newly formed rivers and streams then provide shade, shelter, and crucial inputs of leaves and nutrients into these aquatic systems. These trees also help shape the rivers themselves by stabilizing banks, creating meanders, and slowing erosion. This project examines willows that have colonized along streams that formed after the eruption of Mount St. Helens. Researchers will study the influence of genetic variation in these trees on the development, ecosystem structure, and successional processes of the associated stream communities. Understanding the impact that the genetics of trees plays in the development of river systems has the potential to transform our understanding of how aquatic ecosystems are structured. This research is also important for the management and conservation of rivers because it explores the critical roles trees play in the formation of river systems following disturbances. This project will also provide outreach that engages the public and middle school students and promotes the participation of girls in STEM.   \r\n \r\nThis study explores the novel role the genetics of colonizing trees may play in structuring stream networks; extending genes-to-ecosystems research into evolutionary geomorphology. Using established common gardens and four headwater streams at Mount St. Helens, this study will examine how male and female willow trees differ in terms of litter quality, herbivory-induced leaf chemical changes, and their subsequent influence on in-stream litter-dependent microbes, macroinvertebrates, and leaf litter decomposition. Plants that have been tagged as male or female and clones will be genotyped to determine genetic relatedness, using established primers for determining willow genotypes. CHN composition and condensed tannins will be measured for each willow genotype sampled from the common gardens and litterbags will be incubated in the streams to quantify the impact of genetic and chemical differences on riverine biotic communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Because new streams and rivers are rare, little is known about how they form. One place we can learn more is in volcanic landscapes. After catastrophic volcanic eruptions, water from springs and snowmelt carve fresh stream channels. We can study the organisms that colonize these new streams, both along the river's edge and living in the water. The trees that line rivers and streams provide shade, shelter, and crucial inputs of leaves and wood to aquatic ecosystems. Trees help shape the stream itself by stabilizing banks, creating meanders, and halting erosion. Studying the establishment of trees along new streams is important because they can influence many other organisms and the ecosystem services they provide (e.g., water filtration and the breakdown of materials). We know very little about how these processes first begin, or whether different types of trees can engineer different types of streams. Just as there is great variation and diversity among humans, there is similar genetic variation within each species of tree, including for some tree species, differences between males and females.</p>\n<p>This research addressed the influences of plant genetics in willow on in-stream ecosystem function, the succession of in-stream communities, and channel dynamics across four headwater streams at Mount St. Helens. Since the presence of riparian trees has the ability to influence channel dynamics and stream morphology, the genetics of colonizing trees may structure the entire stream network, extending genes-to-ecosystems research into evolutionary geomorphology. In trees that separate male and female flowers onto different individuals, this genetic difference may influence how streams develop since male and female trees allocate resources differently. This research has increased our understanding of successionary processes in streams and the influences of plant genetics on the development of stream ecosystems in a post-eruption volcanic landscape.</p>\n<p>We published 16 journal articles during the period of this grant. We found that male and female willow shrubs colonize riparian habitats differentially (females colonize closer to the wetted edge of streams on the Pumice Plain, LeRoy et al. 2020). Female willow shrubs had lower %N, and higher C:N in summer leaf litter than males and female leaves decomposed more slowly once in the stream (LeRoy et al. 2020). Female willow shrubs were more infected by stem-boring herbivores, which increased branch death and summer litter inputs (Minsavage-Davis et al. 2023). These differences in combination support the idea that female willows are more likely to drop summer leaf litter into streams, providing altered organic matter inputs for a longer duration. We further explored the influences of willow plant sex on leaf litter chemistry and found significant influences of plant sex on nitrogen and a suite of plant chemicals using time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Ramstack Hobbs et al. 2022). Stem-boring herbivore-attacked litter (collected as summer leaf fall) had significantly higher %N, and lower C/N and condensed tannins (CT), than leaves that were unattacked and senesced in the autumn. We found that decomposition rates differed between female leaves compared to female flowers for willows, that macroinvertebrates colonized flowers at higher rates, and that overall communities of macroinvertebrates differed on leaves compared to flowers (Garthwaite et al., 2021). In addition, we found that female willows tended to have higher concentrations of mite galls, fungal rust infections, and tent caterpillar masses across the Pumice Plain of Mount St. Helens (Minsavage-Davis et al. 2023). An undergraduate student led an extensive review paper on plant sex influences on riparian communities and ecosystems (Scheuerell &amp; LeRoy 2023). We established an experiment examining open/closed willow canopies on in-stream communities and ecosystem functions. Organic matter processing rates were significantly influenced by both the watershed and the open/closed canopy treatment (LeRoy et al. 2023).</p>\n<p>We provided science outreach to a variety of audiences. We have given talks as part of lecture series in prisons, worked with high school students in the Mount St. Helens Institute's Summer Ecology program, participated in GeoGirls - a middle school program with USGS, worked with Upward Bound's first-generation college-bound program, hosted and gave a keynote address to 400 K-12 students for annual on-campus watershed ecology events, and have engaged with Evergreen alumni through annual events. PI LeRoy collaborated on an artist book, and a new 15-minute video for the Mount St. Helens Visitor Center to play on repeat.</p>\n<p>We provided research experiences to 36 undergraduate students and 26 are co-authors on journal articles. PI LeRoy was awarded the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring in 2021 and named a River Warrior by the Lewis Pugh Foundation in 2023.
