 "awd_abstract_narration": "How do people who know more than one language recognize which language they are hearing at a given time? And how much of a language must be heard in order to make a positive identification? In most circumstances many features, including sound patterns, grammatical structures, and vocabulary items, simultaneously distinguish the languages and identification is rapid and seemingly effortless. Little is known, however, about the relative contribution of each component, and there are few language combinations that allow for isolating a single feature, with all other factors being equal. Investigating language processing in bilingual speakers is important for testing the limits of bilingualism: what features do speakers use to keep languages apart?\r\n\r\nThis research project examines data from bilingual speakers of Ecuadoran Quichua and the mixed language known as Media Lengua, which consists of Quichua grammatical frames with all word roots replaced by their Spanish counterparts but pronounced as though they were Quichua. Media Lengua is related to Quichua much as Lewis Carroll's poem \"Jabberwocky\" is related to English, e.g. \"'Twas brillig and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe\"; the difference is that the non-Quichua roots come from another real language, Spanish. Quichua-Media Lengua bilinguals provide a unique environment in which to determine whether speakers maintain separate lexicons (word repositories) for each language or a single word-bank with some sort of language-tagging with accompanying grammatical and phonetic information. The project will employ a variety of techniques to explore the mechanisms that allow for language identification, reactions to language mixing when no grammatical differences intervene, and long-term prospects for mixed languages like Media Lengua. The project will train graduate students in experimental field methods. The project will enhance the value and prestige of less commonly studied and often stigmatized languages and language varieties.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The search for answers capitalized on a unique environment found in the mountains of northern Ecuador, where the Andean language Quichua co-exists with the \"new\" language known as Media Lengua, essentially a variant of Quichua in which all word roots have been replaced by their Spanish counterparts, while leaving the grammar unchanged. To speakers of Quichua, Media Lengua is much like Lewis Carroll's \"Jabberwocky\" in <em>Through the looking glass</em>: \"Twas brillig and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe\" except that the non-Quichua roots are real words in another language (Spanish). Since Quichua and Media Lengua share the very same grammar, only the separate sets of word roots keep the languages apart. Or do they? Fully mixed languages like Media Lengua are as scarce as the heaviest radioactive isotopes, and like the latter, are predicted to have short life spans when not hived off from their source languages. Yet another open question for which the Quichua-Media Lengua communities can provide information has to do with restrictions on fluid language-switching mid-way through a sentence. Such freely switched language occurs in many bilingual communities, and can be frequently heard among Spanish-English bilinguals in the United States. Research has shown that certain combinations almost never occur, for example switching languages after a subject pronoun (<em>she, he</em>) or a question word (<em>what, who</em>). It is not clear whether this is due to some ?special? property of pronouns and interrogatives, or to more general grammatical differences between the languages: for example subject pronouns can be left out in Spanish, but not in English, and English question words often require adding <em>do </em>(<em>What do you want? Where do you live?</em>), unlike in Spanish. Since Quichua and Media Lengua share the very same grammar, the possibly \"special\" status of pronouns and interrogatives can be studied without confounding factors. The present study, based on more than a decade of field research in Media Lengua-Quichua speech communities, brought a number of interactive experimental tasks to bear on the three aformentioned questions: the minimal material required to distinguish languages; the stability of mixed languages in contact with both source languages; the role of specific grammatical categories in constraining or facilitating language switching. The inquiry progressed from simple interviews and questionnaires to more subtle and technologically challenging techniques. This mutual learning environment resulted in a close rapport with community members, which facilitated their participation in tasks increasingly removed from customary verbal interactions among individuals with little or no familiarity with modern technology and linguistic research. These tasks included rapid acceptability judgments, rapid translation, language identification?from individual words to full sentences, elicited repetition with distractions (which induce participants to ?repeat? what they would have said rather than what was actually heard), and pinpointing language switches occuring in the middle of a sentence. The interactive tasks were carried out on portable computers, with measurements of response accuracy, reaction time, and in the final tasks, eye movements and pupil measurements (indicative of relative processing difficulty). With respect to the first research question, the results of the experiments indicate that subtle phonetic differences in word roots are sufficient to reliably distinguish languages, even in the absence of other clues such as context or acquaintance with the speaker. As for the relative stability of a mixed language spoken together with its source languages, a comparison of results from the various communities where Media Lengua is spoken alongside Kichwa shows that once Spanish is added to the mix (e.g. through increasing presence of Spanish-language education among younger generations), the ability to distinguish Quichua from Media Lengua declines. In some cases, only Spanish survives, while in other communities Media Lengua and Spanish continue to co-exist, but traditional Quichua fades away. Finally, even in the absence of any grammatical differences between Quichua and Media Lengua, language switching after subject pronouns and question words was strongly rejected in judgment tasks, provoked greater processing difficulty as seen in pupil responses and gaze-tracking paths, and was routinely self-corrected in distracted repetition tasks. These results indicate that grammatical differences alone do not explain the widely-observed constraint on language switching after pronouns and question words, and point to more general issues of sentence meaning and cohesiveness. Taken together, the outcomes of this project vividly demonstrate that fruitful answers to big questions about language and cognition can come from small, understudied, and undervalued languages. The results also confirm that with proper community-based groundwork, research techniques usually confined to controlled laboratory environments can be effectively employed across a wide range of cultural and ecological settings.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/26/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: John&nbsp;Lipski</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
