 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program supports the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) with the acquisition of a Lab-on-a-Printer (LOP) with RX1 Bioprinting Platform. The instrument will enable accelerated fundamental 3D-bioprinting research at UTEP. The LOP technology is uniquely capable of combining multiple cell types and biomaterial inputs on a single printhead cartridge, enabling the precise deposition of different cells and materials in 3D to recreate and mimic the complex structure of real tissue. The RX1 Bioprinting Platform uses the LOP technology to rapidly and precisely construct functional 3D living tissue, with an advanced material processing capability providing accurate control over patterning of the biological building blocks, rapidly.  At UTEP, the RX1 Bioprinting Platform will be used in several high impact projects including, engineering tissues with blood vessels, the human heart wall, tissues for nerve regeneration and developmental biology, and the application of novel 2D/advanced materials for in-vitro studies. Concurrently, the RX1 Bioprinting Platform will provide sustained and cross-disciplinary studies while contributing to and advancing STEM education and training by providing students access to cutting-edge teaching, research technologies and opportunities.\r\n\r\n \r\nThe main objective of the researchers is to employ the Lab-on-a-Printer (LOP)   to utilize hydrogels (synthetic and naturally derived) as scaffolds for bioprinting aimed at tissue-on-a-chip studies. In addition, non-hydrogel type materials such as polymer blends (including Polyurethane, PCL-PLLA), shape memory polymers and nanocomposites with nanowire inclusions will also be targeted. The 3D-printed constructs will include biological neural network development, dose optimization/ minimization of small molecule based therapeutics and enhanced dielectric energy storage and energy harvesting for energy related applications. The LOP technology can easily enable printing of soft structures (such as tissues) which provides needed exploration of biomaterial with advantageous properties than currently possible. The instrument will support multidisciplinary, team-based opportunities involving Engineering faculty at UTEP and faculty from other scientific disciplines and help establish new critical regional collaborations within the state of Texas and neighboring New Mexico. The technology and hands-on use of this printer will be incorporated into existing or new courses with laboratory component, exposing nearly 100 students annually to this technology. It will strengthen outreach to the community, local middle- and high-school students. It will lead to new industry-academic collaborations benefiting both the scientific community at UTEP and industry, nationwide.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
