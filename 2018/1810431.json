 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical abstract:\r\n\r\nStructural materials used by power generation-reliant industries are often processed such that the amount of material imperfections present at small length scales is reduced. This approach has been quite successful; however, it is reaching the limits of what can be achieved, while new demanding applications require even higher material performance. This award supports fundamental research to look for the next generation of high performance materials for high temperature structural applications by using the opposite approach, i.e., to increase the number of imperfections at small, including atomic, length scales in such a way that deformation at high temperatures is impeded rather than enhanced by these imperfections. This requires a complete understanding of composition effects and processing conditions that can produce the high density of imperfections required and to make sure that they are retained during high temperature loading, since high temperatures tend to decrease the number of imperfections in a material.  The physical principles that govern the relationship among processing, structure and mechanical properties in materials with such high number of defects as those proposed here are not well understood; hence, they will be studied in this project through a combination of experiments and modeling to produce new scientific knowledge in the field of structural materials. Furthermore, students in science and engineering at both undergraduate and graduate levels will participate in the research and be trained in state-of-the-art techniques to process, test, characterize and model structural material behavior, helping to educate the new generation of engineers and scientists in this field. Finally, the potential to understand how to produce a new generation of structural materials for high temperature applications with better properties than those currently available can have significant impacts and benefits to society. \r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical abstract:\r\n\r\nMetal and alloys with a mean grain size below 100 nm have enhanced static strength compared to coarse-grained alloys and, hence, are very attractive for engineering applications. However, very few studies have addressed the fundamental mechanisms of microstructural evolution during time dependent deformation, limiting their practical use. This critical gap in knowledge has stemmed from the lack of consistency among various experimental conditions (processing methods, testing conditions, etc.) along with the grain growth observed during deformation. This indeterminate understanding hinders our ability to address the current need for advanced load-bearing structural materials in many important technologies where creep loading is common (e.g., power generation, propulsion). Motivated by this, the hypothesis that will be tested is that Ni-Y-Zr is a stable duplex system, wherein both grain boundary segregation (some solid solubility of Zr in Ni) and phase formation (e.g., Ni-Y precipitates) occur, leading to a microstructurally stable nanocrystalline alloy. Samples from the resulting material will be tested and characterized under a variety of loads and temperatures, unraveling true creep behavior and pertaining mechanisms of microstructural effects on creep of stable nanocrystalline materials. Furthermore, identification of these mechanisms will also enhance our understanding of microstructural instability commonly observed in nanocrystal materials at relatively low temperatures during time dependent deformation. In a broader context, the proposed work will lay the groundwork to address gaps in iterative materials design through coordinated modeling and experimental efforts across multiple length scales.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

However, microstructure instabilities, i.e., grain growth, observed during short- and long-term deformation at room and elevated temperature complicate the interpretation of grain size effects and creep behavior of NC alloys. Careful processing, testing and characterization work performed in this project has shown that NC Ni-Y-Zr ternary alloys have a much more stable microstructure than pure NC metallic materials and even binary (Ni-Y and Ni-Zr) NC alloys, whereby grain size remains below 1 &micro;m even after annealing at temperatures as high as 1200 &deg;C (Fig. 1a). This result validated a key hypothesis that was at the center of the intellectual merit for this work. Examination of the microstructure of these samples revealed the presence of dispersed reinforcing second phases (Fig. 1b), that help keep the grains small and increase the strength of the material, which reaches values at 600 &deg;C that are comparable to that of Ni-based superalloys (Fig. 1c), but with much lower amounts of alloying additions (only a few weight percent).&nbsp;&nbsp;This strength is reflected in the rate at which strain increases under constant stress and temperature (Fig. 1d), which compares well to other stable NC alloys such as Cu-Ta. Examination of the deformation at the atomic level using powerful X-ray beams shows that both the Ni matrix and the second phases reach a steady value under constant stress even as the creep strain increases (Fig. 1e). This implies that they deform together and contribute to the creep strain in a cooperative fashion, likely through the motion of atomic defects through the lattice.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Conventional, CG Ni-Y-Zr alloys were also investigated in this work and it was found that these materials also exhibited&nbsp;enhanced mechanical properties with very small amount of alloying additions, and had microstructures that are similar to those in some Ni-based superalloys (Fig. 2a), i.e., with an aligned second phase that serves as a strong reinforcement, with strength at 600 &deg;C (Fig. 2b) also comparable to those alloys and better than those of binary alloys (Ni-Zr and Ni-Y). The rate at which creep grows at constant stress (245 MPa) and temperature (600 &deg;C) is comparable to that of the NC alloy (Fig. 2c). Examination of strain at the atomic level during creep experiments shows that the second phase, which shares the &lt;111&gt; crystal direction with the matrix, produces a strong constraint in the latter, as reflected on the negative value of the strains along the transverse direction (TD, solid red and orange lines on Fig. 2d). This constraint, in turn, contributes significantly to increase the strength of these alloys.</p>\n<p>The findings described above make these alloys quite promising for applications under extreme conditions, which represents an important broader impact from this work.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/30/2024<br>\nModified by: Pedro&nbsp;D&nbsp;Peralta</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1810431/1810431_10562920_1711835770926_NCAlloySummary--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1810431/1810431_10562920_1711835770926_NCAlloySummary--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Main results for nanocrystalline Ni-Y-Zr alloys\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1810431/1810431_10562920_1711835770926_NCAlloySummary--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Main results for nanocrystalline Ni-Y-Zr alloys\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1: NC Ni-Y-Zr alloys.
