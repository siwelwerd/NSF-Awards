 "awd_abstract_narration": "Diamond, as an electronic material, has the best heat conduction properties and is readily produced by commercial equipment and processes. Gallium nitride is a semiconductor material that has seen recent commercial success in high efficiency light emitting diode bulbs, radio wave communications and radars, and power conversion switches.\r\nHowever, the full potential of gallium nitride is limited by the material's inability to efficiently conduct heat. Therefore, the project's aim is to combine diamond and gallium nitride in a novel approach that will focus on (1) the processes that produce both materials, (2) an in-depth characterization of the electronic and thermal properties (emphasizing heat flow), (3) fabrication of test structures, and (4) thermal conduction simulations. There are broad needs for combining diamond's thermal benefits within individual circuitry that comprises today's electronics.\r\nTransistors and switches (the backbone of the entire high-tech industry) are well known to produce substantial heat, and the problem is continually getting worse as devices become smaller and the density of electronic components packed together on circuit boards increases. (In personal electronics, consider how hot smart phones and laptops become during regular usage.) Specific applications that will benefit from the research include electric vehicles,  power conversion for flexible integration of renewable energy sources to the nation's power grid, radar systems and communications systems for first-responder, defense and civilian uses. The research will result in basic and applied knowledge regarding the diamond-gallium nitride interface. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international conferences. Student engagement and education efforts will take place through research and classroom experiences and a strong culture of undergraduate research at the affiliate's institution.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of the research is to develop a novel diamond-GaN interface and fully characterize its thermal transport characteristics. Innovative materials research will involve three-dimensional integration of GaN on diamond to significantly improve thermal management in high-power electronics. The high thermal conductivity of diamond makes it highly attractive for mitigating self-heating effects that plague the efficiency of switches and power transistors. An innovative path will be developed to selectively grow diamond and GaN to achieve close proximity to the current-carrying GaN two-dimensional electron gas for efficient heat removal. Systematic studies will focus on material growth and characterization. Characterization will emphasize interfaces of these materials and its impact on heat flow. Fabrication of electrical and electrothermal test structures will be conducted. These will be used in combination with electrical and optical measurements to investigate the effects of deposition and heterointerface quality on fundamental properties, including and thermal boundary resistance (TBR). The impact of these material properties on transistor operational limits will be examined with the aid of simulations. Selective diamond deposition will provide understanding to improve diamond quality, interface properties, and manage stresses resulting from thermal expansion mismatches. The impact of the growth steps, particularly of the diamond-GaN interfaces, on material and device properties will be studied by physical and optical methods. Test structures will be measured to determine thermal conductivity and TBR. Extensive characterization will correlate crystal quality and defect  properties with these key macroscopic quantities in thermal transport and electrical performance. The research will result in basic and applied knowledge regarding material deposition and properties of the diamond?GaN interface region. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international conferences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDiamond grown on AlGaN/GaN high electron-mobility transistor (HEMT)\n\nWe investigated in-situ SiNx grown by MOCVD immediately following the III-Nitride growth.  Subsequently, CVD diamond deposition is conducted via hot filament CVD.  We evaluated the impact on the material properties (stress/strain state) of GaN before and after diamond growth by high-resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD), and from visible and UV micro-Raman.  STEM was performed to evaluate the structural and elemental properties of the in-situ SiNx passivated AlGaN/GaN HEMT interface before and after diamond growth.  The process does not adversely affect the underlying III-Nitride semiconductor layers.  TDTR was performed to evaluate the thermal conductivity of the CVD diamond and the effective thermal boundary resistance of the diamond/GaN interface.  The primary results have been published in ACS Applied Electronic Materials 2019 1(8), 1387-1399. https://doi.org/10.1021/acsaelm.9b00131\n\nEffect of precursor stoichiometry on diamond\n\nThe effect of stoichiometry on morphology, phase purity and texture formation of polycrystalline diamond films was investigated.  Polycrystalline diamond films on Si (100) were deposited via HFCVD at ~720-750 &deg;C.  The gas mixture was varied between 1.5% to 4.5% methane in hydrogen.  UV micro-Raman spectroscopy indicated that diamond phase purity decreases in the films as methane concentration increases.  Cross sectional UV Raman line scan across diamond film thickness shows that diamond quality is primarily dictated by stoichiometry and consistent across the film thickness.  XRD pole figure analyses indicated that films deposited with 3.0% methane are preferentially oriented in the &lt;111&gt; direction whereas films deposited with 4.5% showed texture along the &lt;110&gt; direction in addition to &lt;111&gt; which was ~23&deg; tilted with surface normal.  This work is published in Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics 31, 8597&ndash;8606, 2020. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10854-020-03395-7\n\n3D integration of diamond and GaN\n\nDirect growth of single crystalline GaN on polycrystalline diamond is reported for the first time.  The structure utilizes selective diamond growth on GaN/Si wafers using HFCVD and selective growth of GaN using epitaxial lateral overgrowth.  GaN growth takes place first on the window region between, then above, the diamond stripes via MOCVD.  Optimization of the growth was performed by varying V/III ratio, pressure, and temperature.  Lower pressure, higher V/III ratio, higher temperature and GaN window mask openings along [100] resulted in enhanced lateral growth of GaN.  Complete lateral coverage and coalescence of GaN was achieved over a [100] oriented 5 &micro;m wide GaN window between 5 &micro;m diamond stripes.  The crystalline quality of overgrown GaN was confirmed using SEM, HRXRD, micro-Raman spectroscopy, TEM, and selective area electron diffraction.  This study was published in ACS Applied Materials Interfaces 12, 39397&minus;39404, 2020. https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c10065\n\nPreferentially oriented growth of diamond film on silicon with nickel interlayer\n\nHighly oriented diamond films are produced by use of a thin, 5 to 20 nm, Ni interlayer.  Separate annealing studies demonstrate diffusion of Ni into Si to form silicides with crystal structures depending on temperature.  The HFCVD diamond film with Ni interlayer results in reduced non-diamond carbon, low surface roughness, high diamond crystal quality, and increased texturing relative to growth on bare silicon wafers.  The diamond film grown with 10 nm Ni interlayer yielded 92.5% of the diamond grains oriented along the (110) crystal direction with ~ 2.5 &micro;m thickness and large average grain size ~1.45 &micro;m.  These results were significantly better than diamond grown on Si (111) without Ni layer.  The oriented growth of diamond film on Ni layers is attributed to the nano-diamond seeds becoming oriented relative to the &beta;1-Ni3Si silicide that forms during the diamond nucleation period.\n\nAchieving high diamond seeding density for direct growth on Si and GaN \n\nWe studied the role of diamond seeding density&mdash;spanning the 4&acute;108 cm-2 to 2&acute;1012 cm-2 range&mdash;on the growth, morphology, and quality of diamond films.  The diamond films were found to quickly coalesce for the sample with highest seed density.  For the lowest seeding density, the diamond crystals develop three dimensionally via Volmer-Weber growth into large grains that continue to increase in size with additional HFCVD diamond growth.  At the highest seed density, ~2&acute;1012 cm-2, coalescence happens within the first 30 minutes of HFCVD growth so that diamond grains are mostly vertical and can be described by the van der Drift growth model.  The initial diamond grains are found to be small and more uniform with a polycrystalline morphology that persists with longer growth time.  The slower development of diamond with uniform shape reduces the surface roughness and improve diamond quality.  The diamond/Si interface is observed to be porous when isolated diamond grains coalesce for diamond growth with lower seeding density.  The relative absence of pores or voids is found with increasing seed density.  Micro-Raman cross-section images confirm that the diamond phase quality and crystallinity is improved both near the interface and throughout the diamond film thickness for each seeding density.  A manuscript has been accepted by the Journal of Applied Physics.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/13/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Edwin Piner"
