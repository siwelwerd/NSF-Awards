 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI), the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) programs and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). Professor Karl Booksh from the University of Delaware and colleagues Raul F Lobo, John F Rabolt, Thomas E Hanson and Jocelyn Alcantara-Garcia have acquired an atomic force Raman microscope. Raman microscopy is a principal characterization technique for both surfaces and bulk samples. Using a laser, the microscope scans a sample which produces vibrational spectroscopic data providing chemical information about the material. An atomic force microscope (AFM) also scans a sample using a small probe or tip to provide information about the surface such as topography, hardness, electrical and thermal properties. Combining the two techniques in an AFM-Raman microscope provides both types of information from the same regions of the sample. It has wide application in research endeavors across the pure and applied sciences and engineering.  An important application is use in the investigation of converting methane to chemicals such as methanol using a catalyst on a surface. The microscope will enable study of the reaction of surface species as a function of reaction conditions to optimize the yield of valuable products. The acquisition will impact 5 colleges, 13 departments at the University of Delaware (UD) and users at Delaware State University (DSU, an HBCU) and the Winterthur Museum. The Raman microscope will significantly benefit female, minority, and junior faculty at both UD and DSU. The research and training of a significant number of female and underrepresented minority students will also be greatly enhanced.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. The structure and morphology of trilayer coaxial electrospun polymer nanofibers is under investiation, and analysis of high tensile strength polymers.  Chemical modification of surfaces,  methane activation over copper-containing zeolite catalysts and catalytic conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to chemicals and fuels is being studied.  Synthesis of hierarchical semiconducting nano-composites is another research area to benefit from the instrument.  The microbial iron- and sulfur-oxidation and biomineral composition in environmental samples is explored, and mechanisms and control of sulfur metabolism in chlorobaculum tepidum.  The Winterthur Scientific Research and Analysis laboratory within the Department of Conservation at Winterthur Museum is using the non-destructive instrumental technique afforded by the microscope in the analysis of works of art and cultural heritage.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
