 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborative Research: Do benthic feedbacks couple sulfur, nitrogen and carbon biogeochemistry during transient deoxygenation?\r\nTina Treude and David Valentine\r\n\r\nThis study focuses on chemical processes that occur in oxygen-limited waters along the world's continental margins. These processes are influenced by the activities of microbes and control the fate of key elements that are deposited to sediments in these areas including carbon, nitrogen and sulfur. As a result, they are key to the health and function of the ocean. The intellectual merit of this research is to study the coupled chemical and microbial processes that occur in these environments by combining robotic technology with experiments that will be conducted at the ocean floor and in the shipboard laboratory. The broader impacts of this project will provide at-sea training and educational opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students and the results will be broadly distributed to stakeholders and interested parties. Results from this research promise to identify and quantify rates for key processes that couple carbon, nitrogen and sulfur in marine environments adjacent to the continents. The project addresses an important aspect of environmental change in the ocean (i.e., decreased oxygen due to warming and nutrient enrichment) and its influence on chemical and biological cycles and ocean ecosystems.\r\n\r\nThe dynamics of oxygen minimum zones along continental margins, and their potential for future expansion, are important because of their intersection with global biogeochemical cycles and because of their far-reaching impacts on ocean ecosystems. However, the impacts of transient deoxygenation on biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur at the sea floor are not well established and are the focus of this study. This study will test the overarching hypothesis that deoxygenation triggers a positive feedback loop between bacterial mats at the sea floor that consume hydrogen sulfide, a sulfur species that can be toxic to higher organisms, and an underlying community of bacteria that produce hydrogen sulfide.  By this hypothesis, the establishment of sea floor mats, which depend on inorganic nitrogen sources to run their sulfur metabolism, accelerates nitrogen cycling in the uppermost sediment horizon following deoxygenation. The accelerated nitrogen cycling allows for upward expansion of the sulfide-producing bacteria, which in-turn provide a shallow source of sulfide as substrate to further support nitrogen cycling in the sea floor mat.  The results of this study will enable understanding of the relationship between oxygen dynamics in the water column and the biogeochemical processes at the sea floor that link the transformations of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur. The results of this study promise to define the environmental conditions under which the sulfur and nitrogen cycles are coupled and subject to strong positive feedbacks at the seafloor, as well as the conditions under which they are decoupled. This study provides training in research and innovative analytical and experimental techniques to four graduate students and several undergraduates. Undergraduates will be engaged in research at two institutions, one of which has recently been designated as a Hispanic serving institution.  Approximately 10 undergraduate students (20 in total) will participate in each of the two proposed oceanographic expeditions, through an established course entitled: Field Studies in Marine Biogeochemistry. This course provides an opportunity for students to develop an independent research project in advance of the expedition, to participate on the expedition, and to conduct research projects while at sea.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This process, characterized by declining oxygen levels in ocean waters, is having significant impacts on marine ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles, including nutrient availability, microbial activity, and the health of marine life. Our research focuses on how deoxygenation in the basin's deep, oxygen-deficient waters influences sulfur-oxidizing microbial mats, element cycling, and nutrient dynamics.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Deoxygenation and the Development of Bacterial Mats</strong><br />A distinctive feature of the Santa Barbara Basin is the seasonal formation of bacterial mats at the sediment-water interface. These mats use nitrate to oxidize sulfide in the absence of oxygen. When the bottom waters become anoxic, these bacteria thrive, shifting the sediment from a predominantly denitrifying to an ammonium-producing environment. This shift in microbial activity is associated with changes in sediment chemistry, including the depletion of iron oxides and the release of dissolved iron from the sediment. Our studies suggest that the cycles of deoxygenation and reoxygenation in the basin's bottom waters contribute to very high fluxes of dissolved iron, further influencing nutrient cycling and the overall health of the ecosystem.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Shifting Geochemical Conditions in the Sediment</strong><br />As oxygen levels in the Santa Barbara Basin further decline, we observe significant changes in the geochemistry of the sediment. Below the basin's sill, which is located about 475 meters deep, the sediment undergoes dramatic shifts in its redox state, moving from an iron-rich to a sulfide-rich environment. This state is marked by high rates of sulfate reduction in the sediment, which in turn leads to the production of sulfide. Despite these high rates of sulfate reduction, the accumulation of iron sulfides in the sediment is lower than expected, suggesting that reactive iron is being lost to the water column during anoxic conditions and is not being replenished during re-oxygenation. The loss of iron could have long-term consequences for the basin's biogeochemistry, potentially driving a shift towards more sulfidic condition, highlighting the need for further study of these changes and their potential consequences for marine life.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Role of Oxygen in Marine Biogeochemistry</strong><br />In addition to studying the impacts of deoxygenation on sediment and microbial processes, we have also focused on better understanding the spatial and temporal variability of oxygen in the Santa Barbara Channel. Using advanced technologies such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), we collected high-resolution data on oxygen levels in the channel and reconstructed oxygen concentrations in the bottom boundary layer. This new data provides the first detailed map of dissolved oxygen levels across the Santa Barbara Channel, including the bottom layer of the basin. By reconstructing oxygen levels in this bottom layer, we were able to update our understanding of iron release from the seafloor by incorporating new measurements of iron fluxes. Our findings suggest that the release of iron from the seafloor, driven by changes in bottom-water oxygen, contributes significantly to the biogeochemistry of the region --- estimated at approximately 24,000 tons of iron per year. This research is crucial for understanding how changes in oxygen levels can affect the cycling of key nutrients like iron and nitrogen, which, in turn, influence the productivity and health of marine ecosystems.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Role of Iron in Marine Productivity</strong><br />Iron is a crucial micronutrient for phytoplankton, the tiny marine algae that form the foundation of the ocean's food web. Phytoplankton rely on iron for photosynthesis, and their growth can be limited by its availability in surface waters. The Santa Barbara Basin is a hotspot for the release of iron from its sediments, especially in areas where bottom waters become oxygen-deprived, or anoxic. Our research shows that iron is released in large quantities from the seafloor, with fluxes as high as 4.9 millimoles per square meter per day. These iron releases can enhance phytoplankton productivity in surface waters by alleviating iron limitations. However, the effects of this increased iron availability may be partially offset by other nutrient limitations, such as nitrogen, which can reduce the overall impact of this positive feedback.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />Our research sheds light on the complex interactions between deoxygenation, element cycling, nutrient dynamics, and microbial processes in the Santa Barbara Basin. By studying this climate-vulnerable region, we gain a better understanding of how ocean deoxygenation is reshaping marine ecosystems. These findings are crucial for predicting the broader impacts of deoxygenation on global ocean biogeochemistry and marine life, helping to inform strategies for managing and protecting marine environments in a changing climate.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/13/2024<br>\nModified by: Tina&nbsp;Treude</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1829981/1829981_10572799_1734131028439_Yousavich_et_al._2024__scheme--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1829981/1829981_10572799_1734131028439_Yousavich_et_al._2024__scheme--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Benthic biogeochemical processes in the Santa Barbara Basin along the Basin's depth gradient.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1829981/1829981_10572799_1734131028439_Yousavich_et_al._2024__scheme--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Benthic biogeochemical processes in the Santa Barbara Basin along the Basin's depth gradient.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The teal-to-lavender gradient shows a decline in oxygen and nitrate with basin depth.
