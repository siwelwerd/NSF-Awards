This conference is the annual meeting of the APS Division of Laser Science (DLS), and will be held in conjunction with the annual meeting of the Optical Society of America.  The conference program includes many of the research topics central to Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics.  The support of students through this award makes a substantial contribution to the education and training of future scientists. Students who graduate with a background in laser science acquire a broad range of knowledge and skills that enable them to contribute to progress in many areas of science and technology. \r\n\r\nThe meeting is scheduled to be held Washington DC September 16-20, 2018.  It offers an opportunity for undergraduate students to present their research results and to interact with senior scientists primarily from the United States, but also the broader international community. Support is provided only for US students (students enrolled in US universities).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Again the schedule was very different from previous years for two significant reasons.  First, the meeting was scheduled for mid-September, a month earlier than the traditional mid-October dates, and this caused considerable squeezing in the planning and preparation. Second, the sessions were scheduled differently since there was no preceding plenary session as there usually has been.  Needless to say, we were able to adapt to the new schedule just as we did last year with help from the OSA meetings people.\n\nMonday morning was unscheduled and the students used the time to mount their posters and become further acquainted with one another.  Our Symposium events began at noon with the luncheon in the Ballroom East room of the Washington Hilton.  We had a sandwich lunch for our participants and several guests, who spoke extemporaneously to the assembled group on a variety of topics initiated by student questions.  The guests were primarily mentors, and the exchanges were lively and stimulating.  The 1:00 PM ending time came all too soon. The guests included Nobel Laureates Bill Phillips and David Wineland, Meggers Prize recipient Warren Warren, SPS director Brad Conrad, newly elected OSA Fellow Anne Kelley, and mentors Kristan Corwin, Samir Bali,  Hong Lin, and others.
