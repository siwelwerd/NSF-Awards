 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports student travel for select students to participate in the Doctoral Mentoring Consortium (DMC) at the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) that will be held in Stockholm, Sweden, July 13-19, 2018. This is the premier international conference for researchers in artificial intelligence research across a fully international research community. This activity will bring together a broad community of researchers in the field of AI, and support junior researchers at this critical early-career stage.  The DMC creates the opportunity to bring in participants who might not have attended an AI conference due to lack of resources. This is especially true for those at smaller institutions and those which have less developed AI programs. Engaging such participants has the potential to draw more talent into AI research, improve research ideas in their formative stage, and engender collaborations across the breadth of disciplines.  This event provides students with invaluable exposure to outside perspectives on their work at a critical time in their research and enables them to explore their career objectives.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The fact the  Doctoral Consortium included students who are not studying in the US  (none of them funded under this grant) exposed the students to different  cultures and broadened their professional networks outside their own  institution and their own country, preparing the foundations for long  term international cooperation and better cultural awareness.\n\nThe  students funded by this project have received unique and highly  valuable training.  A valuable part of training new researchers is to  give them the opportunity to interact with leaders in their research  field outside their own research group.  This helps the students seeing  their work in a broader context, gives them opportunities for receiving  different feedback, and makes them more independent of their research  advisor. The students had multiple opprtunities to extend their  professional network to other students and senior researchers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/26/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Maria L Gini"
