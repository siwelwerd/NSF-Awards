 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intense beams of atomic nuclei are essential for studies in fundamental and applied research. These ion beams can be used to reproduce and study the nuclear reactions occurring in stars and stellar explosions, characterize nuclear reactions of interest for nuclear energy and national security, and assist in the development of novel materials via ion beam analysis. Such experiments are performed at the Edwards Accelerator Laboratory (EAL) at Ohio University, where helium nuclei play a particularly important role as helium-induced nuclear reactions are ubiquitous in nature and applications. This award provides the funds to acquire an upgrade to the EAL's helium ion source which will substantially increase operational reliability and will greatly expand measurement capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe EAL is a low energy nuclear physics facility with world-unique research capabilities. Experiments in the laboratory rely on light-ion beams accelerated by a 4.5 MV Pelletron, where beams are used at various target stations for charged-particle, gamma-ray, and neutron spectroscopy. This award supports the acquisition of an RF charge-exchange ion source, known as the Alphatross, from the National Electrostatics Corporation. The Alphatross provides a factor of eight improvement compared to currently achievable helium beam intensities and a factor of two reduction in gas consumption. This will enable several important measurements to be performed that were previously out of reach due to limited intensities or excessive helium-3 costs. The anticipated improvement in ion source reliability would provide additional benefits, such as more efficient operations for collaborators visiting from external institutions, a more consistent experience for the many undergraduate and graduate students who are trained on the accelerator, and increased throughput of experiments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We have installed the Alphatross system at the Edwards Accelerator Laboratory (EAL) at Ohio University, integrated the Alphatross into our control system and physical infrastructure, tested system performance to optimize operating parameters, and used the Alphatross to provide <sup>4</sup>He<sup>--&nbsp; </sup>beams for several successful experiments, described in the following section.</p>\n<p>The new ion source is installed in place of the old ion source as planned. The installation was completed in October of 2019. First plasma ignition was achieved in the Alphatross on November 2019. The first production of 1 microamp of beam from the Alphatross, which is double the current reliably delivered from our old duoplasmatron source, was achieved in January 2020. Since that time we have optimized control parameters. To date, we have only achieved 1.4 microamp from the Alphatross, as compared to the 4 microamp promised by the manufacturer (National Electrostatics Corporation [NEC]). This is nonetheless ~3x our previous achievable current and at half the gas consumption rate. The new source also has a much shorter start-up time, which gains a couple of hours of beam-on-target time each time the source is started, which can be as frequently as every day. By September 2020, we had operated the source for roughly 1,000 hours, which is the promised maintenance interval from NEC, and found it was time for maintenance. The maintenance downtime was a few days, as expected. Since then, we have operated for an additional ~150 hours with the same high-quality source performance.</p>\n<p>One of the primary motivations for the Alphatross described in the original proposal was (&alpha;,n) cross section measurements of interest for astrophysics and applications. As proposed, we have embarked on an (&alpha;,n) measurement campaign, thus far measuring <sup>13</sup>C(&alpha;,n), <sup>27</sup>Al(&alpha;,n), <sup>65</sup>Cu(&alpha;,n), and <sup>96</sup>Zr(&alpha;,n). Results from these measurements are briefly described below.</p>\n<p>We measured <sup>13</sup>C(&alpha;,n) in the energy range of interest for geoneutrino backgrounds with our newly developed HeBGB detector. HeBGB has a near-constant neutron detection efficiency, avoiding the problems of the earlier measurement. Our results&nbsp; largely validate a theoretical correction applied to earlier experimental results. Remarkably, this validates the application of Hauser-Feshbach calculations to far lighter nuclides than typically thought viable. The Alphatross was key to the success of this measurement, due to the long-term stability required to obtain the hundreds of measurement points over more than 100 hours of continuous measurement.</p>\n<p>We measured the <sup>27</sup>Al(&alpha;,n) thick target yield from threshold to 7 MeV, of interest for supernova nucleosynthesis and fusion plasma diagnostics, with the HeBGB neutron detector. Again, the Alphatross was key. In this case, not only due to the stability, but also due to the higher intensity than our old source, which made the near-threshold measurements provide enough signal over background.</p>\n<p>We measured <sup>65</sup>Cu(&alpha;,n) using HeBGB from threshold to 8 MeV, of interest for isotope production and supernova nucleosynthesis. Our background near threshold (6.183 MeV &alpha; energy) is significant and it is not yet clear how close to threshold our data-set will provide useful yield information. Nonetheless, without the Alphatross we would not have even considered going for a measurement just above threshold.</p>\n<p>We measured <sup>96</sup>Zr(&alpha;,n) using the activation technique in the energy region of interest for isotope production and supernova nucleosynthesis. Nominally this region is well described by recent state-of-the-art reaction cross section calculations. However, we find that those theoretical calculations describe existing data poorly a few MeV above threshold. Furthermore, our measurement results are in significant disagreement at the highest common measurement energies (near 13 MeV), with somewhat better agreement near threshold. The Alphatross has enabled our <sup>96</sup>Zr(&alpha;,n) activation measurements by providing the steady beam current over long times that are essential to these measurements.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we have performed thin-films characterization using ion beam analysis for our collaborators in the college of engineering. This case consisted of perfomring Rutherford Scattering using helium ion beams produced by the Alphatross system. The fast start-up of the Alphatross relative to our old system has been highly beneficial, as ion-source warm-up previously dominated the measurement time.</p>\n<p>The project of installing, implementing, commissioning, and using the Alphatross system has resulted in valuable professional development for our graduate students at the Edwards Accelerator Laboratory. The majority of planning, design, and troubleshooting discussions have taken place in the weekly lab-wide meeting, which is attended by all laboratory members. Graduate students Kristyn Brandenburg, Yenuel Jones-Alberty, and Gula Hamad participated directly in the commissioning process by performing early tests and measurements with the Alphatross source.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/14/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Zach&nbsp;Meisel</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1827893/1827893_10575853_1607956898473_AlphatrossInEALSummary--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1827893/1827893_10575853_1607956898473_AlphatrossInEALSummary--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Alphatross in the Edwards Lab\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1827893/1827893_10575853_1607956898473_AlphatrossInEALSummary--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Alphatross in the Edwards Lab\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Alphatross system in the Edwards Accelerator Lab, including close-ups of the control software system and a video image of the ignited plasma.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Don Carter</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Zach&nbsp;Meisel</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Alphatross in the Edwards Lab</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1827893/1827893_10575853_1607957113201_ANwithAlphatrossSummary--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1827893/1827893_10575853_1607957113201_ANwithAlphatrossSummary--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"(alpha,n) measurements with the Alphatross\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1827893/1827893_10575853_1607957113201_ANwithAlphatrossSummary--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"(alpha,n) measurements with the Alphatross\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(&#945;,n)  measurements  enabled  by  the  Alphatross  system  at  EAL.
