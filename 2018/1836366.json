Participation in ICDCS and similar conferences is a valuable and important part of the graduate school experience. It provides students with the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers, and exposes students to leading work and practical industry practices in this important area of research.  The long-term merits of this program's impact on distributed computing research is well established. \r\n\r\nThe conference will be held in Vienna, Austria, July 2-5, will span four days and will consist of technical paper presentations, panels, industry presentations, posters, and demonstrations.  It will also feature keynote speeches from leading researchers and practitioners in the field.  \r\n\r\nFunds will be dispersed with preference given to students who would not otherwise be able to attend the conference and students who are not already scheduled to present a paper, paying particular attention to diversity and relevance of the student's research interest.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
