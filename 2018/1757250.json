 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will develop a general theory for how individuals use deceptive behavior for strategic advantage. The theory will prove a clearer foundation for a range of applications. Many issues in policy and law involve attempts to limit how people share information. For example, deception and fraud are central issues for consumer protection and business law. In other contexts, firms or governments may restrict the ability of their employees to share information with outside parties. Game theory has given us powerful insights on how people can use private information and deceptive behavior for strategic advantage, but the existing theories use inconsistent definitions and are not part of a single framework. The project will give us a better understanding of when deceptive behavior is damaging, how and when to punish unauthorized information sharing, and how the availability of detailed information about individuals will affect targeted persuasion attempts.  The project advances the progress of science in game theory, and the new theory will help us understand how to develop laws and policies that promote national goals.\r\n\r\nThe project includes four main components. First is a general program to clarify the foundations of strategic models of deception in a framework that is flexible enough to permit non-equilibrium behavior and costs associated with lying. The second is a model of persuasion in electoral competition . The third is a model of unauthorized sharing of information that investigates the costs and benefits of policies that punish individuals who share information. The fourth project proves the shared assumptions needed to rule out coordination failures in non-cooperative settings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\n Deception and fraud are central issues for consumer protection agencies.  The project develops a structure that can be used to structure policy discussions.  The rich game-theoretic literature provides powerful insights about how to use private information for strategic advantage, but it lacks clear and consistent definitions of some basic terms.  The intellectual merit of the project is that it provides basic definitions of lying and deception in a framework is flexible enough to permit non-equilibrium behavior and lying costs. \n \n \nThe  proposal investigates a structure that could be the foundation for policy discussions.  The potential impact is better understanding of when deceptive behavior is damaging and how to develop institutions and laws that leverage intrinsic preference for honesty to improve economic outcomes.  The main policy-relevant messages from the work and lying and deception are that the proper definition of deception depends on the context (what is known about the audience's preferences).  If less is known about preferences, then fewer practices will be deceptive.  Deception is possible in equilibrium. Rational agents can be deceived.  Deception is not inevitable.  Audiences can guard against deception.  Speakers can avoid making deceptive statements.  Ruling out deception may have negative consequences for both speakers and audiences.\n\n  Abstract game-theoretic analysis of strategic communication has two significant limitations.  First, the meaning of words is determined within the model.  This means that there is no reason that the words that are used in the model should correspond to words that are used in natural settings.  Second, non-communicative equilibria always exist.  That is, the models may identify the possibility of beneficial communication, but they do not explain when people will take advantage of the opportunity.   \nThe project provides conditions under which strategic communication is effective -- the audience learns something valuable from the speaker -- and in which the communication conforms to basic regularities in the use of natural language.  This analysis improves the link between theory and applications.  It has the broader implication of providing ways in which to preserve and enhance useful communication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/07/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joel Sobel"
