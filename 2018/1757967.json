 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU site, Nanotechnology REU with a Focus on Community Colleges at Rice University aims to broaden the participation of traditionally underrepresented students in STEM by providing research opportunities to local community college students in the area of nanotechnology, a cutting edge and rapidly progressing field that cuts across many disciplines and addresses well-recognized, real-world problems. Nanotechnology integrates the physical sciences and engineering with applications in medicine, energy, and the environment that are particularly appealing to recruit and retain college students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). Historically, economically disadvantaged and first generation students have an underrepresented presence in STEM.  Community colleges serve a high percentage of underrepresented groups and present a rich pool of future scientists and engineers. Undergraduate research can help build confidence and research skills and in turn, play a pivotal role in a student's decision to pursue graduate school or research careers. This REU Site aspires to integrate local community college students with an enriching and meaningful laboratory experience in a community of scholars with mentorship and support that will facilitate their transition and retention into a four-year university. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of this REU site are: 1) facilitate the development of engineering students from underrepresented groups and economically disadvantaged populations; 2) educate community college students about STEM research careers; 3) provide experiences in research laboratories while demonstrating the excitement of STEM careers; 4) build and maintain mentoring relationships with our participants; and 5) promote effective inter-institutional partnerships between Rice University and community colleges in the Texas Gulf Coast Region. The 10-week research experience will introduce students to research, applications, and education and career opportunities in nanotechnology in an inclusive culture. Students will interact with Rice faculty, post-doctoral and graduate student mentors and teaching staff who will be guiding them through program activities that include research methodology, oral and written presentations, networking, career webinars, and college transferring; along with local STEM industrial opportunities that will promote the dissemination of the program's impact into their communities. REU participants will present their research findings at the Smalley-Curl Nanotechnology Institute's Summer Research Colloquium. These program activities are designed to cultivate interest in STEM, provide skills and knowledge in conducting research and scientific thinking, and assimilate community college students in a university setting for a viable future in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
