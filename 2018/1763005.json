 "awd_abstract_narration": "The debilitating long-term consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI) caused by head impacts in sports or blast effects in war are now generally recognized as dangerous.  Even milder head impacts require patient monitoring, though for how long is not completely known.  To care for people with less obvious injuries and to measure whether a patient has healed, new approaches to brain imaging are needed.  This research is targeted at improving the prediction and monitoring of brain injuries.  A loss of white matter is one of the changes in brain tissue after injury. How the head impact is distributed as stress in the brain is not known, nor do we know the tolerance of brain cells to stress. This research project will use fast confocal microscopy and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques to develop and validate a multiscale mechanical model for brain white matter that can predict cell injury.  This validated model will be used to estimate axonal injury in the brain using impact models of the whole brain.  The research will be used in the education of undergraduate and graduate students.  The PI instituted the GirlsConnect club in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering to increase the participation and retention of women in this field.\r\n\r\nThis project will focus on identifying the injury thresholds for individual axons within white matter when the tissue is exposed to dynamic, mechanical stretch. This interdisciplinary research builds on the innovative experimental approaches to understand axon kinematics and novel multi-scale computational models of the collaborative team to introduce: (i) Analysis of axon-level displacements and sub-failure axonal damage following clinically-relevant, dynamic loading of white matter; (ii) Computational incorporation of the composite mechanics of axon and glial matrix interaction, including damage, into the global (macro) response of the white matter following tissue-scale loading; (iii) Quantitative prediction of stress concentrations at the axon-level from the computational models; and (iv) Integration of clinical imaging (MRI and Magnetic Resonance Elastography) and subsequent histopathology and correlation of mechanical properties to axonal damage. The multi-scale model will enable the prediction of changes in bulk mechanical properties from damage to the axonal microstructure and from myelin degeneration. It is anticipated that this model can be easily integrated into advanced imaging modalities to predict and monitor brain injury and disease.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This includes evaluating how stress and strain are transferred to individual components of neural tissue; the tolerance before physical and/or functional damage occurs; and how this damage can exacerbate further physical and/or functional damage in the tissue. This information is vital for identifying the circumstances that cause both mild-traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and TBI. This study aims to quantitatively predict the viscoelastic material properties and consequently damage in brain white matter (BWM). A finite element (FE) based fractional viscoelastic model characterizing the time dependent behavior of the axons in BWM has been developed. Unit cells &nbsp;of hexagonally packed axons in glia are modeled and subjected to a quasi-static displacement boundary condition. Homogenized orthotropic fractional material properties of the composite are extracted by solving the inverse problem. The results from these simulations predict that the homogenized structure becomes stiffer and more viscous with higher volume fractions. The variation, however, is not linear. This observation is especially important when viewed in relation to current MRI-based evidence relating changes in volume fraction during neurodegenerative processes such as aging which predicts a linear variation.</p>\n<p>Considering the fact these simulations are compute-intensive, a computationally efficient scheme has been developed by formulating an efficient method to store and retrieve the response history of the material, deploying different compiler optimization methods for the material subroutines, improving the subroutines&rsquo; memory handling, and performing loop-level optimization with OpenMP for Fortran subroutines and domain-level&nbsp;parallelization in Abaqus.

One of the major issues that impede the development of therapies is the fact that it is challenging to diagnose TBI.

Additional urgency for diagnostic tools is based on the fact that patients have a life expectancy of less than ten years after a TBI. The development of diagnostic and prognostic tools to identify these patients will allow for proper treatment and the development of therapies that will allow them to have a better quality of life and to function better in society. Furthermore, early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention could increase life expectancy after TBI.
