 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many important reactions in Chemistry, from industrial processes (battery operation, electrochemical plating of metal films) to the function of biological systems (photosynthesis, cell respiration) involve charged species known as ions dissolved in water solutions. The interactions between these ions and water molecules at the atomic and molecular level determine the rate at which they move in solution and their reactivity, which affect the outcomes and efficiency of the chemistry involved. Because of the complexity of ion interactions with the many solvent molecules in solution, it is difficult to understand these processes to optimize them or to predict the effects of changing conditions such as concentration or temperature. In this project funded by the Chemical Structure Dynamics and Mechanism (CSDM-A) program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Michael Duncan addresses these challenges using new techniques to make and study small molecular assemblies known as \"clusters\" containing individual ions imbedded in a few solvent molecules of water. The composition of these clusters is controlled by selecting ions attached to a specific number of water molecules using a mass spectrometer. The structure of these ions and the solvent network surrounding them is determined by measuring the distinctive patterns of infrared light that the clusters absorb. Studies on clusters containing a single water molecule up to dozens or more allow systematic investigation of the initial solvent organization around the ion and the eventual development of the full complexity of the liquid solution. Additionally, the work trains students in the design and operation of vacuum systems and mass spectrometers, as well as optical experiments using lasers. A partnership with a minority faculty member at Emory University facilitates the recruitment of minority students.\r\n\r\nThe project investigates cation-solvent clusters in which the charge carrier is either a protonated molecular species (e.g., protonated acetylene or CO2) or a transition metal atom, and the solvent is usually water. M+(H2O)n complexes are produced by pulsed laser ablation, whereas protonated ions are produced in a pulsed discharge. The ions are cooled via supersonic expansion in a molecular beam, mass-analyzed and selected with a time-of-flight spectrometer, and studied with infrared laser photodissociation spectroscopy. The measured vibrational patterns are compared to those predicted by computational chemistry for different isomeric configurations to determine the structures of these clusters and how this changes with the number of solvent molecules present. The performance of anharmonic vibrational theory methods is also evaluated. Ion photofragment imaging experiments investigate the bonding energetics and charge transfer processes in these systems. The molecular level understanding of ion solvation is a universal challenge for Chemistry and Biology. The structures of molecular ions and how they respond to solvation represent severe obstacles for present levels of theory. Benchmark data from our experiments are of value to computational researchers as they validate and refine their high-level anharmonic theory methods.  The results from the Duncan laboratory may also influence molecular dynamics simulations of solutions or their interfaces. Small protonated ions are also interesting for interstellar chemistry; data can guide higher resolution measurements needed for interstellar ion identification and suggest new ions for consideration.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIon solvation processes are found throughout Chemistry and Biology, occurring in acid-base chemistry, electrochemistry, catalysis, photosynthesis, etc.  In all of these situations, a molecular-level understanding of the chemistry that takes place when a metal or protonated ion binds to small molecules is needed to facilitate simulations and computer models of these more complex processes.  However, this is difficult to obtain in the hopelessly convoluted environment in solution, where bonding configurations change rapidly and many solvent molecules mediate the chemistry.  Our research program investigates individual solvated ions, which form the basis of these processes, in the simplified environment of a molecular beam.  The experiments produce the ions in a vacuum, use a mass spectrometer to select and identify their composition, and use infrared laser spectroscopy complemented by computational chemistry to determine their structures.  With these methods, the solvent or reaction partners can first be eliminated, and then systematically re-introduced one molecule at a time to probe solvated structures and how they change with their environment.  Metal containing ions, consisting of a charged metal atom interacting with one or more ligand or solvent molecules, i.e., M+(L)n, are investigated at the molecular level.  Closely related to the metal ions are protonated molecular species of the form H+(L)n  These model systems provide snapshots of molecular configurations involved in reactions or solvation and challenging benchmark systems for theory.\n\nThese measurements are conceptually simple, but their implementation and interpretation are technically demanding.  The isolation and selection of ions in a mass spectrometer provides their compositions, but necessitates that their concentrations are extremely low.  Successful experiments require optimized sources to produce and cool the ions, mass spectrometer designs to preserve their concentrations, and ultra-sensitive laser methods to measure their infrared spectroscopy.  Likewise, the spectral patterns for the exotic ions of interest are intrinsically complex, requiring state-of-the-art anharmonic theory for their interpretation.  We used second-order vibrational perturbation theory (VPT2) computations and also local mode calculations together with collaborator Prof. Anne McCoy (U. of Washington).  To enhance the available information, we have expanded the range of infrared wavelengths for these experiments to the near-IR to probe overtone and combination vibrations. We have also designed, constructed and implemented a new kind of photofragment imaging instrument to investigate the decomposition pathways and bonding energetics of these ions.\n\nThese experimental and computational methods have been applied to several kinds of metal ion-molecular complexes, with systematic variation of structural, composition, and chemical qualities.  Metal ions such as V+, Zn+ or Co+ interacting with one or more water molecules provided the coordination number of solvent molecules around a central ion and the nature of hydrogen bonding networks extending outward from the charged center.  Similar experiments investigated metal ion-methanol solvation.  Metal ions such as Ag+ interacting with more complex aromatic molecules investigated the role of cation-&pi; interactions in solvation and catalysis.  Protonated ions such as H+(H2)n, H+(O2)n, H+(HCl)n or H+(CO)n are essential components of interstellar gas clouds, and their weakly bound complexes are believed to play a leading role in astrochemistry.  Their infrared spectra elucidated the structures that form and the infrared signatures that might be used to identify these species in space.  Proton motion is a critical component of energy transfer processes in biology, and the complex vibrational patterns of these species reveal the potential energy surfaces that mediate proton transfer.\n\nFive graduate students, one postdoctoral research associate, and four undergraduate research students participated in this research, learning the chemistry, technology and culture of science through this work.  They each presented different aspects of the work at conferences and were included as co-authors on the resulting publications.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael A Duncan"
