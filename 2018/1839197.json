 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum science and technology promises realization of powerful quantum computational resource, a\r\nquantum cloud. While the exact implementation of quantum processing nodes and qubits to be used in\r\nsuch networks are still the topic of research and debate, the information between the nodes will surely be\r\ncarried by photons. Therefore, interfacing different types of qubits with photons at telecommunication wavelengths is critical for realization of scalable distributed quantum computational systems. This can lead to realization of high-speed electro-optic modulators and microwave photonics\r\nsystems that will find applications in classical and quantum optical networks, as well as the study of\r\ninteresting and emerging physical phenomena including gauge field for photons, topological photonics,\r\nstrongly-coupled quantum systems and so on.  This program is focused on superconducting quantum technology, a leading quantum computing platform, that faces a challenge: efficient transfer of quantum information encoded into microwave photons over large distances.\r\nThe program will provide a unique training ground for involved students and help train a\r\nnew generation of quantum engineers and scientists.\r\n\r\nTechnical: The goal of the proposed program is to achieve low-noise microwave-to-optical photon conversion with unity efficiency, and then leverage this to demonstrate quantum state transfer between superconducting qubit and a telecom photon. Superconducting qubit will be used as an on-demand source of microwave photons, by leveraging quantum interference effects. The qubit will be strongly coupled to a microwave resonator realized in few-atomic-layer superconducting films that exhibit unique microwave-plasmonic properties. These include low dissipation, high nonlinearity, and exceptionally high kinetic inductance, resulting in extraordinarily slow signal propagation. This will enable realization of compact microwave resonators that allow for strong coupling to a qubit on one end, and that match the dimensions of the optical circuits on the other end. Microwave-to-optical photon conversion will be based on the electrooptics approach using ultra low loss integrated lithium-niobate platform. The process will be enhanced by using triply resonant geometry that combines two optical and one microwave resonator.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
