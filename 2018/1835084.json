The CDM conference is jointly sponsored by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The purpose of the conference is to provide a forum for the latest significant theories and research developments in various branches of advanced mathematics.\r\n \r\nTopics presented by prominent speakers include a diverse variety of mathematical research including differential geometry, topology, number theory, algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, stochastic analysis, algebraic combinatorics, Hodge theory, geometric analysis, probability theory, and symplectic geometry. More information can be found at the conference website: www.math.harvard.edu/cdm\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
