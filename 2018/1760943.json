 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports fundamental research to establish a design methodology for composite structures by taking advantage of Kirigami cutting principles and snap-through multi-stability.  Composite structures combine multiple materials to achieve desirable properties and are vital for many engineering systems. Snap-through multi-stable structures can quickly transition from one stable state to another. They can bear weight and perform other functions such as shape morphing, vibration control, and energy harvesting.  However, the current-state-of-art in multi-stable composites is limited in terms of the achievable shapes and functionalities.  This research uses Kirigami cutting principles to fundamentally expand the performance space of multi-stable composites. The design methodology synergizes with advanced layer-by-layer manufacturing technology, enabling a two-dimensional build to transform into a complex three-dimensional structure through the optimal design of fiber ply properties and Kirigami-inspired cutting patterns. This will lead to novel structural designs that offer sophisticated functionalities, such as shape reconfiguration and on-demand mechanical property programming. These structures can benefit a number of industries, including aerospace, automotive, and robotics, by enhancing system performance and sustainability.  This award will also support efforts to enhance educational activities at Clemson University and nearby communities in South Carolina. Research results will be used in existing outreach networks like Clemson EMAG!NE to inspire the public via combining engineering and the art of Kirigami paper cutting.\r\n\r\nThis research will, for the first time, systematically incorporate the Kirigami cutting principle in an engineering-relevant optimal design framework.  It is expected to create significant leaps in adaptive composites, Kirigami applications, and multi-level, multi-objective design optimization.  The research goals will be achieved by 1) deriving mathematical linkages between design variables and performance outputs via a new reduced-order mechanics model using F?ppl-von K?rm?n (FvK) shell theory and customized shape functions; 2) developing practical design guidelines and constraints via extensive experimental testing; and 3) deriving multi-disciplinary synthesis method based on bi-level optimization.  Results of the three tasks will be integrated into the design framework.  Throughout the course of this project, the research team will address many technical challenges with broad relevance, including the complex non-free boundaries between composite patches, fabrication uncertainties, and robustness in multi-level design optimization.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
