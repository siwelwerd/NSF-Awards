 "awd_abstract_narration": "Surveying, also called geomatics, has been traditionally defined as the science, art, and technology of determining the relative positions of points above, on, or beneath the Earth's surface. Recent technological advances in such areas as Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Global Positioning Systems (GPS) have provided surveyors with new tools for doing this work. In addition, environmental measuring and monitoring is increasingly critical as the population grows, land values appreciate, natural resources decrease, and stresses degrade the quality of our land, water, and air. Surveying and mapping technicians, or geospatial engineering technicians, are a critical part of the geomatics workforce that will provide these critical measurements.  This project focuses on developing robust career pathways and academic programs to educate land surveying and/or geospatial engineering technicians.\r\n\r\nThis project will: 1) develop an academic transfer pathway program to provide a career and technical education (CTE) that enables secondary school and community college students to properly use advanced forms of field equipment and software for land surveying and/or geospatial engineering applications; and 2) assist land surveying and/or geospatial engineering technicians to successfully pass the State of California examinations. High school boot camps and a \"land surveying-CAD bash\" event at four primarily Hispanic secondary schools will recruit students into the program.  In addition, a career opportunity internship pipeline will be formalized with the City of Los Angeles, Bureau of Engineering, Surveying Division's volunteer program. This career opportunity internship pipeline is expected to increase the numbers of female and Hispanic surveying and/or geospatial engineering technicians entering the work force.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In addition, we assisted project participants with face-to-face and online courses in land surveying with an emphasis on using advanced geo-spatial technologies. These tools consisted of survey field equipment and land development software types from Bentley. Finally, the project provided students with employment opportunities, paid for by the City of Los Angeles (COLA) Surveying Division, and volunteer internship opportunities in surveying with the County of Los Angeles Department of Public Works (LACDPW). Rosie Chin and Steve Hennessee from COLA and LACDPW respectively were key public officials that helped establish employment opportunities for this project.</p>\n<p>During the project&rsquo;s first year, we trained over 100 students with field and office techniques traditionally used in land surveying. Basic field activities consisted of pace rates and the usage of leveling tools. Office work consisted of basic drafting skills with an introduction to scaling laws. Many of the students were from STEAM Legacy and Roosevelt Magnet High School with a small number coming from ELAC&rsquo;s MESA program. Career presentations regarding academic pathways in land surveying were also provided to the students during this time. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>During the project&rsquo;s second year, we offered free PLS and FS preparatory workshops and an outreach land surveying conference for K-14 students, all face-to-face. The outreach event was in conjunction with Cal Poly Pomona&rsquo;s (CPP) Geospatial Engineering conference. The conference was sponsored by the California Land Surveyors Association (CLSA), Los Angeles Chapter. During this time, several of our students landed jobs with COLA (x2) and or were accepted to CPP&rsquo;s civil engineering (CE) program (x2). Dr. Omar Mora from CPP was instrumental in developing articulation agreements for transfer from ELAC to CPPs geospatial program in civil engineering. He also developed articulation agreements between Fresno State and Oregon Institute of Technology (OIE). Dr. Mora was key in mapping out academic pathways starting from secondary schools as well. All activities took place during the fall 2019 college semester, as a result, the project was able to provide face-to-face events since pandemic restrictions were not being enforced yet.</p>\n<p>The project&rsquo;s third year focused on providing students opportunities to showcase their skill sets in land surveying through independent studies. These activities consisted mostly of hands-on field techniques using state of the art surveying equipment. The students used mobile devices and 3D scanners to generate virtual models of buildings, and a total station to complete a boundary survey of ELAC&rsquo;s property. One student was also hired to produce a technical manual that showed land surveying students how to use river surveys for hydraulic modeling purposes. The third year was instrumental for the team since it forced us to learn how to provide online services because of the pandemic. During this time, we trained over 60 students how to use online drafting tools using Bentley software. Student participants were composed from secondary, community and transfer schools. We had several work-force participants from different public and private agencies enroll as well. Students were taught how to use Bentley software products such as open roads, concept station, Lumen RT, and others.</p>\n<p>Finally, the no-cost fourth year period consisted of providing a land surveying summer program at a middle school. The project offered land surveying and drafting techniques at Ellen Ochoa Animo middle school. Over 20 students were provided with skill sets in land surveying using field and office techniques. We also launched online PLS and FS preparatory workshops during the project&rsquo;s 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> year reign. Finally, a summer transfer program was provided for all Los Angeles Community College District (LACCD) STEM students to participate in. In addition, several of the independent study projects were selected to present their work online at the California Spatial Reference Center (CSRC) annual meeting.</p>\n<p>Overall, the project was filled with amazing student accomplishments and many lessons learned. At the peak of the pandemic, the project team members did not give up in providing CTE services in land surveying. There is still plenty of work to be done to help increase the number of students interested in becoming PLS&rsquo;s. The PI feels humbled and is filled with gratitude to have served as principal investigator for this project.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/17/2024<br>\nModified by: Humberto&nbsp;Gallegos</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1801188/1801188_10546829_1710660221907_IMG_3350--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1801188/1801188_10546829_1710660221907_IMG_3350--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"ELAC's 2019 Land Surveying Conference for K-12\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1801188/1801188_10546829_1710660221907_IMG_3350--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"ELAC's 2019 Land Surveying Conference for K-12\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Student participants during ELAC's Fall 2019 Land Surveying Conference</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">ELAC E&T Faculty</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Humberto&nbsp;Gallegos\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">ELAC's 2019 Land Surveying Conference for K-12</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1801188/1801188_10546829_1710659950786_EOA_MS--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1801188/1801188_10546829_1710659950786_EOA_MS--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"ELAC's Middle School Summer Program in Land Surveying\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1801188/1801188_10546829_1710659950786_EOA_MS--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"ELAC's Middle School Summer Program in Land Surveying\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Student participants from Ellen Ochoa Animo Middle School, Land Surveying Summer Program</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">EOA Administrators</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Humberto&nbsp;Gallegos\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">ELAC's Middle School Summer Program in Land Surveying</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1801188/1801188_10546829_1710660511065_secondary_school--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1801188/1801188_10546829_1710660511065_secondary_school--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"ELAC's 2019 Land Surveying Conference for K-12\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1801188/1801188_10546829_1710660511065_secondary_school--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"ELAC's 2019 Land Surveying Conference for K-12\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Secondary school students participants during ELAC's Fall 2019 Land Surveying Conference</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">ELAC E&T Faculty</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Humberto&nbsp;Gallegos\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">ELAC's 2019 Land Surveying Conference for K-12</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
