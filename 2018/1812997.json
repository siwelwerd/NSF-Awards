 "awd_abstract_narration": "As an emerging field, data science has the potential to broaden participation of minorities in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) by offering multiple career pathways that span a variety of fields. Growth in the availability of large environmental datasets has also resulted in the need for a diverse workforce with technical data science skills. A variety of organizations support individuals currently underrepresented in STEM that are interested in entering data science careers through training, mentoring, and networking opportunities. However, many of these initiatives have been developed in isolation, limiting opportunities for an exchange of ideas and lessons learned. The Battelle Memorial Institute and its partners will host a 3-day conference to strengthen initiatives across organizations to recruit and retain individuals from underrepresented groups in data science careers. Conference attendees (with selected allied representatives from NSF INCLUDES Design and Development Launch Pilots) will be comprised of academic, training, and business partners that offer training and career opportunities in the data sciences; project leaders conducting research on recruitment and retention of underrepresented groups in this and related fields; employers who have an interest in hiring and retaining a diverse data science workforce; and individuals with experience in mentoring interns and early career professionals in research and technical positions. The products of the conference will include a conference proceedings report; specific recommendations for filling the gaps in understanding the multiple career pathways of underrepresented groups in data-intensive environmental science careers; and a strategy for continued development and expansion of a collaborative community focused on increasing workforce diversity in the data sciences.\r\n\r\nThe Conversation IDEaS (Conversations on Inclusion in Data Science for Ecological and Environmental Sciences) Conference will be a 3-day conference with the ultimate goal of developing a networked improvement community (i.e., Environmental Data Sciences Inclusion Network) that strengthens initiatives across existing alliances and organizations to recruit and retain individuals from underrepresented groups in data science careers. By establishing connections between existing organizations and alliances that are working towards a common goal, this conference will build their capacity to provide opportunities and remove barriers for underrepresented groups. Making special efforts to bring in collaborators that may not currently be known as potential stakeholders in these conversations will broaden the network's impact. The conference will be structured around three primary components of potential career pathways (awareness/recruitment, training, and retention/mentoring) at each of three possible entry points (K-12, higher education, career change/advancement).  The conference activities will be designed to address the following questions relevant to each day: (1) what is the problem we are trying to solve?; (2) what expertise is needed to solve the problem?; and (3) how might our network be structured to support our work? The products of the conference will include a conference proceedings report; specific recommendations to the INCLUDES network for filling the gaps in our understanding of the multiple career pathways of underrepresented groups in data-intensive ecological and environmental data science careers; and a strategy for continued development and expansion of the networked improvement community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
