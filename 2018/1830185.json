 "awd_abstract_narration": "The workshop will focus on the processes that are needed to link multiple interventions and work at different institutional levels to accomplish systemic and cultural changes that become embedded in the values, norms, and behaviors of faculty working in institutions of higher education. Drawing on the experience of past NSF ADVANCE grantees the workshop will document the structural processes that facilitated the institutional change within ADVANCE institutions.  This project will document this important aspect of learning that past NSF ADVANCE grantees have accumulated through many years of experience.  This information will be shared broadly with others interested in pursuing organizational change.\r\n\r\nThe workshop complements prior work by the PIs on the web-based StratEGIC Toolkit which provides text and video resources describing specific interventions of past NSF ADVANCE grantees.  The toolkit helps organizational leaders decide what to include in an institutional change effort to enhance STEM faculty gender equity. This workshop will focus on issues of process that the past NSF ADVANCE grantees have identified as critical for achieving change goals.  Preliminary information suggests that processes such as constructing a diverse leadership team, planning and delivering strategic communication, and leveraging multiple change interventions are all strategies that facilitate systemic change.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
