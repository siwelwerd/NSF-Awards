 "awd_abstract_narration": "Personalized learning applications can guide students for achievement that connects a broad partnership ecosystem and links students with work-based learning experiences. The proposed conference titled \"Broadening Participation in Computer Science: Using Technology to Accelerate Collective Impact\" will bring together regional constituents in order to share early project results.  This work will be used to develop, unite and leverage the partners and stakeholders necessary to scale students' engagement into computing as well as align the interests of the regional invitees from corporations, foundations, educational institutions, government, and non-profits. Conference attendees will all receive a conference final report summarizing the key findings from each conference session in order to help them make improvements in the intentionality of their programs, partnerships and resources.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
