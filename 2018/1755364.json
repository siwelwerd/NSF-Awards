 "awd_abstract_narration": "All living cells have polarity (e.g. front-back, top-bottom) which is absolutely essential for their normal function.  For example, epithelial cells generate \"inside\" and \"outside\" barriers and embryonic cell polarity is required for cells to make important decisions on what they are going to give rise to in adult forms.  Recent work has shown that many of the same molecules are used in both epithelial and embryonic cell polarity.  This grant uses both comparative and functional genomics in animals with simple body plans to discover how these molecules are deployed to give rise to normal functioning tissues.  By inhibiting their normal molecular interactions these findings will have important implications for how normal adult organs function (e.g. gut, heart, lung) and how disruptions/mutations in these processes give rise to birth defects.  The research plan has other broader impacts such as demonstrating that many different kinds of animals and techniques are useful for understanding how life \"works\" and that local community members, including over 5,000 K-12 STEM students per year, will be exposed to the value of the maintaining coastal marine environments surrounding the Whitney Lab for Marine Bioscience that provide homes for the animals utilized for this research.\r\n\r\nThis project tests the hypothesis that fundamental changes in the spatial deployment and interactions of molecules underlying both cellular and tissue polarity were essential for animal organ and body plan evolution. Recent discoveries showing crucial differences in the deployment of Par, cWnt, and PCP Wnt signaling pathways in embryos of the cnidarian Nematostellla vectensis relative to bilaterian species suggest that the site of gastrulation (endomesoderm formation), changed from the animal pole in ctenophores and cnidarians (i.e. \"prebilaterians\") to the vegetal pole in bilaterians.  Furthermore, changes in the gene regulatory network that give rise to the trifunctional endomesoderm in cnidarians were responsible for the formation of distinct endodermal and mesodermal tissue types.  Comparative and forward functional genomic approaches (including transgenesis, mRNA misexpression and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing) utilizing embryos of the acoel flatworm Hofstenia miamia (a member of the earliest branching clade of triploblastic bilaterians), and the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi (a metazoan clade predating the origin of cnidarians + bilaterians), both available year round at the Whitney Marine Lab, will be used to determine the sequence of molecular changes responsible for bilaterian evolutionary innovations. These studies will determine the integration between cell signaling, the cytoskeleton, and cell adhesion systems in the regulation of cell polarity during the developmental process of these two species.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to use comparative and functional genomic  approaches to understand the molecular basis and evolution of embryonic cell polarity in all animals.  Our work leverages the favorable properties of different  early branching metazoan lineages, ctenophores (comb jellies) and two species of cnidarian (sea anemones, and true \"jellyfish).  We developed new reagents and experimental  approaches to understanding the interactions between different developmental  pathways in these new species. \n\nOne transformational result that we literally \"stumbled\" over was a way to interfere with gene expression in both developing ctenophores (comb jellies) as well as regenerating adults.  This was accomplished soaking embryos and adults of the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leiydi  in specific antisense small hairpin RNA molecules which hybridize with and enzymatically destroy targeted messenger RNAs inside of cells at any stage of their life cycle.  This will allow a high throughput dissection of both development and regeneration in these animals.  This is the first demonstration of targeted gene knockdowns in this group of animals and will allow us to generate gene regulatory networks for both development and adult regeneration in these animals. We will use this information to learn why some animals are capable of total body regeneration while others (like human beings) can not.\n\nIn addition, we have used the sequenced genome of the starlet sea anemone (Nematostella vectensis) to identofy all members of botht he cannonical Wnt signaling pathway as well as the PCP Wnt signaling pathway.  We have identified the major ligands and receptors for both of these pathways and showed how they interact with one another to generate organismal polarity (called the oral-aboral axis).  One of these pathways is involved in telling cells who they are going to be when they grow up (cell specification), while the other controls cell behavior and morphogenesis.\n\nFinally, we have developed some important new reagents and for the study of an understudied new model system, the 'upside down' jellyfish Cassiopea xamachana .  We have used the sequenced genome to identify important groups of genes, including Hox genes, study their expression patterns (by whole mount in situ hybridization) and how to microinject uncleaved zygotes for future functional interference of important embryonic patterning circuits.\n\nIn summary, modern molecular tools and approaches can now be used on a much wider variety of different kinds of animals than ever before.
