 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project proposes a workshop to investigate the impact of domestic engineering doctorates, especially from underrepresented groups, through PhD program that allow part-time students working in industry. Anecdotal evidence suggests that part-time students take significantly longer to complete their dissertations and limited research suggests that this is due to a lack of support and adequate planning by the students. \r\n The workshop is to be held at the University of Massachusetts and will be divided into three parts, which will include data sharing, presentations, and brainstorming among the participants. Participants include administrators from Programs with large part-time programs including several prominent HBCUs such as Howard, Maryland at Baltimore County, North Carolina A&T, Morgan State, and Prairie View A&M. As doctoral student populations have significantly higher proportions of underrepresented students when compared to full-time populations, and institutions with large part-time  doctoral populations are located across the country, this project has the potential for far-reaching  impact. The initial workshop seeks to bring stakeholders together, collect data on part-time doctoral programs, and design a program of support for part-time doctoral students for subsequent evaluation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe NSF funded project ?Workshop for Evaluating Part-Time Doctoral Study for Growing the Underrepresented Student Population? included a pre-workshop assessment, workshop implementation, a post-workshop assessment and a plan for next steps with workshop participants. The purpose of the workshop was to gather information and ideas to develop a plan for growing part-time engineering doctoral student populations, especially those from underrepresented groups.\n\n The literature, which is dominated by studies of full-time doctoral students, notes that barriers to part-time student success in doctoral programs are both academic and social.  The academic barriers include inflexible program structures, lack of access to support, lack of student preparation, and students? perception that degree attainment as not being valuable.  Social barriers include limited peer support and interaction, lack of relationship building with faculty, and external family obligations.\n\n Twenty universities from 15 different states participated in a pre-workshop survey with a total of sixteen universities participating in the workshop.  From the survey, 90% of the participants reported that their university does not use a cohort model for part-time doctoral students.  This was the most salient idea gleaned from the workshop. In addition, ideas were brainstormed on addressing industry/work conflicts, scheduling, faculty/student relationships, research/work topic interactions, peer connections, and measuring success.\n\n The analysis of the participating institutions provided motivation for this, and subsequent, work: For each category (Caucasian, Students of Color, and Unknown) of student (see Figure 1), the part-time doctoral students outnumber the full-time students.  Thus, at many schools, addressing the needs of part-time doctoral students may help in increasing the domestic, part-time population. This in turn may help increase those students from underrepresented groups.\n\nWith this information and motivation, the workshop concluded that a cohort modelfor part-time doctoral students may have great potential to improve their experiences, and thus, outcomes with regards to retention and graduation.  In addition, actions to be pursued must consider academic and social barriers; faculty should be trained on advising part-time students; flexibility should be built into the structure of programs; and there is an opportunity to recruit and retain underrepresented students in part-time doctoral programs of engineering.  These suggestions are to be pursued in a follow-on study with the participating institutions.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/04/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joseph C Hartman"
