 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research seeks to improve our understanding of the processes occurring within severe \"supercell\" thunderstorms that control the development of near-surface vertical vorticity (or \"spin\"), possible intensification to tornado strength, and the evolution thereafter.  This project targets two aspects of supercell storms that are notoriously difficult to simulate and observe: (1) the influence of the buoyancy field and its horizontal gradients and (2) the influence of the underlying surface.  The observational and numerical modeling methods are innovative and have the potential to be transformative, not only in the severe storms community, but in other scientific communities as well.  This work will address a long-standing, critical need in the severe storms community, obtaining fine-scale 3D thermodynamic observations within storms? The PIs will also develop a permanent exhibit at a local, non-profit museum educating the public on severe storms, which will be a valuable contribution to the community. Historically, the PIs have been involved in a broad range of outreach activities, including K-12 and public education, the participation as science advisors for government groups and media, and publishing articles accessible to a broad audience. \r\n\r\nThe PIs plan to undertake the following tasks: 1) sample supercell storms using pseudo-Lagrangian drifters and 2) use improved turbulence methods to study frictionally generated vorticity; both approaches are novel and creative.  The use of pseudo-Lagrangian drifters to observe the 3D structure of the boundary layer surrounding and within supercells, capable of obtaining observations within the most dangerous and critical parts of the storm with minimal safety risks to the observer, is novel.   This new observational tool will be used to obtain quasi-Lagrangian observations of wind and thermodynamic characteristics in the boundary layer extending into the core of the supercell, including in the cold pools which have been shown to be critical in developing sufficient near surface streamwise vorticity for tornadogenesis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur project had two main goals: (1) to use dozens of small, lightweight, balloon-borne sensors to probe temperature within supercell thunderstorms (rotating storms with high tornado potential) in order to better assess key forces understood to play a role in tornado formation; (2) to improve how the influence of the ground on the overlying airflow in tornadoes and their parent thunderstorms is represented in computer simulations, in order to better understand how the ground might influence storms and tornado formation.\n\nRegarding the first goal, we successfully launched swarms of balloon-borne sensors into three tornado-producing (i.e., tornadic) supercell thunderstorms and one nontornadic supercell thunderstorm.  In each of these four storms, 30&ndash;90 probes were flown through critical regions of the storms.  The data led to the first-ever three-dimensional mappings of temperature from in-situ observations within supercell storm.  Temperature has a strong influence on the buoyancy of air, and horizontal variations of buoyancy generate spin about a horizontal axis.  In supercell storms, horizontally oriented spin can be tipped into the vertical and amplified when there are certain arrangements of ascending and descending airstreams. Unfortunately, the long-standing lack of temperature observations has hampered scientists\u2019 ability to evaluate computer simulations and the tornadogenesis theories derived from them. We found that significant spin could be generated by the horizontal buoyancy variations that were sampled by our sensors.\n\nRegarding the second goal, friction between the wind and the ground can influence atmospheric phenomena in important ways.  For example, surface friction can be a significant source of rotation in some thunderstorms, and it can also help to intensify rotation when rotation is already present.  Unfortunately, the representation of friction\u2019s effects in atmospheric computer simulations is especially error-prone in phenomena characterized by rapid evolution or strong horizontal variations of wind, temperature, etc., both of which are common in thunderstorms.  Our research was motivated by these limitations, and we explored techniques that would be applicable in high-resolution simulations of storms and tornadoes, even in the presence of rapid evolution and sharp horizontal variations.  Overall, the tornadoes simulated with the more sophisticated representation of the ground\u2019s influence had stronger peak wind gusts, implying that past simulations using simpler representations of the ground\u2019s influence might have underestimated these gusts.\n\nAlthough it was not one of the original project goals, an ancillary high-resolution computer simulation study of tornado predictability was performed as part of this NSF-funded project.  Twenty-five supercell storms were simulated in environments that were identical except for small, random variations in temperature and wind typical of the real atmosphere.  The environments overall were extremely favorable for tornadoes (e.g., the lower atmosphere was quite warm and humid; winds increased rapidly with height and temperatures decreased rapidly with height).  However, the timing of tornado formation varied considerably from storm to storm, as did tornado duration and intensity (the intensity ranged from EF0 to EF3 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale), despite the environments being statistically identical.  The results imply that there are significant intrinsic limits to predicting the specific timing and intensity of tornadoes, even though today\u2019s forecasters have been extremely successful at predicting overall tornado threat on spatial scales larger than the scale of individual thunderstorms.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/18/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul M Markowski"
