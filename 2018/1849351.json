 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems, SenSys, is a highly selective scientific forum sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).  It has successfully created fundamental knowledge and technologies to build sensors and smart systems, from wireless sensors in homes and offices to large-scale sensors, networks, and data analytics in smart infrastructures and cities. The conference brings together researchers from the fields of wireless communication and networking, embedded systems and hardware, energy harvesting and management, distributed systems and algorithms, data management, and applications, and is an ideal venue for beginning researchers and PhD students to be introduced to the field from disciplinary and cross-disciplinary perspectives. The goal of this project is to provide funding for attending SenSys 2018 by PhD students who are enrolled in US institutions of higher learning. The project will enable students who are not well-funded or who belong to underrepresented groups to attend SenSys. The students will not only gain exposure to the leading researchers in the field but also network with peers and start research collaborations as they take leadership roles in research.\r\n\r\nThis project will enable approximately 15 Ph.D. students from a diverse group of US institution of higher education to attend SenSys 2018. A grant selection committee will select the participants based on their financial need, research potential, and their ability to benefit from this attendance while increasing diversity among SenSys attendees. SenSys and the field of sensing and smart systems will benefit from this increased diversity and engagement from the US-based PhD students. The students will benefit from exposure to the leading researchers in the field and with increased networking and collaboration opportunities at SenSys.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
