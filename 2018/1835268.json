 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brain science will benefit from the capabilities in tracing complex animal behaviors down to ensembles of individual neurons, and moreover establishing a real-time closed-loop brain-interface, ideally with deep brain access in a free-moving animal. This research project aims to address the focus areas in this National Science Foundation program by merging novel neurotechnology, evaluation of neural circuits during performance of complex cognitive behaviors, and large-scale neuron ensemble analysis and closed-loop behavioral control. The outcome of this research will result in new technologies and computational tools that can be used across the field of neuroscience and behavior, strengthening research efforts of multiple research groups. The educational objectives of this proposal are aimed at training and inspiring young engineers and scientists who are equipped with the multidisciplinary background required to help define the future trajectory of brain interfaces and data sciences. The broader impacts of this project include: 1) advancing transformative device technologies for next-generation neurotechnology and providing new and more powerful tools for neuroscience studies, 2) educating underrepresented undergraduate and graduate researchers to contribute to the nation's workforce needs in biotechnology, 3) contributing to the K-12 science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education through weekend seminars and mentoring student-teacher pairs from local middle/high schools; and 4) promoting neuroscience and neurotechnology among local senior citizens and support groups for neurological diseases.  \r\n\r\nThe research objective of this proposal is to combine high precision optoelectronic neural probes with real-time neural decoding to feedback optogenetic control over animal behavior. Such closed-loop neural interface will establish a generalizable technology platform to study complex animal behaviors using optogenetic tools and real-time learning. The proposed work will open ample research opportunities and form connections among hardware engineering, cognitive neuroscience, and data science. The intellectual merit of the proposed work will be evidenced by three major contributions: 1) demonstration of high-precision optogenetic brain interface that combines multiplexed recording from and bi-directional control over neuron ensembles, 2) demonstration of closed-loop brain interface that employs real-time neural decoding and adaptive learning to control animal behavior, and 3) characterization of complex decision-making using high-precision, multiplexed data linking multiple brain areas.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

First, we investigated the contributions of the frontal cortex to decision-making in rats using multi-electrode neuronal recording. In this study, we created an open-source automated figure-eight maze to permit investigation of different aspects of reward-related decision-making behavior. We then recorded the activity of dorsomedial frontal cortex neurons during a working-memory based decision-making task to better understand the role of this brain region in cognitive function. Data from this study are currently under analysis, in collaboration with another PI on this proposal (Meyers). As part of this project, we also developed new algorithms for removing noise from neurophysiological signals, in order to optimize the data that we collected. Both aspects of this project are in preparation for publication. Second, we developed new open-source touchscreen systems for high-throughput cognitive testing in mice and rats. These systems use Raspberry Pi processors and touchscreens to make powerful, affordable behavioral testing systems that can be used in a variety of environments, including home cages. We have performed multiple iterations of development on these tools and will continue to refine their development for deployment in the coming months. Third, funds were used to develop head-fixed behavioral testing systems in awake mice in order to perform cognitive and behavioral testing during the use of high-density recording systems such as Neuropixels or multiphoton recording. These systems are currently in use in our lab for recording large-scale neuronal activity during behavior. Fourth and finally, we collaborated with PI Xu to test the opto-electrodes developed in his lab in vivo. Members of our group used viral vectors to deliver the optogenetic construct BiPOLES into mouse brains. This construct allows neurons to be activated by red light and inhibited by blue light, optimal for testing the 2-color LED probes developed by PI Xu. Our group also assisted in optogenetic stimulation and recording the activity neurons in vivo using the Xu lab probes. The results of this study have been accepted for publication. Altogether, these funds supported significant progress on the overarching goals of the proposal  to study ensembles of frontal cortex neurons during cognitive tasks, and to develop new tools and analysis techniques for investigating neural signaling during complex cognition and behavior.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/20/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: GuangyuXu\n"
