 "awd_abstract_narration": "America's most productive farmland lies in the direct path of urban expansion, competing economically with housing markets. The U.S. population is predicted to grow by 50% before 2050, adding nearly 140 million people. Accommodating such growth requires an understanding of urban form and both its influence on and its response to surrounding land-uses. Metropolitan areas contain only 20% of the total U.S. farmland and 80% of the population. Yet, metropolitan-area farms account for the majority of fruit, nut, berry, vegetable, milk and egg production. It is this array of fresh food that is needed to battle the upsurge of unhealthy eating and associated diet-related diseases, such as obesity and diabetes. Encouraged by growing consumer preferences and willingness to pay more for local foods, many metropolitan farms are increasingly turning to direct marketing through you-pick operations, farm stands, farmers' markets, and Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) as a way to stay economically competitive against the housing market. This project explores how social networks formed through local food marketing influence land-use regulations, agricultural economics, and urban development patterns.\r\n\r\nTo inform a \"science of cities,\" this research tests a novel explanatory theory. Ecologists have identified structural complexity as an important indicator for total system growth and resilience. Structural complexity fosters niches. The presence of niches allows for a diversity of uses. Such diversity fosters resilience in the face of natural disasters, disease or extinction of one species. Structural complexity can be estimated. For example, carefully laying a flexible chain over the surface of a coral reef provides a simple indicator of surface roughness, termed rugosity. Rugosity measurements correlate with the availability of habitat niches and related coral biodiversity, total reef species, reef growth and resilience to stressors. Drawing from ecology, this research translates the metric of rugosity -- an interface measurement that indicates niches, rich social networks, and potential resilience to shocks -- to urban and agricultural studies. This research will measure the structural complexity of urban areas as critical to urban and agricultural growth (land values, population growth, production), shared metabolism (supply chains, resource use), and resilience (response to economic and natural disaster). Satellite imagery provided by the National Agricultural Statistics Service now allows high-fidelity spatially explicit data for multivariate regression analysis on farmland loss, crop diversity, and urban development. Collection of novel data on marketing channels allows social network analysis on the mediating effects formed through the food system on land-use. In sum, this research tests the hypothesis that farms that are more intertwined physically with urban lands will also be more intertwined socially through direct and local marketing, thereby changing diet-related health, job diversity, farm tenure, and land-use patterns for urban and agricultural communities alike.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Nor is the food system centrally planned. Yet, we all rely on this invisible infrastructure and are immediately aware when it fails, leaving grocery shelves unstocked and cupboards empty. We also can tell when our critical, but hidden, food systems are strained. &nbsp;Farmers compete with housing markets for land and water, operating on slim economic margins. About 12% of households are food insecure in the United States. To understand how farms and urban areas work in tandem, and could be planned to boost long-term resilience, we collected a novel dataset of the connections between&nbsp;producers and markets. We used network analysis to explore food system functionality in relation to land-use change, and we test the premise that where urban and food-producing lands are physically interwoven, there are better human and ecosystem health outcomes. Early findings show a natural constraint in urban growth. Urban areas grow to reach a thickness of 10km before elongating and branching (Brinkley and Raj, 2022). This finding indicates where and the extent to which urban areas are reliant on non-urban lands. We also find that food systems rapidly reorient in response to land-use changes, with 80% of market connections changing within a five-year period (Brinkley et al., 2021). Even amidst such change, network analysis allowed us to identify anchor institutions in local food systems. We show how these anchors&mdash;including food banks and farmers markets&mdash;set food policy agendas and transfer knowledge while the constellation of farms, markets, and consumers changes. Our findings help identify practical civic engagement opportunities for realizing Sustainable Development Goals of reducing hunger and improving ecosystem services within and outside of cities. For example, given the urban expansion constraint, higher density development with greater job opportunities can be achieved where urban areas are infused with protected food producing lands. Planning green wedges and garden networks through redevelopment will also raise property values and improve human mental and physical health. As the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated, local governments can support anchor institutions in local food systems to improve food security and navigate supply crises. Alongside this research, this award supported an evaluation of student education in sustainability planning. Sustainability science brings together multiple disciplines and needs to translate complex concepts to practical real-world problems and solutions beyond the classroom.&nbsp;To meet these needs, students helped develop and evaluate the first state-level land-use planning search engine, enabling greater learning, research, and planning engagement well beyond the award (<a href=\"https://plansearch.caes.ucdavis.edu/\">https://plansearch.caes.ucdavis.edu/</a>).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 08/19/2024<br>\nModified by: Catherine&nbsp;Brinkley</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1750621/1750621_10542293_1724096370223_Urban_areas_and_perfusion--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1750621/1750621_10542293_1724096370223_Urban_areas_and_perfusion--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Urban areas and the green infrastructure perfusion constraint\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1750621/1750621_10542293_1724096370223_Urban_areas_and_perfusion--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Urban areas and the green infrastructure perfusion constraint\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Hot Spot analysis of urban areas that have grown beyond the perfusion constraint and have interior urban areas further than 5&#8201;km from the urban perimeter.
