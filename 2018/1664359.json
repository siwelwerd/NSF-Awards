 "awd_abstract_narration": "A second quantum revolution in and around the construction of a useful quantum computer has been advancing dramatically in the last few years. Topological phases of matter, the importance of which has been recognized by scientific awards that include the 2016 Nobel prize in physics, exhibit many-body quantum entanglement. This makes such materials prime candidates for use in a quantum computer.  Topological quantum computation is maturing at the forefront of the second quantum revolution as a primary application of topological phases of matter. The theoretical foundation for the second quantum revolution remains under development, but it appears clear that algebras and their representations will play a role analogous to that played by group theory in the first quantum revolution. This focused research group aims to formulate the theoretical foundations of topological quantum computation, leading to an eventual theoretical foundation for the second quantum revolution. It is anticipated that the results of the research will guide and accelerate the construction of a topological quantum computer. A working topological quantum computer will fundamentally transform the landscape of information science and technology. The project includes participation by graduate students and postdoctoral associates in the interdisciplinary research.\r\n\r\nThe goal of topological quantum computation is the construction of a useful quantum computer based on braiding anyons. The hardware of an anyonic quantum computer will be a topological phase of matter that harbors non-abelian anyons. A physical system is in a topological phase if at low energies some physical quantities are topologically invariant. Topological properties are non-local, yet can manifest themselves through local geometric properties. The success of topological quantum computation hinges on controlling topological phases and understanding their computational power. This research addresses the mathematical, physical, and computational aspects of topological quantum computation. The projects include classification of super-modular categories, vector-valued modular forms for modular categories, extension of modular categories to three dimensions, simulation of conformal field theories, topological quantum computation with gapped boundaries and symmetry defects, and universality of topological computing models. The research has potential impacts ranging from new understanding of vertex operator algebras to the development of useful quantum computers. One specific goal is a structure theory of modular categories analogous to that of finite groups. Such a theory would lead to a structure theory of two-dimensional topological phases of matter.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nThe mathematical foundations of topological quantum computation TQC (illustrated in figure 1)  is mainly centered around the description and analysis of generalized anyon models.  From the algebraic point of view the central concept for describing anyon models is a modular tensor category.  The computational power of TQC comes down to analyzing the complexity of the operators achieved by the motions of anyons or their higher dimensional analogues: vortices. Most of the outcomes of the funded research fits into one or both of these two major themes.\nThe major outcomes on constructions and classifications are as follows:\n\n\nA new computational approach to classifying modular categories by rank, using the representation theory of the group SL(2,Z) of 2x2 integer matrices with determinant 1. We classified up to rank 6 (listed in figure 2)  and laid the ground work for current work pushing the rank classification up to 9.\nDetermining when two anyon models are related by phase transitions such as condensation and symmetry gauging is a key problem.  We developed a powerful new invariant that can distinguish certain distinct classes of anyon models that are identical when formed as bi-layered systems.  We found infinitely many such whose \"squares\" are identical using our invariant.\nAnother way that two anyon models can be related is through a construction technique called \"zesting.\" We developed this notion formally and it has now become a main construction technique that goes beyond phase transitions.  This can be used to explain the existence of \"modular isotopes\": anyon models with the same modular data but are distinct in subtle ways.  This can by applied quite generally, including G-crossed braided fusion categories that describe systems with fermions and on-site symmetries.\nGeneralizing modular categories to G-crossed braided fusion categories and super-modular categories presented new classification challenges.  A major achievement here is a proof of the rank-finiteness theorem in this generality.  Another is the classification of low-rank super-modular categories.\n\n\nTo understand the topological dynamics of these systems we study representations of groups of motions in both 2 and 3 dimensions.  Outcomes on this front include:\n\n\nThe classification of charge-conserving Yang-Baxter operators.  This is a progress on a problem that has not seen much movement since the 1990s, when 4x4 Yang-Baxter operators were completely classified.\nThe generalization of the Hecke algebra--finite dimensional quotients of the braid group algebras--to the loop Hecke algebra: finite dimensional quotients of the loop braid group algebras.  This is the group of motions of free loops in 3 space (illustrated in figure 3).\nConstructing representations of the braid group from twisted tensor products of group algebras shed new light on the PI's \"property F\" conjecture which characterizes when braid group representations from braided fusion categories have finite image. The verification of the conjecture for integral metaplectic categories was accomplished with REU students.\nRepresentations of a new configuration in 3 dimensions were described and analyzed: here for the necklace braid group, which is a physically more feasible configuration than free loops due to energy considerations.\n\n\n\n \n\nThese outcomes have significantly expanded our understanding of the mathematical foundations of TQC and the landscape of the relevant mathematical models for anyons and their generalizations.  Both undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdocs were trained during this research increasing the number of highly trained personnel in this new area of science.  Issues of equality, diversity and inclusion were considered, with at least 7 coauthors in groups that are underrepresented in STEM fields.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/05/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric C Rowell"
