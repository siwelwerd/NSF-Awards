 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Midwest Regional Center of Excellence (LSMRCE) for Broadening Participation in STEM is a partnership of Chicago State University (CSU) and Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI). As co-founders of the pilot, Louis Stokes Midwest Center of Excellence (LSMCE),CSU and IUPUI extend the partnership to include the Ohio State University (OSU) and Fermi National\r\nAccelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) in order to deepen collaborations with 6 Midwestern Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation Programs (LSAMPs), while strengthening existing partnerships with non-LSAMP institutions that are LSMCE collaborators. The LSMRCE also aims to become a regional backbone support organization for information dissemination that contributes to the development of the NSF Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science (INCLUDES) National Network. The LSMRCE will develop, house, and distribute results of regional efforts in the collection, analysis, and assessment of best practices as recommended in the LSAMP model. It will also contribute to fundamental research in the science of broadening participation (BP).\r\n\r\nThe project team will implement four strategic plans: 1) Organize annual Broadening Participation conferences with BP professional development opportunities for students, faculty, and program administrators of both LSAMP and non-LSAMP institutions; 2) Provide social\r\nscience research guidance and support to promote BP research collaborations among STEM faculty on LSAMP and non-LSAMP campuses; and further investigate the contributing factors that facilitate sustainable partnerships/research collaborations for improving URM academic success; 3) Demonstrate tangible outcomes of key characteristics of the LSAMP model by providing URMs at LSAMP and non-LSAMP institutions with research skill development, mentoring, and professionalization activities; and 4)Develop a virtual BP resource center using features of the LSMCE website to disseminate current program information as well as evidence-based, high-impact BP practices.\r\n\r\nThe LSMRCE will obtain significant new knowledge on factors that sustain institutional collaborations that advance URM student achievement in STEM majors at Midwestern non-LSAMP campuses. The engagement in BP research collaborations of the faculty will help generate the needed data to assess  STEM education efficacy that reaches across all communities of learners who will graduate and advance\r\ntheir education in STEM. The LSMRCE will become a national model for fostering connections that are essential for expanding the INCLUDES Network. The annual BP conferences, available on-line resources about LSAMP programming, and other analytics on high-impact practices in STEM teaching and learning will enable practitioners and researchers to design effective strategies for increasing the number of URMs who graduate with STEM degrees. LSMRCE summer research interns at Fermilab will be tracked and the impacts of collaborative mentoring on student persistence and advancement in STEM will be studied.\r\n\r\nThis project is co-funded by the NSF INCLUDES program which focuses on catalyzing the STEM enterprise to collaboratively work for inclusive change.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This report highlights the key outcomes and impacts of the project, showcasing its achievements and the lasting effects on the community. Over five years, LSMRCE's efforts to cultivate a strong community were exemplified by hosting annual conferences that evolved to meet the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Initially in-person, these conferences transitioned to virtual and hybrid formats, ultimately returning to an in-person format in 2023. The 2023 conference featured 20 sessions and attracted 321 participants from 111 higher education institutions, demonstrating the project's ability to adapt and thrive in different environments. These conferences were pivotal in fostering inclusivity and diversity in STEM, with a cumulative attendance of 2,344 individuals, including 1,210 students. STEM Education Research was a cornerstone of the LSMRCE initiative. The project supported and coached faculty to cultivate research collaborations and secure funding in STEM education. These efforts resulted in awarding mini-grants for collaborative research projects and developing an extensive annotated bibliography library of broadening participation research articles. These contributions have significantly advanced the academic community's understanding of sustainable partnerships and broadened participation in the STEM fields. Notably, the research team at Lawrence Technological University and the University of Rochester was very productive, with three manuscript submissions in peer-reviewed journals, 11 presentations, and a grant submission to NSF. Professional development was another critical focus area. LSMRCE provided valuable opportunities for students through internships at Fermilab and Eaton Corporation, complemented by professional development webinars and workshops. The Fermilab SIST program hosted 14 interns over five years, while Eaton's programs engaged hundreds of students and volunteers in hands-on experiences. Additionally, 45 student webinars attracted over 2,500 registrants, extending the project's reach through YouTube. These initiatives significantly enhanced students' skills and professional networks, preparing them for future careers in STEM. Dissemination of information was key to LSMRCE's success. The project enhanced its digital presence through its website, social media channels, and newsletters, effectively sharing program information and best practices. The website received over 35,000 pageviews annually, and the YouTube channel featured 235 videos with substantial weekly views. This strategic use of digital platforms ensured that LSMRCE's activities reached a broad audience, amplifying the project's impact. In summary, the LSMRCE project has made substantial strides in broadening participation in STEM through its comprehensive approach involving community building, research, professional development, and dissemination. The legacy of LSMRCE lies in its establishment of a regional backbone support organization that has significantly contributed to increasing the number and quality of minoritized&nbsp;students in STEM graduating with STEM degrees. The project's lasting impact is evident in the strengthened partnerships, enhanced professional skills of students, and a well-connected STEM community dedicated to inclusivity, accessibility and excellence.</span></div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 08/29/2024<br>\nModified by: Christopher&nbsp;Botanga</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1826719/1826719_10581713_1724968069620_Outcomes_4_LSMRCE_Fermilab_Internship--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1826719/1826719_10581713_1724968069620_Outcomes_4_LSMRCE_Fermilab_Internship--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Fermi Lab Partnership\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1826719/1826719_10581713_1724968069620_Outcomes_4_LSMRCE_Fermilab_Internship--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Fermi Lab Partnership\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The LSMRCE offered research opportunities to students at the Fermi National Laboratory through an established partnership</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">LSMRCE Team</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christopher&nbsp;Botanga\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fermi Lab Partnership</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1826719/1826719_10581713_1724967834290_Outcomes_3_LSMRCE_Eaton_Partnership--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1826719/1826719_10581713_1724967834290_Outcomes_3_LSMRCE_Eaton_Partnership--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"LSMRCE Eaton Partnership\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1826719/1826719_10581713_1724967834290_Outcomes_3_LSMRCE_Eaton_Partnership--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"LSMRCE Eaton Partnership\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">LSMRCE Industry Partnership with Eaton</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">LSMRCE Team</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christopher&nbsp;Botanga\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">LSMRCE Eaton Partnership</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1826719/1826719_10581713_1724967680936_Outcomes_2_LSMRCE_Community_Building--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1826719/1826719_10581713_1724967680936_Outcomes_2_LSMRCE_Community_Building--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Community Building\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1826719/1826719_10581713_1724967680936_Outcomes_2_LSMRCE_Community_Building--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Community Building\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">LSMRCE Community Building</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">LSMRCE Team</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christopher&nbsp;Botanga\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Community Building</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1826719/1826719_10581713_1724967535608_Outcomes_1_LSMRCE_Annual_Conference_--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1826719/1826719_10581713_1724967535608_Outcomes_1_LSMRCE_Annual_Conference_--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"LSMRCE Annual Conference Flyer\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1826719/1826719_10581713_1724967535608_Outcomes_1_LSMRCE_Annual_Conference_--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"LSMRCE Annual Conference Flyer\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The LSMRCE organized and hosted an Annual Broadening Participation Conference</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">LSMRCE Team</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christopher&nbsp;Botanga\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">LSMRCE Annual Conference Flyer</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
