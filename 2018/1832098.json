 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Peter Chen's research team at Spelman College is developing a new high resolution spectroscopic technique to study molecules in gaseous mixtures in real time.  The new spectroscopic method Professor Chen works on monitors very small signal shifts caused by the change in a gas mixture.  It could be useful in many different areas, such as studying combustion systems, materials synthesis processes, and catalysis.  The resulting information could be used to discover and identify new species produced during chemical reactions and provide information needed to understand reaction mechanisms.  Consequently, it can lead to improved ways to reduce pollution, improve efficiency, and lower costs for manufacturing, automobile transportation, energy production, etc.  Professor Chen works closely with a group of undergraduate students at Spelman College and prepares them for graduate studies in the STEM fields.  He in particular encourages African American women students in research by providing them with a stimulating, cutting-edge undergraduate research experience.\r\n\r\nThe technique that is being developed is based upon a new high resolution form of coherent multidimensional spectroscopy that uses rovibrational resonances and nonparametric four wave mixing processes. The shift from electronic enhancements to vibrational enhancements makes it easier to detect all species present in the sample.  Advantages for using new nonparametric techniques are explored.  New methods are also being developed that use the resulting multidimensional patterns to distinguish among signals from different species while also providing information on their structures.  Professor Chen has established a strong record of recruiting and involving undergraduate students, many from underrepresented minority groups, on his project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding what happens to molecules in the gas phase is essential for solving major problems such as climate change. New technologies are being explored to limit greenhouse gas emissions, such as the development of new types of fuels. We also need more efficient and less-polluting methods for manufacturing essential products such as ammonia-based fertilizer that is used to grow half the world's food. These and many other systems involve gas phase chemistry and gas phase chemical reactions, and tools are needed that can directly probe such systems so that we can understand, optimize, and assess their effectiveness. These new tools need to be able to probe gas phase systems in real time without altering them. They also need to be able to work under challenging conditions, such as high temperatures, high pressures, and the presence of mixtures often found in manufacturing processes.\n\n\nOptical spectroscopy has long been an effective tool for remotely studying systems in situwithout perturbing them. Beams of light from lasers can probe such systems, providing information about what molecules are present, how much energy they have, and how that depends upon where they are located (e.g., directly above the surface of a catalyst). That kind of information can be captured in infrared spectra rich with details about the molecules being probed (e.g., their identity, structure, energy, and behavior). Unfortunately, this approach has been limited in the past because gas phase infrared spectra contain so much information that they are too congested to interpret. Highly effective methods for eliminating spectral congestion have been developed and used in the laboratory for decades. These laboratory methods use a molecular jet to cool molecules down to extremely low (cryogenic) temperatures. While this approach works very well in a controlled laboratory setting, it is not practical for the development of a probe for studying systems found at room temperatures or higher temperature such as those found in manufacturing, combustion and plasma systems.\n\n\nOur new infrared laser-based technique uses a different approach for dealing with congestion. By generating multidimensional infrared spectra, our instrument uses multidimensional space to spread out the information and reduce congestion. It also separates and organizes information into multidimensional patterns that our group has been studying. We have developed new tools for extracting previously inaccessible kinds of information from these multidimensional patterns. The construction, testing, and demonstration of this new instrument been funded by this NSF grant. And as a result of this success, we have recently formed new collaborations with researchers at other agencies (e.g., NASA and DOE) who are interested in using this new technique to solve problems that were previously intractable.  \n\n\nThis project has also provided the opportunity to train 14 undergraduate research students, all of whom are Black women. These students helped build, test, troubleshoot, and develop experiments for demonstrating the capabilities of this new technique. They have also developed new tools needed to process and extract information from these multidimensional spectra. Eight of these students have graduated: three are currently in Ph. D. programs, two are in medical school, and three are currently in the workforce. The remaining six students are either still at Spelman or are completing their undergraduate studies at Georgia Tech through Spelman's dual degree engineering program.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/22/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: PeterCChen\n"
