 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work examines the evolution of two proteins that are widely distributed in metazoan animals and underlie Alzheimer's disease (AD) in humans - the beta-secretase enzyme (BACE1) and the amyloid beta (A-beta) sequence. The main goal is to understand when and how protein molecules evolve new functions over time. Broader outcomes of this work include expanded access to STEM research for underrepresented minorities and first generation undergraduate students, and outreach to the broader community via a high school teaching module and a popular science article. \r\n\r\nGene duplications are believed to be major facilitators of the evolution of novel protein function. BACE1 evolved from a gene duplication event just after the origin of animals. At a later but as yet unknown point in time, an APP gene duplicate evolved a novel BACE1 substrate motif (A-beta). This project traces back the functional evolutionary history of the origin and interaction of these molecules and resolves, to the most precise degree possible, when BACE1 and APP/A-beta evolved. Two specific aims make up this research: (1) determining the functional origin of BACE1 activity, via a cell culture-based functional test and ELISA, to investigate which species retain BACE1 enzymatic activity, and (2) determining the functional origin of the APP beta cleavage site to determine which taxa retain bona fide BACE1 substrates, using a cell culture-based functional test and mass spectrometry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We previously showed that BACE1 evolved from a gene duplication event near the base of the animal clade and that BACE1 APP/Amyloid beta proteolytic function evolved at least by the chordate origin, well before the evolution of the APP/Amyloid beta substrate. Here we extend our examination of BACE1 APP/Amyloid beta proteolytic function to include cnidarians, ctenophores and choanoflagellates. The most basal BACE1 ortholog is found in cnidarians, while ctenophores, placozoa and choanoflagellates have genes equally orthologous to BACE1 and BACE2. BACE1 from a cnidarian (<em>Hydra</em>) can cleave APP to release Amyloid beta, pushing back the date of the origin of his function to near the origin of animals. We tested more divergent BACE1/2 genes from a ctenophore (<em>Mnemiopsis</em>) and a choanoflagellate (<em>Monosiga</em>) and neither has this activity. These findings indicate that the specific proteolytic function of BACE1 evolved during the very earliest diversification of animals, most likely evolved after a gene duplication event.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/25/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Blaine&nbsp;Moore</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1817867/1817867_10558921_1690293823276_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1817867/1817867_10558921_1690293823276_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cnidarians are the most basal group with a BACE1 ortholog\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1817867/1817867_10558921_1690293823276_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cnidarians are the most basal group with a BACE1 ortholog\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Maximum likelihood tree of BACE sequences with nodes collapsed below 50% support.
