 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the role of mineral dust particles on the formation of cloud droplets in the atmosphere.  Current theories of droplet formation have not included the influence of particle surface structure and porosity.  State-of-the-art laboratory techniques will be used to quantify the effects of particle surface microstructure on the uptake of water and the formation of cloud droplets in the atmosphere.  This research will contribute significantly to the current understanding of how mineral particles of atmospheric relevance interact with water vapor in the atmosphere and lead to improved models of dust-cloud interactions and the influence of these interactions on weather and climate.\r\n\r\nThe specific goals of the studies are: (1) to quantify water adsorption on model insoluble aerosol components as a function of relative humidity (RH); (2) to measure size-resolved cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation of the same model aerosol components; (3) to apply new water adsorption analysis methods to correct for surface microstructure and porosity to obtain more accurate Frenkel Halsey Hill Adsorption Activation Theory (FHH-AT) fit parameters; (4) to compare surface microstructure and porosity-corrected bulk water adsorption-based CCN activation to aerosol CCN activation measurements to establish experimental closure between the two methods; and (5) to mentor and educate a diverse cohort of undergraduate students in atmospheric chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUndergraduate students are at a stage in their lives where they identify where their talents meet their interests in ways that propel them into their future career paths.  Central to this project was the exposure and engagement of undergraduate STEM majors in atmospheric chemistry research that combines experimental and theoretical methodologies to address uncertainties in the Earth?s climate and chemistry.  Through research and career discernment activities, this project prepared STEM majors for careers in the geosciences, thus sustaining a diverse STEM workforce. \n\nUndergraduate students participated in research that exposed them to experimental and theoretical techniques designed to study the climate impacts of insoluble atmospheric particles while producing accurate climate model parameters for improved climate modeling and validating recent developments in theoretical understanding of how these particles? surfaces take up water and affect cloud formation.  This work is significant as cloud activation mechanisms remain one of the most uncertain factors that impact climate.  Most notably, this work bridged scientific understanding of water uptake on insoluble particles above and below 100% relative humidity. \n\nUndergraduate students also participated in the summer career discernment program, called Experiences in Professional Research Organizations and Atmospheric Chemistry at Hendrix (EPROACH).  On-location and virtual programs included visits with and mentorship from professional scientists in national laboratories, industry, and academic research settings and engagement in professional development and field-based research activities, including atmospheric measurements at a high altitude research facility.  Of the student EPROACH participants, 22% have applied, or are planning to apply, to post-graduate work or education in the geosciences, such as atmospheric chemistry.  Compared to the 4.5% of STEM students entering the geosciences from Hendrix College prior to NSF funding, the summer EPROACH program significantly increased exposure and interest in the geosciences. \n\nIn addition to recruiting and training a diverse STEM workforce, this project has produced two peer-reviewed manuscripts, with further papers in development, 6 invited talks, and 22 presentations at national, regional, or local conferences, all including undergraduate student co-authors.  The project?s success in measuring accurate climate model parameters while training the next generation of atmospheric scientists will continue to benefit the field of atmospheric chemistry and research infrastructure at Hendrix College for years to come. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/26/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Courtney D Hatch"
