 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation award supports the acquisition of an ultrafast amplified laser system enabling studies at the intersections of condensed matter systems in physics, materials science and engineering, chemistry, chemical engineering, biology, and bioengineering. Probing materials with ultrafast short laser pulses captures some of the most fundamental physical processes that occur at extremely short timescales. These processes, which the project addresses, provide insights into charge transfer and evolution of optical excitations in solar cells, nonlinear optical phenomena in organic electronics, quantum materials, and (bio)organic materials, and transient optical processes in mesoporous materials. The ultrafast laser facility, while enhancing areas of nonlinear optics and time-resolved spectroscopic studies of condensed matter systems, complements existing research centers involved with nanomedicine, nanotechnology, and nanoscience at the University of Missouri (MU). The project seeks to make ultrafast laser technology available to a large user base at MU and in the state of Missouri. The versatility of the instrument and the transdisciplinary breadth of available expertise are unmatched in the region, empowering STEM students to obtain a competitive edge by hands-on experiences, and preparing them for employment in nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science and engineering, and semiconductor-based academic research or industry. The research and educational activities are strengthened by the participation of students and researchers from Lincoln University, a Historically Black College & University in Missouri, and other institutions in the state along with advancing ongoing efforts in high school mentorship and middle school outreach programs.\r\n\r\nUltrashort light pulses open up new realms for probing nonlinear optical processes in materials and electronic devices. The proposed system is a versatile femtosecond laser system with broadband wavelength tunability and capabilities for multi-dimensional spectroscopy. It consists of three parts: (a) a femtosecond oscillator (mode-locked Ti-Sapphire laser); (b) a femtosecond amplifier; (c) a non-collinear optical parametric amplifier. The project focuses on investigating carrier dynamics and optical nonlinearities in electronic materials and organic semiconductor transistors to improve technology based on organic electronics. The research of two-dimensional (2D) materials, in particular the monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, will benefit by obtaining in-depth understanding of the excitonic processes in these materials. In the area of molecular organic crystals, combined efforts in the second harmonic generation measurements, synthesis, and computational simulations will establish large scale polar order by rational design. The ultrafast laser system will be used to exploit the nonlinear optical properties of biological nanostructures in order to obtain multi-wavelength coherent sources with potential applications in nanophotonics. The project will further enable the development of silica-based materials by probing transient optical processes and fabricating micro- and nano-structures on the order necessary for their integration into optoelectronic devices. The proposed experimental laser facility will be bolstered by establishing a center for nonlinear optics, comprising both experimentalists and theorists, to promote research and educational activities in emerging ultrafast and nonlinear optical phenomena in condensed matter systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
