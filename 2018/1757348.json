 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Description\r\n\r\nThis Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) Track-1 project will focus on two Alaskan ecosystems: (1) the boreal forest, which covers 11% of the world's land mass and (2) the coastal margins of the Gulf of Alaska, which covers an area of about 600,000 square miles. The researchers will use remote sensing, field work, laboratory experiments, and modeling methods to study boreal forest fires and coastal marine ecosystems. The boreal fire research team will identify drivers of fire weather, map active fire behavior, and evaluate the impacts of wild fire on ecosystem services in affected communities. This project will lead to the development of improved fire spread models and tools for fire risk evaluation, web-based fire forecasts, and will inform fire management. The coastal margins research team will study nearshore coastal ecosystems and evaluate the responses of fish and other marine species to varying glacial environments. The results of both the boreal fire and coastal margins research will benefit natural resource management in Alaska and more generally in regions with wild fires and changing hydrology. The project participants will engage in broadly disseminating the findings of the research to resource managers and Alaskan communities in addition to their efforts to train and mentor students and researchers at all educational levels at K-12 schools and universities. \r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on understanding climate-driven changes to 1) fire risk and behavior in Alaska's boreal forest, and 2) glacial and non glacial material flux on the coastal margins of the Gulf of Alaska. This project, will provide comprehensive data streams as well as scenarios, models, tools, and visualizations for use in responding to short-term, climate-driven ecological change. The boreal fires research thrust will identify large-scale climate drivers relevant to fire weather, and use hyperspectral imaging and remote sensing of active wildfires to generate improved maps of fire fuels and active fire behavior. The coastal margins research thrust will determine how glacial melt and increased precipitation are altering material flux across the coastal margin and subsequently influencing nearshore biological communities. Both research thrusts include a human dimensions component that uses social science research to link the project findings to subsistence communities and human populations. The research is combined with the activities of an innovative Diversity, Education, and Workforce Development plan that uses education research to study the effectiveness of diversity recruitment efforts, interventions for helping students overcome stereotype threat, and case studies that explore impact of science identity pathways on student performance within STEM disciplines. The project will advance fundamental knowledge in two vulnerable, understudied and rapidly changing ecosystems and generate findings that will have significant societal and economical relevance to Alaskan communities and natural resource managers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
