 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides support for selected students, postdoctoral researchers, and young investigators studying at US institutions as well as two invited researchers to participate in the Symposium on Additive Manufacturing (AM) - Modeling and Simulation of AM Materials, Processes, and Mechanics at Materials Science & Technology 2018 (MS&T18) in Columbus, Ohio, 14-18 October 2018. This area is a burgeoning area important to the national prosperity. MS&T18 will bring together a broad range of technical sessions and expertise through the collaborative efforts of six major, international materials organizations: The American Ceramic Society (ACerS), Association for Iron & Steel Technology (AIST), ASM International, Metallurgy and Materials Society of CIM (MetSoc), NACE International, and The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society (TMS). In particular, this symposium is expected to have more than 40 presentations, one third of which will be given by students. Participants will be exposed to research at the frontiers of AM including technical presentations by leading international experts in the field. Attendees will also have ample opportunities for networking with other researchers from around the world.\r\n\r\nThe symposium will showcase the latest developments in AM modeling and simulation and help illuminate some of the challenges in predictive theoretical and computational approaches that still hinder the widespread adoption of AM. Example topics covered include modeling and simulation of AM processes to understand the process-structure-property relationship; modeling of morphology evolution, phase transformation, and defect formation; and modeling of residual stress, distortion, and plasticity/damage in AM parts. As part of the very popular and well-attended group of AM symposia at MS&T, it is expected to draw several hundred attendees throughout the week. It remains a vital forum that brings together top researchers from around the world and numerous graduate and undergraduate students to discuss their research, to exchange ideas, to network and to develop collaborative relationships centered on materials research in AM.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
