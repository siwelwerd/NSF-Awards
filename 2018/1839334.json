 "awd_abstract_narration": "On the Sun, magnetic fields are found in both active and quiet large structures forming and erupting from the Sun's surface called solar filaments. The investigators propose to make and study a large data set that measures the magnetic field inside these filaments, including both erupting and non-erupting configurations, of both active and quiet solar filaments. These studies will cover all steps in a solar filament's lifetime, from formation to stability to eruption. Obtaining the complete magnetic field data set required to study solar filaments is only now possible using a medium-sized telescope equipped with special instrumentation, now available to the investigators.  The investigators will be ready to study observations of the solar filaments made at greater resolutions by the new Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope when it begins operation.  This project supports the mission of the NSF by promoting our understanding of magnetic field structure and activity at the Sun. The investigators will include a graduate student and a post-doctoral associate to support the research and learn data analysis techniques.\r\n\r\nMagnetism exists as linear, sheared structures that allows for filament formation; the lack of cross-field drift in the structure stabilizes the filament plasma from thermalization and collapse; and only magnetism can rapidly rearrange structure and result in eruption. Three specific science questions will be addressed: What is the magnetic field configuration of forming solar filaments?  What is the magnetic field configuration of stable solar filaments?  What is the magnetic field configuration of a filament prior to eruption?  To address these, the investigators set three specific objectives: Define and obtain ten spectropolarimetric sequences in the He I absorption line at 10830A, in order to study filament formation. Classify solar filament structure by producing a pipeline to reduce, analyze, and interpret these spectropolarimetric data. Identify those magnetic configurations prior to a loss of filament stability. Data analysis requires the training of personnel in running and expanding the HAZEL inversion code into pipeline in order to study the magnetic structure.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
