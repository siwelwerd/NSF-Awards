 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) has identified research in broadening participation in STEM as one of its priorities and is committed to funding innovative models and research to enhance the understanding of the barriers that hinder and factors that enhance our ability to broaden participation in STEM. The project at Morehouse College has been designed to initiate the implementation of essential research that will set the foundation for the development of the theoretical model for resilient science identity formation. The project in collaboration with Virginia State University and four other HBCU institutions is designed to strengthen education research capacity by implementing a comprehensive faculty development program.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the HBCU Identity Research Center for STEM is to establish the foundational tenets of the theoretical model for resilient science identity formation. The project will achieve this goal through: 1) research activities that will contribute to an increased knowledge base on science identity formation and other psychosocial constructs that promote the formation of a resilient identity and ultimately success and retention in STEM; 2) education activities that contribute to learning about the experiences and accomplishments of STEM education at HBCUs; 3) knowledge translation activities that will facilitate the development of an intellectual infrastructure to ensure mutually beneficial communication and collaboration between individuals to propagate ideas and discover new research opportunities in the science of broadening participation; and 4) outreach activities to all stakeholders and the broader academic community to engage in project activities and to inform the higher education community.  The project will impact the research training and education of thousands of students, hundreds of faculty, and the academic community at large about the science of broadening participation in general and identity formation specifically.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The Center seeks to further examine these relationships and to identify factors that are common between different institutions.  In particular, we will identify the factors that attenuate risks to student success and augment supports for behaviors that lead to academic success.\nThe Scientific Literacy project developed online programs to enhance and support the student transition from high school to undergraduate STEM majors. This work will continue to enhance supports for student success.\nA Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) project added to the body of knowledge on this high impact learning-teaching method by publishing a series of studies on the effects of CUREs on student outcomes.  In addition, faculty development workshops were conducted to foster the development of new CURE activities that HBCU faculty will implement in their own courses and will provide opportunities for those faculty to conduct education research on their interventions. \nThe Computer Sciences project studied culturally relevant computing and online/virtual mentoring in computing.  This project had the following impacts: 1) enhanced a network of subject matter experts in the areas of STEM mentoring and professionals working in computing and data sciences; 2) introduced computer programming and computational thinking to underrepresented middle school and high school students at three coding camps, hosted two courses partnered with a computer technology company, and hosted several workshops for undergraduates with companies that lead to summer internship offers and entry-level opportunities; and 4) provided students with research experiences that prepared them to enter graduate programs.\nA Program for Educating Emerging Researchers (PEER) introduced undergraduate and graduate students to hands-on education research, and experiences that they would typically receive later in their academic and career pursuits. PEER was highly influential in changing undergraduate student?s plans to enter the workforce upon graduation and resulted in students applying to and beginning graduate degree programs.  \n\n\nThe Identify Research Center has built the foundation for continued study on HBCU success in STEM education.  The work of this grant will continue under the HBCU STEM Undergraduate Success Research Center (HRD-2010676).  This Center will continue to study how and why students at HBCUs succeed in STEM at a greater rate than individuals at other institutions.  In addition, the Center will continue to develop education researchers and contribute to our knowledge on student success in STEM.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/17/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lawrence S Blumer"
