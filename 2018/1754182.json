 "awd_abstract_narration": "Some introduced plants are aggressive and fast-spreading, and can be harmful to both natural ecosystems and society by interfering with crops, wildlife, and native species of conservation concern. Despite their large economic impact, it remains unclear why some introduced plants become invasive and others do not. One possibility involves how plants interact with soil fungi. Most plants have beneficial fungi associated with their roots, which are vital for nutrient uptake. However, the roots of plants are also often attacked by harmful fungi. This project aims to uncover how the interactions between beneficial and harmful root-associated fungi influence the success of non-native plants relative to native plants. This project will provide research training for undergraduate students including both laboratory and greenhouse methods. Additionally, the researchers will engage in outreach to K-12 students, as well as the public, to inform them about invasive species and plant-fungal interactions.\r\n\r\nThis project will examine the linkages between soil fungal communities and plant resource strategy within the context of the Resource Enemy Release Hypothesis, which predicts that nonnative species that have escaped their natural enemies in a new range will have relatively higher productivity as compared to native species, and that this advantage increases with resource availability. This research will test whether plant-fungal relationships differ systematically between fast and slow-growing species, using a well-studied Eastern North American invasive shrub system. Additionally, the research team will test whether differences in plant-fungal relations depend on a plant's co-evolutionary history with soil fungi, or alternatively, whether differences in plant-fungal relations apparent in invasive species are due to their overall bias toward fast growth. Multiple native and invasive plants, representing congeneric pairs with a range of plant growth characteristics, will be included in the study to control for phylogeny. In the greenhouse, plants will be subjected to two complementary inoculation experiments to test the relationship between each plant and its soil microbial community, and to test the mycorrhizal responsiveness of each species. DNA sequencing will then be used to characterize the response of root-associated fungal communities to differential conditioning by plant hosts, with emphasis on pathogen and mycorrhizal communities in greenhouse and natural field settings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

However, there is uncertainty about the mechanisms by which invasive plants are able to proliferate, especially with regards to invasive shrubs in Eastern North American forests and their interactions with soil microorganisms. This project examined how the effects of two very different groups of soil microbes (negative pathogens and beneficial mycorrhizal fungi) interact with invasive and native shrubs in Eastern North America, and the implications of these interactions on plant invasions and fungal species diversity. The project included six greenhouse experiments (with soil microorganisms added to only some plants) using over 50 plant species, and also included the sampling of soil fungi (using DNA-based methods to identify invisible fungi) associated with the roots of plant species growing in the greenhouse and in a natural forest. Our overall findings show that native plants are far more reliant on beneficial soil fungi than are invasive plant species, which may provide invasive species the flexibility to invade habitats that are outside their native range. In contrast, negative pathogens in soil have a much smaller overall impact on the growth of native and invasive species.
