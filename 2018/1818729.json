Through this catalyst project, Prairie View A&M University will initiate a comprehensive and synergetic forensic genomics program which will broaden awareness and access to the STEM workforce by engaging students in innovative interdisciplinary educational activities. The program will impact society by increasing minority representation and advancement in the forensic science workforce.\r\n\r\nThe proposed activities will advance knowledge and understanding within the field of Forensic Science as well as across multiple disciplines, both STEM and non-STEM at PVAMU and the surrounding educational communities. By enhancing the scientific exposure of students, they will graduate with a more well-rounded training that can improve competitiveness in the STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
