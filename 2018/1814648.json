 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, and neutral hydrogen atoms are thus an important constituent of interstellar gas in galaxies ? but also one of the most challenging to study. The faintness of neutral hydrogen emission means that it can only be detected beyond the nearby universe via long observations with large telescopes. A new telescope with improved sensitivity, the MeerKAT array, will examine how galaxies' neutral gas reservoirs have evolved over two thirds of the universe's history (i.e., the last nine billion years of cosmic time). It will determine how galaxies' neutral atomic hydrogen content relates to the properties of their stars, their environments, and their cosmic epochs. This will be compared with theoretical predictions in order to understand how gas flows into and out of galaxies and forms new stars while inside galaxies. The research will support the training of graduate and undergraduate students at the four universities; graduate students will gain additional experience in computation and statistics, research mentorship, education in STEM disciplines, and outreach to a variety of audiences.\r\n\r\nThis survey will probe neutral hydrogen (HI) in emission to an unprecedentedly high redshift of z = 1.45. The combination of individual and stacked HI detections ?  complemented by theoretical modelling, multiwavelength observations, and a rich z = 0 reference dataset ? will probe the evolution of (i) the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, (ii) the HI mass function, and (iii) the dependence of galaxies' HI content on stellar and dark matter properties. OH megamasers detected as strong line emitters in the MeerKAT data will be used to place constraints on the cosmic history of gas-rich galaxy mergers. Both the HI survey data and the instructional modules used to provide student training will be publicly released as part of the project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis work is part of the \"Collaborative Research: Observing the Cosmic Evolution of Neutral Hydrogen\" program that uses theLooking At the Distant Universe with the MeerKAT Array (LADUMA) survey to study galaxy evolution, primarily via observations of neutral hydrogen gas. LADUMA is a radio survey of galaxies that will be among the deepest and most sensitive to date.\n\n\nA byproduct of this survey is the discovery of OH megamasers arising from distant galaxies. OH megamasers are naturally occurring luminous microwave lasers produced by the hydroxyl molecule when galaxies collide. During these spectacular collisions, bursts of star formation occur, black holes are rapidly fed, and gas and dust are extremely concentrated. OH megamasers are signposts of these processes and can reveal very dusty and optically faint galaxy mergers.\n\n\nThe goal of this portion of the Collaborative Research program is: (1) to identify OH megamasers inthe LADUMA survey, thereby (2) separating the neutral hydrogen signal found in spiral galaxies from the hydroxyl maser signal found in colliding galaxies, (3) to study the OH megamaser hosts, and (4) to test the hypothesis that hydrogen surveys will find many of these OH megamasers. All of these goals were met by the project.\n\n\nAs predicted, we successfully identified new OH megamasers in the early LADUMA data, including the most distant OH megamaser ever detected. We built machine learning and data science tools to separate the OH megamaser signal from the neutral hydrogen signal (the two signals can look identical in the survey data). This provided a pure catalog of hydrogen in galaxies and identified new galaxy mergers. These tools can be used for other galaxy surveys, and they have already been successfully implemented to find new OH megamasers outside of LADUMA.\n\n\nThis project supported a graduate student's PhD dissertation and an undergraduate Honors Thesis. They have subsequently started a postdoctoral researcher position and a PhD program, respectively.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/02/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JeremiahKDarling\n"
