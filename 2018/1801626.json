 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this renewal RET Site: Integrated Nanomanufacturing, hosted by the Boston University Photonics Center (BUPC), is to immerse teachers in a six-week summer program that focuses on interdisciplinary research experiences. Through the interdisciplinary research, teachers are immersed in an exploration of the design, fabrication, and application of nanometer-scale components in optical, electronic, mechanical and biomedical systems. The teachers will strengthen their capacity in science and engineering practices through their participation, enabling them to engage their students with engineering concepts within the sciences. Mentored research projects challenge participants to engage in engineering problem solving, and the knowledge gained will help participants develop sustainable curricula and activities in STEM education. RET teachers will return to their classrooms with an improved and relevant skill set to foster their student's interest in engineering disciplines and to succeed with the ambitious educational goals of the Massachusetts Adapted Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). This RET Site is focused on underserved schools in the greater Boston area with the goal of recruiting participants from a diverse group with 80% of the teachers coming from resource-limited (high needs) schools. Additionally, teachers from schools with high percentages of underrepresented students in STEM and/or high percentages of low-income families will be encouraged to participate. The RET Site will work directly with STEM Nexus from the Greater Boston area and Eastern Massachusetts to target schools and individual teachers that have interest in STEM but have limited resources to implement these activities. This site will also engage local Boston area companies as potential research locations for RET participants and longer-term partners in K-12 outreach activities. \r\n\r\nIntegrated nanomanufacturing research is an inherently interdisciplinary intellectual area that is evolving rapidly at the intersecting frontiers of microelectronics, optical science, materials engineering, and biomedicine. Three thematic research areas will serve as the foundation for this RET Site: three broad themes of integrated nanomanufacturing: nanophotonics, nanostructures, and nanomedicine. While engaged in mentored discovery of new devices and fabrication at the nanoscale level to explore optical systems, participants will develop critical skills, awareness and confidence necessary to advance in academics and research in the future. The summer experience involves training sessions, hands-on nanofabrication tool training activities, scientific research in partner laboratories, seminars on classroom integration, and faculty pedagogy discussions. Participants will also be introduced to the idea of Societal Engineers, a core concept at Boston University to develop engineers who can connect their training to integrate content and applications reflecting how science and engineering is practiced in the real world. This is the basis of the case study curriculum developed and piloted from the initial RET Site at local schools in Massachusetts, with the renewal promising to disseminate the curriculum widely and develop more focus on physics and chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

All participants in this RET Site teach at Boston-area schools serving predominantly high needs and minority students. Seven (22%) of the 32 participants are community college faculty. Participants spent 6 weeks at Boston University (BU) during the summer, engaged in immersive research, technical training, and professional development. In their research activities, teachers explored the design, fabrication, and application of nanoscale components in optical, electronic, mechanical, and biomedical systems.&nbsp; Many worked in labs alongside REU students, often resulting in REU-RET collaboration and sharing of knowledge. Beginning in the second summer of this award cycle, weekly curriculum workshops were instituted for the RET cohort, to help teachers develop curricular lessons and activities from this research experience. With weekly curriculum workshops, RET participation in curriculum development rose to 100%. Nine of the 18 NGSS-aligned lessons that were developed and implemented by the K-12 teacher participants during this award cycle were published by TeachEngineering, the free, online K-12 engineering curriculum library for educators, with two additional lessons still under review. During this award cycle, relationships, academic year interactions, and mutual learning among BU faculty and students and K-14 educators increased and deepened, resulting in an increasingly effective translation of engineering in high school and community college classrooms.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p>\n<p>The RET INM advanced scientific knowledge in nanoscience, nanotechnology, and advanced manufacturing through interdisciplinary research projects related to nanosystems, nanofabrication, nanomaterials, and nanophotonics. In faculty and startup labs at BU, teachers conducted research to support the work being done by the group; thus, RET participants&rsquo; research outcomes directly assisted their labs in exploring new areas. Participants shared their work with BU&rsquo;s research community at a final poster event. Through their participation in mentored discovery, engineering of new devices, and fabrication at the nanoscale level to explore optical and integrated nanoscale systems, teachers developed skills and confidence to more effectively teach engineering. Annual program assessments consistently found that the program dramatically improved participants&rsquo; understanding of engineering research and the engineering method and enhanced participants&rsquo; confidence and ability to teach engineering and inform their students about STEM pathways and careers. Participants translated the knowledge they gained into new NGSS-aligned lessons and activities for their students, augmenting their high school and community college curricula and improving the quality of STEM education at their schools.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p>\n<p>The RET INM is focused on high needs, high minority schools in Greater Boston. In this award cycle, the Site supported, trained, and collaborated with 32 teachers from high needs schools and community colleges to enhance STEM instruction and improve the learning and achievement of underserved and diverse students. Helping teachers and students develop greater understanding and appreciation for engineering and its significance in our lives helps inspire future generations to pursue engineering careers. In addition to educator development and improved STEM education, broader impacts of this RET program include the development of long-term sustainable partnerships and pathways between BU, local public schools, and community colleges; robust STEM outreach programs at RET schools; reciprocal learning between BU faculty and participants; professional development of graduate students and postdocs through opportunities and training to mentor participants; and new STEM curricula developed by participants and published at the TeachEngineering digital library, available for use by other teachers and classrooms.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 08/29/2024<br>\nModified by: Thomas&nbsp;G&nbsp;Bifano</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1801626/1801626_10537852_1724956619305_2023_RET_Participant_Marla_Rhuma_in_the_Boley_Lab--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1801626/1801626_10537852_1724956619305_2023_RET_Participant_Marla_Rhuma_in_the_Boley_Lab--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"2023 RET INM Participant Marla Rhuma in the Boley Lab\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1801626/1801626_10537852_1724956619305_2023_RET_Participant_Marla_Rhuma_in_the_Boley_Lab--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"2023 RET INM Participant Marla Rhuma in the Boley Lab\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2023 RET INM Participant Marla Rhuma in the Boley Lab</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kelly Pena</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Thomas&nbsp;G&nbsp;Bifano\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2023 RET INM Participant Marla Rhuma in the Boley Lab</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1801626/1801626_10537852_1724956540895_2023_RET_Participants_at_BU_Photonics_Center--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1801626/1801626_10537852_1724956540895_2023_RET_Participants_at_BU_Photonics_Center--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"2023 RET Participants at BU Photonics Center\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1801626/1801626_10537852_1724956540895_2023_RET_Participants_at_BU_Photonics_Center--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"2023 RET Participants at BU Photonics Center\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2023 RET Participants at Boston University Photonics Center</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kelly Pena</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Thomas&nbsp;G&nbsp;Bifano\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2023 RET Participants at BU Photonics Center</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1801626/1801626_10537852_1724956688579_2023_RET_Participant_Paul_Kasili_with_Graduate_Student_Mentor_Francisco_Sanchez--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1801626/1801626_10537852_1724956688579_2023_RET_Participant_Paul_Kasili_with_Graduate_Student_Mentor_Francisco_Sanchez--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"2023 RET INM Participant Paul Kasili with Graduate Student Mentor Francisco Sanchez\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1801626/1801626_10537852_1724956688579_2023_RET_Participant_Paul_Kasili_with_Graduate_Student_Mentor_Francisco_Sanchez--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"2023 RET INM Participant Paul Kasili with Graduate Student Mentor Francisco Sanchez\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2023 RET INM Participant Paul Kasili with Graduate Student Mentor Francisco Sanchez</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kelly Pena</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Thomas&nbsp;G&nbsp;Bifano\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2023 RET INM Participant Paul Kasili with Graduate Student Mentor Francisco Sanchez</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
