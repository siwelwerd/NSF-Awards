Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Charlotte O. Chan is \"Geometric representation theory of p-adic groups and the arithmetic of period identities.\" The host institution for the fellowship is Princeton University, and the sponsoring scientist is\u00a0Christopher Skinner.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
