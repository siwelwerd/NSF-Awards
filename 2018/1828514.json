 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant will support acquisition of a powder X-ray diffractometer (PXRD) that will allow for the identification and characterization of solid materials such as minerals and building materials. X-ray diffractometry is a technique common in industry and research. Undergraduate science students at Bloomsburg University include many of first-generation and/or economically disadvantaged students; access to such an instrument will allow for opportunities in faculty-sponsored research and research training in addition to laboratory exercises within an academic course. This type of experience is essential for science graduates when applying for positions in graduate school or industry. Combined with existing facilities at the institution, a PXRD is a major step towards developing a center for materials characterization in a region with currently limited analytical facilities. Access and training on how to use this instrument will enhance student professional development and will support research.\r\n\r\nThe PXRD has applications to a variety of research, including: 1) Determination of mineralogy in complex rare earth ores from a deposit in Wyoming to understand environmental and economic impacts of deposit development. Rare earth elements are essential resources for modern electronics. They are naturally found in few places at economic grades, and even then, they are in mineralogically complex deposits that are challenging to processes. The Bear Lodge deposit in Wyoming is a rich, but undeveloped deposit. PXRD use in concert with automated mineralogical analysis and other methods is necessary to optimize mineral processing in cost terms and limit environmental impacts of mining. 2) Classification of different varieties of asbestiform minerals in order to help gauge human health risk in mixed land use areas of Nevada. Asbestiform minerals need not be anthropogenic in order to be a health hazard. Southern Nevada has many rock units with potentially hazardous mineral fibers mobilized by erosion. Samples of these rocks obtained during field mapping are best assessed by PXRD in order to determine the speciation of the fibers. 'Asbestos' is a term than encompasses many minerals with similar habits and potential health impacts can vary depending on exact type. 3) Differentiation of soluble versus insoluble heavy metal-bearing minerals in coal mine waste in central Pennsylvania to assess water quality impacts. Past and current coal mining has resulted in significant heavy metal contamination of soils in parts of Pennsylvania. The bioavailability of these elements, such as lead, is a major health concern to residents of these regions. Use of PXRD with X-ray fluorescence allows for the risk to be assesses in terms of the proportion of contaminants residing in water-soluble mineral phases. Simple chemical analysis can identify lead in a sample, but PXRD is necessary to determine the potential mobility of lead (and other elements of interest).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
