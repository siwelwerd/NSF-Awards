 "awd_abstract_narration": "Across the nation, manufacturing and distribution industries have growing needs for skilled technicians, including those with skills in advanced manufacturing and in transportation, distribution, and logistics (TDL). Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical College aims to address this need in its region by enhancing the preparation of students for TDL technician careers. Courses in advanced manufacturing and TDL at the college will be expanded to include a simulation laboratory component. The simulations will include a set of modular real-world scenarios that combine the business, logistics, production, and security sides of automated manufacturing. Teams of students will use these problem-based simulations to interactively troubleshoot, find solutions, and review the process. This approach will use emerging simulation technologies to better prepare students for the changing workplace. The project will also introduce high school students to the types of job opportunities in these fields and education requirements for these positions. In addition, high school students will be able to enroll and obtain dual credit for the TDL-related courses. Recruitment efforts will focus on increasing the number of women and underrepresented minorities in the manufacturing workforce. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to prepare TDL technicians by exposing students to emerging simulation technologies in a multi-disciplinary work environment. Twelve interdisciplinary, real-world simulations will be developed in the areas of advanced manufacturing and TDL, with input from local industry partners. These simulations will be used to enhance existing courses at the institution. A simulation laboratory will be established using a small production line that is fully networked and equipped with several sensors. In conjunction with this system, a resource planning system will allow students to monitor production and control the business processes associated with the manufacturing and order fulfillment process. This integration is designed to provide students with the technical skills and disciplinary knowledge, as well as an understanding of the business side of manufacturing. A Middle College Pathway in TDL will be added so that high school students can obtain transferable credit for completing these courses. Workshops for postsecondary students and teachers will be conducted to promote awareness of career options and industry needs in advanced manufacturing and TDL technology areas. Outreach activities will include a focus on increasing participation of women and underrepresented minorities in these fields. The college location enables it to engage rural student populations in its advanced manufacturing training and outreach. The project aims to increase the number of skilled technicians and to strengthen the regional workforce by connecting supply chain issues, production applications, and network security in a coordinated program that emphasizes real-world simulations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Unemployment rates for the counties identified for this project were among the highest of the 46 counties in the state: Orangeburg - 9.0%; Bamberg - 8.8%; and Calhoun - 6.0%.  These counties were ranked #1, #3, and #12 respectively for the state's highest unemployment rankings. The region continues to experience new industries and employers coming into the area within a 70-mile employment zone of OCtech.  \n\nThe goal of this project (Simul-ATE) was to educate advanced manufacturing (AM) and transportation, distribution, and logistics (TDL) technicians. Using a multi-disciplinary approach, the project was designed to better prepare students for the workplace where employees are exposed to different areas of the business.\n\nThe project had three primary deliverables:\n\nTo upgrade the existing Mechatronics laboratory through the purchase of new equipment\nTo create instructional materials that will be used to educate both mechatronics and TDL technicians\nTo provide outreach to students in grades 8-12 through the use of workshops, field studies, and camps, giving them the opportunity to learn about the career opportunities available in the fields of AM and TDL\n\n\nDuring the first year, the Mechatronics lab was upgraded by adding Industry 4.0 trainers manufactured by Festo.  These trainers will simulate a material handling operation.\n\nTwelve labs (instructional materials) were created with components that can be used by both mechatronics technicians and business.  Oracle NetSuite was used to provide opportunities for students to manage and troubleshoot supply chain and manufacturing processes.  Industries are moving steadily toward the use of Cloud-based, integrated productivity tools and students need education in using these types of tools.  \n\nRecruitment activities were used to ensure that middle and high school students were introduced to career options and the College's programs to prepare them. \n\nA year into the project, we were faced with a pandemic that made traditional outreach difficult.  Our first summer camp was virtual.  As a result, a virtual curriculum was created that can be used to provide future instruction to middle and high school students. The format can be used in a \"hybrid\" format where students learn the material virtually, and teachers can integrate the activities into classroom instruction.  Student counselors can use the information to guide students in a career path.  Through our outreach activities, we exceeded our total outreach goal of 1,175 participants by:\n\nProviding summer camps attended by 143 participants\nProviding field studies for 242 participants\nDelivering workshops to 799 students\n\n\nAnother goal of the project was to educate a diverse workforce.  The goals were met by:\n\nEnrollment of Early College Students in Advanced Manufacturing and Logistics Pathways exceeding the project's 3-year target enrollment numbers\nStudents earning national certifications like NCCER, MSSC-CLT, KUKA (robotics), and CSCMP (supply chain)\nHiring a gender and ethnically/racially diverse pool of interns and co-ops\nThree new articulation agreements signed with universities that will give OCtech students the opportunity to further their education.\n\n\n\nThe project also provided opportunities for professional development and the dissemination of information. The PI has participated in three ATE projects review panels. The PI and Co-PI attended conferences, as well as shared information:\n\nThe Simul-ATE project was selected to be among the projects featured in the 2020-21 edition of ATE Impacts.\nAt the 2020 PI conference, the project PI was part of a roundtable discussion \"The Evolution of STEM Summer Programming for K-12 Students.\"\nAt the 2021 Hi-TEC conference, the PI presented Engaging STEM Students During a Pandemic. \nAt the 2021 ATE-PI conference, the PI participated in the Lightning Round Spotlight session, \"The Pandemic Pivot - Lightning Round of Innovative ATE Strategies.\"\nAt the 2022 PI conference, the PI presented Creative Outreach During a Pandemic.\nWorkshops and field studies provided educators in middle and high schools an opportunity to learn about the grant and local industry opportunities and participate in activities that they can replicate in their classrooms.\n\n\nThe project stimulated student interest in technician careers and provided academic support and educational resources to prepare technicians for the changing workplace.  The certificates and earned associate degrees from OCtech and the subsequently earned baccalaureate degrees from our four-year partner institutions will result in a cadre of graduates prepared for and ready to assume the challenges of these positions. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/18/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Debra H Jones"
