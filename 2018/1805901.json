 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major challenge to combating the global health crisis of antibacterial resistance is that antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) can be shared among bacteria through a process called horizontal gene transfer (HGT). ARGs are present in wastewater, and there is little understanding of ARG health impacts potentially conveyed by recycling wastewater. Little is known regarding the conditions that result in HGT of ARGs from environmental bacteria such as those used to treat wastewater and pathogenic bacteria found in clinical infections. The goals of this project are to decipher how pathogens acquire ARGs from environmental bacteria present in water and wastewater systems and to understand how ARGs are propagated in water and wastewater microbial communities. This research will develop biosensors to monitor HGT of ARGs to understand how simple operational parameters in a wastewater treatment plant impact the reduction or proliferation of ARGs. If successful, the results of this project will identify methods of antibiotic resistance transfer in the environment and identify ways to halt this transfer during water treatment processes, protecting public health and the Nation's water supply.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the controls over horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in microbial communities found in the environment would impart an unprecedented ability to manage the growing threat of antibiotic resistance. While a variety of technologies are available for obtaining static snapshots of bacteria that have acquired antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) through HGT, these existing approaches do not provide dynamic information on the pathways and rates of gene flow within complex communities that experience a changing environment. These approaches also cannot easily differentiate between living and dead bacteria. Two emerging tools will be leveraged to obtain this information: (1) gas-reporting biosensors that report on in situ conjugation events; and (2) a high-throughput, culture-independent method for determining the host-range of ARGs in a mixed community. These tools will be applied in bioreactors treating domestic wastewater to better understand how operational controls impact ARG propagation rates and host range. The objectives of this research are to (1) develop biosensors that report on HGT in situ by coupling the synthesis of an enzyme that produces a rare volatile gas to broad-range plasmid transfer; (2) use these tools in bench-scale wastewater bioreactors to monitor HGT rates across a community under various reactor conditions; and (3) characterize the host range of the engineered plasmids and of a suite of environmentally-relevant ARGs under different bioreactor operational conditions. The results of this research will advance the knowledge of the mechanisms that govern HGT of ARGs in wastewater treatment and water reuse systems that will inform management strategies to protect human health.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The research was motivated by the fact the spread and emergence of antibiotic resistance is a major public health threat and the environmental dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes is poorly understood. In particular, there are limited tools for measuring horizontal gene transfer of ARGs in environmental microbial communities such as those found in wastewater systems. In this project, we developed novel biosensors for tracking HGT of plasmids that use biological memory, we characterized the biosensor performance in diverse microbes, and we demonstrated the biosensor in a wastewater microbial community and showed that it could be used to measure conjugation rates and determine the identities of transconjugants. We also benchmarked several sequencing-based approaches for characterizing ARG-host relationships including short- and long-read metagenomics and single-cell fusion PCR methods. We applied these methods to track ARG hosts across a full-scale wastewater treatment plant. Overall, our research advanced the toolkit for studying the propagation of ARGs in wastewater environments and fundamental knowledge on ARG hosts in wastewater.</p>\n<p>A major outcome of this project was the development and application of an RNA memory biosensor that can be used to detect transconjugants (microbes that receive a plasmid via conjugation). A key benefit of this type of biosensor is that it can report not just on the frequency/occurrence of HGT events, it also provides taxonomic information on the microbes that acquire the plasmid. The RNA-memory biosensor can be read out using RT-qPCR and/or high throughput sequencing, which enables extremely sensitive detection of HGT events. The biosensor uses a small catalytic RNA (a ribozyme) to barcode RNA at a location specified based on a guide sequence. We designed a ?universal? guide sequence to target and barcode a conserved region of the 16S rRNA, and after conjugation occurs, the barcoded rRNA can be sequenced to reveal which taxa received the plasmid. We tested and characterized the performance of the RNA-memory biosensor in a model organism, <em>E. coli</em>, as well as 7 other diverse bacteria. We then conjugated the plasmid with the RNA-memory system into a wastewater microbial community and performed amplicon sequencing of the barcoded rRNA, which revealed the transconjugant microbial community. Our results demonstrate that this novel tool is effective for monitoring gene transfer in environmental communities and can be applied to study conjugation dynamics.</p>\n<p>A second major outcome of this project was to assess ARG hosts across wastewater treatment processes. We performed an in-depth comparison of several methods for linking ARGs with their microbial hosts. First, we used a single-cell emulsion approach in which we encapsulate individual cells in emulsion beads and perform a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) inside each bead that physically links the functional gene of interest (in this case, an ARG) with a taxonomic marker gene (e.g., 16S rRNA gene). After the fused gene products are formed, the bead emulsions are broken, and the fused products are sequenced. Second, we performed short- and long-read metagenomics and developed a custom bioinformatics pipeline to identify ARG hosts using the metagenomics sequencing data. We collected samples from the influent, secondary effluent (pre-disinfection) and final effluent (post-disinfection), and applied each method in parallel to compare the results in terms of diversity of hosts detected and consistency in findings. We also characterized ARGs associated with mobile genetic elements and those found in putative pathogens across the wastewater treatment process. Our results revealed that long-read metagenomics performed better than short-read metagenomics in detecting diverse ARGs in wastewater and in linking ARGs with mobile genetic elements. EpicPCR outperformed long-read metagenomics in detecting unique ARG hosts, but provided no contextual information on the ARGs and their association with mobile genetic elements. We also found that ARG-host phylum linkages in the WWTP effluent resembled those in the influent and that <em>E. coli</em>, <em>A. caviae</em> and <em>S. enterica</em> containing clinically-relevant ARGs were persistent across the wastewater treatment process. Based on these findings, we recommend long-read metagenomics for untargeted ARG-host identification and discovery, and epicPCR for sensitive characterization of specific ARG hosts that are of particular concern to public health.</p>\n<p>The Broader Impacts of this project included the training of six graduate students and four undergraduate student researchers to perform research at the intersection of synthetic biology and environmental engineering. We developed several new synthetic biology tools that can be applied by environmental scientists and engineers to study fundamental microbial ecology questions. We specifically focused on tools that employ accessible and routinely used methods, such as PCR and amplicon sequencing, as opposed to specialized techniques and equipment. We participated in summer research experiences for undergraduates, such as the Bionetworks REU.
