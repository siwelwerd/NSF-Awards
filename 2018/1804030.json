 "awd_abstract_narration": "The driver of glacial-interglacial carbon dioxide (CO2) cycles remains one of the most important unresolved questions in the field of paleoclimatology.  Lower atmospheric CO2 levels correspond to ice sheet expansion, while rising CO2 levels are a primary driver of ice sheet retreat.  Although it has long been assumed that ocean-atmosphere exchange mediates CO2 levels, the underlying mechanisms have remained elusive.  During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; ~20,000 years ago), the deep Atlantic was more stratified than today, which likely enhanced carbon storage in the abyss.  If earlier glacial intervals were characterized by a similar pattern, it would suggest that stratification is fundamental to deep ocean carbon storage and therefore glaciations. Recent studies also suggest the deep Atlantic circulation slowed during the last deglaciation, which may result in carbon accumulation in the surface ocean and atmosphere.  If this mechanism is a key driver of ice sheet retreat, then evidence for a weaker deep Atlantic circulation should exist during each deglaciation of the last 140,000 years. \r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this project is to use data from multiple cores in the Southwest Atlantic to assess changes in ocean circulation and carbon storage during the last full glacial cycle. Using sediment cores from approximately 1500 m to 4000 m water depth, the research will assess: 1) the strength of the Atlantic's meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), 2) water column stratification in the South Atlantic, and 3) their relation to oceanic carbon storage. AMOC strength and water column stratification will be reconstructed by analyzing carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios in the shells of benthic (bottom dwelling) foraminifera. Carbon storage will be assessed by analyzing the boron to calcium ratio (B/Ca) in benthic foraminifera during key glacial and interglacial intervals of the last 140,000 years. Each core will be dated using oxygen isotope stratigraphy, a well-known tool in the field of paleoclimatology.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work could transform our understanding of the climate system by creating the first integrated picture of deep Atlantic circulation and carbon storage spanning the last full glacial cycle. The results will therefore provide a unique framework for understanding the source of atmospheric CO2 variability over long timescales. The results should also be useful to the broader paleoclimate community by providing an internally consistent depth transect of cores that can be studied using analyses beyond the scope of the current project. The educational impact of the proposed work includes the participation of a graduate student and two undergraduate students at the University of Connecticut.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe last million years of Earth's history is dominated by the Ice Ages, the repeated advance and retreat of ice sheets that covered large portions of North America, Europe, and Asia.  While it has long been known that the Ice Ages were paced by changes in the distribution of sunlight over the Earth's surface, the mechanisms responsible for amplifying small variations in sunlight into continent-scale ice sheets remains unclear.  One of the most likely amplifiers is atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), the levels of which vary depending on Earth?s climate state.  During glacial intervals when the Earth is cold and ice sheets are large, CO2 levels are low.  During interglacial intervals when the Earth is warm and ice sheets are small, CO2 levels are high.  The correspondence between temperature, ice sheet size, and CO2 during the Ice Ages is one of the primary lines of evidence showing Earth?s climate depends strongly on atmospheric CO2levels.  \n\nGiven that the ocean holds ~50 times more carbon than the atmosphere, ocean-atmosphere carbon exchange likely controls CO2 levels during the Ice Ages.  Changes in water temperature, marine biological productivity, sea ice coverage, and deep ocean stratification are all thought to play important roles in regulating atmospheric CO2.  In this NSF-funded project, we evaluated the role of stratification during the last glacial cycle, which spans 0-150,000 years ago.  It has been hypothesized that enhanced ocean stratification would allow carbon to accumulate in the abyss, resulting in lower atmospheric CO2 levels.  Prior work implies there was greater deep ocean stratification during the most recent glacial interval about 20,000 years ago.  If stratification is a primary driver of CO2, then we should observe greater stratification during all glacial intervals, less stratification during interglacial intervals, and progressively enhanced stratification across periods of CO2 decline.  \n\nTo test these predictions, we reconstructed deep ocean properties using a depth transect of sediment cores from the South Atlantic. Using microfossils in the cores, we inferred the temperature and nutrient content of ocean waters in the geologic past.  Combining results from multiple cores, we reconstructed vertical profiles of ocean properties to infer stratification.  Overall, we found that stratification was greater than today during glacial times, but we also found that it was greater during the last interglacial period when CO2 levels were high.  And we found no change in stratification across the first major drop in atmospheric CO2 of the last glacial cycle.  Thus, our results indicate atmospheric CO2 is not uniquely linked to deep ocean stratification and that other factors, such as biological productivity or sea ice coverage, were likely more important for controlling air-sea carbon exchange.  A full assessment of the stratification hypothesis will require vertical profiles from other locations to determine whether our results are representative of the global ocean. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/07/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David C Lund"
