 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Illinois State University (ISU) to acquire a multichannel laser scanning confocal microscope. The instrument will provide advanced imaging capabilities to ISU students and faculty in Physics, Chemistry, and Biological Sciences, as well as institutions across the Midwest region. As the centerpiece of the ISU Biological Sciences Microscopy Core Facility, the microscope will greatly enhance ISU's research infrastructure, enabling high-resolution three dimensional reconstructions of cells and tissues, time-lapse imaging of dynamic cellular processes in live samples, and advanced fluorescence techniques. ISU's diverse population of undergraduates will be able to use the facility as part of mentored independent research projects; over 50 undergraduate researchers per year are projected to learn widely useful STEM skills through this training. K-12 students will be exposed to concepts in cells, tissues, light microscopy, biotechnology, and neuroscience, through several ongoing outreach programs such as the Illinois Summer Research Academy. Students from groups underrepresented in science will be recruited for training via ISU's Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation. Future and current K-12 science teachers will train on the instrument to gain practical research experience, for example in the NSF-funded project \"Noyce Scholarships for STEM Teachers of Under-Represented Groups\". 20-30 graduate students/year will use the facility to pursue new avenues of research, ultimately contributing new skills to the Illinois STEM workforce. Positive societal impacts of the project also include agricultural and environmental advances. It will promote the USDA-funded development of pennycress as a new winter cover crop, reducing soil erosion and nitrogen runoff from barren fields while profitably producing oilseed for generating biofuels.\r\n\r\nThe microscope will support the projects of seven main research labs, advancing knowledge in genetics, cell biology, development, neuroscience, and plant science. Projects include:  regulation of protein quality control in response to aging and oxidative stress; interactions among proteins that control directional growth of plant cells; mechanisms of gene silencing and meiotic drive in fungi; effects of newly synthesized chemicals on parasitic Leishmania; how nematode worms detect and respond to magnetic fields; in vivo roles of the cell's cortical cytoskeleton in organismal development and tissue maintenance; and regulation of neural activity by sensory inputs and neuromodulators. New capabilities provided by the award will allow users to expand the scope of their research; the system will feature a broad range of excitation wavelengths; rapid scanning; high-sensitivity, low noise photon detectors; sub-200 nm spatial resolution; and fluorescence lifetime data. The users engage in nation-wide and international research collaborations, which will be expanded and strengthened by the added capabilities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>The grant funded the purchase of a major research instrument, a laser scanning confocal microscope, for use by scientists and trainees at Illinois State University (ISU) in Central Illinois. This is the main microscope in ISU's multi-user microscopy core facility, accessible to all labs at ISU. Since there was no comparable equipment in Central Illinois, the microscope was also made available to any interested scientists in the region. In confocal microscopy, lasers excite fluorescent molecules that tag various proteins and other cell structures, and the resulting fluorescence is detected. The optics exclude out-of-focus light, allowing for detailed high-resolution 3D reconstructions of cells and tissues. The purchased microscope is a Leica SP8 system outfitted with a pulsed White Light Laser (WLL). The WLL allows the user to (a) excite any visible-light fluorescent molecule at its optimal wavelength, thus boosting its signal, (b) create a \"spectral fingerprint\" of every pixel in a scanned image, and (c) measure the sample's fluorescence lifetime values (speed of fluorescence emission). These capabilities enable new types of experiments beyond those of a standard confocal microscope. The instrument has served 17 different research labs and logged a total of 64 unique research users (excluding training courses). Since its installation in 2019, the microscope has been an important tool in numerous scientific projects, helping researchers to make significant advances in the following areas of biology: the J. Dahl lab analyzed the effects of novel antimicrobials on bacteria; the N. Mortimer lab elucidated the mechanism of \"self\" versus \"nonself\" discrimination by the insect immune system; the K. Edwards lab determined the function and subcellular localization of Drosophila Dystrophin; the A. Vrailas-Mortimer lab analyzed how cells cope with protein aggregates; the A. Vidal-Gadea lab dissected the regulation of the Piezo mechanosensor gene in nematodes; the W. Stein lab probed the architecture of neuronal circuits in crustacean model systems; the V. Kirik lab studied proteins that control plant cell shape and division; the T. Hammond lab investigated heterologous gene expression in the Neurospora fungal model system; and the J. Sedbrook lab developed pennycress as a novel agricultural cover crop. Beyond promoting research, the major broader impact of the grant has been to allow training of undergraduate and graduate students in advanced fluorescence microscopy. This skill is highly desirable in biotechnology and biomedical jobs, and requires intensive hands-on training. The instrument allows ISU to prepare its trainees for the biotechnology workforce. In particular, individualized training was provided to 48 students via ISU's Confocal Microscopy course in 2019-22, and ten more in Summer Workshops in 2021-22. The facility has also served as a focal point for ISU outreach efforts, hosting local grade schoolers and high schoolers, international visiting students, and a Congressional delegation. The PI made a series of videos explaining the microscope and its capabilities, available on video sharing platforms. The users have also produced award-winning images that enhance public understanding of molecular cell biology.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/05/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kevin&nbsp;A&nbsp;Edwards</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1828136/1828136_10568229_1678063624764_PhoridOvaryEdwards--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1828136/1828136_10568229_1678063624764_PhoridOvaryEdwards--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Phorid fly oogenesis\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1828136/1828136_10568229_1678063624764_PhoridOvaryEdwards--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Phorid fly oogenesis\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Phorid flies have medical and ecological importance, but Phorid oogenesis is little-studied.
