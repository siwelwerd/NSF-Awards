 "awd_abstract_narration": "Darwin first used the term \"living fossils\" to describe a group of plants that had apparently survived intact for hundreds of millions of years.  During this time a wide range of environmental conditions occurred, including mass extinctions, and yet these plants survived. An intriguing question is how the living fossils were able to persist over millions of years and further, how their extant relatives diverged and evolved. Belonging to the cone-bearing, non-flowering group of plants, called gymnosperms, these species with huge and complex genomes could hold clues to understanding genomic resilience to environmental change. Advances in sequencing technologies are now available to answer these questions.  Very recently, approaches have become available to characterize these complex organisms genetically at a reasonable cost. This interdisciplinary team of researchers compare ancient and more highly evolved relatives to identify how genomes function, adapt and evolve. The project is dedicated to training the next generation of scientists and brings analytical and critical thinking skills to the general public through outreach activities. \r\n \r\nThree of the four extant gymnosperm lineages contain species which Darwin termed \"living fossils.\" These have been present since the Devonian Era and have survived an incredible range of environmental conditions. The genomes of almost all the gymnosperms are extremely large and complex and have been somewhat refractive to genomic characterization as a result.  However, the development of the Oxford Nanopore PromethION sequencer, which can provide extremely long reads (greater than 10 kb) at a reasonable cost, will be used to carry out detailed characterization of the genomes of these plants as well as their more modern, radiated lineages. In addition, the methylation status of these species will be analyzed from multiple tissues to understand epigenomic variability. Specific questions about genome resilience and evolutionary relationships will be addressed. Advances in single molecule sequencing technologies from this project will have broad impact across the life sciences. Educational and outreach programs are designed to improve public understanding or science through engagement with the New York Botanical Garden, and project personnel will contribute expertise to developing exhibits at the American Museum of Natural History. All data and technology advances will be publicly available through public repositories.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Gymnosperm, a broad class of plants, lineages include a mix of living fossils such as Wollemia nobilis (Wollemi Pine) and Metasequoia glyptostroboides along with more plants whose morphology have more recently changed, or radiated, such as Gnetum gnemon (Melinjo), Araucaria angustifolia (Parana Pine), and Juniperus communis (Common Juniper). Many of these exhibit distinctive traits shaped by their evolutionary histories and adaptations to their respective ecological niches. Due to this, they offer a unique opportunity to study the factors in their genomes that lead to their resiliency by comparing them to related species that have radiated to their current form more recently. Emerging as early as the Devonian period before the age of the dinosaurs, these species have survived environmental challenges, yet their genomes remain poorly understood due to their extraordinary size up to 20X larger than seed plants.
