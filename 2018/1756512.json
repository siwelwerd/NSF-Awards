 "awd_abstract_narration": "New Mexico has five major plant museums or herbaria, which contain a combined 300,000 specimens of dried, pressed plants that are invaluable scientific resources used to promote education, research and public engagement. More than 30% (or 120,000) of these unique specimens are housed in two herbaria at the New Mexico State University (NMSU), one of which is the State's oldest herbarium. Together the NMSU herbaria represent the premier plant reference resource for the southern half of New Mexico, adjacent states, and northern Mexico. The goals of the project are to consolidate the NMSU herbaria, modernize their collections data management infrastructure, and update their management procedures, ultimately preserving the collections long-term, while broadening the data accessibility for education, research, and public use. With a multidisciplinary team of botanical researchers and local science educators, a series of academic and outreach initiatives will be implemented to increase literacy in the plant sciences within different sectors of the population. At NMSU, an official Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI), researchers will pursue the recruitment and engagement of students, using hands-on experiences aimed at the care, protection and use of herbarium specimens and their associated data. Skills learned will improve participation in further education and training opportunities (e.g., graduate school) in STEM fields, while increasing downstream employment prospects. Through partnership with a local scientific education non-profit organization, the project will develop comprehensive botanical outreach materials to increase awareness and interest in natural history collections, plant biology and biodiversity, and biogeography among at least 1,500 K-12 students in an underserved Hispanic region located in southern New Mexico.\r\n\r\nActivities and expected outcomes include: 1) physical preservation, curation, and integration of herbarium specimens into a unified online digital herbarium (e.g., all specimens databased, barcoded, and imaged), 2) update of currently insecure, disparate databases of the herbaria into a single modern natural history collection management system, 3) acquisition of specimen data from a backlog of important uncurated specimens, 4) development of comprehensive botanical outreach and educational kits for local K-12 students, 5) training of undergraduate research assistants, and 6) implementation of professional workshops, and a crowdsourcing online campaign, all specifically tailored to a wide variety of stakeholders (e.g., students via NMSU's Graduate Certificate in Museum Studies, curators of other natural history collections on campus, land managers and owners, researchers, and citizen scientists). The collaborative nature of the project across campus and the region leverages knowledge and expertise in efficient and exciting directions, creating new research and outreach opportunities that make use of these important herbarium collections and their valuable and unique biodiversity information.  Specimen data will be shared with and made available through iDigBio (idigbio.org).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These specimens function collectively as an invaluable scientific resource that is used for a wide variety of purposes related to education, research and outreach/public service.\n\nAbout one-third of the state's herbarium specimens are housed at New Mexico State University, which has two historical herbarium collections:\n\nNMC, Biology Department Herbarium, founded in 1890, the oldest and second largest herbarium in the state\nNMCR, Range Science Herbarium, founded in 1932, and an important collection of plants related to rangelands and agriculture\n\n\nThe herbaria at NMSU represent the premier plant science resource for the southern half of New Mexico and the collections have strong floristic representation of the Chihuahuan Desert, surrounding states, and northern Mexico.\n\nPRIMARY GOALS AND ACTIVITIES OF THE PROJECT\n\nmodernize and consolidate the NMSU herbaria by merging NMC and NMCR physically and digitally\nimprove the physical condition of previously mounted specimens to ensure their long-term preservation\nincorporate the unprocessed, unmounted legacy specimen backlog\ncurate, database and image the entire combined collection of specimens\ndevelop modernized curatorial best-practices, standardized collection management policies, and a strategic plan\nbroaden data accessibility for better usage in education, research, and outreach activities\ncreate new educational plant science lessons each year emphasizing herbarium specimens and biodiversity collections to be taught to 1500 K-12 students from regional public schools\nincrease herbarium visitation to reduce \"plant blindness\" and promote the importance of specimen-based inquiry\n\n\nFINAL OUTCOMES: INTELLECTUAL MERIT &amp; BROADER IMPACTS\n\nAll of the project goals were met on budget and on time, despite significant setbacks due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020-2021, in-person gathering restrictions and local public school closures hindered digitization progress at NMSU and slowed the delivery of the outreach educational lessons to K-12 students. For several objectives, the expectations set at the beginning of the project were exceeded, in some instances by considerable measure (e.g. outreach productivity).\n\nMAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS\n\nall specimens of NMC (79,790) and NMCR (21,892) were fully integrated physically into one series following the latest taxonomic classification system, and the combined collection is now housed within a single room in a secure building (Fig. 1)\nca. 8,000 previously mounted specimens in poor condition were repaired to safeguard their future and quality\nthe legacy specimen backlog was evaluated curatorially, which resulted in the selection and mounting of 5,100 specimens for accession into the permanent collection\nthe combined NMC+NMCR collection currently totals 101,682 specimens (before the project the estimated size of the united NMSU herbaria ranged inaccurately from 90,000-120,000 specimens)\nevery specimen was curated nomenclaturally and annotated with the current accepted name whenever necessary following authoritative floras, taxonomic literature and plant databases\nall specimens in the unified collection were then barcoded, fully databased and imaged using a digital imaging system developed for this project (Fig. 2)\ndata missing from important legacy database fields (e.g. current identification, primary collector name and field number, major geographic designations, coordinates) were added to records as needed\nthe two legacy, offline, insecure, disparate databases of NMC (Filemaker Pro) and NMCR (Access) were merged into a single standardized dataset that was migrated into a modern natural history collection management system (Specify 6/7) capable of serving specimen data and images online (Fig. 3)\nprovided extensive training related to plant science, specimen curation, and digitization of large datasets for dozens of undergraduate and graduate research assistants\nthree (3) plant science lessons were developed via the NSF subaward with partner organization The Asombro Institute for Science Education (https://asombro.org) that promote specimen-based inquiry and the importance of herbaria and other biodiversity collections (Fig. 4); these lessons, designed for delivery in-person or online, reached more than 5,000 K-12 students in local public schools serving southern New Mexico (3rd, 4th, and 7th graders selected) --- proposal stated only 1,500 students would be reached (Table 1)\nseveral other outreach programs and professional workshops were created and presented to a diverse group of stakeholders (e.g., Native Plant Society, K-12 teachers, external researchers)\nthe herbarium experienced massive increases in herbarium visitation during the four year project (Fig. 5)\n\n\nThe NSF project completely revitalized and modernized the NMSU herbaria in every respect. We greatly appreciate the funding support, which has laid a solid foundation to continue increasing its scientific value to address the needs of a wide range of stakeholders.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/02/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Zachary S Rogers"
