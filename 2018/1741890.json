 "awd_abstract_narration": "Living and Learning STEM (L2S) is an S-STEM program at Lycoming College designed to attract and support 14-16 low-income, academically talented undergraduate students pursuing degrees in astronomy/physics, biology, chemistry or mathematics. L2S Scholars will be recruited from the local rural region and from national and regional charter school networks that are already part of existing educational partnerships. In addition, Lycoming College will adapt and implement strategies and practices that will address the academic, financial, and social factors underlying student retention and academic success.  Key components of this enhanced support include a living-learning community (LLC) that will house two cohorts of L2S scholars along with other non-participating STEM students; a mentorship program that establishes relationships with faculty, upperclassmen, alumni, and an STEM career advisor; and an enhanced academic experience program that will provide at least one guaranteed paid summer internship and/or research experience for each L2S Scholar. Finally, these strategies and practices will be integrated into a holistic system that ultimately ensures graduation of a maximum number of individuals who will enter the STEM workforce or continue to pursue graduate studies in STEM-related fields.\r\n\r\nThe impact of supports aimed at social interactions and psychosocial learning factors have been under-researched in STEM education in favor of more cognitive and behavioral factors.  The L2S project will generate knowledge about whether a STEM-based LLC, mentorships, and enhanced academic experiences will improve retention and graduation rates among academically talented, low-income STEM majors by minimizing feelings of social isolation and improving like-minded community interactions throughout their undergraduate tenure. Through assessment and evaluation, the project will measure the overall effectiveness of the program by collecting assessments from L2S scholars and their non-participating cohort. The project will also seek to empirically identify the variables of the program that best correlate with: (1) improved factors of psychosocial learning; (2) attraction/recruitment; (3) retention; and (4) graduation, thus allowing us to recommend improvements to the program as needed.",
