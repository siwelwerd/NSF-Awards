 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funds to partially support the 21st annual Conference Experience for Undergraduates (CEU), which is held as part of the Fall Meeting of the APS Division of Nuclear Physics. This year's meeting will be held jointly with the Physical Society of Japan in Waikoloa, Hawaii October 23 - 27, 2018. The CEU is a natural venue for students who have had an undergraduate research experience to present the results of their research and interact with other students as well as faculty and senior researchers. The CEU has been immensely successful in fostering this interaction, which helps students to have a broad introduction and exposure to research across nuclear physics, and to enable senior researchers to get to know some of the junior future leaders. Partial support will be provided for approximately 26 undergraduate students, out of a planned total of 136.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
