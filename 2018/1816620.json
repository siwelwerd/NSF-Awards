 "awd_abstract_narration": "People often assess complex information to make decisions. For example, reviewers assess student applications to make college admissions decisions. In such cases, people can be subject to reasoning biases that may lead to unfair or poor decisions.  Visuals, such as charts and graphs, can be used to support such complex processes. They can also help in countering some of the possible biases. This research will study the potential biases and how to reduce their effects with visual representations. The findings can be applied to support and improve many complex decision-making applications, including the college admissions process.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this research project is to identify and understand the potential cognitive biases in the holistic review process through ethnographic studies and to devise corresponding debiasing approaches using visualizations. This will be achieved through three primary research phases. The first phase will employ a cognitive task analysis and socio-organizational analysis to understand and characterize the holistic admissions process in terms of the data and tasks involved as well as the potential cognitive biases. In the second phase, the project team will explore the potential of visual representations for mitigating several of the candidate cognitive biases. Through systematic crowdsourced studies, the visual debiasing approaches will be evaluated and will result in a set of guidelines for integrating bias-mitigation strategies into visualization design. Finally, the third phase of the project will test the resulting guidelines in practice. The project team will design and develop a visual analysis tool for the holistic admissions process that integrates the effective visual bias-mitigating strategies. This tool will be evaluated through a three-month deployment study.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nPeople often review complex information to make assessments and ultimately decisions. For example, college admissions officers assess student applications to make college admissions decisions.  In such cases, people can be subject to reasoning biases that may lead to unfair or poor decisions.  In this project, we set out to understand these decision-making situations and where biases might be present in order to design and develop alternative interactive environments for supporting decision-making.  \nOur project produced three important contributions to the HCI research community.  First, we thoroughly characterized the holistic review process and identified where biases might be present and further, how visualization techniques could be employed to mitigate those biases.  Second, we conducted one large-scale experiment and showed that visualization can be effective in mitigating confirmation bias, but that this is a complicated situation and that a multidimensional approach is needed to reduce confirmation bias in non-experts.  Finally, we examined the use of a storytelling approach that supports a reviewer in leveraging concrete evidence from the student\u2019s application to construct narratives (with both pros and cons for an applicant) that are potentially less biased.  While this approach has not been experimentally assessed, we have developed a prototype tool and intend to to study its effectiveness in the near future.  \nThe results of this project and the future research opportunities opened up by it are particularly timely given the recent upheaval in university admissions processes.  It is now more important than ever to think creatively about how we both holistically evaluate an applicant while also mitigating potential biases and ultimately provide evidence-based reviews of those applicants.  This work is a step in that direction and has broader implications for both holistic university admissions as well as other holistic review processes.  Consider, for example, the peer review process that is typically applied to the review of academic publications as well as grant proposals.  These reviews are typically holistic in nature, require the application of various criterion, and often involve a \"storytelling\" phase where a lead reviewer must present the \"case\" for or against acceptance of a particular manuscript or grant proposal.  There are many similarities in this process and opportunities to perhaps apply the lessons learned in holistic admissions to these other holistic review processes.\nFinally, his project has also contributed to broadening participation in computing.  More specifically, it has supported 12 students from traditionally underrepresented groups in computing over the course of the grant. Of these students, 10 were undergraduate students and two were graduate students. Both graduate students completed their Ph.D. degrees and are now employed in the computing industry and academia.  Of the 10 undergraduate students, three are still completing their degrees, six have graduated and are in the computing workforce, and one is now a Ph.D. student in computer science. \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/02/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ronald Metoyer"
