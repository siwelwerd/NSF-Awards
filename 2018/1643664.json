 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hydroxyl radicals are responsible for removal of most atmospheric trace gases, including pollutants and important greenhouse gases.  They have been called the \"detergent of the atmosphere\". Changes in hydroxyl radical concentration in response to large changes in reactive trace gas emissions, which may happen in the future, are uncertain. This project aims to provide the first estimates of the variability of atmospheric hydroxyl radicals since about 1880 AD when anthropogenic emissions of reactive trace gases were minimal.  This will improve understanding of their stability in response to large changes in emissions. The project will also investigate whether ice cores record past changes in Southern Hemisphere westerly winds. These winds are a key component of the global climate system, and have an important influence on ocean circulation and possibly on atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.  The project team will include three early career scientists, a postdoctoral researcher, and graduate and undergraduate students, working in collaboration with senior scientists and Australian collaborators. \r\n \r\nFirn air and shallow ice to a depth of about 233 m will be sampled at the Law Dome high-accumulation coastal site in East Antarctica. Trapped air will be extracted from the ice cores on site immediately after drilling. Carbon-14 of carbon monoxide (14CO) will be analyzed in firn and ice-core air samples. Corrections will be made for the in situ cosmogenic 14CO component in the ice, allowing for the atmospheric 14CO history to be reconstructed.  This 14CO history will be interpreted with the aid of a chemistry-transport model to place the first observational constraints on the variability of Southern Hemisphere hydroxyl radical concentration after about 1880 AD. An additional component of the project will analyze Krypton-86 in the firn-air and ice-core samples. These measurements will explore whether ice-core Krypton-86 acts as a proxy for barometric pressure variability, and whether this proxy can be used in Antarctic ice cores to infer past movement of the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award supported work at Law Dome, Antarctica, to develop a new indicator of past storminess using the isotopes of ancient krypton and nitrogen trapped in air bubbles in the ice.  This effort was done in partnership with the Australian Antarctic program and the University of Rochester, USA.  The main objective of this collaboration was to measure past atmospheric cleansing via studies of carbon-14 in carbon monoxide, and UC San Diego's involvement was mainly the krypton-nitrogen storminess indicator.\n\nThe storminess indicator works by the fact that all gases in the snow layer on top of polar ice sheets are affected by gravitational settling, much as a bucket of muddy water will become clear if left to stand overnight (due to the greater weight of the dirt particles than the water).  Heavy gases like krypton settle to the bottom of this snow layer, making the krypton more abundant in the deep part of this snow layer.  Storms cause disturbance to this process, much as a hand dipped into a bucket of clarified water will stir up the mud.  Gases diffuse back to the gravitational equilbrium state after a disturbance.  But krypton diffuses more slowly than nitrogen, making it harder for krypton to re-establish equilibrium than for nitrogen. \n\nWe measure the amount by which krypton is more disturbed than nitrogen, and this quantity turns out to be directly proportional to the storminess at times in the past.  If there is no storminess, then both krypton and nitrogen are essentially at gravitational equilibrium.  But in most situations there are storms that pass by, in which the barometric pressure falls enough to cause krypton disequilibrium.  We call this process \"barometric pumping\", because the air in the snow layer moves up, and then later, down in response to the barometric pressure drop as the storm passes.  The air bubbles in glacial ice thereby trap a long record of ancient storminess, in principle going back at least 0.8 million years, the current age of the oldest ice cores.\n\nThe main reason we are interested in past storminess is that much evidence points to a southward shift of the storms around Antarctica during the end of the last glacial period.  This southward shift would have brought storms that were previously over the ocean onto the Antarctic continent, causing an increase in recorded storminess over Antarctica.  This hypothesized southward shift, in turn, may explain the cause of the end of the last ice age about 18,000 years ago, if it is supported by our new storminess indicator.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/21/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey P Severinghaus"
