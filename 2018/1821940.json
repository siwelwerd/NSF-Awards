 "awd_abstract_narration": "Adolescence is a period of dramatic neural reorganization and can be a vulnerable period.  Social, emotional, and cognitive capacities mature during adolescence. Life experiences of adolescents can play a significant role in shaping the maturing brain.  This award funds a symposium among a diversity of scientists and other professionals to examine topics such as  synaptic plasticity in adolescent brains, environmental factors influencing adolescent brain development, neuroimaging methods used to study the brain, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.  Approximately 200 people across a wide range of professions are anticipated to attend the symposium.  The broader impacts include enhanced understanding across multiple fields, which in turn, informs training, research, and policy.  In addition, a summary of the symposium will be published to reach a wider audience. The information presented will benefit society by informing researchers, and health care professionals about the vulnerability of the developing adolescent brain and how this vulnerability can contribute to adolescent well-being.\r\n\r\nThe adolescent brain experiences dramatic neural reorganization.  The mechanisms underlying decision-making and risky behaviors  of adolescents need to be examined with this reorganization in mind.  This award supports a symposium which will take place as a component of the 2018 Annual Meeting of the Developmental Neurotoxicology Society (DNTS). The symposium will bring together major contributors to the field of adolescent brain development. Presentations will address numerous topics such as (a) how endocannabinoids impact cortical development; (b) what neuroimaging has revealed about cortical network development; (c) how discord between impulsivity and control contribute to risky behaviors, and (d) how exposure to common stimulants  contribute to  abnormal brain functioning.  Experience-dependent plasticity will also be discussed.  Conference attendees will be researchers, policy makers, basic scientists, clinical researchers,  and government representatives (e.g., Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control). The symposium summary will be published as a means of making the information available to the scientific community.  A better understanding of the connection between environmental factors and brain development may help us determine how to foster well-being among adolescents in our society.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nExperience during adolescence shapes brain development: from synapses and networks to normal and pathological behavior\n\nThis project provided support for a symposium held during the Developmental Neurotoxicology Society/ Teratology Society Annual Meeting in Clearwater Florida, June 2018.  Experts who study adolescent brain development met to share information on the effects of human experience on cellular, circuit, network and behavioral brain development.  An important point is that the adolescent brain is far from mature and that substances such as alcohol, marijuana and nicotine can change the course of development.  The reward system, in particular, is highly vulnerable to the effects of these substances in that animal studies have shown that exposure during adolescence increases drug taking throughout life. The prefrontal cortex, or the part of the brain which controls executive function&mdash;planning, evaluating consequences, decision making&mdash;is not fully mature until the third decade of life.  All life experiences contribute both structurally and functionally to the final circuitry and resulting behaviors.  Data from human studies also showed that repeated activation of circuits (e.g., trying to control a tic in people with Tourette?s syndrome) results in altered maturation of the regions involved in the control.  In addition, the complex effects of peers on adolescent behavior was presented. The presence of peers increases risk taking behavior and imaging studies have shown that peer presence increases activation of the reward system.  Since the \"social brain\" (the brain networks responsive to social cues allowing us to recognize and evaluate mental states, feelings and actions of others) is especially activated and vulnerable during adolescence, we speculate that the current focus on social media may influence the maturation of the social brain in unknown ways.  This symposium highlighted the idea that experience, which is a natural occurrence during adolescence, alters brain structure and function and since many psychopathological conditions have origins in adolescence, further study of the effects of experience may help to unravel the causes for these serious mental diseases.\n\nThe individual speakers included:\n\n1)  Frank MacMaster, PhD on the maturation of the brain during adolescence as studied using imaging technologies\n\n2) Bradley S.
