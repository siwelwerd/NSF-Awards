 "awd_abstract_narration": "Friction and wear of materials accounts for enormous losses in performance and lifetime of materials, devices and structures, at considerable cost to the US manufacturing, energy, and infrastructure sectors. Approaches to mitigate friction and wear are thus beneficial to the US economy. This Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award supports scientific research to understand mechanisms of friction and wear in metal nitride coatings. Preliminary studies revealed metal nitride coatings are among the most wear-resistant materials ever discovered, showing promise for significantly reducing the financial and environmental impacts of wear. In this research project, thin layers of metal nitride compounds are synthesized and their friction and wear properties are investigated.  The aim of this work is to identify the relationships between how the films were created (processing) and their wear behavior (properties).  Understanding these relationships allows for enhanced control of the mechanical behavior, and can lead to high-performance wear-resistant materials for coatings.  The new materials developed are of broad importance for increasing efficiency and lifetime of mechanical systems, on both large and small scales.  The work is performed in collaboration with an industrial partner, Veeco CNT. The industry team is integrally involved in the studies, which provides both educational opportunities for students involved in the research and a path to commercialization for high-performance wear-resistant coating materials. \r\n\r\nThis research examines the fundamental relationships among processing, microstructure, and mechanical behavior in a class of transition metal nitrides deposited using plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition. The high degree of synthetic tunability in this deposition technique allows for tailoring of the film composition and microstructure.  Specifically, the fundamental role of composition on wear mechanism is investigated to determine the role of solid solution strengthening versus the formation of a lubricious wear-generated film in films with both vanadium and titanium cations. The impact of crystallite size on mechanical properties is determined for crystallite sizes in the 1-30 nm range using four independent synthesis parameters that control crystallite size. Adhesion and interface chemistry between the nitride films is investigated and related to macroscopic mechanical behavior, such as delamination, that is relevant to applications.  Taken together, these studies reveal fundamental wear mechanisms of this highly promising material that can be related directly to the synthesis and processing parameters.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\n\n\nThis project investigated the connection of mechanical properties and synthesis/growth conditions of transition metal nitride thin films grown using plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD). The overall goal of this project was to understand how synthesis conditions, such as temperature and electrical bias, impact film structure and chemistry, and how this in turn influences friction and wear behavior. PEALD is a thin film growth process whereby films are grown nearly one atomic layer at a time. This technique can deposit uniform thin films with very small thicknesses of a variety of materials. PEALD and ALD are currently used in manufacturing of electronic devices. Importantly, prior to this project, many details of how the film growth condition affect the resulting film and the film performance (for example, wear rates) were not known. This project sought to advance knowledge in this area. This project was a collaboration between Lehigh University, Florida State University, Veeco-CNT, and University of Maryland.\n\n\n\n\nIn this work we investigated several compositions including titanium molybdenum nitride, titanium vanadium nitride, and titanium hafnium nitride. We examined the role of composition, deposition temperature, and radio frequency (RF) biasing.\n\n\n\n\nThin film adhesion is an extremely important issue in a variety of materials and devices. In finding that the nitride film studied here did not always adhere well (delaminated) from the substrate, we undertook a purposeful study on what factors influence the adhesion. We varied the surface conditions of inorganic Si substrates including various cleaning processes and deposition of aluminum oxide before the deposition of the PEALD nitride films. We found that using ozone based cleaning of the surface resulted in the strongest adhesion, presumably due to removal of adventitious carbon species on the surfaces.\n\n\n\n\nWe investigated the effect of temperature on the friction and wear properties of titanium vanadium nitride thin films. We found that at lower temperatures, large amounts of carbon impurities were present in the films, they had low density, and were prone to very high wear rates. At higher temperatures, the films had less carbon, higher density, and lower wear rates. Thus, we showed that high density and removal of carbon from the films is essential to achieving low wear rates.\n\n\n\n\nWe investigated the role of substrate biasing during PEALD and its influence on film structure, chemistry, and wear behavior. Substrate biasing can change the interaction of plasma ions with the growing film, which can modify the film in many ways. We discovered that at low amounts of substrate electrical bias resulted in increased films compressive stress and decreases in wear rates. At high substrate bias, we found that films failed due to cracking or the growth rate decreased, presumably due to sputtering of the growing film by high energy plasma ions.\n\n\n\n\nBroader impacts of this project include student development, tool development, and educational materials development. Six PhD students and several undergraduate students were directly involved and benefitted from this project. Four PhD students who contributed have now graduated with positions at Sandia National Laboratories (2 students), Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Brookhaven National Laboratory.

Two students participated in NSF INTERN opportunities, one with Argonne National Laboratory and one with Brookhaven National Laboratory.
