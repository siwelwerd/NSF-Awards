 "awd_abstract_narration": "Every year, billions of animals migrate long distances. If animals with parasites are less likely to reach their destinations, then migration may allow populations to escape habitats where parasites build up over time. Understanding how animal migration affects the spread of disease is important to predicting disease risk, including to humans. This study focuses on monarch butterflies as a model system and explores the impacts of parasites on butterfly populations that migrate and populations that have recently lost their migratory habits. This study will also examine how non-migrating populations may influence the risk of having parasites by the migrating forms in areas where they come together. Field and experimental studies will also examine how these microscopic parasites influence how long butterflies live and their flight ability.  Through the high visibility and public appeal of monarchs, this project will support the participation of citizen scientists on a continental scale. The investigators will also mentor and train undergraduate and graduate students and will develop web and classroom based educational materials on host-parasite relationships and animal migration. This work will provide additional opportunities for middle school students and support k-12 activities. Finally, this work will inform efforts to conserve monarch butterflies and our understanding of how migration may influence the importance of parasites across many systems.  \r\n\r\nUsing a monarch butterflies and protozoan parasite system, the goal of this study is to examine how migratory and sedentary behaviors influence transmission risk and severity of infection. Research activities will integrate (i) an analysis of continent-wide citizen science databases to monitor monarch butterfly abundance and infection; (ii) field and experimental studies to test how monarch migratory behavior depends on non-native milkweeds and infection status, and to quantify parasite transmission rates; (iii) molecular genomics to ask whether genetic changes in sedentary populations might reinforce the loss of migratory behavior; and (iv) mathematical modeling to track how host and parasite populations respond to migratory vs. sedentary strategies. Information on the mixing of non-migrants and migrants, inferred from stable isotope analyses of field-collected monarchs, will inform mathematical models of interacting sedentary and migratory populations, to explore the consequences for disease spread and the persistence of migratory populations. The project will develop theory for how overlapping migration strategies alter, and are themselves affected by, parasite infection, and will shed light on the evolution of migration by characterizing genetic changes that accompany the recent formation of sedentary populations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In response to environmental changes such as habitat loss and climate change, some migratory species have responded by migrating shorter distances or arriving earlier to their spring breeding grounds each year. In cases where humans provide year-round resources, some animals have stopped migrating altogether, instead adopting a resident lifestyle and remaining in the same locations year-round. How these resident populations form and persist, and whether they continue to interact with remaining migratory populations is largely unknown. Importantly, resident populations often experience greater infection pressures by parasites and pathogens than migrants. Given that many migratory taxa face ongoing declines, scientists need to understand whether resident populations positively or negatively impact remaining migratory populations, including through their effects on disease.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">This project examined how shifts from migratory to resident behavior, as caused by human-associated environmental change, affect animal-parasite interactions. Research focused on an iconic migratory insect, the monarch butterfly, and its debilitating specialist protozoan parasite. Coincident with declines in the numbers of migratory monarchs in North America in recent decades, year-round resident monarch populations have proliferated in the southeastern U.S., in response to human planting of non-native tropical milkweed. In warmer regions that don&rsquo;t experience hard freezes, tropical milkweed provides a year-round resource to support monarch reproduction at times of year when the migratory population historically overwinters in Mexico in a non-reproductive state. Using field data, volunteer-based reports, laboratory experiments, and mathematical models, researchers supported by this project asked: (1) How and why do resident populations form and persist; (2) How does parasite transmission differ between migratory and resident populations, and (3) How do interactions between migrants and residents influence their population numbers and parasite transmission?&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Results from this project showed that exposure to tropical milkweed disrupts the monarchs&rsquo; fall migration and fosters the formation and persistence of resident behavior. Specifically, monarch caterpillars raised on non-native tropical milkweed had a lower probability of entering their pre-migratory state in the fall. Moreover, adult butterflies that were already migrating in the fall were more likely to drop out of the migration when exposed to tropical milkweed. Field and modeling work showed that the parasite can increase quickly to infect the majority of butterflies in resident populations owing to its three-pronged transmission strategy (parent-to-offspring, environmental, and adult-to-adult transmission). Community science data and field observations showed that parasite infection prevalence reaches high levels in the extreme southern U.S. at sites where tropical milkweed has been planted, and that migrants and residents interact (mix together) at these sites during the spring and fall migration. The high infection prevalence observed in resident monarchs is not due to warmer temperatures in the southern U.S. In fact, laboratory experiments showed that the protozoan parasite does not replicate or survive well when exposed to sustained high heat. Importantly, analysis of multi-decadal trends in parasite infection prevalence across North American monarchs showed that the parasite has more than tripled in baseline prevalence in recent years (now at ~15%) relative to pre-2002 levels (2-5%), likely owing to sustained parasite transmission in resident monarchs and spillover infections from residents to migrants. Thus, the parasite now could cause the deaths of tens of millions of monarchs each year during their annual migration, and could be an emerging threat to the long-term health and persistence of migratory monarchs.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Intellectual Merit:</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Results of this project contributed to the fields of host-parasite ecology and partial migration, by examining the population-wide conservation implications of habitat sharing and parasite transmission between residents and migrants.
