 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many animals change their behavior in response to seasonal changes in the environment. The molecular nature of the changes that occur in the brain to alter behavior in a seasonal manner remains poorly understood. This project will examine epigenetic changes, i.e. changes in external modifications to DNA, that turn behavior-regulating genes on or off in a season-dependent manner. The work will be carried out using behavioral approaches and DNA sequencing of the genome of the long-distance migratory monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus. The monarch exhibits extreme seasonal behavioral changes at the individual level in response to changing daylength and temperature. Migratory monarch butterflies accomplish an extraordinary journey of 2,000 miles from the United States to their overwintering sites in Mexico by flying southward in the fall. In the spring, migratory butterflies flip their flight orientation northward and return to the United States. This project will reveal seasonal epigenetic changes to the genome in the brains of these seasonal forms. These findings will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying seasonal migration and the production of distinct seasonal flight orientations, and may be applicable to other migratory species. They could also have implications for conservation strategies to help preserve the iconic monarch migration, a spectacular yet threatened biological phenomenon. The project will provide valuable research training for students interested in animal behavior, neuroscience, and bioinformatics, including students from groups underrepresented in STEM fields. The researchers will also develop outreach activities devoted to increase public awareness for the need of monarch habitat conservation efforts.\r\n\r\nSeasonal behavioral adaptations are key to the ecological success of many animals. The behavioral plasticity observed in individuals in response to seasonal changes in the environment strongly suggests that epigenetics play a crucial role in shaping seasonal behavior. However, the epigenetic changes that link brain function to seasonal regulation of behavior remain largely unknown. This project will leverage the remarkable seasonal plasticity of monarch butterfly migratory behavior in response to seasonal changes in the environment (daylength, temperature) to delineate the genome-wide epigenetic architecture in the brain that underlies seasonal migratory behavior and flight orientation. The goal of the project is to identify active cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and putative transcription factors (TFs) that mediate differential gene expression in the brains of non-migrants, fall migrants and spring remigrants. The researchers will use fall migrants and fall migrants reprogrammed into spring remigrants in controlled conditions and a combination of next-generation sequencing technologies. Genes differentially expressed in the brains of these seasonal forms will be identified by RNA-seq, and open genomic regulatory regions and CREs that mediate this differential expression will be identified by ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq of histone marks. Candidate transcription factors (TFs) responsible for the seasonal behavioral reprogramming will ultimately be identified through DNA genomic footprinting within CREs. The project will have broad societal impacts through outreach activities devoted to increase public awareness for the need of monarch habitat conservation efforts, and research training of students interested in animal behavior, neuroscience, and bioinformatics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The molecular mechanisms that link brain function to seasonal regulation of migratory behavior remain, however, largely unknown in any species. With support from this award, we leveraged the behavioral plasticity observed within individuals of the North American long-distance migratory monarch butterfly to fill this gap in knowledge. Monarchs fly south in the fall and reverse their flight orientation to the north in the spring in response to prolonged exposure to low temperatures at their overwintering sites, strongly suggesting that epigenetics play a crucial role in shaping seasonal behavior. We reasoned that reprogramming of the transcriptional landscape in the monarch brain may underlie the behavioral plasticity in seasonal flight orientation. Using genomic tools that include RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq, from brains of wild-caught fall migrants, wild-caught fall migrants exposed to overwintering-like coldness (reprogrammed spring re-migrants), and wild-caught spring re-migrants, we uncovered a previously unappreciated differential seasonal expression of genes controlled by the circadian clock, a 24-hr time keeping system that synchronizes an organism&rsquo;s physiology and behavior with the environmental light:dark cycle. We also discovered that genes encoding integrins were significantly enriched among down-regulated genes in both wild-caught and reprogrammed spring re-migrants as compared to fall migrants, and that these integrin genes were exclusively expressed in a single cell type corresponding to surface glia. In <em>Drosophila</em>, surface glia is itself surrounded by a dense network of extracellular matrix (ECM) that contains collagen type IV deposited by hemocytes, which together form the blood-brain barrier (BBB) that encapsulates the brain and protects it from uncontrolled entry of toxic substances and regulate the entry of chemicals for normal brain function. Integrins are cell surface adhesion receptors that link the ECM to the cell cytoskeleton. Interestingly, <em>alpha-1 subunit of collagen type IV</em> was previously found to be under divergent selection between migratory and non-migratory populations. Thus, our work highlight for the first time a critical role for the BBB in the regulation of orientation behavior in a migratory species, whereby downregulation of <em>integrins</em> in the BBB may result in its permeabilization upon sustained cold exposure and promote the entry of neuromodulators to regulate the neural circuit responsible for flight orientation. Finally, the application of additional genome-wide sequencing approaches, namely Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) of histone marks, allowed us to identify cis-regulatory elements and characterize their transcriptional states (active vs. poised/inactive) to determine if their status correlate with differential gene expression and whether environmentally-responsive transcription factors rewire specific transcriptional programs in different migratory states. Ultimately, the strategies we developed to interrogate and probe the genome of the monarch species will likely facilitate the development of functional genomics in many other non-traditional insect species that are increasingly used for tackling important biological questions in a wide range of disciplines.
