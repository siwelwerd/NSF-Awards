 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Partner to Existing Networks (PEN) award to the Idaho Museum of Natural History to partner with the Open Vertebrate (oVert) Thematic Collections Network (TCN).  The oVert TCN is creating high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) data for internal anatomy across the diversity of vertebrate animals.  Using computed tomography (CT) scanners at institutional collections across the US, more than 20,000 fluid-preserved specimens will be scanned and made available online for open public use.  This PEN complements the oVert TCN program by including vertebrate animals too large to be preserved in fluid or scanned by conventional CT scanners.  The oMEGA PEN will use portable surface scanners to provide high-resolution scans of skeletons of large vertebrate animals curated at Harvard, Berkeley, and California Academy of Sciences.  The addition of large vertebrates, including whales and elephants, provides an important segment of the animal world to open access collections for researchers and educators.  The process of creating this 3D resource will provide training for undergraduate students, and on-site workshops for collections staff.  Skeletal models will support TCN activities in creating K-12 STEM lesson plans and 3D-printable resources for the classroom.  \r\n\r\nThe digitized skeletons acquired in this PEN will help fill a major gap in the original TCN and support its research theme on the evolution of vertebrate morphological diversity.  By virtue of their large size, vertebrates exceeding 250 kg define upper boundaries of size-dependent anatomical form and function, and therefore push the limits on development and physiology.  These skeletal data will provide new opportunities to evaluate gigantism and the tendency of animal lineages toward ever-larger body size.  Combined with the other oVert 3D specimens, the TCN's digital collection distributed through MorphoSource and iDigBio will inspire new research questions and provide the raw materials to test hypotheses in a broad range of biosciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This is a contribution to the Online Vertebrate (oVert) database available to the public at morphosource.org. The collection includes 3D surface scans of 9,324 bones from 160 unique species, including several endangered or threatened animals. The project fills a significant gap in the oVert database with animals too large for CT scanning, and include species having the broadest public appeal for education, scientific, and artistic reference. The skeleton collection includes a wide range of hooved mammals, carnivores, seals, dolphins and whales from the collections of Harvard (MCZ), California Academy of Sciences (CAL), Berkeley (MVZ), and Idaho Museum of Natural History (IDS), among others. The largest individual, a 22-meter-long blue whale from the Noyo Center, is included with humpback and killer whales. Other noteworthy species included in this collection are the Sumatran rhinoceros, Asian elephant, Bengal tiger, Baird's beaked whale, Dromedary camel, California brown bear, a variety of seals, river dolphin, both white and black rhinoceros, water buffalo, hippopotamus, and the skulls of a Tasmanian wolf and Komodo dragon.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This project contributed substantially to the education of 11 Idaho State University students through the Idaho Virtualization Lab at IMNH.
