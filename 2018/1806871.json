 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern physics rests on two widely successful theories: Einstein's General Relativity (GR) and quantum physics.  The former describes all known gravitational phenomena on scales larger than micrometers, the latter describes the atomic and subatomic world.  Physicists widely conjecture that the two are merged in an as yet unknown unified theory.  Much recent work in the literature has revealed the possibility that observable hints of such a unified theory could arise as violations of the foundations of General Relativity theory, including local Lorentz symmetry, which encapsulates the principles of Special Relativity.  These studies will investigate new types of signals for Lorentz violation in experiments and observations ranging from Earth laboratory experiments to distant pulsar observations and gravitational waves.  Undergraduate research projects and outreach opportunities are planned in this proposal.\r\n \r\nThe supported work will make use of an effective field theory framework for describing generic spacetime-symmetry violation that has been widely adopted in recent years.  A significant part of the work will involve phenomenology and analysis in precision Solar-system tests of gravity including Earth-laboratory tests and space-based tests.  Building on prior work, the PI will also further develop the effective field theory framework in the area of beyond solar-system astrophysics and apply the results to gravitational waves and observations of pulsar systems.  The PI will also investigate the match of specific proposed models, used widely in the literature, to this test framework with the goal of constraining these models with existing and future measurements.  By providing motivation and additional areas in which to search for new physics beyond GR, this work will positively impact researchers involved in precision tests of GR in Earth laboratories, solar-system tests, and those working on gravitational wave observations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe work in this proposal focused on Einstein's General Relativity theory of gravity, which describes gravity as manifesting via the spacetime structure of the universe.  While widely successful in describing gravitational phenomena like black holes, gravitational waves and cosmology, physicists have yet to combine with quantum theory into a unified theory of physics.\n\nPhysicists worldwide are interested in uncovering new physics by testing General Relativity principles with ever-increasing precision.  This work in this proposal studied these possibilities using a test framework for describing general spacetime-symmetry violations, spacetime symmetry being a core principle of General Relativity.\n\nThe Principle Investigator (PI) and collaborators performed analysis of tests in distant pulsar systems.  They also worked on near-Earth tests like precision lunar laser ranging observations of the Moon\u2019s orbit. Furthermore, detailed analysis of the new prolific gravitational wave data has begun, and holds great promise as there are now over 50 events to analyze.  So far, General Relativity appears to hold up to these tests, within experimental uncertainty.\n\nOn the theoretical side, the PI and collaborators studied scenarios where spacetime symmetries could be broken in various candidate models.  They investigated the intriguing question of whether hypothetical background fields causing spacetime-symmetry violation are given a priori, or whether they could arise through an elegant spontaneous-symmetry breaking process, the latter scenario would indicate the presence of new forces in nature.  The theoretical works supported by this grant will spur more research to come in the future in this area.\n\nThe PI collaborated internationally on this proposal with top institutions from China and France and ones in the United States.  Undergraduate students took up several research projects with the support of this proposal and contributed towards publications as well as presenting work at conferences.  \n\nBottom line: our understanding of the foundations of General Relativity were advanced by this work.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/30/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Quentin G Bailey"
