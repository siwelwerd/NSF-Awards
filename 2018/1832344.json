Both fundamental aspects including transport studies at the nano, micro, and mini scales as well as practical applications including thermal management, energy conversion, lab on a chip, and biomedical devices are included. The insights obtained from the close interaction allowed by this conference will pave the way for the implementation of novel methods for transport physics in a range of applications.\r\n\r\nThe ICNMM conference is one of the premier annual events for researchers in fields related to transport\r\nphenomena. The conference (1) advances the fundamental understanding of transport physics; and (2)\r\ndiscusses the fundamental physics related to modern electronic devices, biomedical, and energy\r\napplications. In particular, the plenary speakers for this conference represent a broad spectrum of fields including two-phase transport physics, transport phenomenal in micro and nanofluidic systems, and electrokinetic systems. The conference also includes nine confirmed Keynote presentations, covering a broad variety of disciplines and institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
