 "awd_abstract_narration": "The insect collection at the Museum of Northern Arizona (MNA) spans nearly 100 years, focusing on the iconic Grand Canyon ecoregion and surrounding landscapes.  Many specimens were collected at springs - critical ecosystems that support unusually high levels of biodiversity and unique species compared with the surrounding landscape.  Through this award 120,000 well-documented insect specimen records and 1,000 high-resolution images will be digitized and contributed to the InvertEBase Thematic Collection Network (TCN).  MNA staff will conduct three workshops on specimen identification and imaging, and will train and mentor students, including those from under-represented groups, to learn about museum curation, imaging, data management, and biodiversity research. The MNA will also present an interactive exhibit on the biodiversity of invertebrates on the Colorado Plateau and Grand Canyon.  Designed to appeal to all age groups, the exhibit will consist of photographs and information about the region's most compelling species, with taxonomy, distribution, evolutionary history, ecological roles, and conservation status.  \r\n\r\nThe data digitized through this project will fill critical gaps on species geographic ranges and contribute taxa currently not included in InvertEBase, with a representation of Odonata, Mantodea, Blattodea, Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, and non-insect terrestrial Arthropoda (Myriapoda, Arachnida and Crustacea).  Specimens include records of rare, endangered, and undescribed species.  MNAInverts, an online relational database, will serve as a platform to facilitate identification and georeferencing of specimens, and to streamline quality control procedures.  Georeferencing of collection localities will increase their value for range mapping and biogeographical studies.  The resource will include annotated, stacked, high resolution images of exemplar specimens from the region.  To facilitate identification, important morphological character states essential for diagnosis at the species level will be noted.  The project will advance public and scientific understanding of the complexity and importance of aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates to the ecological integrity of the Southwest.  The MNA's contribution of occurrence data and images will augment the representation and distribution of Mollusca and Arthropoda in the InvertEBase TCN and will be shared with iDigBio (www.idigbio.org).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
