 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research training for the next generation of marine scientists and oceanographers is an important focus for the Division of Ocean Sciences. Tomorrow's oceanographers require technological, interdisciplinary training that few undergraduates have experienced. Research Internships in Ocean Science (RIOS), the REU site hosted by the Department of Marine and Coastal Sciences at Rutgers University, is designed around mentors drawn from an internationally recognized faculty, high caliber research facilities, access to multiple coastal sites, a commitment to undergraduate hands-on research experiences, and strong programs in marine science and outreach. Through independent projects and team research experiences, students focus on process-oriented concepts and techniques applicable in any marine ecosystem. \r\n\r\nThe Rutgers REU Site will provide a total of twenty-four undergraduates with internships over the two-year period. The goal of RIOS is to enable students interested in ocean sciences to participate in meaningful, interactive research directed by an enthusiastic, experienced group of mentors. Group activities and independent research are embedded within ongoing programs, many of which are focused on the New Jersey continental shelf and adjacent estuaries. At the beginning of each summer internship, a four-day orientation introduces students to ongoing research, focusing on the Raritan River-Raritan Bay and the Mullica River-Great Bay systems. The two estuaries provide a sharp contrast in their human impacts on coastal ecosystems. During the first week, students also consult with mentors, and attend workshops on how to formulate a research question and write a proposal. Students then begin research projects either at the main campus in New Brunswick, NJ or at the Rutgers University Marine Field Station (RUMFS) in Tuckerton, NJ. Students make oral progress reports of their research in a mid-program workshop, receive instruction on how to write up and analyze their data, and how to prepare a poster for the final poster session.\r\n\r\nStudents will conduct independent research projects with the guidance of research mentors and will participate in a variety of professional development activities, including workshops on scientific ethics, scientific writing, the graduate school experience and career options, as well as field trips and outreach events. The program conducts a national search for applicants and seeks to engage students who are from schools with limited research opportunities. Most of the funding provided supports student stipends, housing and travel to attend the program. This project supports the national goals of developing the next generation of scientists and the scientific workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
