 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research will seek to improve understanding of aerosol's impacts on climate change and air pollution; this has implications for health as well as societal impacts. In addition, a variety of education, field experiment and research opportunities will be available for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) undergraduate students as after class research experiences. The project also provides support and training for a HBCU graduate student and a postdoctoral fellow. Moreover, there will be plenty of opportunities to introduce aerosol radiative forcing and remote sensing as real examples in undergraduate and graduate geoscience courses to help students to improve their research techniques and develop their theses and dissertation topics.\r\n\r\nAerosols have cooling effect on climate system through reflecting solar radiation. At the same time, some aerosols e.g. black carbon, can absorb solar radiation, which cools the surface but warms the atmosphere in the process. These effects of aerosols on radiation, the temperature profile, along with the role of aerosols as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), impact the radiative balance through the direct radiative effects of aerosols and indirect radiative effects on cloud properties and precipitation. To estimate aerosol effects on radiative forcing, knowing information about vertical distribution of aerosols is crucial since the vertical distribution of aerosols has a significant effect on the sign of radiative forcing. This research will develop a new aerosol vertical distribution retrieval algorithm which can take advantage of broad ceilometer networks on aerosol vertical distribution observations. Then the variability of aerosol vertical distributions and the impacts on radiative forcing and heating rate profile will be investigated. The investigated climate regions include areas of rural, suburban-urban, urban, urban-dust and ocean areas from mid-latitude to tropics. This research will investigate three scientific questions: (1) What are the characteristics of aerosol vertical distributions at different regions and seasons? (2) what are impacts of the aerosol vertical distribution on radiative forcing? and (3) what are the characteristics of heating rate profile associated with aerosols at different regions and seasons?\r\n\r\nAerosols direct and indirect effects on radiative forcing is still one of the largest uncertainties in global climate models (IPCC, 2013) and the uncertainty in the aerosol vertical distribution alone can contribute as much half of the uncertainties of the global aerosols direct effect. The information of aerosol vertical distribution is needed to quantify the effects of aerosols on radiative forcing and how these in turn influence climate and the hydrological cycle. This study will enhance our understanding of aerosol vertical distributions though a new retrieval algorithm. It will improve the study of aerosol direct effects on radiative forcing as well as the indirect effects due to aerosol-cloud-precipitation interaction. It will aid to improve aerosol parameterizations and then improve air quality prediction, weather forecast and climate models.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nExtensive research has demonstrated that airborne particulate matter, also referred to as atmospheric aerosols, can have complex effects on the Earth\u2019s climate system.  The effects of atmospheric aerosols depend on their concentration, vertical location and distribution within the atmosphere, and chemical composition.  Generally speaking, aerosols that primarily cause backscattering of solar radiation lead a cooling effect in the climate system. Certain aerosols e.g. black carbon can absorb solar radiation, which cools the surface but warms the atmosphere in the process. These combined effects of aerosols on radiation and the temperature profiles of the surface and atmosphere require detailed measurements and characterization in order to improve our understanding of the influence of the various types of aerosols mixtures and distributions on the temperature profiles of the atmosphere.  The measurements can inform the development of mathematical equations that can be incorporated into climate models to improve climate predictions. \n\n \n\nAnother complicating factor associated with atmospheric aerosols involves their role as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) &ndash; the particles that seed the growth of clouds - and the interactions of aerosols with clouds.  These phenomena are referred to as aerosol indirect effects.  They can affect cloud lifetime, cloud optical properties, and alter precipitation patterns observed for several cloud types.  Thus, a knowledge of the vertical distribution of aerosols is crucial for obtaining reliable estimates of the aerosol effects on climate. \n\n \nThis project aimed to develop the daily mean aerosol vertical distribution across a wide range of atmospheric condition above two atmospheric observational facilities.  One was located between Washington, DC and Baltimore Maryland.  This suburban region is important because it is more representative of where people live than the typical remote sites that are used to provide information for climate models.  The other observational facility was located in a remote continental field site in Oklahoma.  Finally, a third data set obtained in the remote tropical Atlantic Ocean on a research vessel will be compared.  This data set derives from the AEROsols and Ocean Science Expeditions (AEROSE).  The AEROSE missions are a series of sea-going research campaigns that collect a comprehensive suite of observations to characterize desert dust and biomass burning air masses that originate in the Saharan desert and travel across the tropical Atlantic Ocean.\n\n \n\nA second goal of the project was to quantify the impacts of aerosol vertical distribution on the energy redistribution in the atmosphere. Specifically, two model parameters were projected for evaluation; direct radiative forcing and heating rate profile.\n\n \n\nThe research involved in three distinct objectives/steps:\n\n1.     Constructing the data set by merging observations from several different instruments.\n\nThe deliverable for this objective is a quality-assured data set that includes ceilometer backscatter measurements, aerosol types, the vertical distribution of water vapor, meteorological conditions and aerosol extinction coefficient profiles at each site.\n\n2.     Evaluating a retrieval algorithm (the Klett-Fernald retrieval algorithm) for efficiency.\n\nThis objective is aimed at determining whether a specific mathematical representation of the data could be used to improve descriptions of the backscatter from aerosol vertical distributions in climate models. The algorithm was evaluated by using aerosol vertical distributions derived from a Raman Lidar.\n\n3.     Investigating characteristics of aerosol vertical distributions.\n\na)     The algorithm in objective 2 was used to discriminate between the effects of aerosol type and vertical distributions in different regions (remote continental, urban-suburban, and remote ocean) across the seasons on vertical temperature and heating rate profiles.\n\nb)    A detailed data set that contains the aerosol loading, optical properties, and their atmospheric effects will be developed in parallel with the analyses above.  This data set will be made available to future researchers to address questions of climate significance related to atmospheric aerosols.\n\nWhile some of the research was disrupted due to health complications from COVID, the first two objectives were achieved.  Specifically, the collection of the datasets and application of the retrieval of aerosol vertical profile algorithm to the data. A comprehensive data set was generated for remote continental, suburban-urban, and maritime subtropical to tropical Aerosols and Ocean Science Expedition (AEROSE) climate regions.\n\nThe third objective was partially achieved.  It was determined through this project that the observations were not sufficient to fully characterize the complexity of the aerosol impacts due to high variability in the observed data.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/22/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Vernon R Morris"
