 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nHawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT):  2018-2023\r\n\r\nSystematic long-term (greater than a few decades in length) time-series observations of aquatic and terrestrial environments have led to a more comprehensive understanding of the natural ecosystem variability and have enabled an assessment of human impacts on ecosystem dynamics.  Because of their ability to store and transport large amounts of heat and to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the world's oceans play a critical role in modulating environmental conditions for the sustained well-being of both land-based and marine organisms including humans.  Despite their recognized scientific and societal importance, long-term records of key ocean processes are rare.  In 1988, two ocean time-series programs were established: one in the North Atlantic near Bermuda and the other, the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) program, near Hawaii.  For the past three decades, teams of scientists based at the University of Hawaii have made critical measurements of the 'state of our sea.'  These long-term observations have established a baseline against which future states can be compared.  The ship-based HOT program complements other diverse ocean observation programs including remote-sensing via satellites, moored buoys, profiling floats, and autonomous underwater vehicles.  All HOT program data are publicly available and are frequently used by researchers and policy makers around the world.  Education, outreach, and training will continue to play prominent roles in the HOT program.  HOT provides a unique teaching and learning platform for high school, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students and teachers from Hawaii and around the world.  The frequent cruises provide opportunities for students to gain first-hand exposure to ocean research.  In addition, HOT is a community resource that helps to support the efforts of numerous scientists worldwide who rely on the program's infrastructure (ship time, staff, laboratories, equipment) to conduct their own research, education, and outreach activities.  HOT program data are also widely used in classrooms and appear in textbooks on ocean science.  These sustained, interdisciplinary measurements are crucial for the validation of models that seek to predict global environmental change and its impact on society.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scientific mission of HOT is to investigate temporal dynamics in the cycling of carbon (C) and associated bioelements, and to observe the variability of hydrographical and ecological properties, heat fluxes, and circulation of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG), one of the largest biomes on Earth.  The proposed research will rely on shipboard measurements and deployments of in situ arrays conducted on 10 separate 5-day expeditions per annum, observations from a fleet of remotely operated vehicles, near-continuous moored platform measurements, and deep-moored sediment traps.  These diverse modes of observation, in conjunction with the extant HOT database, will document variability in ocean properties and processes over time scales ranging from diel to decadal.  This project maintains the high quality suite of biogeochemical and physical measurements required for the assessment of ocean C and nutrient pools and fluxes, plankton community structure, ecosystem productivity, and inherent optical properties of the water column.  Extending the length of program observations by an additional five years improves the value of the data sets for deciphering how low-frequency natural and anthropogenic signals influence ecosystem structure in the NPSG. The HOT site is one of only a few in the world where sustained air-sea carbon dioxide flux, primary production, export fluxes, upper ocean physical data, and meteorological observations are routinely made.  Such efforts continue to aid on-going modeling efforts required for predicting how future habitat perturbations may influence ecosystem dynamics in the NPSG and are crucial for the validation of models that seek to predict global environmental change and its impact on society.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

One salient outcome of the ~35 year record at HOT is a clear demonstration that the ocean varies over a range of time scales, with anthropogenic forcing contributing an added layer of complexity. In the growing effort to distinguish between natural and human-induced variability, sustained ocean time-series such as HOT are of critical importance as they represent one of the few long-term, temporally resolved observing assets scientists have to characterize and quantify marine ecosystem response to a highly dynamic and changing climate system. Two exemplar outcomes of this effort include characterization of the seasonality and trends in ocean productivity and ocean acidification. Specifically, HOT data has revealed an unexpected increase in rates of primary production, the metabolic process that fuels and supports ocean food chains. Layered over seasonal, interannual, and quasi-decadal variability in rates of production, is a significant linear increase in the 0-200 m depth-integrated rate of primary productivity, with a large relative increase in the lower portion (75 -125 m) of the sunlit zone of the water column (Figure 1). We hypothesize this trend to be a consequence of anthropogenic nutrient additions to the open ocean. Changes in the chemical composition of seawater are also emerging. In response to rising carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the HOT program has documented progressive decreases in seawater pH (Figure 2) with apparent acceleration of acidification in the mesopelagic (~500 m). These documented patterns in ocean biology and chemistry illustrate how HOT has served to provide reference baselines for essential ocean variables. These data help to characterize natural patterns of ocean system variability and associated links to regional climate indices, as well as support calibration/validation of autonomous <em>in situ </em>and remote (satellite, airborne) sensors (Figure 1). The measurements collected through the HOT program are augmented by continuous measurements at the surface by the Woods Hole - HOT (WHOTS) mooring, a designated \"Ocean Reference Station,\" and the ALOHA Cabled Observatory (ACO).&nbsp;Together, HOT, WHOTS and ACO provide complete water-column measurements at high precision and temporal resolution.
