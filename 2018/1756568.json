 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite its critical importance for the global heat and carbon cycles, the Southern Ocean, the vast ocean surrounding the Antarctic continent, is the least understood region of the world ocean, particularly because of sparse observations and our incomplete understanding of high latitude processes such as deep sea convection, the mixing and subsequent homogenization of water column properties over thousands of meters depth. Many climate models simulate strong open sea deep convection within the Weddell and occasionally the Ross Sea, with periods ranging from decades to centuries. This process brings a large amount of heat from the subsurface and releases it to the atmosphere, changing ocean and atmospheric temperatures and winds globally, and producing large holes in sea-ice called polynyas. Interestingly, the largest Weddell Sea polynya observed since the 1970s was seen from satellite pictures this past (2017) October, making an understanding of polynyas ever more urgent. The mechanisms underlying Southern Ocean convective variability, the reasons that it differs widely across climate models, and the impacts of variability on ocean circulation, heat and salt cycles remain unclear. This makes it difficult to determine whether models simulate (or fail to simulate) Southern Ocean convection for the right reasons, whether such events are likely to reoccur and whether past changes in convection are exerting an impact on the course of modern climate. This proposal will directly inform the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC-AR6) assessment project, focusing on a previously understudied area, expanding our fundamental knowledge of the Southern Ocean and its role in the global climate system, and developing new model diagnostics. By providing insights into the relationship between deep ocean convection and ocean/climate indices on multiple timescales, this proposal will potentially inform design of future observational networks. The proposed work will enhance education and dissemination of research via undergraduate teaching and strong outreach activities both in West Philadelphia, where Dr. Marinov will partner with a public elementary school, and in Baltimore, where Dr. Gnanadesikan will continue his strong involvement in the Science Olympiad.\r\n\r\nThe project is organized around four major scientific questions and underlying hypotheses:1. What produces SO deep convection and determines its frequency and intensity across coupled climate models? 2. What are the global oceanic implications of Southern Ocean convection? 3. How do changes in convection impact the transient climate response and climate sensitivity? 4. How do eddy parameterizations and model construction affect the representations of SO convection and resulting oceanic teleconnections? The team will run a set of new simulations and PIs will analyze (a) a suite of models already run at Johns Hopkins (JHU), (b) a suite of new model runs at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GDFL), (c) models submitted to the IPCC-AR5/IPCC-AR6 as part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project versions 5 and 6 (CMIP5,6). PIs will examine how different models become \"preconditioned\" for convection by producing a buildup of heat at depth or salt anomalies at the surface; how convective variability produces changes in key water masses and how heat, salt, mass transport signals evolve over time. They will examine the impact of convective variability within a large ensemble of the same coupled climate model, as well as within versions of the GFDL models which differ in model construction (hybrid vs. level coordinate), resolution (1 vs. \u00bc  degree ocean), and eddy mixing coefficients. A side benefit of the proposal will be building a set of novel metrics than can be used for routine benchmarking and evaluation of GFDL and CMIP6 models. These metrics will help evaluate strengths/weaknesses of SO simulations, including tracking corrections in long-standing model errors from one model generation to another.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

But is is a key part of the Earth's climate system, as it is here that waters from the deep ocean are drawn up to the surface by these same winds. The subsurface waters are slightly denser than the surface waters because they are slightly saltier- but they are also warmer.&nbsp; As they are brought to the surface rainfall and ice melt gets mixed into them which acts to make them lighter- even as they cool. However, the extent of compensation between temperature and salinity is very nearly in balance.&nbsp; In about half of the modern generation of climate models, this results in an irregular overturning where these waters are brought to the surface and release heat to the atmosphere. The resulting mixing events (known as open-ocean convection in general and often referred to as the Weddell Polynya when localized to the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean) can play a dominant role in the circulation of the Southern Hemisphere atmosphere and ocean and in its response to climate change.</p>\n<p>But what determines whether convective events occur or not or whether they are periodic or continuous? And does turning off convection (potentially as a result of global warming) move climate and ecosystems into a fundementally different state? The models used for predicting global warming different in their answers to this question. This proposal examined a set of models and looked at how convection behaved in these simulations.</p>\n<p>A major result was the elucidation of a new mechanism that allowed for convection to vary on decadal time scales (illustrated in more detail in attached image 1). When convection occurs, warm water at the surface heats the atmosphere. This tends to reduce the temperature difference between the mid and high latitudes, which acts to reduce the strength of the winds. But as the winds decrease,&nbsp; the added freshwater from precipitation doesn't get moved away as quickly and the mixing of salty water from below near the date line decreases. This results in a freshening and lightening of the surface water over time which then propagates into the convective region and turns off the convection. However, the resulting cooling of the surface then produces a cooling of the atmosphere, with stronger winds that then mix up more salinity, starting the cycle again. This work was published in a paper in Journal of Physical Oceanography (Gnanadesikan et al.,2020) and represents an important new mechanism for generating climate variability.</p>\n<p>One thing that we found in this paper was that this mechanism was active in some models, but not others. Our set of models differed in one way- how they represent the impacts of eddies- illustrated in the attached image 2. We found that models with high levels of mixing associated with these eddies don't have a strong periodic convective signal-instead they are always in a convective state.This has important impacts on the globe's largest current, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (Ragen et al., 2020), in part because by maintaining convection the model keeps the Antarctic relatively warm and reduces the Southern Ocean winds.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>We also find that the strength of eddy mixing affects how sensitive the convection in the model is to being turned off under global warming, and that this has imporant implications for the evolution of the deep ocean environment. Under global warming, the deep ocean loses oxygen and accumulates respired carbon dioxide, making it more acidic and potentially making the environment hostile to organism with calcium carbonate shells. In Bahl et al. (2020) we showed that these environmental changes under global warming are much weaker in&nbsp; low mixing models than in high-mixing models, which tend to start off with too much convection. This also led us to ask whether convective shutoff put the ocean into fundmentally new ecological states, or whether it simply resulted in \"shuffling\" current conditions. In Holder et al.
