 "awd_abstract_narration": "Archaeologists at the University of Washington, Seattle, will collaborate with Indonesian colleagues to investigate why some residentially sedentary communities relocate over short distances. Some societies have developed and retained building styles that allow easy movement, although communities therein tend to remain in the same place for generations. The researchers will examine potential causes for infrequent, short-distance mobility including changing climate, conflict, changes in trade, ideological change, and epidemics, which may have influenced decisions to shift settlement locations within a small area. While it is well understood that humans often shift their settlements from place to place as part of a subsistence strategy, this research examines mobility as an adaptation to a range of factors not directly related to subsistence, which have affected humans throughout time, including in the present, and space, including in the Americas. While examining mobility's uses beyond subsistence, this research also asks whether otherwise sedentary societies have used lightweight, mobile building methods to adapt to a range of infrequent pressures. A clear understanding of these past adaptations may inform adaptive strategies in the present, whether in terms of house design, settlement planning, or civic organization. The research will involve consultation with members of the present community in which it takes place. The researchers will provide archaeological training to local students, and develop educational materials to distribute through regional schools and museums. \r\n\r\nThe researchers will test ideas about the social effects of the changing climate, hypothesized as \"climate refugees\" or conflict over scarce resources. Likewise, they will investigate theories about how newly arrived ethnic groups integrate or do not integrate into an indigenous population. They will also test the hypothesis that societies may relocate to take advantage of new access to long-distance trade. Finally, they will test the historical hypothesis that colonial-period diseases spurred the abandonment of settlements. The researchers will use datable ceramics and radiocarbon dating to determine a chronology for the abandoned sites on the islands of Ujir and Wasir in the Aru archipelago, Eastern Indonesia. They will determine the sources of locally produced earthenwares through geochemical analysis, and of porcelain and stoneware from more distant regions through stylistic analysis. By tracking changes in the diversity of ceramic sources over time, the researchers will reconstruct a history of the sites' connections to local and long-distance trade networks. The site chronology and trade history will then be compared to historical records and oral traditions, as well as regional climate proxies. These methods will allow the researchers to infer whether one factor or multiple factors together caused the past communities on Ujir and Wasir to abandon their settlements, in a case study that can inform scholars and members of the public interested in mobility, conflict, climate change, cultural difference, and trade.",

We proposed that the many abandoned sites on the island might be explained either by climate stress and conflict, a change in ideology (such as the conversion to Islam), a re-orientation to trade, or some combination of these factors.</p>\n<p>During the early colonial period, Ujir was often in conflict with the Dutch East India Company, while its main village Maiabil was the most important Muslim village in Aru. Its involvement in regional trade networks was a source of wealth and political influence. This project investigated how Ujir developed into such a significant power. We collected samples of pottery, glass, animal bones, and charcoal from the archaeological deposits at Maiabil, along with samples from other, smaller sites (Jakalar, Maisei, and Wakajukin, among others). We analyzed these assemblages with a range of techniques, described below.</p>\n<p>We used laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and petrographic thin sectioning to analyze the composition of the locally produced earthenware pottery at these sites. This has established that regional trade was important for Ujir before the time of European contact, notably with the Banda islands famous for spice production: volcanic glass, probably from Banda, appears in potsherds found on Ujir, and the geochemistry of clay in the potsherds is also similar to sherds from Banda.</p>\n<p>Although we expected to find trade pottery from mainland Asia before the time of European contact, it appears that most of the trade in these goods, notably blue-and-white porcelain from China, occurred after European contact. Indeed, the Jakalar site, which was inhabited from about the fourteenth century and abandoned around the time of European contact, shows very little trade pottery, whereas Maiabil, which was most prosperous during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, had far more porcelain in addition to glass and stoneware. While earthenware from other islands (e.g. Banda) appears at Jakalar, most of the trade in porcelain only corresponds with the establishment of the Maiabil settlement. Thus there is a relationship between different sites and different sorts of trade.</p>\n<p>The varying prevalence of pig bones in the faunal assemblages at different sites also suggests some differences in cultural practices. Because Islam prohibits the consumption or presence of pigs, we would expect a site whose inhabitants followed Islamic practice to have no pig bones in the faunal assemblage. The faunal assemblage at Jakalar had pig bones throughout, while pig bones were almost completely absent from Maiabil, suggesting that its inhabitants followed Islamic practice. The faunal record at Jakalar also produced an astounding diversity of species, the identification of which is still in progress. Dugong, turtle, many reef fish, birds, deer, marsupials, and other animals appeared in the faunal assemblage, along with taxa that have yet to be identified.</p>\n<p>Collaboration with Balai Arkeologi Maluku, the provincial archaeological research institute, allowed an exchange of knowledge and strengthening of ties between BalAr and the University of Washington. The archaeologists also met with linguists, historians, and sociocultural anthropologists working on Ujir and elsewhere in Aru, at a conference in nearby Dobo toward the end of the project; we shared our results with each other and with the broader Aru community.</p>\n<p>This project demonstrated the potential for further research on Ujir, in the two major sites studied in 2018, but also in other, smaller sites on Ujir Island and neighboring Wasir Island. The research on Ujir so far has been done in consultation with the local community, and any further research should also consider their concerns and interests.</p>\n<p>Preliminary conclusions are that Ujir was engaged in regional trade networks early on, and that an increase in intensity of occupation at the Maiabil site coincided with engagement in longer-distance trade and a shift toward Islamic cultural practice.
