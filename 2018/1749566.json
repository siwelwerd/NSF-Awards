 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will use Maker pedagogy to develop workshops to test its potential for improving the effectiveness of learning pathways in STEM disciplines for military veterans. The workshops will provide training and educational awareness in engineering topics and will include computer-aided design (CAD), rapid prototyping, 3D printing, fundamentals of bio-inspired robotics, and additive manufacturing technologies. The project will address the nation's need for workforce to learn the most current and emerging skill sets.  The workshops will be held at Old Dominion University in the Hampton Roads area of Southeastern Virginia, which serves a wide population of women, underrepresented minorities, and veterans entering into the engineering and technology workforce. \r\n\r\nThe research team will develop and deliver two Maker Workshops serving military veterans to foster their STEM knowledge and careers and to develop their interest and introduce the skills needed for opportunities in advanced manufacturing.  The project will carry out formative and summative evaluation that will support the development of an educational model that can be implemented in different institutions across the country with veteran or adult student learner populations. Evaluation will focus on veteran workshop participants' attitudes, behaviors, and skills, using observations from data collected through surveys and instruments, and teaching related activities.  Project results and resources will be disseminated through conferences held by a wide range of Veterans' organizations and the American Society of Engineering Education, as well through relevant educational and professional journals.",

Therefore, their previous background affected their perception of the presentations, as some of them were more or less familiar with parts of the content of the presentations. Since not all of them had the same background, it turned out to be beneficial to everybody to go through the whole material, providing a perspective of the complexity of the engineering field, and the broad area of knowledge necessary to build even a small robot, which for so many people these days would be no more than a toy. Nevertheless, adults or children alike, veterans or faculty, men or women, we all appreciate a smart toy when it becomes a vehicle of learning, and the bio-inspired robots used in these workshops were excellent choices to bring up the enthusiasm of the participants and to stimulate their interest in further learning. As one of the participants said: \"It was very fun. I built a robot that did not walk very well to be honest, but I learned that engineering is more than just one discipline, it's a combination of multiple skills from different fields that you need to utilize to complete a job\" Therefore, its major innovativeness was exposing adult learners to STEM through a multidiscipinary project run by the faculty from multiple disciplines. In this way, they were exposed to the muldisiciplinarity of engineering profession.</p>\n<div>For the actual building part of the workshop, the participants studied various types of walking, specific to different types of animals (such as lizard, horse, crab, or bear) and they applied their learning to program the servo-motors that were controlling the legs of their robots. This part of the workshop raised the most enthusiasm, as the participants got really excited to watch their robots walk, and to change their walking style by modifying the programming code. Simple changes of parameters or different sequences of delays were translated in new walking styles, and the participants were really engaged in trying all sorts of patterns.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>The compact presentation of the electrical part of the lectures exposed the participants to the following: the basics of electrical circuits, types of devices, breadboard design and wiring, adding control to the design, using the Arduino?s Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to develop code on a desk computer or laptop and download it on the microprocessor board, the basics of the analog and digital type of signals and their use for controlling servo-motors, and even to the notion of pulse modulation, in particular Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) signals, which were used to control the servo-motors for the bio-inspired robots. Arduino kits that were purchased during this proejct are now used for various outreach activites as well as in the various Introduction to Engineering sessions or Introduction to Mechatronics course at Old Dominion University.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>The faculty team that developed and implemented the bio-inspired robotics workshops presented in this paper included members from the College of Engineering as well as from the College of Education, specifically from STEM education. Most of the faculty have multidisciplinary background and together they cumulate degrees from five engineering disciplines. This diversity in the team background was reflected in the development of the workshops, throughout the materials presented, and through the complexity of the final product of the workshops. The faculty team collaborating on this project decided to approach the teaching of the making process from a multidisciplinary perspective, using this very specialized project-based theme, of the bio-inspired robots. Some specific topics included in the workshops are currently included in the courses they teach regularly, such as the \"Bioinspired Robotics\" course which is offered to undergraduate students in the Mechanical Engineering program, the \"Introduction to Mechatronics\" course which is offered to undergraduate students in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Technology programs, the \"Computer Solid Modelling\" offered in the Mechanical Engineering Technology program, and \"Additive Manufacturing Methods\"course that is currently under development as an elective course in MET program.
