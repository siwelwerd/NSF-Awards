 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Abstract:\r\nTwo dimensional materials are composed of layers of atoms that are only a few atoms thick. These materials, known as van der Waals (vdW) materials, have strong interactions between the atoms in the layer and weak interactions to neighboring layers.  This leads to unique electrical and optical properties which can be exploited for the next generation of electronic devices.  This project will develop new sample preparation and device fabrication techniques that will allow us to probe the unique electronic and optical properties of these materials.  This program will also provide exceptional opportunities for training of graduate students, who will gain first-hand knowledge of forefront research on 2D materials and research in a national lab through visits to the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, FL.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract:\r\n\r\nRecent advances in the development of atomically thin layers of van der Waals (vdW) materials have opened up many new research opportunities. Examples include the unique electrical and optical properties of massless electrons in graphene and Berry curvature effects in monolayer semiconductor transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). These properties are, however, mostly associated with independent particle phenomena. This project will focus on collective quantum phenomena in atomically thin TMDs and will explore the possibility of tuning the charge-density-wave (CDW) order and superconductivity in a model two-dimensional (2D) TMD metal NbSe2 by carrier density modulation through ionic liquid gating. The study will be enabled by development of new sample preparation and device fabrication methods and will be supported by combined optical and transport probes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
