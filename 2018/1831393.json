 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will host a 2-day workshop in Washington, DC, which will bring together the community of Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation (SI2) awardees (with the goal of involving one principal investigator from each Scientific Software Elements (SSE), Scientific Software Integration (SSI), and Scientific Software Innovation Institutes (S2I2) project, many of which are collaborative awards) from approximately 250 awards. The workshop will have participation from Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering (CDS&E), Critical Resilient Interdependent Infrastructure Systems and Processes (CRISP), and Venture funded PIs as well as SI2 Early Concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) and Rapid Response Research (RAPID) awardees. In addition, the proximity to NSF will encourage participation by Program Officers from across the Foundation. Goals of this workshop include: (a) providing a focused forum for PIs to share technical information with each other and with NSF Program Officers, (b) encouraging exploration of emerging topics, (c) identifying emerging best practices across the supported software projects, (d) stimulating thinking on new ways of achieving software sustainability, and (d) disseminating the shared experiences of the researchers via an online web portal. The workshop is expected to host close to 150 SI2 and other awardees, other speakers and panelists. \r\n\r\nThe proposed workshop will support the exchange of ideas among the current software cyberinfrastructure development projects. It will provide guidance on issues related to the development of robust software and to the problem of software sustainability with the broader agenda for national software ecosystem. Involvement of program officers across NSF is expected to help the interdisciplinary SI2 awardees understand the relevance and impact of cyberinfrastructure throughout the NSF. The participation of these researchers and program officers in a common forum will help ensure that the cyberinfrastructure software developed as part of SI2 projects will be relevant and broadly applicable to the most science and engineering domains possible. The results of this workshop thus have the potential to guide cyberinfrastructure development and cyberinfrastructure driven research for both the participating projects and for the wider software development community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

City Center, 1400 M Street NW, Washington, DC. The 2018 SI2 PI workshop had five strategic objectives that aligned with the broader SI2 program goals: (1) Serve as a focused forum for PIs to share technical information with each other and NSF Program Officers; (2) Explore innovative topics emerging within software communities; (3) Discuss emerging best practices across the supported software projects; (4) Stimulate thinking on new ways of achieving software sustainability; (5) Share the experiences in a workshop report. These five strategic objectives were embedded in five aims of the 2018 workshop: (a) Significantly expand the number of non-SI2 researchers who attend the workshop; (b) Invite Early-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) Innovation Corps (I-Corps), Critical Resilient Interdependent Infrastructure Systems and Processes (CRISP), Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering (CDS&amp;E), and Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) projects to fulfill the aim of exploring new or hitherto untargeted areas by hosting non-SI2 PIs, and conversely, give the SI2 community a sense of what is possible through the EAGER, Venture, CRISP, CDS&amp;E and DMREF mechanisms; (c) Showcase the diversity of projects within the SI2 program, from conceptualization through SSE and SSI to Institute awards; (d) Feature domain scientists from SI2 under-served domains; (e) Nurture a sustainable organizing committee process. The workshop was attended by 161 PIs who collectively spanned the SI2, EAGER, Venture, CRISP, CDS&amp;E and DMREF programs. The workshop was also attended by at least 5 NSF Program Directors. The agenda included 16 invited speakers, 4 Lightning talks that allowed every participant to briefly discuss their project, 4 extended Poster Sessions, and 1 Panel Discussion. Based on participant feedback, the 2018 workshop achieved its five strategic objectives. The workshop expanded the collective domain of knowledge on software infrastructure, enhanced the capability for sustained innovation within software communities, and contributed to the broader CIF21 vision. The Final Report was released and distributed on May 30, 2018 through https://si2-pi-community.github.io/2018-meeting/ : \"Towards a National Software Ecosystem, Report of the 2018 NSF Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation (SI2) Principal Investigator (PI) Workshop\", by F.X.
