 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, will provide undergraduate students from resource limited institutions, as well as women and minorities, research opportunities in nanoscience and nanotechnology. This program will be carried out at the University of Iowa, run for 10 weeks during the summer session, and be administered through the Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Institute at the University of Iowa (NNI@UI). Participants will be recruited from institutions with limited undergraduate research opportunities, and underrepresented minorities and women will be recruited by coordinating with on-going diversity efforts at the University of Iowa. \r\n\r\nREU participants will be provided with a stimulating research experience focused on (1) giving students the opportunity to work on a cutting-edge research project focused on nanoscience and nanotechnology under faculty mentorship, (2) helping undergraduate students develop strong research and communications skills through seminars on laboratory safety and scientific ethics, a technical communication workshop, and participation in a university-wide summer undergraduate research symposium, (3) training undergraduate students in the interdisciplinary area of nanoscience and nanotechnology, a field of demonstrated scientific importance, (4) encouraging student participation from institutions with limited research opportunities and from underrepresented groups (including women in engineering) through vigorous recruiting efforts, and (5) encouraging REU participants to pursue graduate studies by informing them of opportunities for graduate study and application procedures. Faculty mentors from Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Chemistry, and Pharmacy will guide these students in their research. Given the importance of nanoscience and nanotechnology, it is imperative to provide undergraduates with early exposure to research in this interdisciplinary field and to enhance their interest in science and engineering for graduate studies and as a career path.\r\n\r\nFunding for this REU Site is provided by the National Science Foundation, Directorate for Engineering, Division of Engineering Education and Centers and the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Science, Division of Chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Given the increasing importance of nanoscience and nanotechnology, it is imperative to provide undergraduates with authentic exposure to research opportunities in this interdisciplinary field.  This REU summer program addressed this need by providing undergraduate students with a unique research perspective related to the applications and implications of nanoscience and nanotechnology.  The participants conducted research under the mentorship of faculty and graduate students from a wide range of nanoscience disciplines including Chemistry, Engineering (Chemical, Environmental, and Electrical), and Pharmacy.  In terms of intellectual merit, the REU participants actively contributed to new nanoscience research discoveries in their research labs and several contributed peer-reviewed research publications resulted from their research efforts.  The participant's research activities contributed new knowledge to range of projects related to (i) the synthesis and characterization of nanoscale materials, (ii) fundamental studies of nanoparticles and nanomaterials in biological, energy, and environmental applications, and (iii) fundamental studies to better understand the biological/environmental implications of nanoparticles.  The program's broader impacts first focused on broadening research participation for women, members of under-represented groups, and for students at institutions with limited research opportunities.  Additional broader impacts were achieved during our formal science communication program and weekly scientific and career seminars provided important skills for the REU participant?s development into future professional scientists and engineers.  Despite a 2020 pandemic pause, we successfully recruited and mentored 40 REU students over four summer program periods (2018, 2019, 2021, 2022).  These students were 46% women, 27% were from under-represented groups, and 70% were from undergraduate institutions with limited access to research opportunities.  At the conclusion of the program, just over 40% of the participants had already continued with their education in graduate and professional programs.  In many instances, this program gave students confidence and research skills such that they could envision themselves pursuing advanced education and research opportunities.  Our interactive, engaged, and authentic REU experience's positive impact on our student's mindset and career pursuits represents the most substantial broader impact arising from this grant.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/26/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Edward G Gillan"
