 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is familiar to everyone that waves typically organize themselves into certain identifiable patterns. For instance, a stone dropped into a pond produces concentric rings of ripples, and the wake of a ship has a characteristic V-shape. Although they may be harder to see in everyday experience, other types of waves like electromagnetic waves frequently also produce such patterns. This means that wave patterns might be understood from the mathematical study of certain underlying models of wave motion that are common to several different types of physical systems. In a similar way, understanding wave patterns from first principles is a worthwhile pursuit because such patterns occur frequently in so many physical circumstances, ranging from the very small (e.g. optics or quantum waves on the scale of atoms) to the very large (e.g. gravitational waves on the scale of the galaxy). This project is a systematic investigation of wave patterns arising in mathematical models of wave propagation, and it aims both to catalogue the various wave patterns that can occur in a given model and to determine the range of models and physical situations in which a given pattern can arise. As one example application, the outcomes of this project will contribute to our understanding of rogue waves, large disturbances of the sea surface that appear out of nowhere and disappear just as suddenly, but which can cause great damage to ships, unless they are anticipated and avoided or otherwise mitigated. Some parts of the project will serve as vehicles for the training of junior researchers such as undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to develop and apply methods from the theory of completely integrable systems to the study of wave patterns. The key mathematical methods are tools of complex, functional, and asymptotic analysis, and the results of the research will be relevant to the fields of nonlinear wave propagation, integrable systems, and special functions. Specific models to be studied include the three-wave resonant interaction equations, the focusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation, the Davey-Stewartson equations, and the family of Painleve equations. The project will study both regular wave patterns, i.e., modulated wave trains spontaneously generated from smooth initial conditions, and universal wave patterns, i.e., special structures appearing in double-scaling limits that do not depend on initial conditions (and perhaps not even on the equation of motion). Specific goals include the development of new techniques for the investigation of wave patterns via asymptotic analysis in integrable systems consisting of multiple coupled fields or in multiple space dimensions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project concerned the analysis of wave patterns in various physical systems modeled by nonlinear partial differential equations.  It also provided new information about certain nonlinear special functions that can be used to describe such wave patterns and that are important in their own right.  \n\nIn the latter category, there were several findings related to the Painleve equations, which are nonlinear ordinary differential equations with specific mathematical properties that make their solutions valuable as modern special functions, analogues of sines and cosines, for instance.  The rational solutions of the third and fourth Painleve equations were analyzed in detail, and the patterns made by their poles and zeros in the complex plane were explained precisely.  A family of transcendental solutions of the second Painleve equation called \"increasing tritronquee\" solutions was analyzed and these solutions were related both to the rational solutions of the Painleve-III equation and also to a transitional phenomenon observed for certain special functions describing large-amplitude rogue waves on the sea surface.\n\nIn the former category, a new wave pattern was discovered near a certain wave-breaking point in solutions of the sine-Gordon equation, a nonlinear partial differential equation used to model base-pair vibrations in DNA molecules and transmission pulses in long superconducting Josephson junctions, among other things.  It was revealed that near the breaking point, the sine-Gordon solution resembles a periodic wave with an amplitude derivable from the tritronquee solution of the first Painleve equation, except near points where the latter has singularities of its own.  Near each of these points, the wave field is instead approximated by a family of solutions that resemble space-time defects in a periodic wave form.  \n\nThe most interesting and far-reaching outcome of this award is the discovery of a specific type of wave pattern that is observed near the peak of large-amplitude rogue waves of many different types.  The basic result is that in the double-scaling limit that the amplitude of the rogue wave is increased while the \"near field\" of the wave near its peak is scaled up reveals a universal wave form that we call the \"rogue wave of infinite order\".  This discovery has important disciplinary impacts in that the same universal form is observed in many different contexts in the field of nonlinear wave science.  It also has important possible impacts in other fields such as coastal engineering or marine science, because it can inform studies of large-amplitude rogue waves that can damage ships and fixed structures.  \n\nThe project also established that the same rogue wave of infinite order appears also in other problems, such as a certain boundary layer phenomenon in active optical media governed by the Maxwell-Bloch equations in the sharp-line limit.  \n\nIn terms of educational and training impacts, the project involved the efforts of two graduate research assistants, some undergraduate REU students, and supported the research of two postdocs supervised by the PI.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/07/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter Miller"
