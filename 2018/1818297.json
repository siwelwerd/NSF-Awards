 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sphingolipids are the most abundant lipid component of the membrane that surrounds plant cells. This membrane separates the plant cell from the surrounding environment. Sphingolipid composition is important for the plant's ability to survive variable growth conditions, such as drought and freezing, and to fight infection from pathogenic fungi and bacteria.  Plant cells vary the amount of sphingolipid synthesized depending on environmental conditions. This project examines how plants make the required amount of sphingolipid for optimal growth. If there is too little sphingolipid, the plant's cells will not be able to grow and the presence of excess sphingolipid can trigger cell death. This project shows how sphingolipid metabolism is regulated and generates a computer model to predict the regulation of sphingolipid levels in plants. Regulation of sphingolipid metabolism is investigated under optimal growth conditions and in response to pathogen infection. The results of this project will enable plant breeders and biotechnologists to predictably alter sphingolipid metabolism in crops, such as corn and soybean. With the knowledge derived from this project plant breeders will be able to maintain plant productivity in response to drought, soil salinity, pathogenic fungi and bacteria and other environmental challenges. The project engages high school and undergraduate students in sphingolipid research to advance STEM education. Graduate student participants are trained broadly in the convergence of computation with experimentation to address significant biological questions.\r\n\r\nThe project addresses fundamental gaps in knowledge of sphingolipid metabolic regulation in plants and its impact on biotic stress responses by integrating computational modeling with experimental approaches. Relative contributions of biosynthetic and catabolic reactions for sphingolipid metabolic regulation are determined through a kinetic model derived from metabolic flux analyses of wild-type and mutant plants exposed to biotic stresses. An extensive toolbox of plant mutants and engineered yeast strains are used for biochemical and genetic studies aimed at understanding mechanisms through which orosomucoid-like proteins function as central regulators. These regulators control the amounts and types of sphingolipids produced in response to biological stresses. Findings from these studies contribute to iterative kinetic model improvement through design-build-test-refine cycles for a more quantitative and mechanistic understanding of sphingolipid metabolic regulation in plants.  The project also advances the study of plant sphingolipids through development of a web portal that contains information on sphingolipid structural diversity, metabolism, function, and analysis and disseminates project-derived metabolic models.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Some lipids also act as signaling molecules to trigger processes that are important for cell growth and death and response to changes in a cell's environment. A fundamental biological question across all organisms is how does a cell know how much of a given type of lipid to make for the cell to live, grow and die and to respond to a changing environment? Our research explored how plant cells regulate the amounts of sphingolipids that they produce. Sphingolipids are the major lipid of the plasma membrane that surrounds cells and controls the plant cell&rsquo;s ability to adapt to stresses such as low temperature and drought and to respond to fungal and bacterial pathogens. While sphingolipids are required for cells to live and grow, the build-up of sphingolipid intermediates or building blocks known as ceramides can trigger cell death, which is important for a plant to fight-off microbial pathogens. Our research combined genetics and biochemistry with mathematical modeling to understand the network that plant cells use to finely tune how much sphingolipid that they synthesize.&nbsp; Our research centered on the enzyme serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) that controls the first step in sphingolipid biosynthesis. We discovered a previously unknown protein component of plant SPT (\"small subunit of SPT\") that is required for this enzyme to function. We also identified a protein called \"ORM\" that functions as a brake to temper the production of sphingolipids. We found that plant mutants that completely lack ORM produce sphingolipids uncontrollably and produce seeds that are not viable. To understand the metabolic cues that control SPT activity in response to amounts of sphingolipids in cells, we developed mathematical models based on biochemical data from our studies. &nbsp;These models pointed to one type of ceramide structure as a suppressor of SPT activity, while another type of ceramide structure allows SPT to function in an uncontrolled manner. While the balance of the amounts of these two ceramide classes is important for tuning SPT activity and sphingolipid production up or down, how SPT is able recognize these ceramide molecules was unclear. We obtained the answer to this question through a collaboration that generated a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the plant SPT-ORM complex. This physical \"snapshot\" of the SPT-ORM complex showed that ceramides bind to the ORM, and the ceramide binding to ORM blocks the ability of SPT to use its substrates, which turns off SPT activity. Consistent with our modeling results, it was found that the predicted \"suppressor\" ceramides bind to ORM and result in the inhibition of SPT activity, whereas the \"non-suppressor\" ceramides bind to ORM but do not inhibit SPT activity. From our previous studies, these results suggested that suppressor ceramides control SPT activity and sphingolipid production during normal cell growth. However, when challenged by microbial pathogens, the plant cell shifts to the production of non-suppressor ceramides that do not regulate SPT, allowing the cell to accumulate ceramides to high levels to trigger cell death to protect the remainder of the plant from infection. Our findings have important implications for developing higher yielding crops with increased environmental resilience. Our findings can also be extended to other organisms, including humans for development of cancer treatment therapies. As a component of our project's Broader Impact, we trained three high school students, five undergraduates, and six graduate students for more advanced education and careers in STEM disciplines. We also developed a publicly-accessible website to advance knowledge and understanding of sphingolipid biology and biochemistry and to promote research on this important lipid class.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/29/2023<br>\nModified by: Edgar&nbsp;B&nbsp;Cahoon</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1818297/1818297_10560862_1701284602667_SPT_structure_2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1818297/1818297_10560862_1701284602667_SPT_structure_2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Serine palmitoyltransferase complex structure\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1818297/1818297_10560862_1701284602667_SPT_structure_2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Serine palmitoyltransferase complex structure\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Plant serine palmitoyltransferase-ORM complex structure obtained by cryo-electron microscopy.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Xin Gong</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Edgar&nbsp;B&nbsp;Cahoon\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Serine palmitoyltransferase complex structure</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
