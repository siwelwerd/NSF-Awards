 "awd_abstract_narration": "Infectious diseases pose a serious threat to many wild animals. While vaccination is a successful tool against diseases of humans and livestock, it is rarely used to control wildlife diseases. This is partly because of a poor understanding of immunity in wild animals and its impact across a large population. This award will address these gaps in knowledge by studying the immunity acquired by frogs against a fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Bd infection has caused a severe decline in frog numbers around the world. Recent studies have shown that frogs exposed to dead Bd become resistant to future infection. They suggest that the immune system of frogs can be harnessed to fight Bd. This award combines mathematical theory with laboratory and field experiments to understand the correlates of acquired resistance to Bd in frogs and assess the potential for managing outbreaks in wild populations by stimulating acquired resistance to the fungus. Results of this study will facilitate the development and testing of a novel, widely applicable theory for the management of epidemics in wildlife. Consequently, this work will help to curb losses of biodiversity. Researchers will share their results with groups working on frog conservation and provide multi-disciplinary training to a diverse group of scientists. Computer-based teaching tools that illustrate wildlife disease management through vaccination will be developed and made publicly available.\r\n \r\nThere is poor understanding of acquired resistance in wild animals and a scarcity of theory underlying wildlife vaccination. These gaps in physiology and ecology will be addressed in the current research using amphibians and the chytrid fungus, Bd.  Bd is selected for study because this pathogen contributes to global amphibian declines and the recent discovery that amphibians acquire immunological resistance following exposure to dead Bd. This award integrates mathematical theory with laboratory and field experiments to i) characterize the acquisition and maintenance of Bd resistance across host life stages, ii) evaluate the immunological mechanisms responsible for individual resistance and whether their presence predicts population-level outcomes, iii) determine if resistance can be induced in wild populations, and iv) if so, can this alter epidemics and host persistence in a whole-ecosystem experiment populations - an outcome of broad significance for wildlife conservation. This project links immunological mechanisms and individual-level traits to population- and community-level disease outcomes. It advances fundamental knowledge of host-parasite interactions while helping to curb disease-driven worldwide losses of biodiversity. Results of this research will be disseminated to conservation partners to help limit the spread of chytridiomycosis. This research will facilitate the training of a diverse group of scientists in physiology, ecology, and mathematical biology. Computer modules that illustrate general and amphibian-specific outcomes of disease management via acquired immunity will be integrated into teaching and made publicly available.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Several laboratory experiments have demonstrated that prophylactic exposure to metabolites produced by Bd significantly reduces infection loads in amphibians subsequently challenged with live Bd. Because Bd metabolites are non-infectious and applied topically, this treatment can be administered directly to waterbodies, holding promise as a feasible conservation too. The University of Colorado portion of this project was to coordinate a field experiment with the following two objectives: 1) to evaluate whether we can reduce disease in natural host populations by exposing amphibians to dead Bd and 2) to assess the capacity of developed models to predict field outcomes (i.e., model validation), In spring of 2021, we successfully launched the manipulation in April. We deployed a team to administer the manipulation (either vaccine or sham-vaccine [added pond water]) to 16 freshwater ponds. This process went smoothly; rains were limited in California this year, which was an advantage in that amphibians bred early and ponds were unlikely to get flushed out after we administered the treatments. On the downside, however, 2021 was among the most severe droughts on record, forcing us to accelerate our timeline for collecting data. While this is beneficial for amphibian populations at large, it made for a difficult year in which to experimentally manipulate Bd resistance. We therefore re-ran the manipulation for a second time in 2022, for which we are currently processing and analyzing the data. This result was unexpectedly found that prophylaxis (e.g. vaccine exposure) addition to the ponds increased pathogen loads in the exposed amphibian populations and model results suggest this may be the result of enhanced tolerance. In the search for a chytridiomycosis cure, these findings underline the importance of accounting for how different mechanisms of individual-level partial protection can generate population-level outcomes that paradoxically undermine conservation objectives. Finally, these signifies the importance of accounting for differences in the transmission potential of treated versus untreated hosts when designing conservation-motivated disease control campaigns and cautions the use of this prophylaxis for amphibian conservation</p>\n<p><strong>Broader impacts:</strong> This research capitalized on the public&rsquo;s interest in amphibians generally &ndash; and in amphibian deformities specifically &ndash; to foster educational outreach and conservation awareness.
