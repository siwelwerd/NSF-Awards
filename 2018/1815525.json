 "awd_abstract_narration": "As data centers scale up, there is an increasing need for fast data replication to distribute computational load across servers.   This is especially true of distributed machine learning algorithms, where a 'master computer' must distribute computational updates (i.e., do a multicast) to 100's or even 1000's of other servers. For example, for text mining, each iteration of a computation can easily result in more than a 1 Gigabyte of data being distributed, with the total exceeding 1 Terabyte. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art solutions for transporting these massive data sets in the data center rely on application-layer overlays where the data is transmitted sub-optimally as a large number of repetitive flows. This project seeks to realize a fundamental breakthrough in data center multicast performance by leveraging optical transmission to perform the multicast function by simultaneously connecting a source machine rack to multiple receiver machine racks with a reconfigurable optical device. The results of this work will impact data analytics, which increasingly drives the US economy, through much more efficient operation of datacenters.   \r\n\r\nThis project develops a scalable architecture leveraging distributed small port-count optical cross connect switches and optical splitters to realize a data center network that efficiently supports both unicast and multicast traffic. To fully achieve the potential of this architecture, this project designs, analyzes and evaluates: (1) Scalable, high performance network connectivity for an optical splitter network, addressing difficulties resulting from heterogeneous packet switch port-counts, link speeds and splitter configurations; (2) Different routing algorithms and their performance trade-offs for different network connectivity and workload, addressing challenges such as failure recovery; (3) Different algorithms for multicast demand placement and optical multicast network resource scheduling that aim to optimize application level performance; (4) Different approaches to exploit the flexibility of the distributed small port-count optical circuit switches for adapting to dynamic shifts between unicast and multicast traffic hot-spots; (5) A variety of real big data applications operating over this new architecture, addressing the system design and implementation challenges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
