 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project seeks financial support for increasing the diversity of speakers and enhancing student participation at a Conference to be held from June 24 to 27, 2018 at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The \"76th Device Research Conference (DRC)\" will focus on a variety of devices ranging from semiconductors to organic, molecular devices, as well as spin and quantum devices. The Conference will host world-renowned researchers in advanced devices as invited speakers, whose expertise range from design, to fabrication characterization and applications. In addition to technical talks, short courses on highly relevant topics presented by renowned world experts will greatly enhance the usefulness of the conference to attendees. This year's course will be on future computing technologies based on architectures beyond traditional von Neumann computing. The technical program will provide student participants with the opportunity to gain exposure to new materials and devices, their basic physics, and their engineering applications. Exposing the next generation of researchers to these important disciplines is critical to maintain the supply of STEM workers with the skillsets necessary to address emerging commercial trends. The information will be disseminated through the conference proceedings which will be available online through the IEEEXplore.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Yet, the DRC&mdash;and the device research community as a whole&mdash;stands to benefit from an increase in the invited speakers at the conference and enhanced exchange. Additionally, student involvement is a hallmark of the DRC, with traditionally strong student attendance to its short courses, poster session and oral presentations; however, student participation is strictly tied to the ability of offering a discounted student registration rate.  DRC has a history of offering discounted student registration fees, for general attendance and short courses, in order to encourage student participation and attendance from additional students who are not presenting an abstract.  To these ends, $4,000 of the NSF grant was used to discount student registration to the general conference.  Anticipating 100 student registrants, we reduced the student registration by $40 per student (final student registrant tally was 105), in addition to not increasing registration from the previous year. Another $1,000 of the NSF grant was used to discount registration for the short course to make it more affordable for students to attend.  The short course cost came out to be $60 per student attendee and there were 37 students that attended.  Finally, $2,000 of the NSF grant was used to support travel grants for students to attend the conference, including two recipients of the Best Student Paper award.\n\nIn addition to the student support, we placed strong emphasis on increasing the diversity of plenary and invited speakers at the 76th DRC.  Using the final $3,000 of the NSF grant, we supported the conference registration and travel for a female plenary speaker (Heike Riel).  Dr. Riel?s involvement was a highlight of the DRC meeting.  \n\n \n\n\n\n1 http://www.deviceresearchconference.org\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/18/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: J.
