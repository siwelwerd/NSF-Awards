 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the renewal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (RE) site in Physics at the University of Rochester.  The site supports twelve undergraduate students per year for ten weeks of summer research in topics including Physics, Astrophysics and Optics.  Many of the research projects in which students have participated are attracting growing interest from the scientific community. The faculty's research group's combination of enthusiasm and discipline motivates students and contributes to the quality of their research. Individual guidance and mentoring fosters each student's skill at navigating the world of science - giving talks, writing articles - and as well as his or her intellectual development as an independent researcher.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the REU is to offer undergraduate students nationwide the opportunity to take part in Physics, Astrophysics and Optics including: particle/nuclear/cosmic ray physics, optics/quantum optics, condensed matter/biological physics, and plasma physics/astrophysics/geophysics. Each student works with a faculty adviser on a specific project within the context of the overall research focus of the group. The program includes a mini-course in Linux/Unix. REU students attend weekly presentations by University faculty, tours of University research facilities, and social outings and may also take part in the Department's summer outreach activities. The program concludes with a student symposium, at which each student speaks on his/her research project; students submit written abstracts and reports of their research experiences. Students are strongly encouraged to continue their projects toward publication and are eligible for additional support to present their results at national student and professional conferences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We seek to provide research experience to students nationwide whose research interests are uniquely well-served by research in our Department and other University research centers.\n\nThe REU program has shown success in the participation of women and serves a significant number of students from non-research institutions each year.  A range of recruitment strategies for minority students is in place both at the department and at the institutional level.  Stipend support, travel expenses, and on-site housing are available for all participants.  Each student works with a faculty adviser on a specific project within the context of the overall research focus of the group.  Students attend mandatory weekly presentations by faculty mentors and tours of University research facilities. They are exposed to the variety and commonality of research among subfields, in addition to career development sessions that address options.\n\nThe program concludes with a student symposium, at which each student speaks on his/her research project; students submit written abstracts and reports of their research experiences.

The program clearly contributes to the goal of building the nation?s scientific workforce and leadership. Many of the REU participants cite the program as pivotal in their decision to follow a research career.
