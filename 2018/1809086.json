 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through the development of highly competitive students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines:  African-Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.  The goal of the LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity is to increase the quantity and quality of STEM graduate students from underrepresented populations, with emphasis on Ph.D. matriculation and completion.  BD programs implemented in the nation's institutions of higher education contribute to addressing one of the objectives in NSF's 2018-2022 Strategic Plan, namely to foster the growth of a more capable and diverse research workforce and advance the scientific and innovation skills of the Nation.  The vision of this grant is to provide a national model to produce underrepresented scientists and engineers with doctoral degrees in STEM.\r\n\r\nHoward University will be the host site for the 2018-2020 Washington Baltimore Hampton Road Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation Bridge to the Doctorate Program.  Drawing upon its historical prowess of being the leading institution in the country that graduates African Americans with advanced degrees, and the number one producer of minority engineers and scientists. Howard University seeks to implement activities that focus on mentoring, professional writing, and classroom teaching experiences, which will support the development of competitive doctoral candidates historically underrepresented in STEM.  These activities will be enhanced by the support of the Graduate School Office of Retention, and the Mentoring and Support and Preparing Future Faculty programs.  Additionally, relationships between the extant Howard University NSF Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate project will be established and leveraged to further increase the benefit to BD scholars.  The BD project at Howard University will be an important step in advancing the career awareness and preparation of underrepresented minority students in STEM and their access to career opportunities as they progress in their educational pursuits.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These trends indicate that the WBHR Alliance members offering Ph.D. degrees (HU, HaU, MSU and NSU) will outpace all other institutions in the nation in degree production for African Americans during the next decades just as has been done in the past, making this Alliance the&nbsp; continuing top producer of B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in STEM to African Americans in the nation.</p>\n<p>The Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Program at Howard University, which is the lead institution for the Washington Baltimore Hampton Roads - Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (WBHR-LSAMP) was designed to address the inequality that exists in the United States when it comes to the production of persons of color with Ph.D. degrees. However,this did not solve or address the real problem. The problem is quite complex and has many layers that must be addressed. Students from underrepresented communities are earning more Ph.D.s, yet doctoral degrees in science and engineering are still overwhelmingly conferred upon white students;more specifically, according to an analysis from the National Science Foundation.&nbsp; In 2019, nearly 70% of doctorate recipients who were U.S. citizens or permanent residents were as follows: 10%&nbsp; Asian, 8%&nbsp; Latino,&nbsp; 7% &nbsp;Black, and 3% identified as more than one race (<a href=\"https://www.axios.com/hard-truths-deep-dive-science-doctorates-race-ethnicity-aed9c1b1-30ca-40ac-8b8e-eed33cd02a23.html\">https://www.axios.com/hard-truths-deep-dive-science-doctorates-race-ethnicity-aed9c1b1-30ca-40ac-8b8e-eed33cd02a23.html</a>).</p>\n<h2>Intellectual Merit</h2>\n<p>The graduate school at Howard offers Ph.D. degrees in 16 STEM fields. These include the Biological and Life Sciences and the Engineering and Physical Sciences. For the BD program, we selected fields where there are still gross underrepresentations of minorities and minority women.&nbsp; This included chemistry, mathematics, physics, and engineering. The BD program provided the first two years of support to twelve minority students in the targeted fields. These students came from our own WBHR-LSAMP Institutions as well as minority students from other LSAMP institutions with additional support from Howard University to pay for tuition and fees not covered by NSF.&nbsp; In total,the University supported&nbsp; six cohorts of students. To date, 54% of the 72 students who have been funded by the BD program have successfully matriculated toward the Ph.D. degree in STEM.</p>\n<h2>Broader Impact</h2>\n<p>A major component of our BD program was the requirement that all BD fellows were required to participate in a research mentoring experience. Additionally, the BD fellows served as mentors for the LSAMP students. The research mentoring and advising provided by the HU STEM faculty members allowed for superior graduate research opportunities for the BD fellows. Fellows also took part in research opportunities during&nbsp; the summer months with other institutions and programs to expand their research knowledge.&nbsp; Eligible fellows also took part in supervised teaching experiences during their time in the program.&nbsp; These activities provided opportunities for hands on training for BD fellows considering an academic career.&nbsp; Moreover, to hone the mentoring skills of BD fellows, they were paired with LSAMP students to present their research at various science conferences. These interactions allowed for mentoring to take place in both an academic and a social networking context.&nbsp; These peer relationships strongly aid our goal to emphasize graduate education of the WBHR-LSAMP students in STEM fields especially those students who intend to go into the professoriate.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Does the Bridge to the Doctorate Program make a difference?&nbsp; The three former BD students, who are pictured in this report, are perfect examples.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Today's doctoral candidates are tomorrow's teachers, leaders, mentors, and researchers who can help the next generation of students see themselves as scientists and guide the areas they explore.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The wind of change continues to blow but the direction must change if we are going to make a difference in the United States and the world.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/12/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Clarence&nbsp;M&nbsp;Lee</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1809086/1809086_10567725_1633795942875_AdanaLlanosBridgetoDoctorate(5)-page0001--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1809086/1809086_10567725_1633795942875_AdanaLlanosBridgetoDoctorate(5)-page0001--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Emerging Scholar\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1809086/1809086_10567725_1633795942875_AdanaLlanosBridgetoDoctorate(5)-page0001--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Emerging Scholar\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Emerging Scholar</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Howard Universty</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Clarence&nbsp;M&nbsp;Lee</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Emerging Scholar</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1809086/1809086_10567725_1633796136581_appointmentofDr.SameliaP-page0001--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1809086/1809086_10567725_1633796136581_appointmentofDr.SameliaP-page0001--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"New appointment\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1809086/1809086_10567725_1633796136581_appointmentofDr.SameliaP-page0001--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"New appointment\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Former BD student becomes a new Associate Director</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Howard Universty</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Clarence&nbsp;M&nbsp;Lee</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">New appointment</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1809086/1809086_10567725_1633828282537_Document12(2)-page-0--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1809086/1809086_10567725_1633828282537_Document12(2)-page-0--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"New Assistant Professor\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1809086/1809086_10567725_1633828282537_Document12(2)-page-0--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"New Assistant Professor\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">New Assistant Professor at Georgetown University</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Howard Universty</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Clarence&nbsp;M&nbsp;Lee</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">New Assistant Professor</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
