 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Elan Eisenmesser from the University of Colorado Denver to investigate how motions within an enzyme communicate to control enzyme function. With the development of technological methods capable of identifying the positions of all the atoms in molecules over the last two decades, it has become increasingly clear that macromolecules, and particularly enzymes, are reliant on a range of motions for their functions. However, how these motions are communicated across an enzyme in order to control their functions is less understood.  Utilizing newly developed techniques that bridge molecular biology and nuclear magnetic resonance, graduate and undergraduate students will reveal how motions on multiple timescales communicate within a critical biological enzyme, called Bilirubin Reductase B, and whether there is cross-talk between movements on different timescales. Such studies could impact efforts to engineer enzymes by considering both their structure and intrinsic motions. Dr. Eisenmesser also plans to introduce these studies to minority undergraduates in order to train students in molecular biology and state-of-the-art biophysical techniques that probe the atomic level details of both structure and motions.\r\n\r\nThe research project is aimed at elucidating how networks of coupled motions regulate active site dynamics and how these in turn modulate catalytic turnover.  Dynamic communication is now well understood to play critical roles in enzyme function and many recent studies have shown that motions are only partially correlated.  Thus, identifying the molecular basis of these partial couplings and specifically modulating distal dynamics in order to control enzyme function will significantly impact efforts for enzyme engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

There is an inverse relationship between coenzyme release and substrate turnover for active site changes at position 14 and 78, published in the Journal of Biochemistry as Duff et a., ?Structure, dynamics, and function of the evolutionarily changing BLVRB family?, 2020. \nDistally dynamic site, T164, modulates coenzyme release and substrate turnover and can be used to determine the rate-limiting step. We have used mutations of this residue to identify coenzyme-release as the rate-limiting step the specific networks of changes modulated by the 164 site and follow our discoveries of global hydride-mediated coupling through both this distal site as well as active site residues that bridge such distal communication (Redzic et al., ?Modulting Enzyme Function via Dynamic Allostery within Biliverdin Reductase B?, Frontiers of Biomolecular Sciences, 2021). \n NSF funding has also allowed us to complete related projects on the study of dynamics of multiple proteins, which include the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (Redzic et al., ?The inherent dynamics and interaction Sites of the SARS-CoV Nucleocapsid N-terminal Region?, JMB 2021), G5 adhesive domains (Paukovich et al., ?Streptococcus pneumoniae G5 domains bind different ligands?, Protein Science 2019), and finally the dynamics of Toll-Interleukin-Receptor (TIR) domains (Lee et al., ?Human and Bacterial Toll-Interleukin Receptor Domains Exhibit Distinct Dynamic Features and Functions?, Molecules 2022).These discoveries have identified regions of flexibility within both the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and G5 domains that are also critical for their interactions with host proteins and small ligands, respectively. \n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/02/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Elan Eisenmesser"
