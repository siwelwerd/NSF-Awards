 "awd_abstract_narration": "Half of the Earth's streams are intermittent: they occasionally dry or stop flowing. Since the 1980s, researchers who study streams have developed theories about how stream ecosystems work.  Each theory is different, but they all focus on a single physical aspect of streams that is thought to best explain how stream ecosystem structure and function vary from one place to another. Physical factors that have been considered include stream size, floods, and climate. However, the body of work informing the development of these theories, and the body of work supporting them, is based on research from streams that flow continuously, or \"perennial streams.\" Given that half of the Earth's streams are intermittent, there is a need to develop a new theory for streams that explains how drying acts as a control on stream ecosystem structure and function, how intermittent and perennial streams are different, and how those differences vary from region to region. This project uses macrosystems ecology as a foundation to develop and test such a theory that can be applied to all the Earth's streams. A smartphone app will map wet and dry stream reaches in conjunction with international research partners (1000 Intermittent Rivers Project), and citizen science organizers, and educational partners to create new teaching tools.  The research may help inform decisions on water use where streams and intermittent and human populations are increasing.  Seven graduate student will be included on the diverse research team.  \r\n\r\nThis research project is comprised of three components. The first is a three-year field study of intermittent and continuously flowing streams in 10 different regions across the southern, central, and western US led by researchers at five different US universities that will collect streamflow and biological data. The field study will be focused on investigating how macroinvertebrate communities in intermittent and perennial streams differ in species composition and abundance, and how these differences vary according to climate. In 9 of the 10 regions, the researchers will use National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) collected data, and sampling will follow NEON sampling protocols to generate NEON-compatible data. The second component will develop fine-scale hydrological models of the study watersheds using the Coupled Routing and Excess STorage (CREST) model. These models will predict where and when streams dry in these watersheds, and researchers will model streamflow patterns under different scenarios related to sea surface temperature oscillations and other changes. The third component of the project will generate spatial models that integrate the empirically collected ecological data in the field with the hydrological model outputs. This part of the project will investigate how large-scale climate oscillations (e.g. El Nino Southern Oscillation) influence regional drying patterns differently, and how shifts in spatial drying patterns influence stream ecosystems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This climate whiplash has dramatic impacts on flow in rivers and streams, resulting in record floods followed by partial or total drying of the streambed. Stream drying affects water quality, aquatic communities, and ecological services in every part of the United States, but its impacts have mostly been studied in arid regions, where drying is widespread and occurs regularly. This regional focus means that we do not have a good understanding of what may happen when streams in the wetter parts of the United States, such as the Midwest or Southeast, start to dry up during these climatic whiplash events. It could be that streams in the arid Southwest, which are already used to drying, are more robust to future drying events than those in the wetter part of the country, which have little experience with long-term drought and drying. Predicting what happens when streams dry up is important for understanding aquatic biodiversity as well as all the ecosystem services that those aquatic species provide, including providing invertebrate prey for many of the birds and mammals that the general public loves to see.</p>\r\n<p>In this study, we quantified stream drying and aquatic invertebrate communities in 10 stream basins spanning the southern half of the continental United States, from the arid Southwest to the humid Southeast, over a three-year period. Our spatially replicated study design included 10 sampling reaches nested within each of the 10 basins, to capture both perennial (year-round flow) and intermittent (seasonally dry) reaches within each basin. At each sampling reach in each basin, we used remote data loggers to measure when flow started and stopped over the three-year period. We also sampled aquatic invertebrate communities once each year over the three years to quantify their biodiversity and how that diversity is affected by aridity and stream drying. Surprisingly, neither the total number of aquatic invertebrates we found by basin nor the average number of species we saw at each sampling reach varied predictably with increasing climatic aridity from the Southwest to the Southeast. We had expected to see more species in the wetter stream basins of the Southeast, as it should be a less &lsquo;harsh&rsquo; place for an aquatic species to live. However, we did find impacts of stream drying within the 10 basins. In general, the average number of species we saw per sample tended to be lower in intermittent reaches (that dry seasonally) versus perennial reaches (with year-round flow). Additionally, we found the largest drying-induced decreases in diversity in the arid basins of the Southwest. In fact, in the most humid basins of the Southeast, we found no differences in the number of aquatic invertebrate species between intermittent and perennial reaches. The types of invertebrate species that we found did vary along the climatic aridity gradient, with distinct aquatic invertebrate faunas in the Southwest, Midwest, and Southeast. However, within a basin, differences we documented in the types of species between intermittent and perennial reaches were highly variable and basin-specific.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, the remote data loggers we used to measure flow documented the very types of climatic extremes that inspired our research in the first place. For example, our study basins in Arizona had a record wet period in late 2019 and early 2020, followed immediately by the driest and hottest year on record. This resulted in the basins going from having many dozens of miles of continuous flowing streams in early 2020 to less than a mile total of isolated trickling or stagnant reaches in 2021.</p>\r\n<p>Together, our results suggest that the loss of perennial flow due to drought may have larger impacts on aquatic invertebrates in more arid basins, where a number of species already are restricted to small and isolated perennial reaches. The loss of sensitive species in arid regions due to stream drying will have cascading impacts on ecosystem processes (e.g., decomposition of leaves, nutrient cycling) and will negatively affect the riparian birds and mammals that rely on those species. In contrast, for humid basins in the Southeast, the persistence of at least some nearby perennial refuges during drought may buffer the local ecological impacts of stream drying for at least some period of time. But if longer droughts persist in areas like Georgia and Alabama, then we would expect more parts of the stream networks to begin drying up. If that were to occur, we predict dramatic ecological impacts of drying similar to what we observed in the Southwest. These nuanced insights into the impacts of stream drying were only possible with a study that lasted multiple years across many stream basins, so we hope that similar large-scale studies continue in the future.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/29/2025<br>\nModified by: Michael&nbsp;T&nbsp;Bogan</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div
