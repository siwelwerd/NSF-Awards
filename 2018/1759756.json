The investigators will use environmental DNA (eDNA) to provide new insights for addressing long-standing questions of past human-environment relationships and biodiversity dynamics resulting from environmental change, fire, and human activities.  The project will engage Native American communities in order to shape the procedures ancient eDNA studies take with regard to obtaining information about their ancestral activities. The investigators will build partnerships through this Native American network to initiate eDNA citizen science projects and virtual eDNA learning content.  Through these activities, the investigators will offer educational and research opportunities to these underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental DNA (eDNA) is a new methodology used for biodiversity monitoring.  DNA shed by plants, animals, and other organisms is sequenced and evaluated, thereby allowing scientists to inventory the community at a location.  Previous studies using eDNA on paleosoils and sediments have only been done in colder climates.  This project will develop eDNA methods suitable for inventorying paleosediments in warmer climates by focusing on southern California, an area with a diverse history of environmental and landscape change over the timespan characterized by continuous human presence.  The investigators will recover DNA shed by plants, animals, and microbes from well-dated, environmentally sensitive lake sediment cores, and they will use these data in combination with other paleoecological proxies.  Using DNA techniques involving metabarcoding and hybridization, the investigators will inventory the flora and fauna of the past at low and high elevations levels and with different temperatures. Outcomes of this research will provide the scientific community and the public with the appropriate mechanisms to interpret ancient eDNA results.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

While sedimentary DNA has often been used successfully to document biodiversity in cold climate sediments, it has rarely been used on warm climate sediments. This project explored ancient environmental DNA from sediments of Lake Elsinore in Southern California. Using an existing set of sediment cores spanning the late Pleistocene (here, 33,000 years ago) to the present that had been thoroughly studied for paleoclimatological data, we investigated DNA patterns with metagenomics and target baits capture of plants and mammals, investigated charcoal (local wildfire) and XRF elemental data, and investigated pollen. We asked how these various data patterns relate to the arrival of humans in North America and to the arrival of Europeans in California as well as how they relate to records of fire and pollen from the other regional studies. &nbsp;We also attempted to correlate the core&rsquo;s pollen and charcoal patterns to the DNA results. A final arm of this work was to initiate conversations with different communities about the potential of ancient DNA to shed light on ancient human activities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our team found that deciphering the DNA signals was complicated because of the diverse bacteria DNA in the sediment and the severe degradation of warm climate DNA. In particular, the Angio353 baits capture DNA that needs to be carefully informatically filtered out to enable quality plant diversity analysis. From mammal baits, we discovered signals of several mammals, some now extinct, and from Angio353, signals of many plants including ferns, wildflowers, grasses, shrubs and trees suggest DNA represents very local lowland biodiversity whereas pollen represents more regional and higher elevation biodiversity. Although this project is still in progress even as the NSF award has formally ended (COVID delays, and added student team members), we are working on submitting our computational workflow for publication and graduate students are relating the biodiversity signals to ethnobotanical uses of plants as well as biogeography of plants that may indicate how plants came into the area because of human trade networks. For example, we find succulents from inland desert at Lake Elsinore during pulses of human migration. This finding complements the archaeological records about cultural exchange and human demography. We also find a dearth of plant signals at points when wildfire is extremely high in the area around the lake. The highest point of wildfire was at 12.8 thousand years ago, adding evidence that the B&oslash;lling Aller&oslash;d to the Younger Dryas was a time of major ecological change in southern California. Biodiversity available for use by humans in the area may have been temporarily insufficient to sustain large populations.</p>\n<p>The team discovered that DNA metagenomic analysis showed dramatic microbial and diatom turnover throughout the sediment strata. To interpret these patterns, we needed to compare ancient patterns to contemporary environmental DNA patterns of biodiversity across burned and unburned areas in southern California watersheds. We put effort into data collection around recent wildfires and connected with the wildfire community about how DNA monitoring could be useful for understanding fire ecology. Several microbial families have been found to respond to wildfire severity, and we are tracking these throughout the core layers to develop hypotheses about burn severity.</p>\n<p>For broader impacts, we used these Lake Elsinore data in undergraduate UC Santa Cruz Molecular Ecology classrooms in authentic research modules where undergraduates ask their own questions about biodiversity change through time. Students enjoyed how this module let them gain insight into major questions in the scientific community such as why megafauna went extinct early in the Holocene. This project also led to conversations and plans to collaborate with artists, Native ethnobotanists, and the general public, where we are focusing on bioethics and how to support community-driven about biodiversity or human activity from sedimentary DNA.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Members of the project team shared this work at several multidisciplinary meetings such as the AGU meetings (American Geophysical Union) in 2019 and 2021.
