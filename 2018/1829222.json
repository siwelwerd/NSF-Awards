 "awd_abstract_narration": "This I-Corps Site at Michigan Technological University builds on the accomplishments and lessons learned during years 1-3 of the Michigan Tech I-Corps Site Project. Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors. This is a proposal for a Type II I-Corps Site - Type II proposals are submitted by institutions that have already received a Type I award.\r\n\r\nDuring the first Site award, Michigan Tech was able to create a partnership with Western Michigan University, doubling the number of workshops offered and the number of teams participating in those workshops in one year. During the Site's next phase, Michigan Tech will offer Workshops each year and recruit teams to participate each year; increase the diversity of participants in the Workshops; expand the mentor pool to broaden participation of experienced mentors from academia, industry, and investment capital; continue to refine the I-Corps curriculum to best meet the needs of participating teams by offering a follow-up workshop in order to prepare teams for National I-Corps and to build and support communities of innovators; expand their interaction with the Midwest Node; revise the mini-grant process to encourage more teams to apply for these grants; and continue to build the local, regional, and state-wide innovation culture and ecosystem. The Michigan Tech Innovation Center for Entrepreneurship will use a cadre of Outreach Ambassadors to serve as advocates across campus and within their spheres of influence to help recruit high quality teams to participate in the I-Corps program. Project evaluation will focus on the effectiveness of specific curriculum improvements and on the impact of the project on the local, regional, and state innovation ecosystem and culture.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
