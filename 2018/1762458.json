 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will continue NSF support of the University of Texas High-Resolution X-ray Computed Tomography Facility (UTCT) as a shared multi-user facility supporting geoscience research. Computed tomography (CT) is ideally suited for many geological applications, as it nondestructively creates 3D imagery of the interiors of rocks, fossils, meteorites and other materials.  Successful application of this technique requires both advanced instrumentation and experienced operators to optimize data acquisition and processing, and the ability to design and implement rigorous and well-targeted 3D data analysis strategies. UTCT serves both as a source of high-quality data for investigators without access to CT instrumentation, and as a repository of experience and expertise in all aspects of CT data acquisition and analysis, both through individual consultation and collaboration and by teaching short courses. Having UTCT as a national resource thus reduces the number of instruments the nation needs to conduct CT-involved research, and helps those instruments that we do invest in to be used to best advantage.  Advances in CT data acquisition and processing at UTCT have also been used in many other fields.  UTCT also provides leadership in management and curation of CT data sets, through our long-term investment in the DIGIMORPH digital library. \r\n\r\nThis project will provide partial support of the UTCT facility operating expenses for the next three years, including staff, equipment maintenance, and computing infrastructure. In addition, funds will be used to upgrade the primary CT instrument to enhance data processing speed and the flexibility of the detector gantry to enable scans of larger objects and scanning at higher resolution.  The facility support will allow for timely and high-quality service for a large user base; development of new CT methodologies; and expansion of short courses in HRXCT data acquisition, visualization, and quantification.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
