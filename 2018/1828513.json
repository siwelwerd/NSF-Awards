 "awd_abstract_narration": "The technique of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) links together radio dishes around the globe to form Earth-sized telescopes. Each telescope in the array, synchronized by a network of atomic clocks, observes the same cosmic target at the same moment, recording data onto banks of hard-disk drives. Currently, these disks are sent to a purpose-built computer cluster for processing and imaging. But the sensitivity required for the most cutting edge work in this field has led to recording rates and data volumes that now exceed the capacity of in-house computing clusters. This project will include a partnership with Google to develop infrastructure and software that will shift VLBI processing to the cloud, where enormous virtual machines can be nimbly configured to process scientific data at speeds that easily keep pace with advancing recording rates. This project will revolutionize the practice of VLBI, and provide an extensible means of increasing array bandwidths and spectral resolution for a broad range of science.  At the absolute limits of the VLBI technique, a millimeter wavelength global array will image nearby supermassive black holes as part of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). This project will also include educational participation and early career development opportunities in instrumentation and astronomy research.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop a scalable, cloud-based computational system for VLBI.   This project is motivated by the computational needs of extending EHT observations to short wavelengths; however, it will develop a methodology that is broadly applicable to the current and future needs of VLBI observations.  The project will develop a hardware/software approach in conjunction with commercial partner, Google.  This approach will include a new recording system for VLBI using customized commercial appliances for the transfer of data from the telescope to the cloud, and modifications to existing correlator code to make it suitable for execution on a parallelized, cloud-based platform.   This project will contribute to broadening participation in science through student research opportunities made in conjunction with the Urban Massachusetts Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation Program and the Akamai Workforce Initiative.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award (AST-#1828513) funded high performance computing research aimed to increase the sensitivity of globe-spanning networks of radio dishes used to make the first images of black holes. With the developments funded by this grant, scientists can move from studying \"still\" images of black holes to observing real-time \"movies\" that show how supermassive black holes shape the way our Universe appears to astronomers. \n\nThe technique used to make the first black hole images is called Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI).  VLBI uses ultra-fast electronics to record radio waves emitted by the black holes at widely separated antennas around the world.  Atomic clocks note the exact time of arrival of these signals, which are recorded and then later combined at a central location.  In this way, a virtual telescope as large as the Earth can be formed, achieving angular resolutions far beyond what a single telescope could deliver. The process of combining the global data streams, requires considerable computer resources and forms a bottleneck in the path from observations to the production of black hole images.\n\nThe specific goal of the grant was to develop a VLBI data processing platform that is powerful and versatile enough to accelerate black hole imaging, to the point where many independent observations can be stitched together to make black hole movies.  Such movies would require at least ten times the currently available computing power.  Within this grant, our team developed the software and hardware that connects photons collected at radio dishes, using new data storage and transport systems, to enhanced central processing platforms.\n\nThe primary software goal was to implement a VLBI processing architecture in the Cloud.  Instead of building dedicated computer clusters, we shifted the VLBI processing to large commercial and University-based computer facilities.  In so doing, we enable the global array processing to use vast computer resources when they are needed, and then return the compute fabric for other uses when the processing is complete.  This maximizes the efficiency and use of the VLBI hardware. Our team also developed prototypes for the data capture engines that store radio waves onto hard disks at each geographic location.  This increases the bandwidth of VLBI systems, which in turn increases the sensitivity of the Earth-sized telescope.\n\nThe array used to make the first black hole image was the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).  A new array capable of making black hole movies is called the next-generation EHT (ngEHT).  The new platform and data capture systems will be applied to the building of ngEHT instrumentation, where wider bandwidths will lead to new science breakthroughs.  In addition to black hole movies, the additional sensitivity will enable astronomers to make the most detailed maps to date of the light-speed jets that are launched from the North and South poles of spinning black holes.  These structures extend for thousands, and even millions, of light-years from the black hole and are some of the largest structures in the known Universe.\n\nOur team includes numerous undergraduate and graduate students, so these developments also had the benefit of training the next generation of scientists.  The use of this work in other fields, and the training that is an integral part of the development, is a very important component of what we do.\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/20/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sheperd S Doeleman"
