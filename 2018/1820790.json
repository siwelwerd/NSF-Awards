 "awd_abstract_narration": "Controlling the properties of single atoms at the quantum mechanical level promises to enable revolutionary quantum technologies with application in computing, secure communication and precision measurements. From the prospect of developing a scalable technology, it is very appealing to work with atoms trapped in solids. Rare-earth atoms in crystals are a very promising system to study because their quantum properties are not significantly degraded by the interaction with the other atoms in the solid. This project will be focused on controlling the quantum states of single neodymium atoms using optical laser pulses and microwave pulses. These studies will determine whether neodymium atoms are well suited for developing quantum technologies, especially quantum communications. This project will allow for training the future generation of scientists and engineers with expertise in quantum science and technology.\r\n\r\nStudying and controlling single quantum bits in solids is at the current frontier of quantum information science. To advance this frontier, optical spectroscopy and spin control of single neodymium ions coupled to nano-photonic resonators will be performed, and the prospects for using them as reliable quantum bits will be assessed. The reason for using rare-earth-ions, specifically neodymium, is that they have 4f electronic levels exhibiting some of the best optical and spin quantum coherence in the solid state, similar to trapped atoms and ions.  This study will lead to a better understanding of the interactions between single ions and their nano-scale environment, such as nearby surfaces, hyperfine coupling between nuclei, and ion-ion dipole interaction that have not been studied before at the single quantum level. New optical techniques combining high-frequency-resolution laser spectroscopy, nano-photonics, low temperature, microwave spin control will be developed. Nano-fabrication techniques for new crystalline materials will be further advanced.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
