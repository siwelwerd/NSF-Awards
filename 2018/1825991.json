 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proper function of many systems vital to the United States' economy, defense, and national health depend on fluid flow (i.e., the flow of a liquid or gas).  Examples of such systems include commercial and military aircraft, automobile engines, wind turbines, and heart pumps. Fluid systems are characterized by unintuitive physics, which makes them exceptionally difficult to design.  This difficulty is particularly acute during the conceptual design of unconventional fluid systems, for which experimental data and engineering experience is lacking. In principle, engineers could use numerical simulations to analyze innovative fluid systems, but high-fidelity simulations have found limited use during conceptual design. Why?  Flow simulations typically rely on meshes, which divide the region occupied by the fluid into many smaller volumes, and generating high-quality meshes for complex geometries remains a time-consuming, human-in-the-loop process.  This research will investigate a fundamentally new approach to mitigate the meshing bottleneck and thereby improve the fluid system design process. Project outcomes will include novel algorithms and prototype implementations of the algorithms that will be made available in an online repository.  \r\n\r\nThe research project will study a novel immersed-boundary method and its application to design optimization.  The key insight is to frame the immersed-boundary method as an inverse problem.  The idea is to introduce a body force, or surface flux, interior to the geometry that acts like a control variable to impose the boundary conditions.  The optimal value for this control is determined by solving a partial-differential-equation constrained inverse problem.  This approach is attractive for the analysis of fluid systems during conceptual design, because the computational mesh does not need to conform to the geometry.  Furthermore, unlike most immersed-boundary methods, this project's approach remains accurate and is compatible with high-order discretizations.  To assess the potential of the concept, the project will investigate several critical questions: among alternative inverse-problem formulations, which one is the best?  How should the problem be regularized?  How do we solve the inverse problem efficiently?  How robust and accurate is the concept when applied to imperfect CAD geometries?  And, how can the method be used to advance shape optimization algorithms?\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMany industries and challenges in the 21st century will require novel, unconventional fluid systems to achieve their desired economic and environmental outcomes.  Unfortunately, engineers are often reluctant to consider novel ideas during the conceptual design of fluid systems, because of the tension between accurate and timely predictions of the complex, nonlinear physics.  For instance, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can be used to simulate fluid flows and make accurate predictions, but CFD suffers from a time-intensive, human-in-the-loop mesh generation process.  Consequently, CFD is rarely used during conceptual design, and engineers are forced to favor conservative systems for which they have intuition and empirical data.\n\nThis project was motivated to help automate the use of CFD during the conceptual design of fluid systems by simplifying the mesh generation process.  To this end, the project investigated two alternative strategies: i) the inverse-immersed-interface concept, described in the project abstract, in which the immersed-boundary method was posed as an inverse problem, and; ii) a strategy referred to as cut-DGD, which combined a cut-cell approach with the discontinuous Galerkin difference method.  The project outcomes listed below are grouped into outcomes related to the inverse-immersed-interface concept and the cut-DGD method.\n\nProject outcomes related to the inverse-immersed-interface method:\n\nThe inverse-immersed-interface method is effective at applying boundary conditions on complex geometries for linear partial differential equations.  In this setting, the solution obtained by the inverse-immersed-interface method is accurate and high-order convergence can be easily attained.\nA naive implementation of the inverse-immersed-interface method is ill-posed, but this can be remedied by ensuring the approximate boundary converges to the true boundary as the mesh is refined, which is easy to enforce in practice.  In addition, the conditioning of the inverse-immersed-interface benefits from regularization, which can be introduced by adding a boundary-condition penalty to the objective function.\nWhile the inverse-immersed-interface is effective for linear problems, the method is not robust for nonlinear, advection-dominated problems.  For this reason, we do not recommend using the method for fluid flows.\n\n\nProject outcomes related to the cut-DGD method:\n\nA cut-cell version of the discontinuous Galerkin difference (DGD) method does not suffer from the small-cell problem.  The small-cell problem arises in many cut-cell methods when the immersed geometry creates a cut cell that is significantly smaller than its neighbors.  Such small cells lead to problems such as solution inaccuracy, impractically-long simulation times, and, in some cases, the failure of the overall method to have a solution.  The cut-DGD method mitigates the small-cell problem because it spreads the effect of the small cells over multiple degrees of freedom.\nThe cut-DGD method does not require special treatment or stabilization at cut-cells other than sufficiently accurate quadrature rules (which other cut-cell methods also require).  Consequently, the cut-DGD method is straightforward to implement, and high-order versions of cut-DGD achieve their optimal rates of convergence.\nComplex geometries in the cut-DGD framework can be represented accurately using a partition-of-unity-based level-set-function.  This type of level-set function can be used to construct quadrature rules for the cut-DGD method using the algorithm proposed by R.
