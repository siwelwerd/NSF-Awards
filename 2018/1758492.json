 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cultivating STEM Teaching Identity in Noyce Teacher Scholars is a Noyce Track 1 project at California State University San Marcos (CSUSM). The project will encourage highly qualified mathematics and science students to pursue secondary teaching careers at high-need schools.  The project team includes the CSUSM School of Education and College of Science and Mathematics, Palomar and MiraCosta Community Colleges, and Vista Unified, Escondido Union High School, and San Marcos Unified school districts. The project aims to recruit 40 CSUSM mathematics and science undergraduates to the CSUSM teaching credential program, which includes acquisition of an Authorization to Teach English Learners. In addition to scholarships, the project will offer early STEM teaching experiences to Noyce Scholars, as well as provide them with early career mentoring.\r\n\r\nThis Noyce Track project includes a focus on developing a teaching community using Wenger's Community of Practice Framework and will implement evidence-based approaches such as internships and induction activities and will leverage existing activities and partnerships.  The program will also build on model programs implemented at CSUSM by the PIs. The embedded training on teaching English Language Learners has important value, as area schools have a high enrollment of ELL students. Additionally, the project will include efforts to recruit scholars from partnering community colleges, with an emphasis on recruitment of underrepresented minorities. The models implemented for faculty teamwork, collaboration with community colleges, and partnerships with school districts have the potential to provide insights for teacher preparation efforts at other institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In a recent report on the condition of education by the National Center for Education Statistics (2023), 32% of the public schools surveyed found it very difficult or were not able to hire math teachers. In other STEM areas, the percentages of schools in need of qualified teachers were: 37% physical sciences, 31% computer science, and 31% biology or life sciences. These numbers are alarming. K-12 students deserve not any teachers but high-quality teachers who know their subject areas, are passionate about teaching, and care about students.</p>\n<p>To help address the need for recruiting and retaining high-quality math and science teachers, California State University San Marcos received a grant from the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program of the National Science Foundation. The primary goal of the project was to encourage talented science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) undergraduate students and STEM professionals to become high school and middle school math and science teachers in high-need school districts. The project provided scholarships, early teaching experience, teacher education, mentorship, and a supportive network. The project successfully recruited 45 teachers (27 female and 18 male), called Noyce Scholars, for high-need school districts. Specifically, 27 are in math, 11 biological sciences, 4 physics, 2 chemistry, and 1 other sciences. Ethnicity: 20 Latinx and 25 non-Latinx. Race: 30 White, 7 Hispanic/Mexican/Chicana, 2 Asian, 3 American Indian/Alaskan Native, and 3 preferred not to report.</p>\n<p>The project has broader impacts. First, it helps to alleviate a teacher shortage. The project has produced the above-mentioned high-quality STEM teachers who can work with diverse students. Among them, the 10 teachers from Hispanic/Latinx and American Indian cultures are a part of a growing pool of underrepresented racial minorities in the STEM teaching workforce. They become role models for many K-12 students. Additionally, numerous teachers in the project have reported instances of inspiring students to learn science and math and consider a career in STEM areas.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the project has created a model for STEM teacher recruitment and support at a higher education institution. The model has a few key components. First, early teaching experience (such as tutoring peers and working with K-12 students in afterschool programs) encourages some STEM undergraduates to consider education and develop their teacher identities. Second, it takes a village to recruit and nurture STEM teachers. The project has developed a strong relationship among STEM undergraduates, STEM faculty, and education faculty to guide young STEM majors through a challenging course of study and help them persevere in their pursuit of knowledge and skills for teaching. Also, the models for faculty teamwork, collaboration with community colleges and school districts, and STEM teachers support can provide insights for other institutions.</p>\n<p><strong>Reference</strong></p>\n<p>Irwin, V., Wang, K., Tezil, T., Zhang, J., Filbey, A., Jung, J., Bullock Mann, F., Dilig, R., &amp; Parker, S.
