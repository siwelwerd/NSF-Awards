 "awd_abstract_narration": "New York University (NYU) has received an Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Education and Human Resources Directorate (IUSE: EHR) Exploration and Design award for a project to develop inexpensive time-lapse photography tool to allow the study of plant movement (tropisms, oscillations, growth, etc.) for practicing scientists, as well as for undergraduate students in the classroom.  Through a collaborative effort among plant molecular biologists, engineers with expertise in motion, and digital educational scientists, the PI team from NYU is designing, developing, and disseminating a mobile app, Plant Tracer, to quantify plant movement from time-lapse videos in an associated undergraduate teaching environment.  \r\n\r\nThe PI team is using the capabilities of Plant Tracer to advantage by developing inquiry-based laboratories that allow students to participate in authentic research studies on gravitropism (movement of a plant in response to gravity) and circumnutation (movements of the growing portions of plants to form spirals or ellipses).   Using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, students are dissecting the mechanisms underlying these behaviors at a molecular level.  Plant Tracer permits high-throughput, low-cost analysis that allows students to identify new mutants undetected in previous work.  A collection of genetically altered Arabidopsis germplasm is being developed to allow students to use a crowd-sourcing approach to isolate these mutants. The project, which involves students from six universities, is motivating student interest in plant biology and enhancing student learning outcomes.  At the same time, the data that are collected by the students are advancing our knowledge of genetics that govern gravitropism and circumnutation.\r\n\r\nThis project is being jointly supported by the NSF Division of Undergraduate Education and the NSF Division of Biological Infrastructure as it aligns with an important subset of the objectives of both divisions that is expressed in the \"Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education\" effort (see http://visionandchange.org/).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLooking at a typical plant, you may not notice that it is moving. Although generally perceived as immobile, all plants have parts that are moving, as shown by time-lapse photography.  Plant movement involves not only growth but also cell expansion and contraction and can be seen in the complex twisting and turning that plants do for survival.  Plant movement is involved in light acquisition and avoidance as well as nutrient gathering.  Plant Tracer is the first App-based tool that enables students and scientists to quantify plant movement in plant shoots, including circumnutation (the back and forth swaying of plants) and gravitropism (movement responses to gravity) from time-lapse movies using their hand-held devices (iPhones).  Charles Darwin was one of the first scientists to measure plant movement, but he did this over regular time intervals by making marks on a glass plate suspended over the plant.  Plant Tracer currently works on Apple iPhones.  An on-line prototype version of Plant Tracer is also available for download to PC and another prototype version that uses machine learning is also available for use on PC.\n\n \n\nPlant Tracer is being used in teaching laboratories to study plant movement in the genetic model plant, Arabidopsis, as part of a crowd-sourced method to identify novel mutants to better understand the signals regulating plant movement.  Plant Tracer can also be used to study movement in the seedlings of common garden plants such as peas, morning glory and radishes. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/01/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric Brenner"
