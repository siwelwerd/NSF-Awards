 "awd_abstract_narration": "New scientific advances often require synthesis of information from many perspectives. This is particularly true in the environmental sciences. New ideas that build on what we know are needed for a deeper understanding of human impact on ecosystems. Training young scientists to think broadly and synthetically is important to achieve this deeper understanding. This workshop will provide an opportunity for twenty-four young scientists to interact with each other and their more senior colleagues. The goal is to improve and expand ideas in ecology and evolution by building on previous work and bringing many perspectives together to explore new frontiers. These new ideas will be shared broadly with the science community and the public. The outcome of the workshop will be several high impact publications presenting some of the most exciting new ideas in ecology and evolution. It will also set a cohort of young scientists, many from underrepresented groups, on a pathway to success in the environmental sciences.\r\n\r\nThe ecological and biological stoichiometry theoretical frameworks apply mass balance of energy and multiple chemical elements to fluxes at multiple scales of biological organization and integrate them into an evolutionary framework.  The vision of the proposed product-focused event, The Woodstoich 4 Workshop, is to empower early career scientists to invigorate ecology by improving and expanding the use of stoichiometric theory. The proposed workshop will stimulate innovation by encouraging open dialogue and rigorous exchange of ideas and methods amongst diverse, early career scientists whose ways of working are not locked into place by tradition, long-standing habits, or professional obligation. Key concepts in the product-focused workshop framework include selection of a few, early-career post-doctoral researchers or first-year assistant professors with an innovative stoichiometric vision that lead working groups composed of other early career researchers to clarify that vision in the form of a manuscript that is rapidly but rigorously peer-reviewed for publication. Participants will apply and be selected based not only on their disciplinary focus and accomplishments but also to incorporate diversity that is essential to the creative effectiveness of groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEcological stoichiometry (ES) is a relatively new scientific approach for studying how key chemical elements like carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus are connected in ecological interactions.  It allows new insights into fundamental ecological questions as well as practical problems, such as pollution and climate change.  Since ES is a new field, much innovation in its development is coming from early career researchers (ECRs), such as graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.  This continuing workshop, held since 2004 on the five-year anniversaries of the Woodstock rock concert (this time from 15 to 19 August 2019), provides an opportunity for 25 ECRs to organize five working groups on topics in ecological stoichiometry of interest to them. \n\nBefore the workshop, selected participants chose a study topic, conducted analyses, and developed a draft research paper.  The five topics involved:  environmental change and human health; soil stoichiometry; the mountain cryosphere; silica biogeochemistry; and evolutionary ecology of species traits. During the first days of the workshop, the groups were mentored by three senior participants as they finalized their papers and submitted them for peer review at the journal Frontiers in Ecology &amp; Evolution on day three.\n\nOutcomes of the five papers are briefly summarized below.\n\n1.  The paper \"Elemental Ratios Link Environmental Change and Human Health\" highlighted how key chemical elements (like iron or phosphorus) can have major public health implications via direct and indirect pathways,\n\n2.  The paper \"Carbon and Nutrient Flows in Soil With Ecological Stoichiometry\" presents a new conceptual model of the connections of C, N, P, and S stoichiometry to carbon use efficiency in soil.\n\n3.  The paper \"Ecological Stoichiometry of the Mountain Cryosphere\" presents an overview of the potential utility of ES in better understanding the ecology of Earth's frozen habitats, the cryosphere.\n\n4.  The paper \"Exploring Silica Stoichiometry on a Large Floodplain Riverscape\" shows that rivers are not simple conduits for silica but are places where various features such as the complexity in watershed characteristics, hydrology, and biological uptake affect the relative abundance of Si compared to other elements along a river's course, using the Upper Mississippi System as an example.\n\n5. The paper \"Stoichiometric Traits Vary Widely Within Species: A Meta-Analysis of Common Garden Experiments\" compiled literature data to examine the relative roles of genetic and physiological variation in affecting the elemental processing by organisms with an emphasis on phosphorus.\n\nTwenty four hours after submission the anonymous peer reviews were returned and the participants began Frontiers' interactive peer review process.  All five papers were eventually accepted within the following three weeks and all were published in Frontiers by 10 October 2019.  An accompanying overview article written by the co-organizers and three senior participants was published in December 2019.\n\nAs for broader impacts, the workshop supported the training of 25 early career researchers (PhD candidates, postdocs, assistant professors or early career research professionals), 12 of whom were women.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/23/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James Elser"
