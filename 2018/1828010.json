 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cities are facing new demands as their urban populations rapidly grow. Smart City initiatives are being developed to address issues of mobility, infrastructure, security, and safety, while enhancing the quality of life of citizens. One-size-fits-all solutions are not viable.  Instead, the diversity of a city's residents, including life experiences, cultural backgrounds, needs, and behaviors, must be taken into account to achieve transformative, citizen-centered solutions. Engineers, scientists, policy makers, entrepreneurs, and thought leaders must be prepared to tackle future Smart City challenges, and address knowledge barriers in understanding the needs of citizens across age, occupation, financial standing, disability, and technology savviness. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the Arizona State University addresses this need by training the next generation of MS and PhD students for careers in Smart Cities-related fields. The project anticipates training thirty-eight (38) MS and PhD students, including twenty-four (24) funded trainees, from the following degree programs: Human and Social Dimensions of Science and Technology; Public Affairs; Computer Science; Civil, Environmental, and Sustainable Engineering; Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering; and Applied Engineering Programs. In addition to trainees, it is envisioned that over 300 other MS and PhD students in STEM disciplines will participate in opportunities made available through this traineeship. The knowledge and technologies developed from this project will contribute toward improving the quality of life for all of society through interdisciplinary, citizen-centered Smart City solutions.\r\n\r\nAn integrated education-research-practice model focused on the technological, societal, and environmental research aspects of citizen-centered solutions for Smart Cities will be employed to instill trainees with transdisciplinary skills and knowledge through cross-disciplinary courses; experience with leading collaborative, use-inspired research projects; applied learning through internships with partners and teaching opportunities; research experiences through service learning and leadership; and entrepreneurial education. Trainees will pursue research thrusts in Citizen-Centered Design; Smart City Infrastructure and Dynamics; and Socio-Environmental Practices and Policies. These thrusts are embedded in integrative priority application areas of Transportation and Accessibility; Safety, Security, and Risk Reduction; and Engagement and Education. Research efforts will significantly advance data-enabled citizen engagement; urban informatics; Internet-of-Things technologies; inclusion and accessibility; urban infrastructure; transportation systems; cybersecurity; swarm robotics; urban sustainability; quality of life and equity for citizens; hazards management and risk reduction; and societal concerns and ethics of emerging Smart City technologies. Focused efforts will be made to recruit underrepresented minorities, women, and individuals with disabilities, in order to tap underutilized talent, equip them to address the needs of their communities, and increase involvement of these groups in Smart Cities-related fields.\r\n\r\nThe NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.  This project was co-funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
