 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geographic Information System (GIS) skills are needed for jobs in many fields. GIS combines cartography, spatial analysis, and data management to support research and inform decision-making. Computer programmers or database administrators need GIS expertise to maintain or program databases containing geographic information. Mapping technicians apply GIS concepts when creating maps and charts. GIS is also used in city planning, developing marketing strategies, addressing public health concerns, and conducting geographic research. The use of GIS in many fields opens new employment options for students. Despite these employment needs, only four GIS certificates were awarded in the South-Central Coast Region of California between 2012-2015, all by a single community college that is 200 miles from San Luis Obispo, where Cuesta College is located. Since adequate GIS training is not currently available in the region served by Cuesta College, this project aims to meet the high-demand workforce needs across multiple industry sectors for Geographic Information System (GIS) Technicians.\r\n\r\nThis project establishes a GIS Analyst certificate at Cuesta College, a Hispanic-Serving Institution. Activities include outreach, and project-based and work-based learning designed to motivate more students to enroll in specialized GIS courses.  This increased enrollment is expected to increase the number of students, particularly Hispanic students, who earn a GIS Analyst certificate. The certificate will be part of the Earth and Ocean Science program but may appeal to students who seek to add GIS skills to other degrees, such as engineering or computer information systems.  Through seminars related to use of GIS in these and other fields, the project aims to engage faculty from different fields in the GIS project. The GIS Analyst certificate is also expected to appeal to workers who need to learn GIS skills to advance in their careers or to become competitive for a new job. The GIS Analyst certificate requires the addition of three new courses, which will be based on models developed by the GeoTech Center with funding from the National Science Foundation. Regional employers will contribute to the development of the curriculum and provide work experiences for students. Students enrolled in GIS courses will have the opportunity to attend the Environmental Systems Research Institute Users Conference, earn industry-recognized credentials, and display their projects at a local GIS event. By June 2021, the project aims to enroll forty students in GIS courses and projects that ten or more students will earn the GIS Analyst certificate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The goal for the program is to meet the high-demand workforce needs identified in the South Central Coast Region of California across multiple industry sectors for Geographic Information System (GIS) Technicians and Analysts.  The specific objectives were to create a one-year pathway to a GIS Analyst Certificate that launches in Fall 2019, enrolls 40 students and graduates 10 by June 2021 and provide 8 students with GIS work-based learning experiences by June 2021. \nThe PI has established the GIS Certificate Program which has been offered by the college for three years.  Cuesta College awarded certificates to 18 students earning the certificate by July 2022.  The program has enrolled a total of 130 students in courses since the program started in Fall 2019.  Seven students have been placed in internships with both government organizations and private companies. The internships completed in the final year placed students with the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), a local cultural resource management consulting firm, and a national environmental consulting firm.\nThe PI continued and strengthened relations with our core group of government and industry partners.  The program has extended its reach to partners throughout the US through the internship program.  The program has been successful in placing graduates in full-time positions as GIS technicians and analysts.\nThis project has also been successful in giving underrepresented student populations a pathway for vocational training and internship prospects.  \nIn addition to meeting the goals and objectives of this grant, we were able to work towards preparing the classes for acceptance into The California Virtual Campus &ndash; Online Education Initiative.  The courses will be reviewed for acceptance into this clearinghouse for online courses that helps students achieve their educational goals.  The online courses will be offered together with key resources that will help students enter and succeed in the GIS Certificate Program.  This program will help to extend the reach of our offerings to out of state students.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/30/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Feride Schroeder"
