 "awd_abstract_narration": "The movement of electrons in biomolecules and materials is central to many physical, chemical and biological processes as well as to electronics industry. The PI has found that protein filaments of common soil bacteria can move electrons similar to metallic systems. In this CAREER Project, the PI will identify the mechanism underlying this process that occurs over unprecedented distances. The results of the research could have applications in environmental, bioenergy, and microelectronics applications.  The PI will integrate this research into a range of educational activities that will inspire and train the next-generation of interdisciplinary students to tackle challenging problems. The PI will draw from his own training in biophysics and structural and molecular biology as well as his experience in technology innovation and entrepreneurship to reach students at all levels. Specifically, the PI will first develop a new cross-disciplinary curriculum for undergraduate and graduate students to introduce key concepts at the intersection of physics, chemistry and biology that are not covered in traditional courses. Second, the PI will design hands-on laboratory activity on the science of bacteria-powered fuel cells, using the feedback from the teachers of New Haven Public School that primarily serve minority students. Third, the PI will disseminate molecular structures through a user-friendly software based on First Glance and Proteopedia. Fourth, the PI will increase participation of underrepresented and minority students into research by working closely with the Yale assistant dean of science education and the coordinator for local community and outreach events. Thus, this CAREER project will integrate highly interdisciplinary research at the interfaces of physics, chemistry and biology with a diverse educational program reaching students at all levels.\r\n\r\n\r\nElectron transfer is fundamental to many life processes. Existing models of biological electron transfer rely primarily on tunneling and hopping mechanisms that are limited to few nanometers, and metallic conductivity has been considered impossible in proteins. These models cannot explain the remarkable capacity by bacteria to transport electrons over centimeters, 10,000 times their size. By introducing a new concept of delocalized conduction via closely stacked aromatic residues that can account for high conductivity in pili proteins, this CAREER project at Yale University proposal will expand the intellectual range of biophysics by building a mechanistic framework for extracellular electron transport. The overall goal of this project is to identify the mechanism of extracellular electron transfer in soil bacteria that occurs at rates and distances unprecedented in biology. Building on the discovery by the PI that pili protein filaments of Geobacter sulfurreducens show electrical properties similar to metallic polymers, this project aims to identify the structural, molecular and biophysical mechanism of metallic conductivity. First, the PI will identify crucial microscopic transport parameters in pili that led to electron delocalization. Second, the PI will visualize conformational changes in pili that drive electron transport. Third, the PI will obtain near atomic-resolution structures of pili using Cryo-EM. The success of this project could provide unprecedented new insights into the metabolism and communication of a diversity of microbial species that regulate our environment and are important for bioenergy and biofuel strategies. Engineering microbial interactions via conductive pili could potentially offer control over their physiology and ecology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We previously discovered that the common soil microbe Geobacter polymerizes cytochromes OmcS and OmcZ into highly-conductive filaments, so-called &ldquo;nanowires,&rdquo; by responding to an electric field at the electron donor/acceptor interface (<a href=\"https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(19)30291-0\"><em>Cell</em></a><strong><em> </em></strong>2019, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-020-0623-9\"><em>Nature Chemical Biology</em></a><em> </em>2020). These nanowires are hypothesized to be ubiquitous and enable diverse environmetanlly-importnat bacteria to respire by exporting electrons to extracellular acceptors such as minerals. Despite their importance and potential, protein nanowires remain poorly understood. One mystery is how nanowires transport electrons over micrometers despite electrons decaying exponentially in most proteins, thus limiting transport to a few nanometers.</p>\n<p>To address this question, we measured electron transport along individual OmcS nanowires as a function of nanowire length, temperature, voltage, and pH <strong>(</strong><a href=\"http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abm7193\"><em>Science Adv.</em></a><strong><em> </em></strong>2022).</p>\n<p>Our results yielded several surprises. First, <strong>electrons were able to move over micrometer distances along the nanowires with negligible energy loss and at a rate (&gt;10<sup>10</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) comparable to synthetic molecular wires </strong>(<strong>Fig. 1)</strong>. Second, the conductance of mostly metallic materials increases upon cooling. However, the intrinsic <strong>conductance of individual OmcS nanowires increased 300-fold upon cooling</strong> (<strong>Fig. 2)</strong>. The conductance of deuterated nanowires did not increase, likely due to a change in the hydrogen bonding network, as suggested by computations. Raman spectroscopy and computations indicated that <strong>cooling makes heme planar, which could alter their redox potential</strong>. Initial computations suggested a role of H-bonding networks in the conductivity.<strong> Protein surrounding the hemes thus acts as a temperature and pH sensor for environmental changes to control the conductivity of nanowires.</strong></p>\n<p>We photoexcited hemes in living biofilms and nanowires to understand the mechanism of high nanowire conductivity. We found up to a <strong>100-fold increase in conductivity in individual nanowires that persisted for hours</strong> &nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-32659-5\"><em>Nature Comm.</em></a><em> </em>2022). This result was astonishing because cytochromes do not show photoconductivity due to picosecond lifetimes of heme iron inhibiting any charge separation. Transient absorption spectroscopy and quantum dynamics simulations revealed <strong>ultrafast (&lt;200 fs) electron transfer in hemes</strong> that could partially account for high nanowire conductivity &nbsp;(<strong>Fig. 3</strong>). This work was selected as<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/ncomms/editorshighlights\"> Editor&rsquo;s Highlight</a> <strong>among the 50 best papers</strong> in Inorganic &amp; Physical Chemistry.</p>\n<p>Another mystery is how cells inject electrons into the nanowires by overcoming considerable spatial, kinetic, and thermodynamic barriers to move electrons from the inner membrane to the outer surface. The periplasmic space (&gt; 40 nm) is too large for direct electron transfer, which is limited to ~1.5 nm. Cells also pass electrons rapidly (&gt;10<sup>6</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) to the outer surface despite the kinetic barriers of a crowded periplasm and slow (&lt;10<sup>5</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) electron flow among periplasmic cytochromes. There is also a large (~100 mV) thermodynamic barrier for electron transfer from periplasm to nanowires because the redox potential of the periplasmic cytochromes is ~100 mV higher than that reported for OmcS.</p>\n<p>We found that <strong>OmcS nanowires possess 82 mV more positive redox potential than reported previously, with a large redox-active window</strong> (&gt; 160 mV) (<strong>Fig. 4,</strong> <a href=\"https://yale.box.com/s/v930nxn1uctvyua1gfrg1m36gk0psb5y\"><em>Nature Comm.</em></a> 2024). We further found that <strong>p</strong>eri<strong>p</strong>lasmic <strong>c</strong>ytochromes (PpcA-E) transiently bind to OmcS nanowires to <strong>wire the inner membrane to the outer surface directly</strong> at differing efficiencies with the least-abundance cytochrome showing the highest efficiency (<strong>Fig. 5)</strong>. &nbsp;Due to these unique electrochemical properties, PpcA-E can efficiently pass electrons directly from the inner membrane to outer-surface, by altogether avoiding the bottleneck caused by slow diffusion among periplasmic electron carriers.</p>\n<p>We further show that this <strong>defined nanowire-charging pathway is widespread</strong> in diverse environmentally important bacteria, including thermophiles and bacteria critical from bioremediation of oil spills and toxic materials. Our studies show that the periplasmic cytochromes and nanowires co-occur in diverse bacteria growing in extreme environments, enabling bacteria to exchange electrons rapidly without relying on the slow diffusion of monomeric or soluble electron carriers. <strong>We identify design principles for controlling microbial growth deep inside the Earth by engineering the binding interface between nanowires and periplasmic cytochromes to control the electron injection rate.</strong></p>\n<p>We had previously found that <strong><em>Geobacter</em></strong><strong> makes another nanowire made up of cytochrome OmcZ</strong>&nbsp; (<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-020-0623-9\"><em>Nature Chemical Biology</em></a><em> </em>2020), which is <strong>1000-fold more conductive than OmcS</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(19)30291-0\"><em>Cell</em></a><strong><em> </em></strong>2019) <strong>(Fig. 6)</strong>. To understand the structural, molecular, and biophysical mechanism underlying this extremely high conductivity, we combined cryo-electron microscopy with computational and functional studies (<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01315-5\"><em>Microbiology</em></a><em> </em>2022). We found that <strong>OmcZ shows highly linear and closely stacked hemes with a high excitonic coupling</strong> that could partly account for high conductivity <strong>(Fig. 6)</strong>. OmcZ also shows <strong>more surface-exposed hemes and more negative surface charge</strong>, contributing to higher conductivity. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our nanowire measurements and computations of <strong>high electron conductivity at ultrafast rates and metal-like temperature dependence</strong> suggest that many <strong>non-photosynthetic microbes employ </strong>highly efficient electron transport chains<strong> that could exploit quantum processes of electron delocalization and coherence</strong> to drive global biogeochemical processes. These processes may be monitored and controlled via protein nanowires.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/05/2024<br>\nModified by: Nikhil&nbsp;S&nbsp;Malvankar</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1749662/1749662_10527505_1709689632034_Slide1--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1749662/1749662_10527505_1709689632034_Slide1--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Electrons move efficiently in micrometer-long OmcS nanowires with negiligible carrier loss\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1749662/1749662_10527505_1709689632034_Slide1--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Electrons move efficiently in micrometer-long OmcS nanowires with negiligible carrier loss\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(Top) Conducting-probe AFM to measure nanowire conductance for various lengths.

Second, the conductance of mostly metallic materials increases upon cooling. However, the intrinsic conductance of individual OmcS nanowires increased 300-fold upon cooling (Fig. 2). The conductance of deuterated nanowires did not increase, likely due to a change in the hydrogen bonding network, as suggested by computations. Raman spectroscopy and computations indicated that cooling makes heme planar, which could alter their redox potential. Initial computations suggested a role of H-bonding networks in the conductivity. Protein surrounding the hemes thus acts as a temperature and pH sensor for environmental changes to control the conductivity of nanowires.\n\n\nWe photoexcited hemes in living biofilms and nanowires to understand the mechanism of high nanowire conductivity. We found up to a 100-fold increase in conductivity in individual nanowires that persisted for hours (Nature Comm. 2022). This result was astonishing because cytochromes do not show photoconductivity due to picosecond lifetimes of heme iron inhibiting any charge separation. Transient absorption spectroscopy and quantum dynamics simulations revealed ultrafast ( that could partially account for high nanowire conductivity (Fig. 3). This work was selected as Editors Highlight among the 50 best papers in Inorganic & Physical Chemistry.\n\n\nAnother mystery is how cells inject electrons into the nanowires by overcoming considerable spatial, kinetic, and thermodynamic barriers to move electrons from the inner membrane to the outer surface. The periplasmic space ( 40 nm) is too large for direct electron transfer, which is limited to ~1.5 nm. Cells also pass electrons rapidly (106 s-1) to the outer surface despite the kinetic barriers of a crowded periplasm and slow (5 s-1) electron flow among periplasmic cytochromes. There is also a large (~100 mV) thermodynamic barrier for electron transfer from periplasm to nanowires because the redox potential of the periplasmic cytochromes is ~100 mV higher than that reported for OmcS.\n\n\nWe found that OmcS nanowires possess 82 mV more positive redox potential than reported previously, with a large redox-active window ( 160 mV) (Fig. 4, Nature Comm. 2024). We further found that periplasmic cytochromes (PpcA-E) transiently bind to OmcS nanowires to wire the inner membrane to the outer surface directly at differing efficiencies with the least-abundance cytochrome showing the highest efficiency (Fig. 5). Due to these unique electrochemical properties, PpcA-E can efficiently pass electrons directly from the inner membrane to outer-surface, by altogether avoiding the bottleneck caused by slow diffusion among periplasmic electron carriers.\n\n\nWe further show that this defined nanowire-charging pathway is widespread in diverse environmentally important bacteria, including thermophiles and bacteria critical from bioremediation of oil spills and toxic materials. Our studies show that the periplasmic cytochromes and nanowires co-occur in diverse bacteria growing in extreme environments, enabling bacteria to exchange electrons rapidly without relying on the slow diffusion of monomeric or soluble electron carriers. We identify design principles for controlling microbial growth deep inside the Earth by engineering the binding interface between nanowires and periplasmic cytochromes to control the electron injection rate.\n\n\nWe had previously found that Geobacter makes another nanowire made up of cytochrome OmcZ (Nature Chemical Biology 2020), which is 1000-fold more conductive than OmcS (Cell 2019) (Fig. 6). To understand the structural, molecular, and biophysical mechanism underlying this extremely high conductivity, we combined cryo-electron microscopy with computational and functional studies (Microbiology 2022). We found that OmcZ shows highly linear and closely stacked hemes with a high excitonic coupling that could partly account for high conductivity (Fig. 6). OmcZ also shows more surface-exposed hemes and more negative surface charge, contributing to higher conductivity. \n\n\nOur nanowire measurements and computations of high electron conductivity at ultrafast rates and metal-like temperature dependence suggest that many non-photosynthetic microbes employ highly efficient electron transport chains that could exploit quantum processes of electron delocalization and coherence to drive global biogeochemical processes. These processes may be monitored and controlled via protein nanowires.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/05/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: NikhilSMalvankar\n"
