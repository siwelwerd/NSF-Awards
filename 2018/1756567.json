 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will improve knowledge of trends in income segregation in metropolitan regions in the post-2000 period. The first goal is to measure more accurately how residential segregation by income has evolved in the last decade. The second goal is to analyze how changes in the income composition of neighborhoods ? such as neighborhoods that are gentrifying or becoming more impoverished ? are tied to outcomes for individual families. What kinds of people are entering, leaving, and staying in changing neighborhoods?  Where do they come from and where do they go? What are the implications for their welfare? Neighborhood changes, changing forms of separation between more affluent and less affluent families, and minority access to better neighborhoods have a strong bearing on urban development related to housing inequality, affordable housing, and school disparities.\r\n\r\nThis study analyzes trends in income segregation since 2000, addressing two aspects of these trends. The first question is how measures of segregation are affected by the reduction in sample sizes in the American Community Survey (ACS), which scholars now rely on for data at the census tract level. There is good reason to believe that direct measures are biased upwards as sample sizes decline, so that results may show increasing segregation even if there has been no real change. The project will apply new methods of correcting for sample bias to the original sample data in a federal Research Data Center. Working with confidential data ameliorates other methodological limitations in published data including: 1) the suppression of data by race/ethnicity in tracts with small numbers of minority residents and 2) top-coding of the income distribution. The second question is how changes in the income composition of neighborhoods are produced through patterns of residential mobility. The project will make use of the original records from Census 2000 and 2010 and the 2008-2012 ACS that can be linked over time. The study will select neighborhoods that have experienced gentrification, poor neighborhoods that have become poorer, and affluent neighborhoods that have become more exclusive. In each type of neighborhood, it is possible to identify the number and characteristics of residents who remain from 2000 to 2010, who leave, and who enter.  This research will offer new insight into how individual-level (mobility) behaviors aggregate to macro-level (neighborhood) outcomes, which is an enduring issue in social science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary purpose of this study is to assess changes in the residential patterns of families with different incomes.  Some research reported a trend since 2000 for different income groups to become more separated from one another, a process of polarization of neighborhoods by social class.  It was observed that this polarization was especially strong among families with children, suggesting that more affluent families were seeking to preserve locational advantages for their children.  It was also observed that the polarization was stronger among African Americans and Hispanics than among whites, a pattern that was interpreted in terms of a growing minority middle class that was taking advantage of a wider range of options.  A problem with this research is that it relied on publicly available census data drawn from samples, and that the available samples had become smaller after 2000, a data problem that could in principle artificially inflate measures of income segregation, especially for smaller population groups.  One major outcome of the current study was development of methods to correct for changing sample sizes.  Using these methods required access to the original census data samples in a Federal Restricted Research Data Center, which was approved by the Census Bureau.  It was found that prior studies had indeed been biased by sampling issues.  Family income segregation rose markedly in the 1980s but only selectively after 1990.  For some categories of families, segregation actually declined after 1990. There has been an upward trend for families with children, but not specifically for families with children in the upper or lower 10% of the income distribution.  Separate analyses by race/ethnicity show that segregation was not generally higher among blacks and Hispanics than among white families.  Trends of time for these separate groups is mixed.  Segregation increased for all three categories for families with children.  Only among Hispanics was there evidence that the top 10% of families with children was separating from the rest of the Hispanic population.  Trends have varied for specific combinations of race/ethnicity, presence of children, and location in the income distribution, offering new challenges for understanding the underlying processes of change.   However the main finding is that although income inequality has increased substantially in recent decades, this change has not resulted in increasingly separate neighborhoods for richer, poorer, and middle income families.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/07/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John R Logan"
