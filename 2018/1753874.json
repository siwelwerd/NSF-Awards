This meeting brings together world leaders in space plasma phenomena from South Korea, Japan, Europe and United States. It also provides significant opportunity for students to participate in sessions. The meeting is largely focused on the variability of the space plasma environment. This is timely and relevant to the nation's space weather efforts. Understanding of the environment is important for understanding how space weather events evolve.",
