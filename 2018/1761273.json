 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nanoparticles are particles between 1 and 100 nanometer in size that possess unique, size-dependent properties due to their high surface area-to-volume ratios. Functional nanoparticles have the potential to benefit society through applications such as drug delivery, magnetic resonance imaging, renewable energy, optoelectronics, and catalysis.  These applications rely on an ability to precisely customize the surface chemistry of nanoparticles using thin-film coatings.  Nanoparticle thin-film coatings are typically on the order of a few monolayers in thickness, yet must be uniformly applied to individual nanoparticles. This award supports fundamental research into a new, high-precision thin-film nanoparticle coating strategy that overcomes current manufacturing challenges, including coating non-uniformity, by combining principles of atomic layer deposition, three-dimensional printing, and microfluidics.  Improving the uniformity of nanoparticle coatings enables new applications of functional nanoparticles across health, energy, and technology sectors.  This research award supports public engagement with nanotechnology through hands-on educational demonstrations of nanoparticle applications, with a focus on promoting inclusion for groups historically underrepresented in manufacturing research such as women and minorities.\r\n \r\nCurrent challenges in thin-film coating of nanoparticles include particle aggregation, non-uniform coating, limited thickness control, and undesired sensitivity to particle size and morphology.  This research award meets these challenges by combining the monolayer-by-monolayer deposition principle of conventional atomic layer deposition with the hydrodynamic nanoparticle manipulation approach known as deterministic lateral displacement to achieve a new nanomanufacturing technology termed 'Liquid Phase Atomic Layer Deposition'.  This approach represents a shift from conventional atomic layer deposition based on deposition at the solid-vapor interface to a new deposition physics based on successive adsorption and deposition reactions at the solid-liquid interface.  The research studies center on utilizing specially positioned nanoposts within a microfluidic channel to passively transport suspended nanoparticles into discrete, adjacent flow streams of successive reactant and wash solutions.  It is hypothesized that the controlled solid-liquid interface phenomena of Liquid Phase Atomic Layer Deposition yields a high degree of precision and uniformity for nanoparticle thin-film coating. The engineering of parallel three-dimensional microfluidic reactors, constructed by means of two-photon direct laser writing-based additive manufacturing, ensures that this method is also high throughput.  The research team investigates the phenomenon of Liquid Phase Atomic Layer Deposition through fundamental experimental studies, computational fluid dynamics simulations, and multiphysics finite element modeling.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Nanoparticle surface coatings are typically less than a few nm in thickness, and must be uniformly applied to individual particles. The ability to manufacture precise surface coatings on nanoparticles is of great importance in applications including drug delivery, magnetic resonance imaging, renewable energy, catalysis, and many other fields.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this project, a new concept for achieving highly uniform, precisely controlled nanoparticle surface coatings was envisioned and investigated. The new approach uses a microfluidic deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) platform to passively guide nanoparticles across sequential reactant and wash streams that deposit surface coatings one layer at a time on individual particles. DLD uses an array of microposts within a fluidic channel to guide suspended nanoparticles across discrete, parallel flow streams without altering the direction of the input fluid flow. The overall nanoparticle coating process is termed ?liquid-phase atomic layer deposition (ALD)? due to its similarity to conventional ALD used in the semiconductor industry. The principle challenges associated with nanoparticle surface coating by liquid-phase ALD are: 1) how to manufacture DLD arrays that can handle nanoscale particles; 2) how to achieve high throughput of nanoparticles; and 3) how to mitigate fluid mixing of reactant and wash streams. These challenges were investigated through a collaborative research effort led by PIs Roseanne Warren (University of Utah) and Ryan Sochol (University of Maryland, College Park).</p>\n<p>Two approaches were investigated to manufacture DLD arrays capable of manipulating micro/nanoscale particles. The first approach is a new method of patterning DLD arrays using nanosphere lithography. Through simulations and experiments, it was determined for the first time that triangular patterns produced from single-layer, self-assembled nanospheres can be used as DLD arrays (Figure 1). Statistical methods were employed to advance current understanding of nanosphere self-assembly and provide more consistent array patterning over large areas (Figure 2). A new method was devised to rapidly quantify nanosphere self-assembly from scanning electron microscopy images (Figure 3). The second approach is a novel Direct Laser Writing (DLW) 3D printing strategy that enables the fabrication of full DLD structures inside of microfluidic channels at high resolutions. Submicron-scale DLD array manufacturing was demonstrated for the first time using the Dip-in Laser Lithography printing mode of two-photon polymerization, using cyclic olefin polymer to print DLD arrays directly inside of unenclosed channels. The approach achieves submicron resolution by avoiding optical interference and height issues caused by interfacing surfaces typically present during <em>in situ </em>printing processes (Figure 4).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To increase particle throughput in DLD arrays, <em>in situ </em>DLW 3D printing was used for the first time to create micropost arrays inside a 200-?m-wide and 30-?m-high microchannel (Figure 5).

An interactive microfluidics demonstration was designed and built by a team of undergraduate senior design students at the University of Utah and donated to the Utah STEM Action Center for use in their outreach programs (Figure 6).
