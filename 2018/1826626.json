 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Midwest Regional Center of Excellence (LSMRCE) for Broadening Participation in STEM is a partnership of Chicago State University (CSU) and Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI). As co-founders of the pilot, Louis Stokes Midwest Center of Excellence (LSMCE),CSU and IUPUI extend the partnership to include the Ohio State University (OSU) and Fermi National\r\nAccelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) in order to deepen collaborations with 6 Midwestern LSAMPs while strengthening existing partnerships with non-LSAMP institutions that are LSMCE collaborators.\r\n\r\nThe LSMRCE also aims to become a regional backbone support organization for information dissemination that contributes to the development of the NSF INCLUDES National Network. The LSMRCE will develop, house, and distribute results of regional efforts in the collection, analysis, and assessment of best practices as recommended in the LSAMP model. It will also contribute to fundamental\r\nresearch in the science of broadening participation (BP).\r\n\r\nThe project team will implement four strategic plans: 1) Organize annual Broadening Participation conferences with BP professional development opportunities for students, faculty, and program administrators of both LSAMP and non-LSAMP institutions; 2) Provide social\r\nscience research guidance and support to promote BP research collaborations among STEM faculty on LSAMP and non-LSAMP campuses; and further investigate the contributing factors that facilitate sustainable partnerships/research collaborations for improving URM academic success; 3) Demonstrate tangible outcomes of key characteristics of the LSAMP model by providing URMs at LSAMP and non-LSAMP institutions with research skill development, mentoring, and professionalization activities; and 4)Develop a virtual BP resource center using features of the LSMCE website to disseminate current program information as well as evidence-based, high-impact BP practices.\r\n\r\nThe LSMRCE will obtain significant new knowledge on factors that sustain institutional collaborations that advance URM student achievement in STEM majors at Midwestern non-LSAMP campuses. The engagement in BP research collaborations of the faculty will help generate the needed data to assess  STEM education efficacy that reaches across all communities of learners who will graduate and advance\r\ntheir education in STEM. The LSMRCE will become a national model for fostering connections that are essential for expanding the INCLUDES Network (Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering & Science). The annual BP conferences, available on-line resources about LSAMP programming, and other analytics on high-impact practices in STEM teaching and learning will enable practitioners and researchers to design effective strategies for increasing the number of URMs who graduate with STEM degrees. LSMRCE summer research interns at Fermilab will be tracked and the impacts of collaborative mentoring on student persistence and advancement in STEM will be studied.\r\n\r\nThe project is co-funded by the NSF INCLUDES program which focuses on catalyzing the STEM enterprise to collaboratively work for inclusive change.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This report highlights the key outcomes and impacts of the project, showcasing its achievements and the lasting effects on the community. Over five years, LSMRCE's efforts to cultivate a strong community were exemplified by hosting annual conferences that evolved to meet the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Initially in-person, these conferences transitioned to virtual and hybrid formats, ultimately returning to an in-person format in 2023. The 2023 conference featured 20 sessions and attracted 321 participants from 111 higher education institutions, demonstrating the project's ability to adapt and thrive in different environments. These conferences were pivotal in fostering inclusivity and diversity in STEM, with a cumulative attendance of 2,344 individuals, including 1,210 students. STEM Education Research was a cornerstone of the LSMRCE initiative.</p>\n<p>The project supported and coached faculty to cultivate research collaborations and secure funding in STEM education. These efforts resulted in awarding mini-grants for collaborative research projects and developing an extensive annotated bibliography library of broadening participation research articles. These contributions have significantly advanced the academic community's understanding of sustainable partnerships and broadened participation in the STEM fields. Notably, the research team at Lawrence Technological University and the University of Rochester was very productive, with three manuscript submissions in peer-reviewed, 11 presentations, and a grant submission to NSF. Professional development was another critical focus area. LSMRCE provided valuable opportunities for students through internships at Fermilab and Eaton Corporation, complemented by professional development webinars and workshops. The Fermilab SIST program hosted 14 interns over five years, while Eaton's programs engaged hundreds of students and volunteers in hands-on experiences.
