 "awd_abstract_narration": "The frequency, duration and severity of droughts are increasing across the western United States and are affecting the growth of trees in forests.  However, predicting how the growth of specific forests will respond is difficult, especially in mountainous areas of the west that are characterized as having steep gradients in climate related to complex local topography. For example, the topography across a western landscape can affect the availability of water and light for the growth of trees and other plants, and the growth responses will depend on specific physiological attributes that vary highly across tree species. The main objective of this study is to link three factors (variability in climate, the physical characteristics of watersheds, and the physiology of vegetation) in order to better understand and predict forest productivity across mountainous landscapes of the west using model study sites in Montana and Oregon. The study will increase participation of underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics through development of K-12 lesson plans and science kits for rural schools across Montana. The study will also be carried out in collaboration with the Montana Climate Office to more effectively disseminate results to stakeholders and decision makers in the western United States related to natural resource management and stewardship.\r\n\r\nScientists, forest managers and decision makers must be prepared to understand, respond and adapt to the effects of a changing climate. This project will lead to improved predictions of how forests will respond to changes in climate in the future by more clearly linking the physical characteristics of mountain landscapes and the physiological attributes of trees in spatially explicit computer models of forest productivity. The methods to be used include a range of hydrological, tree physiological, and isotopic measurements, all nested within large-scale satellite remote sensing estimates of forest productivity. This project will merge concepts and methods from the fields of ecology and hydrology to provide a more comprehensive understanding of vegetation sensitivity to climate as related to its position in the landscape.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>The goal for this project was to understand the physical and plant physiological controls on plant water use and productivity in a complex montane ecosystem. &nbsp;At large spatial scales, e.g. across an elevational gradient, variation in temperature and precipitation largely control plant species composition and productivity. At the same elevation, topography, e.g. slope and aspect, can also control plant species composition and productivity through influences on insolation, soil moisture, and temperature. Our study had four main findings, ranging in scale from the watershed to tree cambial cells. At the watershed scale, we first found that landscape position modulated the sensitivity of trees to the local micro-climate; we found transpiration rates, hydraulic vulnerability, and tree cambial growth responses were more sensitive in trees growing in convergent areas (e.g. hollows) compared to divergent areas (e.g. hillslopes). Second, we also found that by combining both the supply (from soil) and demand (from atmosphere) components of the soil-plant-atmosphere water continuum, we could predict when trees reached their maximum growth rates, and when growth rates began to decline within the watershed. Third, our study highlights the importance of snowmelt as an dominant water source for trees in this region, primarily for trees growing in drier landscape positions where snowmelt in deeper soils was the main source of water throughout the entire year. Declining snowpack across the western U.S. can lead to additional drought responses from these trees. At the individual tree scale, our study focused on using stable oxygen isotopes from the wood cellulose to examine how changes in atmospheric aridity was recorded in the tree ring record. These findings contribute to our understanding of what climate signals are recorded in the tree rings, and can help interpret variations in climate over the last 100 years.</p>\n<p>The Broader Impacts of our study was to reach an audience that included both K-12 students, university students, and stakeholders across the state of Montana. For the K-12 component, we partnered with Montana State University's Extended University to build a program that brought middle school students across the state of Montana to a science camp during the summer. During 2015 and 2016, we contributed lessons titled, \"Hot and Cold Science\" as part of the week long ?MSU explore: Earth and Space Science Camp.? This camp was targeted at students from rural communities across Montana, many of whom were Native American students living on reservations. We interacted with 15 students for 1.5 hours every day for five days. Our lesson plans included: 1) climate versus weather, 2) hydrology and soils, 3) climate change and decomposition, and 4) dendrochronology. On the last day we played kickball with the students to review concepts they learned in class and made ice cream using liquid nitrogen and Douglas fir needles (from the trees they cored from the dendrochronology section). At the university level, we conducted field trips to our field site, with approximately 75 students visiting the site each semester. During the field trip students were exposed to hands on measurement techniques in meteorology (meteorological stations), hydrology (surface and groundwater exchange) and ecohydrology at our study sites across the Lubrecht Experimental Forest. Learning outcomes centered around watersheds and the organization of water and energy by topography. By the end of the field trip students were able to interpret and understand how landscape position influences micrometeorology, soil development, soil moisture and subsurface flow, and ultimately forest habitat productivity. For our outreach with stakeholders, we conducted two lectures for a Montana State University Extension?s Forestry Mini-College. Here, we highlighted research results for public landowners and taught basic lessons for managing for forest health in mountain landscapes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/01/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jia&nbsp;Hu</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1840737/1840737_10365723_1601589747488_UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_e5e--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1840737/1840737_10365723_1601589747488_UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_e5e--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Field site in Montana\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1840737/1840737_10365723_1601589747488_UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_e5e--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Field site in Montana\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Ponderosa pine field</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jia Hu</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jia&nbsp;Hu</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Field site in Montana</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1840737/1840737_10365723_1601591808695_IMG_0747--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1840737/1840737_10365723_1601591808695_IMG_0747--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Tree micro-cores\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1840737/1840737_10365723_1601591808695_IMG_0747--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Tree micro-cores\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">We collected micro-cores from trees to examine cambial growth and tree productivity</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Justin Martin</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jia&nbsp;Hu</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Tree micro-cores</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1840737/1840737_10365723_1601591899402_UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_e8f--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1840737/1840737_10365723_1601591899402_UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_e8f--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Reaching the canopy\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1840737/1840737_10365723_1601591899402_UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_e8f--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Reaching the canopy\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">In order to measure needles high up in the canopy, we spent a week in a cherry picker</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jia Hu</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jia&nbsp;Hu</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Reaching the canopy</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1840737/1840737_10365723_1601592057852_IMG_7014copy--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1840737/1840737_10365723_1601592057852_IMG_7014copy--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Take SWE measurements\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1840737/1840737_10365723_1601592057852_IMG_7014copy--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Take SWE measurements\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">At peak snowpack, we hiked out to the site to collect snow for measurements of snow water equivalent (SWE).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jia Hu</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jia&nbsp;Hu</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Take SWE measurements</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1840737/1840737_10365723_1601592157596_larch--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1840737/1840737_10365723_1601592157596_larch--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Larch in its full fall glory\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1840737/1840737_10365723_1601592157596_larch--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Larch in its full fall glory\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Western larch are one of the few deciduous conifers.
