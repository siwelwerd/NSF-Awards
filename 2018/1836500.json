 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum technologies can revolutionize modern information systems by enabling faster computing and secured communication. Such technologies can be realized by exploiting the quantum nature of light, namely, photons. Unfortunately, photons do not interact with each other on their own, which prevents their direct application for quantum information processing. With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program in the Division of Chemistry, Professors Arka Majumdar and Brandi Cossairt from the University of Washington are designing nanoscale optical structures that can store light for a long time while simultaneously confining it to a small volume. It is like focusing sun-light with a magnifying glass, but on the nanometer scale, the effect happens at a single photon level. Integrating nanoparticles with these optical nanostructures leads to a strong interaction between the photons. When photons are made to influence one another, they can then be used to distribute quantum information in a variety of useful ways. Discoveries from this project are advancing our understanding of how light interacts with matter, as well as leading to new, one-of-a-kind platforms for quantum technologies. Furthermore, the project is providing training and education in quantum technologies for graduate, undergraduate and high school students, with a strong emphasis on including women and students from underrepresented minorities groups. \r\n\r\nNano-optical resonators can enhance the light-matter interaction via spatial and temporal confinement of light. The integration of a single quantum dot with such a resonator can lead to the strong coupling regime, where individual photons repel each other in an effect known as photon blockade. Such strong interactions are necessary for simulating the complicated behavior of electrons in real materials and other strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. However, deterministic positioning of single quantum dots is a very difficult task, and to date remains unsolved. To address this problem, the team is using solution-processed colloidal quantum dots in conjunction with lithographically defined windows on each nano-resonator. Combining numerical simulations, new synthesis chemistry, and optical characterization, three research thrusts are pursued: (i) Synthesis of quantum dots with large physical size; (ii) Size-selective integration of quantum dots with nano-resonators and measurement of quantum optical properties; (iii) Optical spectroscopy and photon correlation measurements in a nonlinear cavity array. The proposed research is built upon the PI's prior work on solution processed quantum dots, cavity quantum electrodynamics, and single photon nonlinear optics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

While progress in integrated photonics has enabled large scale photonic circuits, it is imperative to develop methods for integration of quantum materials (to generate single photons or to engineer interaction between photons) with such circuits. This challenge remains unmet for large-scale semiconductor photonic systems. In this proposal we developed a method to deterministically position colloidal quantum dots on low mode-volume nano-cavities. The idea is to lithographically define a window on top of a prefabricated cavity, through which the solution processed quantum material can come in contact with the cavity. In our system, by controlling the size of the window, the number of quantum dots could be controlled. We also made progress in developing new synthetic approaches to physically large quantum dots, in the form of nanoscale tetrapods, which can be useful to limit the number of quantum dots coupled to a single cavity - pushing towards the desired limit of one quantum dot per cavity. Along with new quantum dot architectures, we explored the coupling of colloidal nano-platelets to the cavities. Such a hybrid system could enable single photon nonlinear optics, where single photons repel each other.
