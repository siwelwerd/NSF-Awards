 "awd_abstract_narration": "Distributed computing is the area of computer science that reasons about the ability of networks of independent computers to solve computational problems.  This project focuses on locality sensitive models of distributed computing, which model many types of networks arising in the real world, for example, wired computer networks, wireless sensor networks, and networks of biological agents (cells, ants, etc.).  The concept of local interaction is a compelling one that has been studied across the sciences. Theoretical advances in locality-sensitive distributed models will shed new light on similar models studied by biologists, physicists, and neuroscientists, and thereby have a broad impact across scientific disciplines. A key goal of this project is to develop and actively promote practical and theoretically attractive models of energy-efficiency for distributed computing. This project will support the development of a new course in theoretical distributed computing at the University of Michigan.\r\n\r\nThe project will focus mainly on the LOCAL model and derivatives that incorporate congestion, energy, radio communication, and randomization. One goal of this project is to develop a complexity theory for these models, and specifically to develop \"time hierarchy\" type theorems, characterize the value of random bits, search for complete problems within various complexity classes, and prove unconditional separations between easy and hard problems.  Another goal is to understand the exact complexity of critical algorithmic primitives in these distributed models, including symmetry-breaking primitives and information-dissemination primitives like broadcast and gossiping.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project studied theoretical models of distributed systems, and the computational complexity of solving problems on a distributed system.  In a distributed system there are numerous computational devices and some underlying communications medium, for example, a fixed physical network, or a wireless network.  Computational devices typically solve the given problem using only locally available information and communicating with their immediate neighbors.  \n\nOne half of the project focused on developing a complexity theory for classical LOCAL and CONGEST models of distributed computing, in which the communications network is fixed and unknown, and in designing new LOCAL/CONGEST algorithms for the most fundamental problems.  We established the first time-hierarchy theorem for the LOCAL model, which, informally, says that given more time, asymptotically, we can solve more problems.  Unlike the time-hierarchy theorem for Turing machines, there are several non-trivial \"gaps\" in the LOCAL time-hierarchy where no problem complexities exist.  These gaps were established by proving that algorithms with certain time complexities can be mechanically speeded up.  This line of inquiry also revealed that randomization in LOCAL can sometimes speed up algorithms exponentially (something conjectured not to be true of Turing machines).  The project produced new algorithms for classical symmetry breaking problems such as vertex- and edge-coloring graphs, and the first optimal triangle enumeration algorithm for the CONGEST model.\n\nThe other half of the project focused on developing an attractive theoretical model of energy complexity in wireless radio networks.  Modern sensor networks consist of many tiny battery-powered devices, and the primary limitation of such networks is not computational power or time, but battery life, which can be efficiently conserved by entering a sleep-mode in which communication (transmitting or listening) is turned off.  We defined the energy complexity of an algorithm to be the number of time-slots spent transmitting/listening to the channel, and investigated the energy complexity of basic computational tasks.  In clique-networks, we proved sharp bounds on the energy-complexity of leader election and estimating the size of the clique.  On arbitrary wireless networks, we proved nearly sharp bounds on the energy complexity of Broadcast, computing Shortest Paths, computing the Diameter of the network, and computing Maximal Matchings.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/07/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Seth Pettie"
