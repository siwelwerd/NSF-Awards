 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tsunamis create major geohazards for populated coastal areas, whose mitigation requires understanding of the generation mechanisms. Numerical models of tsunami generation and propagations are used in support of warning systems and for the creation of inundation maps for hazard assessment. Tsunamis can be attributed to seismic (i.e., earthquakes and submarine landslides) or non-seismic sources (i.e., volcanic eruptions). The latter are prevalent in some areas around the world (e.g., Aleutian arc for US West Coast).  Our understanding of tsunami generation from mechanisms such as earthquakes, landslides, and volcanic collapse, has largely resulted from devastating events (e.g., Papua New Guinea, 1998; Indian Ocean, 2004; Japan, 2011), which combined have caused over 300,000 fatalities and US $30B of damage.  Due to lack of a major recent event, eruption generated tsunamis (the focus of this study) remain largely under-studied. In this multi-disciplinary study, the US/UK team will perform collaborative field and modeling research, to improve our understanding of tsunamis generated by volcanic eruptions, especially those from large-volume, caldera-forming events close to the sea, which are among the most devastating geohazards. Work will focus on the 1883 Krakatau eruption-generated tsunami, which caused over 33,000 fatalities in Indonesia. Although this eruption was well studied, there is still controversy over the tsunami generation mechanism and, since 1883, apart from a surge of interest during its 100-year anniversary, there has been little new data, which would be a basis for a major project on the event. The new understanding/modeling resulting from this project will improve tsunami hazard assessment and warning from such sources, and could improve operational tsunami hazard assessment and inundation mapping work as tsunami warning systems for non-seismic sources with significant implication in population safety. Project results will be disseminated to the scientific and broader communities at professional conferences, in peer-reviewed journals, by building an extensive website (with project metadata, news, podcasts/videos, and auxiliary information), and through the visualization of scientific data (targeting a K-12 audience). A workshop will be organized in Indonesia at the outset to engage local people and scientists (support from Newton funds is being sought). There will be active collaboration with colleagues at Greek/Caribbean/Mediterranean-based institutions/organizations, facing similar eruption-tsunami risks.\r\n\r\nAs a large-volume, caldera-forming event Krakatau is representative of similar other well studied historical events (e.g., 3500BP Santorini and 7500BP Kikai), and includes diverse tsunami generating mechanisms: pyroclastic density current (PDC) discharges into the sea, caldera collapse, and explosions. It also has an exceptional eruption and tsunami record from observations at the time. The objectives of the study are to: 1) apply improved numerical models of tsunamis from volcanic eruption mechanisms (including seafloor deposits), mainly PDC and caldera collapse; 2) perform new field surveys of on land tsunami sediment deposits, to discriminate individual tsunami events and their impact; 3) perform new PDC field surveys, complementing a pilot offshore seismic database showing that individual PDC flows can be identified and mapped, and their runouts and volumes estimated; 4) use these estimates to understand physical properties of PDCs as they enter the sea; and 5) use the new data (sediment, PDC) as a basis for applying the new numerical tsunami models. Tsunami simulations will be carried out iteratively by comparing model outputs (inundation limits, runups; PDC deposits/runouts) with historical documentation of impacted areas along the coasts of Sumatra and Java, and both old and newly acquired PDC and sediment deposit field survey data.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This was well illustrated in popular culture by the many movies (e.g., the 1968 blockbuster &ldquo;Krakatau East of Java&rdquo;), television series, and books inspired by this event. In this project, our multidisciplinary team of US and UK scientists, including volcanologists/ geophysicists, marine geologists, physical oceanographers, and numerical modelers, reanalized all prior work on and data (including a large vault of pumice and other samples collected on site in earlier projects by University of Rhode Island colleagues) from this event, as well as collected new field data for both seafloor sediment and onshore runup, to explain the key mechanisms of this catastrophic eruption and tsunami generation that killed over 33,000 people in Java and Sumatra (Fig. 1 shows runup in m). As there are many similar volcanos worldwide that could suffer a similar fate in the future, it is very important to better understand, and hence predict, the effects of such mechanisms, to mitigate the hazard posed by such events on our increasingly populated coastal areas. At Krakatau, numerous observations indicated that several and then a final paroxysmal explosion, associated with large pyroclastic flows/pyroclastic density currents (PDC), some of these being tsunamigenic, preceded the large-scale collapse of the volcano main edifice and the formation of the present caldera, surrounded by the three small islands of Sertung, Rakata and Pajung (Fig. 2 shows K pre-post eruption map; Fig. 3 shows K pre-eruption bathy/topo). Despite the large amount of work done, however, the relative contribution of these mechanisms to the catastrophic tsunami was still uncertain. Measurements at a distant tide gauge in Batavia (now Jakarta) showed the arrival of a large elevation wave, about 2.5h after the final massive explosion. Additionally, the pressure pulse (Lamb waves) caused by the latter was recorded all around the world, together with the generation of small tsunamis associated with the Proudman resonance phenomenon.</p>\n<p>Our plans were to survey Krakatau in the summer 2018 shortly after starting the project and from there to proceed with our planned data analysis and modeling. However, surveys were delayed and on 12/22/2018, Anak Krakatau (AK), the &ldquo;son of Krakatau&rdquo; that had emerged from the side of the caldera in 1929 to grow over 330 m tall, unexpectedly collapsed following 6 months of on/off eruption, losing two-third its height and discharging 0.22 km<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;of material in the ocean. This caused a landslide tsunami that killed nearly 450 people and destroyed a large swath of the nearby shores (Fig. 4 shows 3D then 2D modeling). This unique event, which was observed by numerous instruments, forced us to revise both our modeling and survey plans. This led to both improving and validating new numerical models, that allowed explaining all the near- and far-field observations and newly collected field data for AK in summer 2019. These improved models were then applied to modeling both the PDC and caldera collapse mechanisms that occurred during the K1883 event (Fig. 5).</p>\n<p>On 1/15/22, a second seminal event occurred, the explosive eruption and tsunami generation of the Hunga Tonga Hunga Ha&rsquo;apai (HTHH) volcano, that again led us to revise our priorities. With a large-scale explosion and caldera collapse, and the intense generation of Lamb waves and related distant tsunamis, the strong similarities with K1883 made this event another extensively observed proxy for our primary objective. Studying HTHH led us to improving our tsunami models with the inclusion of tsunami generation by an underwater explosion and the pressure pulse generation (Fig. 6). The modified models were then applied to K1883, showing that while a trigger, the ultimate large explosion was not the major contributor to the near-field tsunami generation, which instead resulted from the combined paroxysmal PDC generation/edifice collapse. Simulating tsunamis generated by these mechanisms at the time of the largest explosion, explains the majority of observed 15-35m runups (Fig. 1), their timing, and the arrival time and magnitude of the waves observed at Batavia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/30/2023<br>\nModified by: Stephan&nbsp;T&nbsp;Grilli</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1756665/1756665_10531204_1701382298878_Fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1756665/1756665_10531204_1701382298878_Fig2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 2: Krakatau 1883 pre-/post-eruption\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1756665/1756665_10531204_1701382298878_Fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 2: Krakatau 1883 pre-/post-eruption\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Krakatau (left) before and (right) after eruption plan view and bathymetry recreated from field data (leaving a 250 m deep Caldera in the middle)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Grilli et al.
