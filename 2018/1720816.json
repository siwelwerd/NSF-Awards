A key ingredient is the electron spin. Quantum mechanically, the electron behaves like a very tiny top, and because of its charge like a tiny magnet as well. As the electron moves through the crystalline lattice, the electric field of the nuclei looks like a magnetic field which interacts with the magnetic character of the electron and so, the direction of its spin. In this research project, the PI will develop a theoretical description of electrons that interact strongly with each other and with the periodic lattice of nuclei through its spin in natural and artificially constructed crystalline materials. The PI will investigate a phenomenon which results from the interplay between the electrons interacting with the lattice and electrons interacting with each other; this leads to a new type of spin wave which might be used to carry data in computing devices. These spin waves can provide transfer of spin information over macroscopic distances with virtually no loss of energy, and allow for the implementation of new computing concepts.  In connection with the research, the PI will develop a new mini-course on subjects relevant to this award for a multi-faculty course \"Advanced Topics in Condensed Matter Physics\" and organize an international workshop on quantum phase transitions. The significance of the research results will be communicated to a broader audience through the Funsize Physics website and public lectures.\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis award supports theoretical research and education to develop and pursue the consequences of a consistent theory of materials systems with strong correlations among electrons and among spin and orbital degrees of freedom, a chiral Fermi liquid theory. The PI will explore predictions of this theory with consequences accessible to experiment. The research involves the identification and investigation of possible new phases of electronic matter in materials with strong spin-orbit-coupling and analyses of various experimental fingerprints of the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and electron-electron interaction. The main thrusts of the project include developing: i) a theory of electron-and electron-dipole spin resonance effects in a chiral Fermi liquid; ii) a many-body theory of Raman scattering from collective spin excitations in a chiral Fermi liquid; iii) a theoretical analysis of recently observed chiral spin waves and chiral excitons at the surface of a three-dimensional topological insulator (bismuth selenide); iv) an analysis of possible nematic phases of a two-dimensional electron system with SOC; and v) an analysis of the competition among possible instabilities in the spin channel of a non-chiral Fermi liquid. In connection to the research, the PI will develop new mini-courses on subjects relevant to this award for a multi-faculty course \"Advanced Topics in Condensed Matter Physics\" and will organize an international workshop on quantum phase transitions. The significance of the research results will be communicated to a broader audience through the Funsize Physics website and public lectures.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In what follows, we briefly summarize some of the main outcomes.</p>\n<p>A Fermi liquid is a state of interacting fermions, e.g., electrons in metals or&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>He atoms, which resembles in some respects a free-fermion gas. Unlike a gas, however, it supports a unique class of collective modes: zero-sound waves. While usual sound is a wave of pressure (or number density), zero sound is a wave of numbers of fermions with energies above or below the Fermi energy. We predicted a new type of collective modes in two-dimensional Fermi liquids: ?hidden?? zero-sound waves. Conventional zero-sound waves can be detected by measuring a response of a system to a weak perturbation of its number density or magnetization. The predicted hidden zero-sound modes cannot be observed like that. However, they can be observed in a time-resolved experiment, when one electromagnetic pulse (?pump?) excites the system, while another one (?probe?) monitors how the system relaxes back to equilibrium.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) forms the foundations of spintronics by enabling purely electric control of spins. SOC is a relativistic effect, which becomes more pronounced when electron speeds become comparable to the speed of light. In heavier atoms, electrons spin around nuclei faster, and thus SOC is stronger. Graphene, a monolayer of carbon atoms, has many attractive properties but, with carbon being a very light element, strong SOC is not among them. However, if graphene is mounted on a substrate containing heavier elements (typically, on a transition metal dichalcogenide or TMD), graphene electrons spend some time around heavy nuclei of transition metals, which induces strong spin-orbit coupling. Experimental and theoretical studies of graphene/TMD structures is currently a very active research area. Within this project, we predicted that a graphene/TMD system should support a new kind of spin waves. The forces responsible for such waves arise from two types of SOC: the Rashba one and valley-Zeeman one. Rashba SOC acts as an effective magnetic field that enforces an in-plane helical spin structure with electron spins being perpendicular to their momenta, whereas Zeeman SOC favors a state in which spins in different valleys are opposite to each other and perpendicular to the plane. The interplay between two types of SOC and electron-electron interaction results a propagating wave, in which the average magnetic moment and opposite magnetic moments of the two valleys oscillate in sync to each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;This effect should be detectable via electron-spin and electric-dipole-spin resonances. When an in-plane magnetic field is applied, physics becomes even richer. The TMD substrate is expected not only to induce SOC in graphene but also to open a gap at the points where the two Dirac cones touch (the Dirac point). A gapped Dirac point has a non-trivial topology: it harbors a magnetic monopole. The effective magnetic of this monopole (Berry curvature) affects electron orbits as if it were a real field. As a result, not only the diagonal but also the Hall component of the optical conductivity are predicted to shows a resonance at the spin-wave frequency.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In a ferroelectric, electric dipoles are aligned in one direction, pretty much like magnetic moments are aligned in a ferromagnet. An important class of materials are ``quantum paraelectrics? (QPE), which come very close to being ferroelectric but never make it due to a zero-point motion of atoms.&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong fluctuations of the electric dipole field result in gigantic dielectric constants. For example, the low-temperature dielectric constant of an enigmatic QPE SrTiO<sub>3&nbsp;</sub>is 25,000 (to be compared with 12 of silicon). Even at very low doping levels, a QPE conducts electricity in a metallic-like way, i.e., its resistivity increases with temperature. The most puzzling observation is that the resistivity scales as&nbsp;<em>T<sup>2</sup></em>&nbsp;over a wide temperature range. Normally, such a scaling is associated with the Fermi-liquid behavior. However, the&nbsp;<sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;</sup><em>T<sup>2</sup></em>-scaling in QPE straddles the temperatures both below and above the Fermi temperature, and thus cannot be a Fermi-liquid effect. We proposed an alternative explanation in which the&nbsp;<em>T<sup>2</sup></em>&nbsp;-scaling is attributed to the interaction of electrons with two transverse optical phonons, which (in direct connection with the gigantic dielectric constants) have very low frequencies in QPE. Our model explains the existing data fairly well and works both below and above the Fermi temperature.</p>\n<p>The results of this project have been summarized in 14 papers published in high-impact journals, including PNAS, npj Quantum materials, Phys.
