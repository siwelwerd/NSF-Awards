 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two decades ago, the National Science Foundation supported the development of the English Lexicon Project (ELP), a critical database for researchers exploring how people read. The ELP affords measures of word recognition for over 40,000 words across over 1200 participants that were collected at six universities. Importantly, these data are made available to the wider research community via a user-friendly website at elexicon.wust.edu.  Using the database, researchers can select stimuli with specific characteristics for experiments exploring the nature of reading and its neural underpinnings. Moreover, the database has been important in identifying new variables that influence the reading process.  The impact of this database on research is exemplified by the over 1600 (google scholar) citations to the original (2007) publication describing the project.  The website is accessed approximately 250 times each week from researchers worldwide.  This is a prime example of how big data can have a substantial impact on a theoretically important area that has clear applied implications, i.e., how individuals read words.  \r\n\r\nThis ELP is being run on an outdated computer that has outlived its life expectancy and the original software interface is no longer supported.  This proposal is to rewrite the programs for the user interface using current  software supported by  a virtual computer system within the  Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Washington University.  This will ensure the database remains available to the psycholinguistic community.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOver 20 years ago the English Lexicon Project was originally funded by the National Science Foundation, as an early example of a big data effort.  This project allowed the acquisition of behavioral data (both response latencies and accuracy) concerning how people recognize over 40,000 visually presented words.  In addition, an interface was originally developed that allowed the easy access to these data (along with a host of additional variables) for developing models of word reading and the selection of stimuli for future studies.  This interface has been widely used and accessed nearly 50 times per day since its inception.  Because the computer and ithe interface that supported the English Lexicon Website were outdated, and new variables had become available since the original implementation, a new computer interface was necessary along with the addition of the new variables.  Hence, the new project (Rejuvinating the English Lexicon Project) was funded to accomplish these goals.  This project added new variables and implemented the interface on a platform, which ensures the continued availability of this widely used database.  The system continues to be a valuable resource.  The original publication describing the English Lexicon Project has been cited over 2500 times, and over 250 times this past year.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/14/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David A Balota"
