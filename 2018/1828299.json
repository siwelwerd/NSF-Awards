 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to develop an \"advanced molecular microscope\" for visualizing chemically complex and diverse substrates, including biological tissues and materials (e.g., polymeric drug delivery systems). This instrument will provide revolutionary capabilities for the visualization of biological molecules, dramatically expanding our understanding of cellular systems. The proposed instrument combines state-of-the-art laser optics and mass spectrometric analysis into a single molecular imaging platform. This instrument will enable ultra-high spatial resolution imaging of thousands of biomolecules virtually at the same time. Development and assessment of the instrument will be done in collaboration with internationally recognized scientists whose projects were specifically chosen based on their critical need for the proposed technologies. The challenges raised by each project will drive further technology development. These projects span numerous application areas, including engineered drug delivery systems, natural product discovery and identification, fundamental research in life science, and plant metabolism and biofuels. This next-generation molecular imaging platform will be the foundational instrument of tomorrow. \r\n\r\nThe instrument to be developed is a state-of-the-art ultra-high spatial resolution matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) orthogonal quadrupole time-of-flight (TOF) molecular imaging platform. MALDI imaging mass spectrometry combines the sensitivity and molecular specificity of mass spectrometry with the spatial fidelity of classical microscopy. Imaging MS is label-free, untargeted (concurrently detects thousands of chemically diverse molecular species), sensitive (femtomole limits-of-detection), and specific (discriminates molecules that differ by <0.001 Da). Commercial imaging mass spectrometry platforms are adaptations of instruments built for other purposes and thus offer only limited imaging capabilities, lacking the performance to solve in-depth challenges that complex chemical systems present. The proposed novel MALDI timsTOF molecular imaging system will provide an unprecedented combination of ultra-high spatial resolution imaging capability (1 micrometer laser beam diameter), high-performance mass analysis (accuracy: <2 ppm, resolving power: >50,000), high resolving power ion-mobility separations (resolving power: >150-200), and highly multiplexed fragmentation from a single pixel (>200 MS/MS events/s). This instrument will be the cornerstone molecular imaging platform of the Vanderbilt University Mass Spectrometry Research Center. The operational instrument will address the critical research needs of Vanderbilt University as well as the regional, national and international scientific communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (or MALDI) is one way to conduct a mass spectrometry experiment where a laser is focused onto a surface to desorb and ionize molecules from samples such as biological tissues. When this laser is scanned across the surface of a biological sample, it generates many mass spectra, one from each location or &lsquo;pixel.&rsquo; The many spectra can then be reassembled to create an image of the abundance distribution of each molecule in the sample. We refer to this experiment as imaging mass spectrometry (IMS). Different types of mass spectrometers have been used for imaging mass spectrometry. Axial time-of-flight mass spectrometers have been the primary detectors for IMS, but these have a few limitations. First, the chamber with the laser and the sample (called the &ldquo;ion source&rdquo;) must be under high vacuum, limiting certain sample preparations that can be used. Second, the ion source is coupled to the detector, meaning that aberrations in the sample surface directly affect the measured mass. Thirdly, there is no way to tell the difference between molecules of the same or very close mass &ndash; they appear as the same image. We have developed a novel imaging mass spectrometry instrument in collaboration with Bruker Daltonics called a MALDI timsTOF, which alleviates these limitations.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has a semi-atmospheric ion source decoupled from the detector and an ion separation device called trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) that helps distinguish between molecules with the same mass.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The ion source has been decoupled from the detector using a quadrupole time-of-flight detector (qTOF) instead of an axial time-of-flight instrument. Because of this, mass measurements have improved both mass resolution and accuracy. Furthermore, the system's new design allows for improved laser optics, which has permitted higher spatial resolution images. Prior commercial systems offered routine 50-100 micron pixel sizes. The developed platform enables routine 5 micron pixel imaging. Figure 1 is an example from human kidney tissue, specifically the glomerulus. The glomerulus is critical for filtering toxins from the blood and excreting those toxins as urine. Prior lower-resolution IMS studies show the entire glomerulus as a single &ldquo;dot&rdquo; or a single signal. Figure 1 shows that at 5 micron spatial resolution, we can now resolve the substructures within the human glomerulus by their unique molecular profiles.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We have also implemented a TIMS cell to separate inside the instrument prior to detection. This allows for separating molecules with the same or very similar mass. The TIMS cell operates using an electrostatic field that &ldquo;halts&rdquo; the molecules within the device. A gas is then flowed through the trapped molecules,&nbsp;&nbsp;colliding with them. Bulky, branchy molecules will feel the force from the gas more strongly, causing them to exit the TIMS cell faster when the electric field is reduced. We have utilized TIMS separations to visualize ganglioside isomers in rat brain hippocampus, as seen in Figure 2. Two ions having the exact same mass but a different shape are located in two distinct regions within the rat brain. Without TIMS, these two discreet ions would appear to be localized incorrectly throughout the hippocampus.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another advancement we have made is the development of parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation imaging mass spectrometry (PASEF-IMS). PASEF is a technique in which ions are eluted from the TIMS cell sequentially, isolated by the quadrupole, and then fragmented in the collision cell. Ion fragmentation is a method in which researchers figure out the exact structure of a molecule by fragmenting it and looking at the resulting pieces &ndash; like a puzzle. Figure 3 shows how a single molecule seen at m/z 788.54 in the human glomerulus can be fragmented and imaged using this approach. A significant advancement we have made with this platform is the ability to do this for more than 120 molecules within a single imaging experiment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The technologies developed here by Drs. Jeffrey Spraggins and Richard Caprioli are already being used by researchers to better understand a range of biological and medical questions.
