 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will contribute to the national welfare, health and prosperity by advancing mathematical dynamic models that can accurately capture and predict slip-and-fall accidents. Unintentional falls are the leading cause of nonfatal human injuries and the second leading cause of accidental deaths. The fall-related economic and societal costs for elders and professional workers are very substantial, and foot slippage is one of the major causes.  This project will develop mathematical models and balance control strategies informed by human motor skills. In collaboration with Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation, this knowledge will enable development of innovative personalized assistive and rehabilitation technology for prevention of slip-induced falls. The researchers will also develop a number of integrated research and education programs to attract students from underrepresented groups into engineering and involve undergraduate students into research.\r\n\r\nSlip-and-fall consists of a series of continuously rapidly changing, whole-body human movements. It is challenging to capture and model human motion and reaction to slip due to complex slip biomechanics, human interactive neuro-musculoskeletal control and lack of real-time sensing and assistive technologies for reliably detecting the foot slip and helping design bipedal balance control under slip. The project will emphasize (1) the development of new dynamics models to understand and capture the bipedal walking locomotion under slip; (2) a new human-inspired balance recovery design to prevent slip-induced falls; and (3) experimental validation and testbed development to real-time detect slip and effectively prevent slip-induced falls. The new knowledge and design tools developed in this project will also serve as a cornerstone to further advance understanding, modeling and control of unsteady, unstable, agile bipedal locomotion and performance.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
