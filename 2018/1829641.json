 "awd_abstract_narration": "Viral infections of marine microbes can transform the fate of microbial populations that fuel global ocean biogeochemical cycles. For example, viral infections of microbes lead to the release of carbon and nutrients back into the environment. This regeneration of carbon and nutrients stimulates the activity of other microbes and diverts carbon and nutrients from larger organisms in marine food webs. Because virus-microbe infections are relatively specific, it is critical to identify those pairs of viruses and microbes that may disproportionally contribute to the turnover of carbon and nutrients in the ocean. This project will develop quantitative approaches and tools to quantify which viruses infect which microbes and to use these data to quantify how viral infections of microbes collectively shape nutrient and carbon cycles in the North Atlantic Ocean.  The project will analyze virus-microbe interactions in mesocosms at the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in mid-coast Maine and during open ocean expeditions to the Bermuda Atlantic Time-Series Study (BATS) site. An interdisciplinary team will leverage recent advances in molecular biology, computational biology, and mathematical modeling to identify virus-host partners and their impact on the movement of elements through marine systems. This project will support three graduate students, six undergraduate students and one postdoctoral researcher in an interdisciplinary context.  Research advances will be translated into reproducible software methods to be disseminated via the community cyberinfrastructure platform iVirus, with additional training materials presented as part of a viral methods and informatics workshop held at The Ohio State University.  The translation of discoveries to the public will be furthered by the involvement of journalism undergraduate students at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville. \r\n\r\nThis project builds upon advances in the molecular toolkit of viromics to develop an integrated approach to characterize lineage-specific rates of infection, lysis, and nutrient release induced by marine viruses in open ocean ecosystems. It will combine theory, in vitro experiments, and in situ sampling to (i) extend a robust inference method for estimating virus-microbe cross-infection networks from time-series data; (ii) establish and characterize in-vitro protocols for inferring cross-infectivity in complex communities using culture-independent methods; (iii) estimate lineage-specific rates of lysis and regeneration of nutrients in marine systems, including applications to coastal and open ocean ecosystems. Project aims focus on quantifying the extent to which virus-induced lysis and regeneration of carbon and nutrients is heterogeneously distributed across microbial populations. To do so, the project will incorporate time series measurements of abundance information (via metagenomes) and activity information (via metatranscriptomes). In so doing, it will advance efforts to understand community-scale interactions rather than those amongst a single virus-host pair. Theoretical methods and in vitro protocols will directly infer lineage-specific infection, lysis, and nutrient release rates in coastal- and open-ocean ecosystems in the North Atlantic Ocean.  Results will be used to identify key links that disproportionately influence bulk nutrient release.  A novel PCR-based approach will augment and validate the core inference approach. Overall, the project aims to enhance our understanding of how viruses contribute to marine ecosystem function.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe project was a collaboration between the University of Tennessee, The Ohio State University and Georgia Institute of Technology/The University of Maryland. The main goal of the research was to understand how the millions of viruses in every drop of ocean water interact with the hundreds and thousands of bacteria found in the same volume of ocean. A key goal for the University of Tennessee group was to accomplish this from RNA sequencing data that is presently being broadly collected by researchers around the world.\n\n\nStarting with data generated in the spring of 2018 from the Southern Ocean near Tasmania, the team was able to develop strong linkages between the virus communities in the system and their potential hosts. This was particularly true to a group known as the \"giant viruses\": these members of the Nucleocytoviricota infect protists that are abundant members of the Southern Ocean community. The observations demonstrated that changes in the availability of the trace element Fe influenced the activity of these viruses. Increases in Fe availability made some more activty while decreases in the availability of Fe made other viruses more active. The results shine a light on how nutrients can indirectly regulate microbial community form and function.\n\n\nThe team also completed field expeditions to the Atlantic Ocean in 2019 and 2022. In 2019 a 5 day diel study (i.e., around the clock) sampled several ocean depths every 4 hours. Team member extracted RNA for sequencing as well as small molecules to characterize microbial community changes with the solar day. One major observation was the rediscovery of a region of high oxygen just below the thermocline we have refered to as the subsurface oxygen maximum (SOM). This region receives reduced surface sunlight (~ 1%) while at the same time getting nutrients which are upwelled from below. Our observations suggested that this region is expansive across the Atlantic and that biological activity in it is driven by a subset of the cyanobacteria in the genus Prochlorococcus along with various heterotrophic bacteria. Surprisingly, it appaears that the more rapid activity in this region is driven by increase virus infection of the Prochlorococcus: increased infection leads to faster carbon cycling (as more cyanobacteria lyse) which leads to more heterotrophic bacterial activity. The bacteria respire off the carbon and then recycling ammonium, which in turn enhances the growth rate of the Prochlorococcus. One conclusion from this data is that the SOM is likely strong affected by regional climate, and it could become under threat with predictions of climate change that will alter ocean circulation and stratification.\n\n\nA final significant observation in this region was that the assimilation of phosphorous (P) is like partitioned by different members of the microbial community to different times of day. This observation arose from the diel assessment of microbial community function as observed in the RNA sequencing data. In short, different members of the community seemed tuned to best competing for this limiting resource at different times of day. This suggests very tight regulation of nutrient dynamics across the entire community. Moving forward the data also suggest that changes in circulation and mixing might alter how cells perceived time of day (e.g., by changing the depth cells mix too in the water column they will get different light cues) and thus the physical changes in the water column brought on by a changing climate might have serious complications for the future.\n\n\nAlong with the above scientific output, this project trained graduate and undergraduate students in lab and field techniques invcluding the state-of-the-art bioinformatics needed to analyse the billions of RNA sequences generated by this study. Papers have been published and will continue to be published from this work, and our observations have been presented at scientific meetings around the globe.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/29/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: StevenWWilhelm\n"
