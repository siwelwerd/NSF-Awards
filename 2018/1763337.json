 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemical reactions that involve the transfer of an electron from a metal to a molecule adsorbed to its surface are some of the most important in chemistry, as they form the basis for applications ranging from catalysis to sensing. The study of these electrochemical reactions is challenging, however. Catalytic reactions for example can involve the transfer of multiple electrons, and reaction efficiency can be highly dependent on the local arrangement of metal atoms near the molecular adsorbate. Traditional electrochemistry techniques sample the entire metal electrode, which can contain a vast number of nanoscale metallic features, making it difficult to draw clear connections between the local metal structure and the chemical activity.  In this project funded by the Chemical Structure Dynamics and Mechanism (CSDM-A) program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Michael Mirkin of the City University of New York, Queens College is advancing nanoelectrochemical methods and using them to study catalytic reactions taking place on the surfaces of metallic nanoparticles and nanorods.  Unlike traditional electrochemistry techniques, the scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) method used by Professor Mirkin and his students can monitor a region of the surface that is only 10 nm across, or about the equivalent of 30 gold atoms.  This high spatial resolution enables the team to characterize not just individual particles, but different sections of the same particle.  Their results could have broad implications for fields ranging from the development of ultrasensitive detectors, to catalysis for energy conversion and storage.  The project is also providing training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, who are getting multidisciplinary research experience in interfacial electrochemistry, bioanalytical chemistry and nanoscience.\r\n\r\nNanoelectrochemical techniques, such as steady-state voltammetry, SECM, and nanoparticle collisions, are combined with high-resolution tunneling electron microscopy and finite-element simulations to study the fundamental processes that impact the detection of electrochemical events on nanometer length scales. The project is investigating electrochemical processes in microscopic carbon cavities, long-distance transfer of electrons between metal nanoparticles and electrodes, and spatial variations in surface reactivity around catalytically active metallic nanorods.  The interactions between single nanoparticles and nanoelectrodes are investigated by two approaches. In the first, the SECM nanotip is brought to within the tunneling distance of a single nanoparticle, and the tunneling current is detected, while the second approach monitors electron tunneling as nanoparticles collide with the electrode.  The main objective is to develop the experimental and theoretical framework for mechanistic studies and visualization of complex nanoelectrochemical systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe most important outcomes of this project are the development of the tunneling mode of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) and the introduction of a new technique for single-entity detection and analysis - electrochemical resistive-pulse sensing.\n\nThe tunneling mode of SECM was developed for studies of charge-transfer reactions at single metallic nanoparticles; later, we demonstrated the possibility of electrochemical tunneling experiments at flat samples. In this way, electrocatalytic activity, conductivity, and charging properties of and faradaic processes in layered nanomaterials were characterized by single nanoflake voltammetry without making direct ohmic contact with them. A broad applicability of tunneling SECM experiments was demonstrated by probing nanomaterials with different size, geometry, and electrochemical reactivity.\n\nThe combination of resistive-pulse sensing with electrochemical analysis of single vesicle contents has been demonstrated for the first time.  In electrochemical resistive-pulse technique, the measured current is produced by oxidation/reduction of redox molecules at the inner surface of a carbon nanopipette (CNP) in addition to the current blockage during the particle translocation.  Besides counting single entities, this technique enables qualitative and quantitative analysis of the electroactive material they contain.  In this way, biologically important analytes, such as dopamine and nitrite, were measured in single liposomes.  Quartz and carbon nanopipettes were inserted into biological cells and used to monitor processes involving vesicles and nanoparticles in real time.  A platinized CNP was used to detect single vesicles within a living macrophage cell and selectively measure four reactive oxygen and nitrogen species inside such vesicles.  This approach is potentially useful for sampling and analyzing physiologically important species in subcellular compartments such as lysosomes and synaptic vesicles.\n\nThe possibility of TEM-assisted fabrication of sub-10 nm sized SECM tips was demonstrated.  The fabrication of such small tips has up to now been unpredictable, uncontrollable, and irreproducible.
