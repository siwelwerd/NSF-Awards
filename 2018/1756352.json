 "awd_abstract_narration": "CSBR: Natural History Collections: Safeguarding the world's largest dendrochronological collection\r\nThe Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research (LTRR) at the University of Arizona holds the world's largest and most diverse collection of wood specimens used for dendrochronological (tree-ring dating) research.  The estimated two million tree-ring specimens collected over the past century are used to understand past climate and ecosystem dynamics, refine predictions regarding future environments, inform policy for hazard mitigation and resource management, and to study and date a broad range of human and environmental interactions.  Many of these unique, irreplaceable specimens are currently at-risk, stored beneath the university football stadium bleachers.  They require cataloging, labelling, and re-boxing prior to transfer into a new state-of-the-art repository.  Techniques and tools will be developed to assist in this cataloging and to maximize accessibility to the international scientific community and the public.  Best practices developed through this process will be made available to other tree-ring laboratories around the world.  In addition, the project will enhance the existing LTRR public outreach program by developing new resources such as STEM and sensory resource kits in collaboration with local schools.  \r\n\r\nThis project will safeguard the approximately 60,000 specimens that constitute the \"modern studies\" portion of the tree-ring collection, making them physically available, secure and electronically accessible via web resources.  The specimens will be cataloged using the open source Tellervo software, which conforms to the Tree Ring Data Standard (TRiDaS) developed by the international research community.  Tellervo will be further developed to include new curation interfaces to improve the efficiency of the cataloging workflow.  To enable data to be provided to established biodiversity portals like iDigBio (iDigBio.org) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF.org), fields will be mapped from TRiDaS to the DarwinCore standard and delivered using GBIF's Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT).  A dedicated web portal will also be developed for Tellervo enabling users to query the rich information associated with dendrochronological data beyond the core specimen collection information.  Such information combined with full accessibility will enhance next generation studies in tree-ring science.  The new curation, DarwinCore data export, and web portal tools developed during this project will be made available to numerous laboratories already using Tellervo, facilitating international adoption of a standardized procedure for collection, data and specimen storage for tree-ring research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Many of these samples, collected over the past century, are irreplaceable because they were collected from forests, archaeological sites and natural preservation environments that are now either substantially diminished or no longer exist. Despite the importance of the collection, specimens had previously been stored in substandard facilities under the University of Arizona football stadium.<br /><br />This project has focused on safeguarding at-risk specimens from the LTRR's \"Modern Studies\" collection by cataloging, relabeling, rehousing and moving them to a newly built state-of-the-art repository. These efforts included the development of new curation and archiving interfaces to upgrade the specialist dendrochronology curation software developed at the lab (and now available more widely at other labs that have adopted the software). Access to the entire LTRR collection has been substantially improved through the development of a web portal allowing people to browse and query the newly archived collection through an easy to use web interface. Users can now view, download and export collections information in a variety of ways. The collections information has also been made more widely available through the iDigBio and GBIF initiatives. The portal also provides transparency with regards other collections that are still awaiting cataloging by providing access to provisional box-level surveys. These parts of the archive can now be accurately described in future collections and archiving proposals.&nbsp;<br /><br />The project has expanded the LTRR's efforts to disseminate research findings and convey core scientific concepts to diverse groups of students and life long learners. Exhibits have been newly developed and improved in the LTRR exhibit hall.<br /><br />A new laser projector mounted above a pre-existing centerpiece giant sequoia section, replaces a paper timeline produced in the 1950s with a variety of digitally projected timelines. This means that interactions are no longer constrained to a single e.g., Eurocentric view of history or important events. Rather we now can rotate through multiple timelines (e.g., major volcanic events) and blend and update timelines as understanding of different (pre)historical events develops. Potential future developments would allow visitors to enter their own important events.<br /><br />The system, which easily allows additional thematic timelines to be added, provides a more diverse experience that engages visitors by contextualizing events across the trees 1703 year lifespan.Through collaboration with the University of Arizona CATalyst maker space, project personnel have explored ways of producing tactile, 3D exhibits for students and visitors, with a special focus on addressing the needs of visual impaired users. 3D-printed models of wood specimens, as well as 4ft tall laser cut exhibits have been produced that are popular with both sighted and visual impaired visitors. Additional enhancements to our exhibit space include braille signage and audio guides. The audio guides have been produced in English, Spanish and Din? (through collaborations with native speakers in the lab), with plans to expand to other languages in the future.<br /><br />Education and outreach has also been facilitated by an extremely successful collaboration with the Center for Creative Photography (CCP) at the University of Arizona. A six month exhibition entitled \"Trees stir in their leaves\" explored the intersection between art and science, combining specimens and images from the LTRR collection with images held within the CCP's collections.<br /><br />Despite the extreme challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic that have delayed the project, overall it has been highly successful. At-risk specimens have been safeguarded and over 62,000 records have been delivered to international data repositories. But perhaps more importantly, the development of a digital and physical infrastructure has provided the capability to safeguard many more specimens as the LTRR continues efforts to make the entire collection accessible for future research, teaching and outreach. The curation software and best practices are also transferable and can be adopted to facilitate the accessibility of other collections.<br /><br />This physical process of re-housing (and the flexibility and ingenuity with which this was managed during the pandemic) not only provided training and career development, but also supported staff and students through a particularly difficult period. Income was maintained through flexible and constantly evolving working arrangements, and community was built through regular online and socially distanced in-person contact.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/28/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Peter&nbsp;W&nbsp;Brewer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1756352/1756352_10552522_1668437138884_PXL_20220618_032200942.PORTRAIT--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1756352/1756352_10552522_1668437138884_PXL_20220618_032200942.PORTRAIT--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"A child explores a laser cut tree-ring image\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1756352/1756352_10552522_1668437138884_PXL_20220618_032200942.PORTRAIT--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"A child explores a laser cut tree-ring image\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Wood anatomy images have been laser cut into large tactile exhibits.
