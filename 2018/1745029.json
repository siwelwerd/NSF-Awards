 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Antarctic cryosphere is a key component of the global climate system, being linked to global sea level through ice sheet mass balance, and to the global ocean overturning circulation through sea ice driven production of Antarctic Bottom Water. This research seeks enhance understanding of cryosphere-climate models interactions in the Antarctic, thereby allowing for attribution of recently observed changes, and for improved quantification of the physical drivers of model-simulated future climate. The project also seeks to contribute to the education and professional training of a graduate research assistant. Educational outreach will occur by partnering with local high school science teachers and students as part of the Secondary School Field Research Program (SSFRP). This partnership with the SSFRP will develop a 4- week curriculum on climate modeling that will be suitable for use in high school Earth Science or Physics courses.\r\n\r\nThe project has three objectives. First, the cryospheric response to changes in the top-of the-atmosphere (TOA) absorbed solar radiation (ASR) at high southern latitudes will be assessed. The second objective of the project is to quantify the effect of ozone depletion and recovery on the mass balance of the Antarctic ice sheet. This will be accomplished both by analyzing the (Whole Atmosphere Community Climate) WACCM simulated surface mass balance, and by performing a series of sensitivity simulations with a stand-alone ice sheet model (the Ice Sheet System Model, or ISSM) forced by WACCM output. A third objective is to determine the atmospheric response to Antarctic sea-ice changes. This will be achieved by running WACCM with prescribed sea surface temperatures and sea-ice concentrations in order to examine the impacts of different sea-ice anomaly patterns.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe overarching goal of this project has been to enhance understanding of cryosphere-climate interactions in the Antarctic, thereby allowing for attribution of recently observed changes, and for improved quantification of the physical drivers of model-simulated future climate change.  More specifically, our work has served to advance knowledge and understanding in the following areas:\n\nCauses and consequences of recent Antarctic sea-ice expansion: During most of the satellite era (i.e., the period beginning in ~1979), total Antarctic sea-ice extent was observed to increase even as the planet as a whole warmed significantly.  Understanding this counterintuitive result - which is not reproduced by climate models - has been one of the greatest challenges in climate science in recent years.  Our work under this project has served to enhance understanding of the observed Antarctic sea-ice expansion.  Specifically, we have shown that internal climate variability may have contributed significantly to this sea-ice expansion.  While such climate variability is largely unpredictable, we found that model simulations beginning from a relatively warm Southern Ocean state, in some cases, were able to reproduce Antarctic sea-ice trends similar to those observed.  This points to the importance of climate model initial conditions in simulations of Antarctic and Southern Ocean surface climate.  In addition to differences in internal climate variability between models and the real world, we also found a possible role for model biases in explaining the discrepancy between observed and simulated Antarctic sea-ice trends over recent decades.  Our work under this project has also identified factors that have likely NOT contributed significantly to the observed sea-ice expansion, namely, Southern Annular Mode trends and stratospheric ozone depletion.  Finally, we have identified an important consequence of the recent Antarctic sea-ice expansion and associated Southern Ocean cooling: an increase in the poleward heat transport by midlatitude eddies (i.e., cyclones and anticyclones).\n\nImpact of future Antarctic sea-ice loss on lower latitudes: The growth of Antarctic sea ice that has occurred during much of the past few decades is expected to transition to sea-ice melt as the climate continues to warm.  Observations from the most recent few years suggest that this transition may already be underway.  Our work under this project has shown that the climate impacts of future Antarctic sea-ice loss will likely not be limited to the high-latitude Southern Hemisphere.  Using a series of climate model simulations, we showed that Antarctic sea-ice loss, through its effects on ocean circulation, leads to significant warming and precipitation changes in the tropical Pacific.  This serves to highlight the large-scale (i.e., hemispheric-to-global) impacts of Antarctic sea-ice loss.  While such large-scale impacts have been widely shown to occur in response to Arctic sea-ice loss, our work is among the first to show that they occur in response to Antarctic sea-ice loss as well.\n\nImpact of changes in ozone and ozone-depleting substances on Antarctic surface mass balance: Climate warming is expected to lead to an increase in the surface mass balance (SMB; i.e., net snow accumulation) of the Antarctic ice sheet.  This occurs because even in a warmer climate, the air over Antarctica is still cold enough to support snowfall, and warmer air holds more moisture, leading to heavier snowfall.  Our work under this project examined the impacts of different climate change drivers on the Antarctic SMB.  We showed that during the second half of the twentieth century, increases in atmospheric ozone-depleting substances (e.g., CFCs) and the ensuing stratospheric ozone depletion had a significant impact on Antarctic SMB, together accounting for 44% of the model-simulated SMB increase during this time.  In contrast, increases in tropospheric ozone were found to have an insignificant impact on the SMB.  It is worth noting that observations do not yet reveal any long-term increase in the Antarctic SMB, which we have argued in our previous work may be due to internal climate variability \"masking\" the effects of anthropogenic climate change.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/16/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael J Previdi"
