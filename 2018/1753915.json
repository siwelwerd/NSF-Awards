 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the complex interactions between how we perceive the world around us and how we move within that world. The researchers will test how learning a new skill affects the information picked up from the world and how that information, in turn, affects motor learning. Understanding the relationship between perception and movement control is fundamental for many fields. Results could contribute to innovations in motor skill training, including rehabilitation of sensorimotor disorders after stroke and development of prostheses, as well as to ergonomics, brain-machine interfaces, robotics, and tele-operations.  The project will advance the NSF's educational goals by encouraging underrepresented students to consider STEM career paths. Five undergraduates per year will be involved in all aspects of the research, including at least three women and minorities through partnerships with programs at Indiana University. The project will also support the expansion of a neuroscience summer camp developed by the study team for Indiana high school girls.  \r\n\r\nTo execute a voluntary movement, such as reaching out to pick up a pencil, the brain must plan motor parameters such as movement direction and extent. Importantly, the hand's movement will not be correct unless the brain accurately perceives hand position, obtained through an integration of visual information, body position sense (proprioception), touch, etc. This \"multisensory integration\" is flexible and can change with learning, just like motor control, but it is not known whether or how these processes interact. The project will address this question at both the behavioral and neural levels and asks whether multisensory integration and motor control share a common sensorimotor map (a model relating motor commands to sensory consequences). A combination of psychophysics and reaching tasks will indicate whether multisensory integration and motor learning affect each other at the behavioral level. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), the researchers will examine whether connections between sensory and motor areas of the brain change in strength when subjects learn a new spatial relationship between vision and proprioception; this would suggest a shared sensorimotor map at the neural level. Results will inform a theoretical framework of sensorimotor control that accounts for both multisensory integration and motor learning.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

By adulthood we have learned countless such motor skills: tying our shoes, controlling a computer mouse, etc. We may also learn more specialized skills. Consider what it would take to learn to operate a neuroprosthesis, surgical robot or telerobotic interface. In addition to learning the procedural steps, such a task involves learning a new mapping between your hand movements and where the robotic effector actually goes, as well as improving both the speed and accuracy of your movements. Your training may also utilize virtual reality (VR), which adds the complication that any visual rendering of your hands will have positional errors and temporal delays. Such tasks are common in industrial, medical, and military settings.</p>\n<p>One challenge in knowing how best to train people to perform such skills is that in addition to the cognitive components, a variety of sensory and motor processes are involved. Historically, sensory perception and motor control have been studied separately, limiting our understanding of how they interact and work together in human behavior. This project used behavioral and neurophysiological methods to examine how changes in sensory perception of the hand affect the motor system, and vice versa.&nbsp;<em>Results point to a greater degree of interaction between sensory and motor systems than was previously known.</em>&nbsp;For example, we found that primary motor cortex activity changes after sensory perception of the hand is experimentally manipulated, and we identified sensory-motor pathways in the brain that could be responsible. This suggests that the neural systems underlying sensory perception send information to the motor system, even in the absence of movement.</p>\n<p>A particularly important result of this project demonstrates for the first time that a change in perceived hand position, in the absence of movement, has a measurable effect on later reaches made with that hand (Figure 1). In other words, the change in perception alters the same internal representation the brain uses for movement planning.&nbsp;This not only has important theoretical implications for how the brain represents the body; it also has implications for technological applications of sensorimotor neuroscience such as brain-machine interfaces, prosthetic devices, and virtual reality. For example, when training someone to use a prosthetic limb or to perform a task in virtual reality, sensory and perceptual training may be as important as movement practice for achieving the best result.</p>\n<p>In addition to the intellectual outcomes, the project provided educational opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students as well as high school students. 12 undergraduate students participated in a research experience for undergraduates (REU) for one, two, three, or four years.

We operated Girls with Nerve as an in-person day camp for local girls in 2018-19 (Figures 2-3), and a virtual camp in 2021 (Figure 4) due to the pandemic. In total, we provided this free 5-day experience for 94 campers. Across all camps, about 25% of campers identified as an underrepresented minority. 30% would be considered first generation college students (neither parent completed a bachelor&rsquo;s degree), and 25% would be considered economically disadvantaged.
