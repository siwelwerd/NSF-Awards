 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will investigate the formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) containing carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms on interstellar ice analog samples that are held at ultra-high vacuum, low temperatures, and exposure to ionizing radiation --- laboratory conditions that simulate the environment of interstellar space.  Results from the study will allow astronomers to understand how COMs are formed in interstellar clouds and the level of chemical complexity that can be built under the extreme conditions of interstellar space.  This project will train graduate and undergraduate students, including ones from groups that are underrepresented in science, in advanced techniques of laboratory astrophysics research.  The research team will also participate in training workshops for local high school teachers to help incorporate research activities into high school teaching.\r\n\r\nThe research team will explore the synthesis of six key classes of COMs --- aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, amides, and isocyanates --- on interstellar ice analogs.  They will do so by exposing interstellar ice analog samples to Lyman alpha radiation in an ultra-high vacuum space simulation chamber.   The radiation energies and low temperatures in the chamber will approach those found in interstellar clouds, and the molecules produced in the experiment will be characterized in a highly complementary manner using mass spectrometry as well as infrared, Raman, and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy.  The project will support graduate and undergraduate students, and it will help expose high school classrooms to advanced research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

With interstellar matter inaccessibly to bring to Earth, the interstellar medium has to be brought to the laboratory via simulation experiments mimicking the harsh conditions in space. Progress in the field how complex organics form abiotically in space requires the development and incorporation of new technology in a space simulation chamber. Here, we exploit resonance enhanced multi photon and single photon photoionization coupled to a reflectron time of flight mass spectrometer (REMPI/PI-ReTOF-MS) to unravel the isomer-selective formation of complex&nbsp; organics within these ices upon exposure of interstellar analog ices to proxies of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs). Based on the ionization energies, mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio of the ionizes molecules, and isotopic substitution experiments, versatile reaction pathways to complex organics (of astrobiological relevance) could be extracted. Key classes of molecules include: i) C3 and C4 hydrocarbons along with (substituted) mono- to threering aromatics with benzene, naphthalene, and phenanthrene cores, ii) the first isomer quintet [acetic acid (CH3COOH), glycolaldehyde (HCOCH2OH), formic acid methylester (HCOOCH3),1,2-dihydroxyethylene (HOHCCHOH), 1,1-dihydroxyethylene (H2CC(OH)2)], iii) enols versus their keto-tautomers [acetic acid (CH3COOH) versus 1,1-dihydroxyethylene (H2CC(OH)2), acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) versus vinylalcohol (C2H3OH), ketene (H2CCO) versus ethynol (HCCOH)]. These investigations further exposed molecular mass growth processes to truly complex, biorelevant organics carrying at least two functional groups: glyoxylic acid (HCOCOOH), a prebiotic starting material and inter-mediate of the present-day glyoxylate cycle that enables organisms to convert fatty acids into carbohydrates, and pyruvic acid (CH3COCOOH)&nbsp; - a key molecular building block in prebiotic chemistry to form amino acids. Finally, PI-ReTOF-MS identified for the first time two previously elusive molecules derived from methane: methanediol (CH2(OH)2) as the simplest geminal diol and aminomethanol (NH2CH2OH) representing the simplest hemiaminal intermediate and key intermediate in the Strecker Synthesis of amino acids.
