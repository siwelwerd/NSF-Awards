 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"Endless Forms\" Thematic Collections Network (TCN), composed of 17 collaborating U.S. herbaria from 11 states, will digitize approximately two million specimens belonging to some of the most interesting plant species on Earth. Iconic species such as the Giant Saguaro Cactus, the Venus Fly Trap, and the leafless Ghost Orchid of southern Florida are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of plants that have evolved astounding adaptations allowing them to grow in extreme terrestrial environments, including deserts, tropical rain forests, and nutrient poor bogs. Many of these plants can also be challenging to study in nature and face elevated conservation concerns in the face of rapid environmental change. By digitizing herbarium specimens of these groups, researchers will gain a better understanding of these adaptations and their evolution, and can design conservation and management strategies. The public's interest in these unusual plants affords an opportunity to engage k-12 students and teachers in discussions about biodiversity and preservation, plant adaptations, and mutualistic relationships. This project will also train undergraduate and graduate students in the areas of museum studies. Finally, the availability of two million digitized records for these charismatic plant groups will help protect them and enhance their enjoyment by hobbyists, citizen scientists, and other non-academic enthusiasts\r\n \r\nThis \"Endless Forms\" project is the first TCN initiative to digitize the very significant holdings of non-North American specimens housed within North American herbaria. This project will provide access to digitized records of 15 plant families associated with adaptations to extreme terrestrial environments that can be used to test evolutionary and ecological hypotheses. This network will, for example, provide data that can be used to explore trait development and evolution, species delimitation, and geographic distribution modelling and that can inform national and regional floristic projects. This project will help provide critically needed information to overcome obstacles related to studying plant families which are very large, have cryptic diagnostic features, or occur in geographically challenging areas. This TCN will also help overcome an acute problem of access to specimens of CITES-listed taxa (species threatened with extinction) by easing data access and by holding a Plant Collecting Ethics Workshop that will bring together an array of stakeholders to make recommendations on best practices for handling sensitive data for rare species. The project will fill taxonomic and geographic gaps in U.S. institutional specimen digitization, will bring new institutions into the national digitization effort and will invest in the development of tools to stream-line the digitization process. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Botany Department at the California Academy of Sciences (CAS) has completed work for the project: TCN Collaborative Research:  \"Digitizing \"endless forms\"; Facilitating Research in Imperiled Plants with Extreme Morphologies.\n\nThis project involved 15 institutions including herbaria located in both non-profit museums and botanical gardens as well as University-based collections.  The goal was to image a total of 1.425 million specimens; complete data entry for 1.161 million specimens and provide georeferenced coordinates for approximately 920,000 specimens of plants that live in unusual habitats or have unusual growth forms and are often threatened or endangered.\n\nIn addition to the mobilization of vast of amounts of data, this project had a number of broader impacts.\n\nFirst, the production of high resolution images and the transcription of data from those images serves to make information about endangered plants readily accessible to researchers from around the world.  This project also served to make the data from specimens available to the general public, who do not often have the ability to travel to or work in herbaria.\n\nSecondly, making these images and data available has almost immediately reduced the need to send as many specimens on loan to institutions around the world.  It has become increasingly difficult, expensive and risky to ship biological materials internationally and sometimes even domestically.  Having the data and images available has cut down on the size of the loans that we send, as much of the data can be accessed without having the physical specimen available for the researcher.  This also has the advantage of cutting down on the amount of staff time that is needed to pull, prepare, pack and ship loans, as well as the cost involved.  Saving staff time, shipping expense, and reducing the risk to valuable and often irreplaceable specimens is a major advantage both to non-profit museums and to university-based collections.\n\nThirdly, images and data from herbarium specimens are now available and being used in classrooms for teaching and other educational experiences.  These specimens make valuable teaching tools that would otherwise not be available for study of topics including, but not limited to, biodiversity, biogeography, plant distributions, plant identification and evolution.\n\nFourthly, because our data are readily available, both through our data portal and through other data aggregators, such as iDigBio, GBIF and others, it has allowed government agencies such as the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture  (Park Service, Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service) easy access to specimen records from the lands that they manage.  In addition, other government agencies, who may not normally deal with plant data, and industry interests, may now access the information from millions of specimens stored in herbaria all over the United States.\n\nA fifth outcome of this project is that it has provided training opportunities for students, interns and volunteers in data management, imaging and data mobilization.\n\nDespite the difficulties encountered due to the closing of many of the participating institutions due to COVID-19, we were able to complete most of the work for this project, precisely because so many specimens had been imaged.  This allowed CAS to retain its curatorial staff as they could continue to work on transcribing and georeferencing data from home while the museum was closed to staff and the general public.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/14/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Debra K Trock"
