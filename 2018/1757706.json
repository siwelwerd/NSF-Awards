 "awd_abstract_narration": "The REU site award to Furman University in Greenville, SC supports the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2019-2021. In the program, funded by the Division of Chemistry in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, Professor Karen L. Buchmueller and colleagues host an REU site that involves three visiting teams, each consisting of a faculty mentor and two to three students who come to Furman University each summer to conduct research. The program also includes two Furman University teams, each consisting of a faculty mentor and one student. The summer program begins with a research boot camp, providing mini-courses in laboratory safety, scientific ethics, career advising and hands-on experience with departmental instrumentation. The summer research program culminates in an oral symposium and an outreach program at a local summer camp for disadvantaged children. The entire summer is designed to facilitate the development of future scientists, through direct engagement with real scientific problems in the lab and the development of meaningful relationships with faculty and students participating in the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program. \r\n\r\nFurman University provides a unique summer REU program that incorporates visiting teams of students and faculty from small colleges, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and technical colleges. The REU site provides research and educational opportunities that act as stepping stones in the development of the undergraduate student as a scientist. The program recruits students in the first two years of their college careers and students from under-represented groups. Visiting students are supported by REU ambassadors (former REU students) and a faculty member from their home institution. The REU site also serves as an incubator, a place where visiting faculty build research programs that have the potential to amplify the REU program beyond the bounds of Furman University. The goal is to cultivate future scientists, both directly within the program and through the development of sustainable research programs at our partner institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\n\nThe REU site (CHE- 1757706) at Furman University hosted 30 students over four summers (none in 2020). This site hosted visiting faculty-student teams from primarily undergraduate and two-year colleges that have limited to no infrastructure for undergraduate research. Through this model, Furman chemistry has served as a research incubator, promoting undergraduate research in the region. Faculty from three institutions, Campbell University, Wofford College and Spartanburg Methodist College, each brought 1-3 REU students to the site over multiple summers. Furman University REU students served as ambassadors, helping the visiting students navigate the institution and department, while conducting research with Furman faculty. This REU site purposefully invited promising visiting REU students back for a second summer. As a result, five visiting students participated over two summers. These students helped their faculty build and maintain momentum, which is a key component towards developing a successful undergraduate research program. More importantly, these returning students were able to build self-confidence, gain leadership skills and strengthen their feeling of ownership in their research projects. \n\n\n\n\nOver the course of our project, REU participants made 43 conference presentations, with four winning awards for their presentations. An additional four papers have been published, with more anticipated. One visiting faculty mentor was promoted to Associate Professor and won their university research award during the course of the award. Another visiting professor gained leadership skills and is now chair of their department. The third faculty member translated their first summer mentoring undergraduate students into a tenure track position. Twelve REU participants are still in college, with seven set to graduate in spring 2024. Of these seven, five will matriculate to graduate programs in chemistry or related fields, and one is applying for chemical industry positions. Of those who have graduated, two from the two-year college matriculated to four-year institutions. An additional eight graduates entered graduate programs in chemistry or related fields (e.g. chemical biology, chemical engineering). One has completed her M.S. degree and, along with two other alumni, is working in chemical (or related) industry. Two students are in medical school, and one is in pharmacy school at UNC-CH. Another is completing a post-baccalaureate position at a National Lab before going to graduate school in biochemistry in fall 2024. \n\n\n\n\nThe Furman REU site leveraged the recently developed Furman Pathways programming. Pathways is an integrated, multi-office/center program that is centered on helping students build the skills and the connections they need to succeed after college. The REU program liaised with the Malone Center for Career Development, the Shucker Center for Leadership Development, and the Internship Office to provide summer workshops on building CVs, LinkedIn profiles, using CliftonStrengths, teambuilding, networking and giving elevator pitches. Each of these activities was tailored to chemistry students and included time for the students to workshop. These activities allowed students to translate their summer research experiences in ways that will help their future professional endeavors. \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/23/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MaryEDaub\n"
