 "awd_abstract_narration": "The characteristics of supercell thunderstorms that form tornadoes are well-known.  However, a large fraction of the supercells that exhibit those characteristics do not develop tornadoes.  This research award will use high-resolution numerical modeling to investigate why tornadogenesis so frequently fails in environments that are otherwise favorable.  The work has the potential to improve forecasting, nowcasting and warnings for tornadoes.  The award will also contribute to training and mentoring of early-career research scientists, ensuring a diverse and highly capable workforce.\r\n\r\nThe research team will conduct a numerical modeling study to analyze the within-storm attributes and associated environmental traits that distinguish simulated tornadic from non-tornadic supercells.  The researchers suggest that more study needs to happen at the point at which tornadogenesis succeeds or fails, rather than focusing on the origin of the rotation.  The Cloud Model 1 (CM1) model will be used in idealized simulation ensembles, multi-storm simulations, and toy model simulations to:  1) Explain why supercells with large surface vertical vorticity often fail to produce significant tornadoes, 2) Establish the environmental proxies that are most directly, physically linked to supercells with a high probability of tornadogenesis, and 3) Explain why multiple supercells within the same environment can differ dramatically in terms of tornado production.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nThe purpose of this project was to understand the within-storm and environmental attributes that distinguish tornadic from nontornadic storms. The project pursued three specific objectives: 1) explain why storms with large surface rotation often fail to produce tornadoes; 2) establish the environmental variables that are most closely linked to a high probability of tornado formation; and, 3) explain why multiple storms within the same environment can differ dramatically in terms of tornado production.  We used a combination of observations and computer model simulations to address these objectives.  Our most important findings include the following.\n\n \nWe have shown that most rotating parent thunderstorms (\"supercells\") have sufficient rotation at the surface to produce a tornado.  The reason storms do, or do not, produce a tornado is most directly linked to the intensity and steadiness of upward motion in the lowest 1 km of the atmosphere.  This upward motion can in turn be linked to specific details of the environmental winds in the lowest 500 m above the ground, specifically the magnitude of the vertical wind shear (the change in the wind vectors with height).  These near-ground winds influence both the storm's overall precipitation structure and the storm's ability to produce rotation and intense lifting in the location where tornadoes normally form.  We therefore recommend a concerted effort to improve our routine measurements of the winds in the lowest 500 m above the ground.  We have also shown that, when multiple storms are present near one another, they can modify these environmental variables in ways that alter the probability of tornado formation; forecasters must be aware of this when several storms could possibly become tornadic within a single region.  Finally, we have explained why storms in environments with limited instability (such as are commonly found in the Southeastern U.S. during the cool season and overnight) have uniquely shallow structures that will significantly limit our ability to detect potential tornadoes with radars.  We therefore recommend that new detection strategies be developed for these environments.\n\n \nThis project led to 14 peer-reviewed scientific publications, and at least partially supported the education, training, and professional development of 5 graduate students and one postdoctoral scholar.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/01/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew D Parker"
