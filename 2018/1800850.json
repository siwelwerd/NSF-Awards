 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project meets a growing industry demand for skilled bioscience technicians, specifically at the College's industry partner, Charles River Laboratories. The primary goal of the grant will be to create an evening cohort of students drawn from Charles River Laboratories that work day shift and take evening courses to advance into higher level positions. A secondary benefit of this grant will be the generation and promotion of a pathway for students from a career center (Ashland County West Holmes Career Center) to a two-year institution (North Central State College), or to one of two four-year institutions (Ashland University and the University of Findlay), all of which are within a one-hour driving radius of Charles River Laboratory. Course offerings will be modified to better use distance learning, with the goal of reducing face to face lecture time while maintaining in person lab instruction. The enhancements to the Bioscience Program and pathways are designed to advance the technical education of a diverse group of students ranging from graduating career center students, to future and current students employed as biotechnicians.\r\n\r\nThe North Central State College Bioscience Technician Expansion Project aims to support and increase knowledge in the field of biotechnology in north central Ohio by bringing new opportunities for students to advance through a prescribed pathway culminating in a career in biotechnology. The project will design and enable a pathway from high school career centers through a two-year community college and on to four-year universities. The project leaders will investigate and disseminate experiences using a variety of educational tools, pedagogy, and curriculum changes that aim to support students new to the biotechnology field, as well as incumbent workers. These pathways have the potential to demonstrate and/or establish best practices for supporting student progression through a pathway from career center to 4-year institutions that will function as a self-sustaining system. The program will also incorporate assessment methods for the incumbent student population to assess knowledge gained on the job and give them credit for the skills and training they already possess. Evening courses for incumbent workers in local Biotechnology facilities will be offered. To facilitate these changes, the institution will modify course and curriculum delivery to meet the needs of the students. The modifications of delivery have measurable, predetermined expected outcomes. These outcomes will be measured to assess the educational effectiveness of these course alterations, contributing information about student learning within different presentation styles.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The North Central Ohio service area is seeing an increased demand in Associate Degree level jobs. This grant was designed to provide a distance learning option for students, allowing them to complete the degree while beginning employment in the field.</p>\n<p>The project set out to design distance course materials to facilitate a degree program that is time intensive.&nbsp; The original plan was to have the lecture materials posted and due on a one night per week schedule and have that night coincide with the in-person lab activities, this would allow students to focus on a \"One Course, One Night\" hybrid model. By providing a new delivery system for the courses, the Principal Investigator (PI) and Co-Principal Investigator (Co-PI) were looking to allow students options in degree completion. This model would allow students to piece out the degree courses if needed, continuing through the degree program at either the traditional two-year pace or spaced out based on their individual needs.</p>\n<p>The grant provided a focal point for our college during the COVID-19 pandemic by having a distance learning plan in place. The PI and Co-PI had been gaining experience at delivering distance learning via the project. This provided the college with faculty experts that could be leveraged outside of their particular program of study. This expertise supported the conversion of 61 unique courses and 28 faculty members, benefiting more than 2000 students. With these changes, the college has been able to switch to a mostly Hybrid course structure for the majority of these classes going forward.</p>\n<p>To provide a benefit on a national level, the course outlines are available via the learning management system, Canvas on their course commons pages. These courses include outlines on how to best utilize the course outlines and rational on why these decisions were made. The courses available include Biology I (BIOL 1230), Biology II (BIOL 1231), Introduction to Bioscience Lab Techniques (BIOS 1010), Environmental Science (BIOS 1030), Introduction to Agricultural Science (BIOS 2440) and Histology (BIOS 1210). Due to the disruptive innovation provided by the global pandemic, we were also able to convert and provide shells for the complete Bioscience degree. These additional courses that were not within the original grant outline are Advanced Bioscience Lab Techniques (BIOS 2410), Genetics (BIOS 2530), Pharmacology / Toxicology Bioscience (BIOS 2550) and the Bioscience Practicum course (BIOS 2590).</p>\n<p>A major benefit of the grant was to place the PI and Co-PI in situations that increased the collaborative footprint of the college. Through these efforts the grant team was able to grow associations with Charles River Laboratories, InnovATE BIO, BioOhio (now rebranded as Ohio Life Sciences), local career centers and many local high schools, ultimately adding to workforce and degree program sustainability. Additionally, connections made during the grant tenure allowed North Central State College to be a leader in the Ohio Association of Community Colleges (OACC) initiative for the Intel Semiconductor grant.</p>\n<p>In addition, new collaborations were developed with several water and wastewater associations, such as the Ohio EPA, Operator Training Committee of Ohio (OTCO) and American Water Works Association (AWWA) to design and implement a water technology certificate that is housed within the Bioscience program. The knowledge and skills developed through the grant facilitated the design and approval of the certificate curriculum which utilized the same hybrid modality established by the grant. The certificate is working to address the growing workforce needs of the water and wastewater sectors in biotechnology.</p>\n<p>Additional opportunities for outreach were made possible by the grant funding. With the support of grant dollars, the Science Department was able to promote the Bioscience degree via the Mansfield Family Festival prior to and directly after the COVID-19 pandemic to reach thousands of local children and parents. The grant was also able to support STEAM initiatives in schools, providing funding for STEAM summer camps at a local elementary school, Discovery School in Mansfield, Ohio.</p>\n<p>The project can be measured as a success due to the support for distance learning, acting as a working model for Biotechnology Associate Degree programs and initiative that build the local biotechnology workforce now and in the future.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/20/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Justin&nbsp;D&nbsp;Tickhill</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1800850/1800850_10537695_1671544986995_Mansfield_Children's_Festival_2019--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1800850/1800850_10537695_1671544986995_Mansfield_Children's_Festival_2019--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Mansfield Family Festival 2019\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1800850/1800850_10537695_1671544986995_Mansfield_Children's_Festival_2019--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Mansfield Family Festival 2019\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A young scientist examining results.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">North Central State College</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Justin&nbsp;D&nbsp;Tickhill</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Mansfield Family Festival 2019</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1800850/1800850_10537695_1671545137490_Benchwork_Masked(2)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1800850/1800850_10537695_1671545137490_Benchwork_Masked(2)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Benchwork_Masked (2)\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1800850/1800850_10537695_1671545137490_Benchwork_Masked(2)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Benchwork_Masked (2)\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A students performing experiments in a distanced lab setting.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">North Central State College</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Justin&nbsp;D&nbsp;Tickhill</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Benchwork_Masked (2)</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1800850/1800850_10537695_1671545368623_Lab_work_no_mask(2)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1800850/1800850_10537695_1671545368623_Lab_work_no_mask(2)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Lab work no mask\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1800850/1800850_10537695_1671545368623_Lab_work_no_mask(2)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Lab work no mask\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students performing experiments in a normal lab setting.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">North Central State College</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Justin&nbsp;D&nbsp;Tickhill</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Lab work no mask</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1800850/1800850_10537695_1671545527610_MansfieldFamilyFestivalBooth--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1800850/1800850_10537695_1671545527610_MansfieldFamilyFestivalBooth--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Mansfield Family Festival Booth\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1800850/1800850_10537695_1671545527610_MansfieldFamilyFestivalBooth--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Mansfield Family Festival Booth\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The North Central State College Booth at the Mansfield Family Festival.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">North Central State College</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Justin&nbsp;D&nbsp;Tickhill</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Mansfield Family Festival Booth</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
