 "awd_abstract_narration": "In both bioarchaeological and forensic settings, scientists need to be able to establish the biological profiles of individuals based on their skeletal remains. In this EAGER research project, methods for determining whether a skeleton was female or male based on the chemistry of tooth enamel will be developed and compared to other methods of sex estimation.  The research will expand the available suite of tools for establishing biological profiles, with the aims of validating and improving protocols and expanding the range of time periods and environmental conditions in which skeletal sex estimation can be accomplished. Findings and protocols will be shared with researchers in anthropology, chemistry, and other disciplines, and the project will support undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral student training and mentoring across the three collaborative research sites.  \r\n\r\nThe inability to accurately determine the sex of sub-adult and/or incomplete skeletons is a persistent problem in biological anthropology and forensic anthropology. Both osteological analysis and DNA-based methodology have particular strengths and limitations. This project seeks to develop a robust, reproducible, and sensitive method for bioarchaeological and forensic sex estimation based on the detection of sexually dimorphic amelogenin peptides in human enamel, the hardest and best preserved tissue in the human body. The investigators will optimize peptide extraction from enamel, increase the sensitivity and quantification of sexually dimorphic peptides, establish a uniform protocol that can be applied as broadly as possible to archaeological material, and replicate and build on other work done in the field. The approach developed will be statistically grounded and result in sex estimation with established error and false positive and negative rates.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Amelogenins are proteins involved in the formation of tooth enamel, and they are produced by the AMEL genes located on the X and Y chromosomes. The AMEL gene on each of these chromosomes is slightly different such that DNA analyses of the nucleotide sequences or proteomic analyses of the amino acid sequences from individuals can be used to identify their biological sex. For this project, the sex of 36 individuals was assessed using DNA and proteins extracted from ancient teeth. Of the 36 teeth, all had enamel that could be used for proteomic analysis, while only 34 had roots that were usable for DNA extraction. At the Molecular Anthropology Laboratory at the Arizona State University, DNA analyses were used to estimate sex based on three methods: a rapid quantitative PCR (qPCR) method that tests for sex specific AMEL X and Y sequences and two bioinformatic methods (the Skoglund and Mittnik methods) to analyze genome sequencing data for sex chromosome sequences.

The qPCR method produced results for 14 of 34 samples. After sequencing, Skoglund&rsquo;s method resulted in sex estimations for 29 of the 34 samples, while Mittnik&rsquo;s method produced estimates for 27 samples. We also examined how these methods worked for samples with little DNA. Specifically, when there are limited DNA sequences, these methods can fail or conditionally assign the sex as female, which indicates that more reads are needed to meet the thresholds suggested. We found that the bioinformatic methods are mostly consistent in their estimations for samples with more than 7000 sequencing reads. The qPCR method was not as effective as we thought it would be; though this is perhaps not surprising given the low amount of sequencing data that we could generate from these samples. In samples where sex was not identified using these methods, DNA extract quantifications were very low, the DNA preservation based on total read counts was poor, and/ or reads mapped specifically to the X or Y chromosomes were low or missing. Overall, samples with inconsistent sex estimates based on genetic methods were characterized by less than 100,000 reads that could be mapped to the human genome reference, as found in previous studies. In this study, only two samples met the 100,000 read mapping criteria, but samples that had more than 65,000 sequence reads had consistent estimates for all methods, while the Mittnik and Skoglund methods were consistent with proteomic results in samples with more than 40,000 sequencing reads.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> In this research, the sex of multiple individuals was assessed using proteomic, osteological, and genetic methods in order to evaluate their sensitivity and accuracy.
