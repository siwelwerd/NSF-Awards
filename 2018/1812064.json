 "awd_abstract_narration": "Algebraic topology began as the study of algebraic invariants of geometric objects which are preserved under certain smooth deformations.  Gradually, it was realized that these algebraic invariants (called cohomology theories) could themselves be represented by geometric objects, known as spectra. A central triumph of modern homotopy theory has been the construction of categories of ring spectra (representing objects for multiplicative cohomology theories) which are suitable for performing constructions directly analogous to those of classical algebra.  This move has turned out to be incredibly fruitful, both by providing invariants which shed new light on old questions as well as by raising new questions which have unexpected connections to other areas of mathematics and physics. The project funded by this grant carries out this program in the setting of a rich invariant called algebraic K-theory and related theories known as topological Hochschild, cyclic, and periodic homology.  The project studies applications of these theories to a broad range of questions in number theory, algebraic geometry, and geometric topology, as well as algebraic topology itself.\r\n\r\nThis research continues a broad research program aimed at applying recent work of the PIs on algebraic K-theory and trace methods to study a wide variety of basic problems in number theory, noncommutative algebraic geometry, and symplectic topology. It also includes a project to develop the foundations of equivariant derived algebraic geometry, which has applications to organizing computational phenomena observed in the study of topological modular forms.  The PIs' recent work has resulted in a complete description of the homotopy groups of K(S) (in terms of other known spectra) and a canonical identification of the fiber of the cyclotomic trace via a spectral lift of Tate-Poitou duality.  The PIs have a program to apply this work to provide novel evidence for the Kummer-Vandiver conjecture. If successful, this would provide another example of input from algebraic topology addressing questions in number theory. The PIs previously applied their work on the fiber of the cyclotomic trace to resolve conjectures in the p-adic Langlands program about the (co)homology of stable congruence subgroups. The PIs describe a series of projects that would use homotopy theoretic data about the fiber in the study of the p-adic Langlands program.  Other recent work of the PIs established a Kunneth theorem for topological periodic cyclic homology (TP) of dualizable dg categories. This result has already had interesting applications in noncommutative algebraic geometry, as a consequence of regarding TP as a kind of noncommutative Weil cohomology theory. The grant includes a project to establish this viewpoint and to apply TP in noncommutative algebraic geometry. Based on conversations with Abouzaid and Kragh, the PIs have started exploring applications of algebraic K-theory and TP to symplectic topology via the wrapped Fukaya category.  The PIs describe a series of projects that leverage their expertise and prior results to study fundamental questions in this area.  PI Blumberg has previously worked with Mike Hill to develop the foundations of the theory of equivariant commutative ring spectra. PI Mandell is one of the foremost experts on topological Andre-Quillen homology (TAQ). In collaboration with Basterra, Hill, and Lawson, the PIs study equivariant TAQ as part of a broader program to develop the foundations for equivariant derived algebraic geometry.  If successful, this program will provide an organizing principle for phenomenological data coming from work on topological modular forms.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
