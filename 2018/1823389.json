Texas Southern University will host a Conference on Invitation to Mathematics at Texas Southern University on September 8-9, 2018. About forty faculty and students from Prairie View A&M University and Texas Southern University will attend this conference.\r\n\r\nThrough the activities of this conference, undergraduate students will be exposed to mathematics research and techniques and gain a perspective on relations between mathematics and and other fields of science. Areas of mathematics to be discussed are: statistics, operations research, mathematical biology, and algebra. The conference will consist of research talks by mathematicians, a poster session for students, and a panel discussion with researchers and representatives from industry. The conference is to bring together scholars, researchers, educators, students and professionals. A key objective is to provide undergraduate students the opportunity to interact with a group of researchers and to learn about research and career opportunities in various fields of mathematics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
