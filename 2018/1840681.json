Distributed computing is ubiquitous, with many applications in the Internet and in small-scale devices.  DISC gives an opportunity to expose students to the fundamental concepts behind the algorithms that drive distributed computing applications.\r\n\r\nThis award will provide partial support to approximately 10 students to attend this top conference in the area of distributed computing. Efforts will be made to support students from under-represented groups and geographic diversity among students will be taken into account. The award will encourage and facilitate the student participation in this top-tier computer science conference.  It will contribute towards attracting more under-represented groups to computer science research giving students an opportunity to engage in the important technical, professional, and social exchanges that DISC fosters.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
