 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the University of Tampa (UT) for acquisition of a capillary electrophoresis instrument, the SeqStudioTM, for separation and study of nucleic acids (DNA). It will greatly facilitate a variety of behavioral, ecological, population genetic, environmental, and evolution research projects and research-training of undergraduate students. This instrument will replace an earlier generation labor-intensive single capillary instrument, and permit quick adoption by numerous faculty at UT.  UT is primarily an undergraduate institution and currently engaged in a campus-wide initiative which provides funding assistance to faculty to convert courses to include student inquiry. The biology department has long been dedicated to maintaining high levels of involvement by undergraduates in faculty research. Graduating senior exit surveys indicate that 60% to 95% of graduating students have been involved in research outside the classroom. Thus it is not surprising that 40-50% of graduating seniors indicate that they wish to continue in graduate or professional programs in STEM fields. Undergraduates majoring in biology are nearly 75% female; 22% are members of underrepresented ethnic or racial minorities; and 14% are first generation college students. These ratios are reflected in the investigators' research laboratories, and funding assistance exists to further encourage underrepresented students to participate in research. Further, all of the investigators carry out research that emphasizes environmental science and that informs conservation decision-making. Therefore, acquisition of the SeqStudioTM will expose the next the generation of scientists to cutting-edge research and instrumentation and increase STEM as well as environmental competencies and our global competiveness.\r\n\r\nThe SeqStudioTM Genetic Analyzer is a four capillary electrophoresis instrument for separating and visualizing DNA bases and fragments. Each of the six investigators carry out research on wild organisms, the focus of which spans questions that can be answered using DNA techniques from the behavioral level, to the population level, to the phylogeographic, to the species delineation and identification level, and even to the deep phylogenetic level. Studies include conservation, ecological and evolutionary genetic studies on a variety of wild animal species, characterizing the retinal opsin genes and expressed proteins from marine vertebrate, the evolution and diversification of male parental care in fishes, the reproductive behavior of fish, and the ecology and distribution of seahorses and pipefishes in Tampa Bay, the Florida Keys and the Bahamas. The SeqStudioTM has the capability of running DNA sequences, fragment analysis (genotyping), and SNP genotyping, and will permit expanded capabilities for research labs on campus.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

With the installation and eventual networked connectivity of the new ABI SeqStudio genetic analyzer, we anticipated that multiple researchers would gain access to the technology and potentially use it in their research with undergraduates, and potentially, in their classes. The instrument was purchased in the Fall of 2018 and became fully operational in early Summer of 2019. Dr. Belfiore's objectives for the Summer of 2019 were to separate cycle sequencing products from one genetic locus from some remaining samples in an ongoing study. In addition, she worked with an undergraduate student to design new nuclear DNA sequencing markers to further study the same species of fish. Dr. Belfiore worked with one undergraduate student on the marker testing project for several weeks during the Summer of 2019. This student obtained an internal grant to work on the project.&nbsp; Dr. Rose's objectives were to ensure that the microsatellite data she had obtained from outsourcing the fragment analysis matched the fragment (microsatellite) data she could obtain on our instrument. Dr. Rose worked with three undergraduate students on this project. These students gained experience using an existing successful protocol and testing it on the new instrument and continued with Dr. Rose on this project in the 2019-20 academic year.&nbsp; Regarding the impact on the development of human resources, the four undergraduate research students working with Drs. Belfiore and Rose during the 2019-20 academic year, three are women and one is a member of an underrepresented minority.</p>\n<p>The campus shutdown due to Covid19 in mid-March 2020 and the instrument was not operated until spring 2021.&nbsp; Dr. Rose left the university in spring 2020.&nbsp; Dr. Belfiore left the university in spring 2021.&nbsp; In 2021, the instrument was utilized by both students in classroom settings as well as by new tenure-track faculty and their research students for scholarly activities.&nbsp; Approximately 300 students and five faculty, along with their researcher students, have utilized this instrument for their sequencing protocols to date.&nbsp; The instrument has been used to enrich the laboratory exercises of various sections of BIO200-Genetics, BIO355-Conservation Genetics, and BIO307-Microbiology. In the BIO307 lab sections, students used DNA barcoding approaches to identify species from unknown samples. There was an 85% success rate with students preparing their own samples and performing their own sequencing reactions. The instrument was used in a similar fashion in the BIO200 and BIO355 courses.&nbsp; The demographics for the fall 2021 semester Genetics course were: 76% female, 24% male; 97% US citizenship; 61% white; 12% Hispanic/Latino; 5% Asian; 4% two or more races; 3% non-resident alien; 1 % Black or African American; and 13% unknown.&nbsp; The instrument has also been used by new tenure-track faculty for their scholarly activities and independent student research.&nbsp; Three new UT faculty in collaboration have used the instrument to sequence unknown bacterial isolates from a Tampa Bay environmental sampling project.&nbsp; The project was funded internally and supported three students as well as two new tenure-track faculty mentors. The project included funding to run 1000 sequence samples that are being performed on the instrument. A new faculty member has used the instrument to sequence several isolates from a marine cave as well as ID fungus from the herbarium at USF by sequencing herbarium samples of different boletes. This has allowed us to perfect a sequencing protocol for the identification of fungi for our BIO307 course.&nbsp; A UT faculty member will begin SNP analyses using this instrument in the future.&nbsp; Scholarly outcomes include two course specific learning outcomes tied to the use of the instrument in BIO307 (Microbiology): 1) Illustrate how mutations can be tracked in microbes using bioinformatic resources such as Genbank and MEGA; 2) Evaluate newly sequenced DNA sequences to identify a microbial culture.&nbsp; Microbiology enrolls approximately 160 students each academic year, all of which utilize the instrument for their sequences.&nbsp; Sections of this course require poster presentations that include sequence analysis.&nbsp; These posters may be presented at the University of Tampa?s annual Undergraduate Research Consortium.&nbsp; A sample poster is attached to this report.&nbsp; The instrument is utilized in our BIO200 and BIO355 courses which currently has a combined annual enrollment of approximately 220 students.&nbsp; Most of these sections also utilize the instrument for their sequences.&nbsp; Faculty outcomes includes a poster presentation (see attachment) at the Florida Branch of the American Society for Microbiology (FLASM) in St Augustine FL in early 2022.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/01/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jeffry&nbsp;Fasick</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1828101/1828101_10569935_1648836236408_Slide1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1828101/1828101_10569935_1648836236408_Slide1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"What?s in Our Water?
