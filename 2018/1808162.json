This unique property makes SMAs ideal for the fabrication of powerful yet lightweight actuators for a variety of applications. While SMAs have already been adopted in a number of commercial technologies - from image stabilizers in smart phones to tools for minimally invasive endovascular surgery - the relatively low operating temperatures of commercially available SMAs (typically between room temperature and 100 degrees C) make them unsuitable for many applications. New alloys are needed that operate at either much higher or much lower temperatures to prevent inadvertent actuation by ambient temperature fluctuations or to allow operation under adverse conditions. In this project, a framework for the rational design of novel SMAs will be developed. The framework will couple high-throughput computational and experimental techniques using a physical model that quantitatively relates material properties to physical parameters. This framework will be used to screen a range of alloys with the goal of identifying new families of SMAs with tailored shape memory properties in terms of operating temperature and functional stability. The computational strategy will start with a rapid screening for alloy endpoints that exhibit relevant characteristics of shape memory alloys. Physical models will then be trained to rapidly interpolate the thermomechanical properties of complex alloy compositions in the region spanning the endpoints. Materials systems of interest identified in the computational phase will then be investigated using state-of-the art experimental techniques. The methodology developed in this project and the ensuing fundamental understanding of the phase transformation responsible for the shape memory effect will provide a pathway to the targeted design of novel SMAs that may be used in a broad range of applications. The methodology is also easily transferred to the design and understanding of other classes of active materials that may be used in sensors or actuators. The computational methods that will be developed in this project fit very well within a graduate curriculum for computational materials science and will be incorporated in a graduate course on computational materials design. This project will also provide the context for a summer internship program for undergraduate students and for high-school students from local public schools that will provide a learning environment for students to experiment with materials, processing, modeling, and data science. \r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\nShape memory alloys (SMAs) undergo large recoverable shape changes as a result of thermoelastic martensitic transformations. These alloys have actuation energy densities that are an order of magnitude higher than any other solid-state actuator and are therefore of interest for lightweight and robust actuation systems. Nitinol, the most commonly used SMA, has actuation temperatures slightly above ambient temperature. To fully realize the potential of SMAs, new alloys are needed that can operate at either much higher or lower temperatures. In this project, a framework for the rational design of novel SMAs will be developed. The framework will couple high-throughput computational and experimental techniques using a physical model that quantitatively relates material properties to structural parameters. This framework will be used to screen a range of alloys with a goal of identifying new families of SMAs with tailored shape memory properties in terms of transformation temperature, hysteresis and stability. The effort will initially focus on known cubic binary and ternary phases with Fe, Cu, or Ni as the main component, and will expand as necessary. The computational screening strategy will start with a rapid screening for alloy endpoints that exhibit relevant characteristics of thermoelastic martensitic transformations and stability. Promising structures will be investigated in more detail, focusing on the temperature dependence of their properties. Physical models will then be trained to rapidly interpolate thermomechanical properties of complex alloy compositions in the region spanning the endpoints. Materials systems of interest identified in the computational phase will be investigated experimentally using sputter-deposited composition spreads combined with combinatorial nanocalorimetry and resistivity measurement techniques. The methodology developed in this project and the ensuing fundamental understanding will provide a pathway to the targeted design of novel SMAs that serve a broad range of applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

An SMA can be deformed in its martensitic state and then be restored to its original shape by heating the SMA to a temperature above the martensite-austenite transformation temperature. The large recoverable strain and energy density associated with the transformation make SMAs very useful for engineering applications such as actuators and dampers. While NiTi SMA is commercially available, new alloys with different operating temperatures and mechanical properties are needed to fully realize the potential of these materials. In this project, we have 1) developed a machine learning framework for performing molecular dynamics simulations on shape memory alloys; 2) discovered explosive transformation in thin-film CuZr-based SMAs; and 3) carried out computational-experimental studies of ternary CuZrX and NiTiFe SMAs to tailor the transformation properties of these alloys.</p>\n<p>Molecular dynamics is an efficient computational method to model materials with a relatively large number of atoms, with the versatility to manipulate stress, composition, dislocations, grain boundaries, etc. in a material. It is the ideal tool for studying the shape memory behavior. There are, however, not enough molecular dynamics potentials for multi-elemental systems to support the discovery of novel SMAs. These molecular dynamics potentials are essential because they describe the interactions between the atoms in the simulations. We have developed an on-the fly machine learning method that updates the molecular dynamics potential from density functional theory (DFT) simulations and have demonstrated that for NiTi, the machine learning potential is in good agreement with ab initio results (<strong>Figure 1</strong>). It is superior to previous molecular dynamics potentials in capturing the effects of compositional change.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We discovered that the austenitic phase of CuZr-based SMAs can be supercooled in thin-film samples. At a critical temperature below the finish point of a normal martensitic transformation, the entire sample transforms to martensite within a microsecond, releasing all the enthalpy in a temperature spike. As shown in <strong>Figure 2</strong>, the transformation can be switched between explosive and gradual by tuning the anneal time above the austenite finish temperature A<sub>f</sub>. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveals that some martensite can be retained above A<sub>f</sub> for a short period of time (<strong>Figure 2b inset</strong>). This martensite serves as nucleation site for the new martensite, giving rise to a gradual transformation. Once the residual martensite has transformed to austenite, the lack of suitable nucleation sites results in an explosive transformation. This discovery has a direct impact on how CuZr-based SMAs may be used in practical applications.</p>\n<p>Our computational-experimental study of CuZrX (X=Ni, Co, Hf) has revealed how both composition and microstructure change the transformation behavior. Because the energy difference between the martensite and austenite phases is very small, many factors can affect the phase balance. Energy values obtained from DFT simulations show that adding Ni and Co to CuZr can stabilize the martensite (<strong>Figure 3a</strong>). Experimentally, adding Ni increases the transformation temperature, confirming that the martensite phase is stabilized. Co, on the other hand, decreases the transformation temperature (<strong>Figure 3b</strong>), in direct contradiction with the DFT simulations. The reason for this discrepancy is that the energy difference between both phases is very small - including additional energy terms related to the microstructure is sufficient to upset the energy balance. For instance, <strong>Figure 3d</strong> shows that including the energy associated with the high density of twins in the martensite is sufficient to reverse the energy trend as a function of Co content.</p>\n<p>Because of the small energy difference between the austenitic and martensitic phases, the microstructure of an SMA has a significant impact on its transformation behavior. A smaller grain size, for instance, leads to a higher density of twins and hence to a lower transformation temperature. We have performed a systematic study of how the heating rate changes the grain size in initially amorphous NiTiFe samples. Amorphous thin-film samples of various composition of NiTiFe were crystallized at varying heating rates, from isothermal treatment to 30,000 K/s. We found that Fe lowers the activation energy of crystallization and results in smaller grains. We also found that the smallest grain size was obtained at an intermediate heating rate of 5000 K/s. Further increases in heating rate resulted in large grains that span almost the entire thickness of the sample (<strong>Figure 4a</strong>). This unexpected behavior arises because grain growth outpaces nucleation at higher temperatures. The crystallized samples show R-phase to austenite transformations with very small hysteresis and the transformation temperature decreases with Fe addition (<strong>Figure 4b</strong>).</p>\n<p>This study provides an example of how advanced computational modeling of material can be combined with thin-film experimental techniques to tailor the transformation behavior of shape memory materials. We believe that this approach can be used for a broad range of active materials.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/05/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Joost&nbsp;J&nbsp;Vlassak</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1808162/1808162_10550806_1639783717931_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1808162/1808162_10550806_1639783717931_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1808162/1808162_10550806_1639783717931_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Simulation of the martensitic phase transition in NiTi with machine-learned force fields.
