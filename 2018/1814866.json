 "awd_abstract_narration": "High-fidelity, and often privacy-invasive, sensors are now becoming pervasive in our everyday environments. At home, digital assistants can constantly listen for instructions and security cameras can be on the lookout for unusual activity.  Whereas once an individual's physical actions, in their own home, were private, now networked cameras and microphones can give rise to electronic privacy concerns for one's physical behaviors. Casual conversations and encounters, once thought to be private and ephemeral, now may be captured and disseminated or archived digitally. While these sensing devices benefit the users in many different ways, hence their popularity, their users may face serious privacy violations. A major problem with current sensing devices is that it is oftentimes unclear whether an audio or video sensor is, indeed, off upon visual inspection by occupants of a space. For example, sensors that have been hacked may indeed record people without their consent, even when their interfaces (e.g., small indicator lights) claim that they are off. The goal of this project is to explore privacy-enhanced sensor designs that provide people with the knowledge and assurance of when they are being recorded and what data is being captured and disseminated.  Whereas purely software mechanisms may not inspire trust, physical mechanisms (e.g., a camera's physical lens cap) can provide a more tangible privacy guarantee to people. This project explores novel, physical designs of sensors that convey a clear and definite sense  of assurance to people about their physical privacy.\r\n \r\nThis project brings together expertise in computer security and privacy, access control, human computer interaction, and social computing. Through this interdisciplinary team, the project makes socio-technical contributions to both theory and practice by: (1) understanding the privacy concerns, needs,  and behaviors of people in the face of increased sensing in physical environments; (2) exploring the design space for hardware sensing platforms to convey meaningful ('tangible') assurances of privacy to people by their physical appearance and function;  (3) exploring visual indicators of what information is being sent over the network; and (4) exploring alternative sensor designs that trade off sensing fidelity for higher privacy. Together these designs combine hardware and software techniques to tangibly and visually convey a sense of privacy to people impacted by the sensors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

At home, digital assistants such as Amazon's Echo and Echo Look can constantly listen, for example, for instructions or comment on clothing choices after a visual inspection, while security cameras such as the Nest Cam can be on the lookout for unusual activity.

Soon people may not have a reasonable expectation of physical privacy even in their own homes. Casual conversations and encounters, once thought to be private and ephemeral, now may be captured and disseminated or archived digitally.\n\n\n\n\n\nA primary focus of this work was to explore how individuals mental models of privacy in the presence of IoT-enabled voice- and video-based sensors are formed and how the design of voice- and video-based assistant technology can impact this mental model and related actions of individuals. Initial studies carried out under this award found that individuals sought to manage their privacy around these types of devices using the same boundary regulation behaviors often used when seeking interpersonal privacy around other people. However, most devices lack the signifiers and affordances necessary to inform these behaviors, leading to user frustration and distrust. In response, our team developed and studied the effectiveness of several prototype sensors embodying tangible privacy design principles. These prototypes leverage designs that make their capabilities, current configuration, and options for adjustment apparent to the user.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, our work also explored the broader context of sensor-informed user-agent communication. Specifically, we studied how mobile phone sensor information can improve unavailability awareness during mobile messaging sessions through contextual automated responses. We evaluated user perceptions surrounding the usefulness and comfort in sharing various categories of contextual information that can directly be captured using smartphone sensors. Our results showed that the type of context (i.e., user-state or device-state) represented by an auto-response category influenced how it was perceived in terms of usefulness and comfort in sharing.

Central to this work was the desire to drive up the utility of this sensing while also managing user privacy concerns. Our results are promising, and further research is ongoing to push these results in directions.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/27/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: AdamJLee\n"
