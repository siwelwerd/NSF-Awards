 "awd_abstract_narration": "Availability of the nutrient element nitrogen generally limits the production of organic matter in Florida Bay and most other coastal ecosystems. In Florida Bay, approximately 90% of this primary production has been generated by seagrasses with another 10% generated by single celled algae and bacteria in the water column. Research completed prior to Hurricane Irma by the UNC-Chapel Hill team in collaboration with scientists at the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC), has revealed that approximately half of the nitrogen needed by these primary producers is supplied by a huge sponge population that filters and decomposes freshly produced organic matter, then balances the nitrogen budget by efficiently recycling inorganic nitrogen back to the water column. The sponge community is capable of pumping and processing organic matter throughout the entire water volume of Florida Bay in less than a week, thus helping to maintain healthy seagrass communities and water clarity. The passage of Hurricane Irma may have profoundly altered the central Florida Bay ecosystem by causing tremendous losses of sponge and seagrass biomass and resulting changes associated with nitrogen cycling. This project will help to assess short- and long-term impacts of Irma through a quantitative assessment of sponge and seagrass biomass losses at representative locations, characterization of water column algal blooms, and measurement of changes to the nitrogen budget of Florida Bay.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of the proposed new work is to quantify potentially major changes in Florida Bay nitrogen cycling and nitrogen budgets associated with the passage of Hurricane Irma, using a combination of pre- and post-storm data from established study sites. The proposed new work builds directly on the team's recently completed investigations of the role of sponges in the overall nitrogen budget of the Bay plus the catastrophic impacts of algal blooms on nitrogen cycling in its central basins that feature water column residence times of days to weeks. The results of this previous work have important implications for sponge-rich ecosystems throughout the Caribbean and tropical Pacific plus many other coastal regions including Antarctic shelf environments where sponges comprise a major component of the benthos. Pre-Irma results include multi-year nitrogen surveys and time-series data, sponge and seagrass biomass surveys at key sites and algal bloom meta-genomics and bacterial count surveys have been conducted. This research will benefit from new collaborations between scientists at UNC-Chapel Hill and FWC laboratories in Marathon (FWC-M), where post-Irma sponge surveys will be made and in St. Petersburg (FWC-SP), where algal bloom meta-genomic studies will be conducted. Data from the Pre-Irma studies includes extensive dissolved nitrogen (DIN and DON) water column concentration and time-series measurements, determination of the role of sponges in organic C and nitrogen recycling rates and the nitrogen budget, multi-year (2013-16) associated sponge biomass surveys at our study sites by FWC-M scientists (2013-15) and algal bloom meta-genomic plus bacterial count studies during a bloom at one of those sites led by FWC-SP. Two graduate and two undergraduate students will participate in this project.",

Along parts of the Middle Keys, the hurricane force winds caused water to recede over 100 meters northward from the bayside shoreline. Exposure of the seafloor resulted in catastrophic damage to nearshore benthic communities including sponges, whose total biomass decreased by approximately 95 &plusmn; 5% on one shallow middle Keys embayment according to scientists at the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) located in Marathon, Vaca Key. In collaboration with FWC scientists we established five sampling stations (see colored dots in Figure 1) for repetitive time-series measurements out in the west central area (MB) and at four nearshore stations along the Middle Keys. Our post-Irma time-series measurements made from October 2017 through July 2018, focused on determination of the impacts of Irma and other episodic storm events on temporal variability in dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), generally the nutrient element limiting productivity in western Florida Bay, and on potentially related phytoplankton bloom occurrences as indicated by enhanced chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations. We also investigated the relationship between changes in DIN and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations.</p>\n<p>Monthly whole water samples were collected by UNC and FWC scientists from October 2-17 through July 2018. The FWC laboratory provided essential support in the forms of scientific personnel, laboratory space, SCUBA equipment support and boating facilities. Each water sample was filtered<a href=\"#_msocom_1\">[MC1]</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"#_msocom_2\">[MC2]</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"#_msocom_3\">[MC3]</a>&nbsp; for chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) measurements, then analyzed for nitrate/nitrite (NO<sub>x</sub><sup>-</sup>), ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>), and DOC. Drastic, systematic changes in all water quality parameters probably occurred within days of Irma&rsquo;s passage and were still present and observed in water column samples collected for our first measurements in October (Figure 2). The initial changes included spiked DIN concentrations, that we hypothesized to result from release of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-enriched porewaters during muddy sediment resuspension. Those high concentrations rapidly declined during subsequent phytoplankton blooms as estimated from Chl-a concentrations (Figure 2). Additional spikes in DIN and Chl-a concentrations occurred following a second but lower intensity storm in December 2017, during which the water column turned milky in color as a result of sediment resuspension. However, four months post-Irma in January 2018, DIN and Chl-a concentrations dropped to spring and early summer values typically observed in quarterly sampling and measurements from 1989 through 2017, conducted by scientists from Florida International University (FIU) as part of the SERC program.</p>\n<p>We conclude that changes from long-term baseline concentrations caused by strong storms, including Hurricane Irma, have immediate impacts on water quality that dissipate within months while causing rapid changes in phytoplankton communities. As a result of Hurricane Irma, interior locations of Florida Bay, including our MB station, experienced large-scale phytoplankton blooms and low DIN concentrations. Interestingly and in contrast, increased DIN concentrations occurred at nearshore stations without creating quick resultant blooms. Throughout Florida Bay, hurricanes and other significant storms likely cause immediate spikes in water column DIN concentrations though sediment resuspension which, in turn, releases large quantities of dissolved ammonium stored in the porewaters in the upper 5 to 10 cm of underlying muddy sediments. Dramatic sponge biomass losses occurred as Hurricane Irma impacted stations in central Florida Bay as well as in nearshore embayments. The importance of sponge nitrogen recycling to the overlying water column depends upon sponge speciation and which nutrient element is limiting to primary production in a given area of the Bay. The decimation of sponge biomass, a major source of recycled DIN, plus contributions of porewater DIN from storm-perturbed sediments and bloom DIN sequestration require new modeling strategies for understanding dissolved nitrogen seasonal cycles and budgets in Florida Bay.</p>\n<div>\n<hr size=\"1\" />\n</div><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/03/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Christopher&nbsp;S&nbsp;Martens</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1807077/1807077_10525906_1654196465973_Fig1FlBaysites--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1807077/1807077_10525906_1654196465973_Fig1FlBaysites--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Florida Bay study sites\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1807077/1807077_10525906_1654196465973_Fig1FlBaysites--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Florida Bay study sites\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Our research was conducted at five sites if Florida Bay as indicated by the five colored dots.
