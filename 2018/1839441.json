 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental problem in physical sciences and engineering is to identify dependencies and dynamical relations between interacting processes for understanding causal relationships and advancing predictive modeling.  Indeed, historically, such dependences often formed the basis of physical laws. The abundance of large data-sets about complex natural or engineered systems in our modern technological world, has brought a sense of urgency to the need for reliable and versatile machine learning tools to detect relations between processes. The starting point of the project is the realization that often the observational time scale at which data is collected may not be the native time scale at which interactions occur and thus sampling might obfuscate the nature of such relations.  Indeed, linear dynamical relations between continuous-time processes may not be readily detectable from data collected at any finite sampling rate.  This project will develop methodologies that will allow to fully recover sought relations between processes at the natural time-scale from data at a (typically coarser) observational time-scale. Theory and statistical learning tools that will be developed for that purpose will be applied to geophysical processes, such as identifying relationships between climate variables using a suite of observations from ground and multi-satellite sensors at different spatio-temporal scales. \r\n\r\nWhen relations between variables are dynamic (i.e., the interaction relies on memory in the system), sampling hides the nature of dynamical dependencies. Specifically, in linear stochastic processes, dynamical dependencies between vector-valued processes are reflected in the nullity of the power spectral density matrix when this is estimated at the natural time-scale of the process. At the observational sampling rate, the corresponding nullity no longer relates to the structure of the dynamical relations. Yet, with proper analysis the dynamical relations can be recovered by projecting sample-models to the natural time-scale of the processes involved.  In fact, for linear stochastic processes there is a fastest process time-scale that is consistent with the coarser scale observational data, and it is at that fine scale that models can be projected via solving suitable algebraic equations.  At any coarser scale, dynamical dependencies cannot be readily detected. The project will focus on how to learn and recover the natural time-space scale at which dynamical dependencies must be sought. Statistical learning tools will be developed and applied to geophysical data as proof of concept.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

What are the major goals of the project?\n\nThe proposed research raised the issue of how sampling might obscure the underlying spatio-temporal dynamical structure of processes and how this structure can best be extracted from data. It aimed to identify appropriate scales where any loss of information due to sampling is minimal and can be recovered from the data, as well as propose new methodologies for dimensionality reduction while preserving multi-scale dynamical patterns. The research goal was to develop insights and techniques so that dynamical relations can be detected at multiple scales and at scales finer than those at which observations have been collected. The research aimed at exploring such issues in the context of high- dimensional and large areal extent systems that exhibit multi-scale variability in search for dynamic relations with a focus on geophysical and climate processes.\n\n1.2. What was accomplished under these goals?\n\n1.2.1. Major activities:\n\nA problem of fundamental importance in science and engineering is to ascertain relations from data. Statistics, system identification, and recently, machine learning, are disciplines that deal with this problem head on. It is indeed the central question in the search for structure in large data-sets.\n\nThe research under this project dealt with dynamical relations in data. The starting point was the ubiquitous and largely unexplored phenomenon that sampling obscures the nature of dynamical dependencies. We focused on spectral representations of vector-valued time series and sought dynamical relations between entries of the process, and thereby models, that capture such dynamical dependences at possibly different spatio-temporal scales. The aim of the project, besides developing general principles and theory, was to gain insights by paying particular emphasis on geophysical and earth system processes, where dynamical features at a range of space-time scales exist, offering potential for improved prediction.\n\nAlong these lines, we our major contributions as part of this project include:\n\n(1) Rotated Spectral PCA. We developed a new methodology, called rotated spectral Principal Component Analysis (rsPCA), for identifying dynamical modes of variability at a range of scales of interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2) Multi-scale evaluation. We proposed a wavelength-frequency decomposition methodology for evaluating and comparing satellite-derived precipitation products across scales, and we defined metrics for evaluating the spatio-temporal organization of storm systems, the propagation speed and direction of precipitation features and the space-time scales at which a satellite product reproduces the variability of a reference ?ground-truth? product.\n\n(3) Riemannian Data Assimilation. We developed a new data assimilation framework for large-scale nonlinear dynamical systems geared towards improving the predictability of these systems. \n\n(4) Self-similar trees and scaling. We performed an extensive review of the theory of self-similar trees, their hierarchical organization across scales and the emergence of scaling laws, with applications in geophysics, tectonics, climate and biology. We also proposed a class of a one-parameter critical Tokunaga models and showed that they can capture several scaling laws of the system, e.g, tree fractal dimension, power law distribution of link attributes and power scaling relations between distinct attributes.\n\n(5) Optimal Mass Transport - Theory and Applications. This grant spurred research on the foundations of optimal mass transport. This represents a rapidly developing opus in mathematics that has impacted many fields, from geoscience to physics, and many others. Our motivation was to develop tools that allow modeling dynamical flows across scales, so that we model large scale dynamics while respecting particulars valid at micro-scales.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/20/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Tryphon T Georgiou"
