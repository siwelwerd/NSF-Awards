 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions Program (HSI Program) aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI program will also generate new knowledge about how to achieve these aims.  This project fulfills part of those aims by building institutional capacity for improving undergraduate STEM teaching and learning.  This project, a collaboration between California State University-Sacramento and the University of California-Irvine, will support efforts to improve the teaching effectiveness of STEM faculty and to advance knowledge about strategies that lead to increased use of evidence-based and equity-minded teaching strategies.  Using online, hybrid, and face-to-face training formats, the project will provide customized professional learning programs to help STEM faculty improve their teaching.  The training will also help faculty become aware of the roles of diversity, intercultural competence, and critical consciousness in the development and persistence of students, including those who are underrepresented in STEM.  The faculty learning programs will be designed to meet faculty where they are in their professional career and in their understanding of equitable classroom practices.  Over the project's funding period, the investigators estimate that the project will help approximately 125 faculty implement evidence-based and equity-minded teaching strategies.  These faculty have the potential to improve the learning of more than 37,000 science and math undergraduate students, as well as to broaden the participation and success of students underrepresented in STEM.\r\n\r\nDevelopmental and adaptive over time, the faculty development curriculum will include 1) fundamental teaching and learning skills; 2) discipline specific, evidence-based best practices; and 3) scholarship and critical consciousness for equity and institutional change.  It will implement and assess a model to transform STEM cultural practices that focuses on faculty. Using a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches, large amounts of faculty and student data will be disaggregated to examine the impact of a developmental set of faculty professional learning programs. Instructional and curricular products created by faculty in these programs and their effect on student learning in developmental math, gateway, and lower division math and science courses will be analyzed. A quantitative, quasi-experimental study using institutional and program data, and a qualitative longitudinal study using observation and interview data will examine how faculty and students change because of STEM faculty participation in a learning program that is customized to their zone of proximal development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Building Capacity for Faculty Professional Development</p>\n<p>This project greatly increased Sacramento State&rsquo;s capability to offer faculty professional development (PD), particularly to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) faculty, with 236 STEM participants (151 unique faculty) completing Faculty Learning Communities (FLCs) focused on improving basic teaching and learning skills and equitable best practices in the classroom. An FLC model that incorporated commercial PD programs and an Observe and Analyze session in which faculty participated with their colleagues was developed and found to be effective. The hybrid modality of the FLCs, both asynchronous and synchronous online, enhanced our ability to institutionalize and scale STEM faculty PD. Participant teaching portfolios documented the curricular and instructional changes they implemented during the FLC and their reflection on the Observe and Analyze session. At the end of each FLC, the portfolios were disseminated during a Zoom culminating event to over 100 faculty colleagues and university administrators.</p>\n<p>B. Research on Faculty Professional Development</p>\n<p>1. Institutional data was used to compare student outcomes from courses taught by participants in STEM-specific PD, participants in a concurrent general PD program, and instructors who did not participate in PD during the same period (control group). Two research questions were investigated:</p>\n<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can STEM faculty PD impact student course performance?</p>\n<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What characteristics of STEM faculty development contribute to improvement in student course performance?</p>\n<p>A difference-in-difference comparison of student grades in courses taught by STEM faculty showed the average grade and DFW rates in courses taught by STEM PD participants, but not by General PD participants, improved significantly more than those in courses taught by the control group (Figures 1 and 2).

Analysis of over 250 FLC participant portfolios showed that participants implemented changes to make their classrooms more active and more equitable. Equity was a major focus of participants&rsquo; course redesign, with most faculty reporting course changes that increased equitable access to the curriculum, including changes in classroom climate, flexible course policies, multiple methods of instruction and assessment to reach diverse learners, attending to the student perspective and student voice, and increasing transparency through clearer instruction, consistent course structure, and explicit assessment policies.</p>\n<p>3. Analysis of student survey results show a general decline in their perception of course environment and teaching during the pandemic-necessitated move to remote instruction in Spring 2020. Student survey results for Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 returned to nearly pre-pandemic levels. However, a closer examination of the data disaggregated by race/ethnicity and gender uncovered disparities between groups, with Black men and Black women showing the greatest loss and slowest recovery in their perceptions of classroom environments. These results led to a new study, described below. Results were disseminated at national and international teaching and learning conferences.</p>\n<p>4. Our quantitative findings show that some marginalized student groups perceive STEM classrooms more negatively than other student group counterparts. As part of this project, a new, ongoing study explores this trend with focus groups comprising students from specific racial/ethnic groups and genders, which can provide detailed insight into their experiences in the classroom.

Six predominant themes emerged related to students&rsquo; classroom experiences, including (1) gendered and racial microaggressions from peers and professors and (2) experiences of \"onlyness\" due to lack of representation. In reaction to these experiences, students reported multiple psychological consequences including (1) the persistent psychological state of weighing the potential cost and benefits of every individual's behavior to avoid negative outcomes, (2) cognitively distancing and disinvesting from areas in which one&rsquo;s ethnic/racial group is not welcomed, (3) the desire to justify social systems due to the individual&rsquo;s optimism or disbelief, and (4) the persistent state of disproving negative stereotypes about one&rsquo;s group through exceptionally high achievement.</p>\n<p>5. Based on the students&rsquo; responses to surveys and focus groups, a disparity in access to technology from certain student groups came to light. To help alleviate this disparity, 75 laptop computers were purchased to establish a culturally responsive computer loan program for the College Assistance Migrant Program and the Black Honors College.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 05/01/2024<br>\nModified by: Mary&nbsp;F&nbsp;Mccarthy Hintz</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1832335/1832335_10566927_1714522350388_Figure_1--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1832335/1832335_10566927_1714522350388_Figure_1--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1832335/1832335_10566927_1714522350388_Figure_1--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Effect of summer 2020 professional development on student grades in STEM courses.
