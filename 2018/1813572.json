 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. \r\n\r\nEngineering is an important component of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).  However, resources for supporting teachers in implementing these standards are scarce.  This project will address the need for resources by applying an innovative pedagogy called Imaginative Education (IE) to create middle school engineering curricula.  In IE, developmentally appropriate narratives are used to design learning environments that help learners engage with content and organize their knowledge productively.  To fully exploit the potential of this pedagogy, this project will combine IE with transmedia storytelling.  In transmedia storytelling, different elements of a narrative are spread across a variety of formats (such as books, websites, new articles, videos and other media) in a way that creates a coordinated experience for the user.  Once created, the curricula will be implemented in classrooms to research its impact on (1) increasing learners' capacities to engage in both innovative and direct application of engineering concepts, and (2) improving learners'  science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) identity.  \r\n\r\nThis research will be led by Smith College and Springfield Technical Community College in collaboration with Springfield (MA) Public Schools (SPS).  Additional expertise in evaluating the findings will be provided by the Collaborative for Educational Services and an external advisory board of leaders in STEM education and transmedia storytelling.  The project will result in the development of a transmedia learning environment that includes two NGSS-aligned, interdisciplinary engineering units and seven lessons that integrate science and engineering.  The research study will be implemented in four phases in eight SPS middle schools.  Approximately 900 students will participate each year.  In Phase 1, the project team will collaborate with SPS teachers to create engineering units, lessons, and standards-based achievement measures.  In Phase 2, teachers in the treatment group will participate in professional development (PD) workshops covering IE, transmedia learning environments, structure of the curriculum, and connections to NGSS.  In Phase 3 the curricula will be implemented in treatment classrooms and both treatment and control group students will be assessed.  In Phase 4, testing and assessment will continue in SPS schools and will be expanded to rural and suburban classrooms.  Teachers in these classrooms will use online multimedia PD that will ensure scalability and mirrors the structure and content of in-person PD.  Data analysis will provide evidence of whether this imaginative and transmedia educational approach improves students' capacities for using engineering concepts and enhances their STEM identity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\n \nEngineering in K-12 Education\nThe role of engineering in K-12 education has been expanding over the past two decades.  The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) has fueled this expansion by integrating engineering into the national science standards and placing engineering design on the same level of importance as scientific inquiry.  Such an approach helps children engage with science through the engineering design process while also addressing the need to better prepare graduates to pursue engineering in college; educating a technically literate public; and diversifying the engineering field to increase the percentage of women and underrepresented minorities in the workforce.  Unfortunately, there are few resources aligned with NGSS and grounded in the research on teaching and learning available to support K-12 engineering educators. \nTo address this need, this project explored the potential of an innovative approach to instructional design that has emerged from the learning sciences called Imaginative Education (IE).  In IE, developmentally appropriate narratives and other cognitive tools are used to design learning environments that engage children's imaginations and help them structure learning productively. To maximize the impact of IE, students engaged in the curriculum through interactive transmedia stories.  Thus, learners experienced the curriculum through multiple media formats that made them active participants immersed in adventures that included inquiry, hands-on activities, design thinking, experimentation, discourse and knowledge building--all experienced within the context of a story.\nNGSS-Aligned Engineering Curriculum\nThis project produced an NGSS-aligned curriculum for middle-school grades called TEEMS, which was implemented in Springfield, Massachusetts Public Schools--an under-resourced, underperforming urban system&ndash;as well as in other urban, suburban, and rural classrooms.  The TEEMS curriculum comprises two 2-week units that align with NGSS ETS1 (Engineering Design) and ETS2 (Materials, Tools, and Manufacturing) as well as Massachusetts Engineering Learning Standards.  In addition, six lessons integrate NGSS 6th grade science topics. IE cognitive tools like mystery, associations with the heroic, and extreme experiences and limits of reality were central to curriculum design.  \nThe engineering design unit is Molasses Disaster, which introduces the engineering design cycle through the true story of the Boston Molasses Disaster.  As two Latinx students help their grandmother write a book about the incident, students explore historical artifacts about it&mdash;photos, court documents, and more&mdash;and the following investigation.  A design challenge conducted by students is included.\nStudents explore the heroic properties of materials and tools in Survival and Superheroes.  It focuses on how materials are heroic&ndash;saving humans from dangerous outdoor survivalist situations and protecting firefighters and astronauts.  It addresses types and uses of engineering materials and their mechanical properties and ways in which tools are used.  \nSix lessons, each 1-3 days in length, accompany NGSS science topics:  \n\n Return to Earth:  Apollo 13 mission (Earth's Place in the Universe)\n Tragedy in Haiti:  2010 Haiti earthquake (Earth's Systems)\n From the Future:  Evolution of technology (Biological Evolution)\nWhisper\u2019s World:  Design to improve animals' lives (Human Body)\nSummer\u2019s Garden:  Population density and city design (Matter and Its Interactions)\nThe Orphan Tsunami:  Mysterious tsunami impacts local region (Waves and their Applications) \n\n\n\nTEEMS curriculum and supporting resources are freely available on two websites.  The TEEMS student website is the multimedia, interactive platform through which students immerse themselves in the curriculum\u2019s transmedia narrative adventures. The TEEMS teacher website provides PD modules and videos about engineering and Imaginative Education; detailed curriculum guides and resources for teachers, including curriculum adapted for remote learning; and more.\nKey Findings\nThe project investigated the impact of this approach by developing assessment tools to measure learners\u2019 capacities to engage in both far transfer (innovation) and direct application (efficiency).  Statistically significant differences were found for each.  Treatment students scored three-quarters of a standard deviation higher than control students on engineering concept assessments (what engineering is) and a third of a standard deviation higher on engineering fluency assessments (the ability to apply engineering principles to real world problems). No significant differences were found based on student race or ethnicity, but a small difference was found between boys and girls.  \nIn addition to measuring student learning, a series of semi-structured interviews were conducted with TEEMS teachers.  It was found that teachers came to the project with a sense that engineering is an intimidating topic to teach and/or that it is peripheral to what they think of as \"real science.\"  The interviews revealed that the teachers using TEEMS found it to be an accessible and relatable entry point that supported their sense of efficacy; recognized the underlying engineering themes in the narratives to be powerful and connected to real world contexts; and discovered connections between their existing pedagogical content knowledge and engineering.\nDissemination\n\nTEEMS published two journal articles and delivered multiple conference papers and presentations (archived in NSF-PAR).  Additional deliverables include informational videos, webinars, articles, and advisory roles in professional and practitioner communities.  The project\u2019s 2020 NSF STEM Video Showcase entry won both Facilitator's Choice and Presenter's Choice awards.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/26/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Beth Mcginnis-Cavanaugh"
