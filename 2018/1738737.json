 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rutgers University proposes a Planning Grant that leverages and expands an existing Research Practitioner Partnership (RPP) in order to lay the groundwork for a project that will investigate best practices in computer science (CS) teacher professional development (PD). The growing demand from companies for professionals with computing experience, and from young adults wishing to pursue CS and CS-enabled careers is driving major investments in CS education. Yet, many high schools are still struggling to deliver rigorous CS curriculum. This larger project will inform efforts to change that. It will help to build the knowledge base needed to infuse high quality, engaging CS curriculum and instructional practices into K-12 classrooms across diverse and geographically dispersed school districts in Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. \r\n\r\nThe planned activities will include a needs assessment, expand the existing RPP, develop initial research questions, and design and pilot CS PD in the summer of 2018. This ground work is seen as Phase 1 of a four-phase project, positioning the RPP for success in the larger project. Phase 2 will include 2 intensive, 5-day summer institutes--one for teachers that will be differentiated by the participant's prior experience with CS, and the other for administrators aiming to add CS to their school's curriculum.  Phase 3 will involve the RPP, functioning as a Professional Learning Community, in providing continued engagement of participants via an online collaborative learning platform, and Phase 4 will complete a summative evaluation. The inclusion of administrators will position districts and schools to develop sustainable systems and processes that will enable them to offer rigorous CS classes to all of their students at the same time they are building the expertise of their faculty. Process and outcomes evaluation will be carried out by an independent evaluator.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our RPP, the Computer Science Teaching and Learning Collaboratory (CS-TLC) builds upon existing curriculum, professional development (PD), and other available resources to best meet the needs of underrepresented students with regards to computer science (CS) education. Working within an RPP structure that brings together practitioners, researchers, and community members as equal partners in all aspects of planning, implementation, and evaluation, ensures that multiple perspectives are included in this long-term, mutually beneficial structured collaboration.</p>\n<p>The main goal of this 18-month planning project was to further develop an existing RPP and initiate a summer institute and other ongoing support for teachers and administrators within public high schools. This goal was reached through the delivery of capacity-building PD and support and the use of iterative feedback to continuously refine the RPP?s structure and activities. Capacity-building PD and support involved site visits, tailored curricular recommendations, cross-district virtual meetings, and a week-long summer institute, which focused on increasing pedagogical content knowledge in CS and emphasized the critical roles of equity and student engagement. Iterative feedback grounded in process evaluation principles informed decisions about continuous modifications and enhancements to the program.</p>\n<p>Outcomes of interest included equity, capacity, and collaboration.</p>\n<p><em>Equity</em>. The establishment of the CS-TLC has afforded educators and administrators an inter- and intra- district partnership focusing on the imperative aim of developing an inclusive culture around computer science education. This community continues to grow, offering an increasing number of connections and resources for school districts of all demographics to participate in the social justice issue of increasing enrollment, access, engagement, and success of previously neglected populations.</p>\n<p><em>Capacity</em>. Through working with the collaboratory, educators and administrators have engaged in important dialogues with colleagues and obtained access to an abundance of resources to increase their knowledge and understanding of issues central to their work. In doing so, this work enhances the cultural responsiveness of teachers and administrators when working with underrepresented populations. As a broader impact of this heightened awareness, we believe that CS-TLC has both directly and indirectly influenced the culture of inclusivity and equity in computer science education. It has directly influenced schools through site visits and tailored recommendations made to influence and implement specific changes in pedagogy, recruitment, and engagement. Its indirect influence occurs via the provision of professional development and informational resources to administrators and educators, which gives RPP members the ability to bolster their own capacity outside of the work done directly with the collaboratory.</p>\n<p><em>Collaboration</em>. By applying principles of team science in establishing and operating the RPP (e.g., trust, shared vision, continuous communication), we have created a culture of collaboration and feedback that is responsive to and able to benefit from the iterative process of change and improvement. This ensures that our collaboratory will stand the test of time, adapting to changes in demographics, standards, and pedagogical shifts of districts and states. By working within and among different school districts, we have created a space for open and honest communication and provided opportunities to share both successes and failures to a receptive network of peers facing similar challenges.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/23/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Cynthia&nbsp;L&nbsp;Blitz</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1738737/1738737_10535205_1571854098818_SIGSEPoster_Final-1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1738737/1738737_10535205_1571854098818_SIGSEPoster_Final-1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Poster Presentation\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1738737/1738737_10535205_1571854098818_SIGSEPoster_Final-1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Poster Presentation\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Poster presented at SiGCSE conference on CS-TLC</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Cynthia Blitz</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Cynthia&nbsp;L&nbsp;Blitz</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Poster Presentation</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1738737/1738737_10535205_1571854253362_GroupPhotoKnight--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1738737/1738737_10535205_1571854253362_GroupPhotoKnight--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"CS-TLC Summer Institute Team Members\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1738737/1738737_10535205_1571854253362_GroupPhotoKnight--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"CS-TLC Summer Institute Team Members\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">CS-TLC Summer Institute at Rutgers</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">David Amiel</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Cynthia&nbsp;L&nbsp;Blitz</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">CS-TLC Summer Institute Team Members</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1738737/1738737_10535205_1571854526344_CSRespectPoster-1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1738737/1738737_10535205_1571854526344_CSRespectPoster-1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"RESPECT Conference Poster\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1738737/1738737_10535205_1571854526344_CSRespectPoster-1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"RESPECT Conference Poster\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Poster presented at the RESPECT conference on resource management</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Cynthia Blitz</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Cynthia&nbsp;L&nbsp;Blitz</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">RESPECT Conference Poster</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
