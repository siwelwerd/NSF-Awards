 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will fund participation of US based researchers in the conference Building Bridges II, to be held July 2-6, 2018, at the MTA Renyi Institute of Mathematics, Budapest, Hungary. The conference will cover front line research achievements in combinatorics and its connections to other parts of mathematics. The objective of the award is to increase participation by leading junior researchers who otherwise do not have funding.\r\n\r\nAmong the wide variety of topics to be covered at the conference are graph homomorphisms and graph limits, a novel and exciting direction related to the study of large networks such as the internet; and additive combinatorics, an area that saw recent spectacular results and is connected to computer science.  The conference website is https://www.renyi.hu//conferences/ll70/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
