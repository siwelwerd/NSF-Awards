 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drs. Thomas Pluckhahn (University of South Florida) and Victor Thompson (University of Georgia) will undertake research regarding the manner in which common property regimes shift over time in relation to changes in environmental and socio-political contexts. The longstanding notion that common property resources are effectively managed only through state control or private property regimes has been refuted time and again by anthropological and historical case studies demonstrating how social groups ranging from small communities to nation-states have devised effective systems of resource management, some of which endure for long periods of time. However, the manner in which common property institutions develop and change over time is poorly understood. As a result, researchers also lack the ability to reliably predict how existing regimes may change with respect to future perturbations in natural and social environments.\r\nDrs. Pluckhahn and Thompson, along with a team of graduate students and a post-doctoral scholar, will study changes in sea tenure - the collectively-managed use rights to fisheries - among the native societies of the Tampa Bay estuary during the late Holocene, from around AD 250 to 1650. Spanish accounts from the end of this time range describe a fractured socio-political landscape comprised of warring, territorially-based chiefdoms, while archaeological evidence from the earlier range of the time frame suggests a more dispersed population with less social stratification and little inter-group conflict. The research tests the hypothesis that this transformation was the result of changes in sea tenure occurring in conjunction with shifts in the natural and social environments, through a program of archaeological and paleoecological testing. For the reconstruction of ancient systems of sea tenure, the research employs isotopic studies of oyster shells in concert with the analysis of the relative abundance of shellfish species with varying salinity tolerances, to model habitat of collection. To reconstruct the local and regional manifestations of global shifts in climate, the researchers will collect pollen and sediments from wetlands adjacent to archaeological sites. Changes in socio-political organization will be identified through a program of archaeological testing and shallow geophysics at mound and village complexes. Temporal control is provided by a rigorous program of radiocarbon dating. This interdisciplinary dataset will contribute to a better understanding of how common property resource management systems may be remade over time and, in doing so, offer insights potentially useful for predicting changes in contemporary public policies regulating common-property resources as diverse as air, water, gene pools, and the internet.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We studied changes in sea tenure?the collectively-managed use rights to fisheries?among the Native societies of the Tampa Bay estuary from around 250 to 1650 CE, focusing on the marine mollusks important to subsistence. Spanish accounts from late in this period describe a fractured socio-political landscape comprised of warring, territorial polities. Archaeological evidence from the earlier range suggests a more dispersed population, with less social stratification and little inter-group conflict. We hypothesized that this transformation was the result of changes in sea tenure occurring in conjunction with shifts in environment and sociopolitical organization. We expected that in drier and colder climate intervals, people favoring more exclusive access to mollusk resources. Conversely, we suggested that in intervals marked by warmer and wetter climates, people made decisions favoring inclusive access to shellfish habitat.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Field investigations, including both archaeological and palaeoecological sampling, were conducted at eight sites. To augment these samples, we relied on existing collections from these and another seven sites (Figure 1). To model habitat of collection, we conducted incremental oxygen (&delta;<sup>18</sup>O) isotope analysis on 160 shells with an average of 17 to 18 samples per shell, for a total of 2768 isotopes samples. We also analyzed the relative abundance of shellfish species in a sample comprised of a minimum of 130,210 individuals weighing 1,710 kg. As an additional line of evidence regarding paleoclimate and resource management, we measured the height of 9,582 oyster shells and the shell lengths of 5607 crown conch and 1142 lightning whelk. Finally, we conducted radiocarbon dating program to provide temporal control, including a total of 155 radiocarbon dates (doubling the database for the region). We stratified our samples by four 350-year time periods: Period 1 (250-600 CE), Period 2 (600-950 CE), Period 3 (950-1300 CE), and Period 4 (1300-1650 CE), roughly corresponding with the major climatic intervals known as the Roman Warm Period, Vandal Minimum, Medieval Climatic Anomaly, and Little Ice Age (respectively).</p>\n<p>Mean &delta;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>carbonate</sub> values for Period 1 are among the highest for any period, suggesting Tampa Bay was somewhat cooler and more saline than expected.

Mean &delta;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>carbonate</sub> values increased, consistent with the onset of higher salinity and cooler temperatures. A decline in the prevalence of oyster in Period-2 middens may indicate that these changes had a negative effect on mollusks. Perhaps consistent with this, a smaller range in &delta;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>carbonate</sub> values suggests more restricted resource procurement areas. On the other hand, the means for oyster height and&nbsp; crown conch length increased.</p>\n<p>Period 3 witnessed a decline in mean &delta;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>carbonate</sub> values, suggesting the bay became substantially warmer and less saline. These changes negatively affected mollusks, with significant declines in both the shell height of oysters and the shell lengths of crown conchs.

Mean &delta;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>carbonate</sub> values for Period 3 exhibit a relatively wide range suggesting variability in the habitats where oysters were collected.</p>\n<p>Period 4 is associated with cooler and drier climate conditions; consistent with this, mean &delta;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>carbonate</sub> values increased significantly. The transition appears to have had a continuing negative effect on oyster populations, as evidence by a significant decline in shell height and a continued reduction in their prevalence in middens.

However, a second lesson is that such institutions may not endure across extended periods of challenging climate conditions. A third and related lesson, is that such institutions may be slow to return even as climatic conditions improve, as suggested by the archaeological record of Period 3.
