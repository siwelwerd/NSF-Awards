 "awd_abstract_narration": "Data from multiple sources of multiple media types (also known as multimedia data) is the foundation of data-driven discoveries in science.  The United States needs to create a workforce trained in storing, analyzing and gaining insights from multimedia data. This travel award will enable students to attend a one-and-a-half-day summit on the topic of  \"Software Infrastructure for Managing and Processing Big Multimedia Data at the Internet Scale\", and co-located with IEEE International Conference on Multimedia Information Processing and Retrieval held on April 10-12 in Miami, Florida.  This summit will include speeches, panels, posters, and hands-on training for attendees. Participation in conferences such as this summit is an extremely important part of a graduate student's research and career development, because it provides him or her the opportunity for them to learn about the field from panel and keynote talks, interact with peers and senior researchers, and generally gain broad exposure to leading edge work in multimedia computing. \r\n\r\nAlmost all disciplines of science and engineering involve generation and analysis of multimedia data, with the sources of data including laboratory experiments, unmanned aerial vehicles, traffic and surveillance cameras, and social media posts.  Multimedia data is more than just big in volume; it is also multi-modal and mostly unstructured. Storing, indexing, searching, integrating, processing and gaining insights from the vast amounts of data have unprecedented challenges. In many cases, the data must be analyzed immediately in order to prevent or respond to situations (such as traffic collisions or natural disasters). In some cases, the data needs to be archived to discover long-term trends. Even though significant progress has been made in processing multimedia data, today's solutions are inadequate for handling the data from millions of sources simultaneously. This summit will include speeches, panels, posters, and hands-on training for attendees together with discussions on software and systems infrastructure for processing multimedia data, and on case studies on using multimedia data for emergency response.  The outcomes of the summit are (1) describe a roadmap for constructing software infrastructure for analyzing multimedia data at Internet scale and (2) develop training modules for using multimedia data for emergency response.",
