 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will experimentally test the hypothesis that when users are presented with search results that are augmented with signals for evaluating the credibility of web sources, they will strengthen their critical thinking skills and become better consumers of online information. Evaluating the credibility of web sources is a crucial critical thinking skill in our digitally mediated world. We have learned to rely on search engine platforms to show us the right results, while forgetting that algorithms are biased or that they can be manipulated. This research aims to discover whether and how humans can reclaim their agency when deciding what information sources to trust. Additionally, it will: (1) identify a set of human-understandable signals that are deemed helpful for evaluating the credibility of web sources and validate them through users studies; (2) propose and implement algorithmic techniques for computing some of these signals, providing a trail of transparency about how they work, and (3) develop a novel web platform for the interactive exploration of signals, modeled upon nutrition fact labels, that will contribute in advancing web literacy skills in the broad public.\r\n\r\nExperimental evidence on whether labeling information sources with credibility signals affects the critical thinking skills of young people will inform the emerging public debate on how cyber-human systems such as search engines, which are shaping our minds and societies, could support a basic consumer right, that of being informed about the source of information that is being consumed. Other broad impacts are: (1) advancing web literacy through an interactive web platform that explains and gives information about signals to evaluate credibility; (2) monitoring search engine result pages (SERP), by establishing a SERP Observatory on results about vulnerable populations to discover attempts to manipulate the ranking, and (3) educating the public through writings on algorithmic decision making on the web. This research will also involve the entire community of the college in the production of digital content through a yearly Wikipedia Edit-a-thon, which will enrich and expand the results shown by search engines on topics about women, gender, and vulnerable populations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

One of the first findings of this work, based on two user studies, was that knowledge panels in Google Search results, especially those using Wikipedia content, play an important role when assessing the credibility of a source during a web literacy practice known as \"lateral reading\". We performed an audit of Google Search results for 8,000 newspapers and found that only a fraction of them displayed knowledge panels with Wikipedia content. This finding inspired public efforts to increase the coverage of Wikipedia pages for news organizations, especially local newspapers (https://www.poynter.org/tech-tools/2018/digital-literacy-project-sets-an-ambitious-goal-wikipedia-pages-for-1000-local-newspapers/).</p>\r\n<p>Given that Google Search is often the starting point for most information needs, our research focused on several user-interface elements of the page, including knowledge panels, top stories, and the \"About the source\" feature attached to every search result, to assess their impact for credibility evaluation. In a study with 30 participants, none of them had ever noticed the \"About the source\" feature, even though it had been part of the Google Search page for more than a year and a half when the study was conducted. The \"About the source\" feature contained many of the credibility signals that our research had proposed (e.g. domain registration year, its Wikipedia link if available, links to social profiles, etc.). However, its subtle interface (a vertical ellipsis next to the URL of the result) didn&rsquo;t invite users to explore its content. As a result, we experimented with several user interface designs that made credibility signals visible in the interface by augmenting each search result (Image_2). Our pilot user studies indicated that having these signals visible all the time created cognitive overload, which led to them being disregarded.</p>\r\n<p>In a second thrust of our research, we experimentally tested the extent to which users could distinguish between reliable and unreliable news websites based on their design. One finding from this experiment was that when the amount of ads on the website increased, users perceived this as having less credibility. Informed by this finding, we evaluated a machine learning approach that uses YOLOv3, a real-time object detection algorithm, to automatically detect the amount of ads on a website while automatically scrolling to capture the entire page (Image_6). We then tested this approach on all newspapers listed on the website Media Bias/Fact Check. In a surprising result, many credible news organizations turned out to have a large volume of ads, often more than that of lesser known or less reliable news websites. Thus, the amount of ads by itself is not that telling, one would need to assess the nature of the ads to be able to distinguish between legitimate advertising (by legitimate businesses that are able to pay to show up in the pages of reputable news organizations) and click-bait advertising from low-credibility and often fraudulent websites, which users should learn to avoid. Our experiments using the newest AI models for recognizing the quality of ads were very promising, which led us to perform a new experiment, not present in the initial proposal, since at that time (2018), we lacked such AI technology.</p>\r\n<p>We have developed a prototype for a chatbot titled CredBot, powered by OpenAI, which unobtrusively monitors a user&rsquo;s web browsing habits and when needed (either when asked by the user or when the user visits websites that they have not visited before), displays a series of credibility signals for evaluating the webpage being visited (Images 1&amp;3). The bot uses a set of well-defined prompts for generating responses and our tests have indicated that the content is consistently reliable (though we are now in the process of performing a large user study to experimentally test these results).</p>\r\n<p>During the entire duration of this project, we have operated a so-called Google Search Results Observatory, periodically capturing Google search results for a variety of search queries. We have published several papers at conferences such as ACM FAccT and AAAI ICWSM to discuss the findings from such longitudinal data collections, making contributions to the research field of algorithmic auditing. One result of these data collections is an ever-growing database of domain names. We have written automated programs that search information about these domains from the 3Ws (Whois, Wikidata, and Wayback machine), databases that are a reliable source of credibility signals. With this information, we have built an interactive website that makes it possible to explore these signals both at the aggregate level and at the individual level (Images 4&amp;5).</p>\r\n<p>For the PI, one of the most rewarding aspects of this project was the collaboration and mentoring of more than 70 undergraduate students, all women.
