 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anti-icing surfaces play a critical role in human daily lives in cold climates by impacting a broad range of systems including infrastructure, transportation networks, and power generation systems. Icing in electricity transmission systems can lead to collapse of poles and towers and rupture of conductors. Icing in aircrafts results in increased drag and may lead to loss of lift force and potential catastrophic events. Icing in energy systems significantly drops the heat transfer rate leading to inefficient operation of these systems. According to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, ice storms account for 10% of power transmission outages in the United States. The financial loss for industries is estimated at $3-5 billion annually. In addition to financial losses, around 3 million people in the US suffer from power losses caused by ice storms every winter. Despite the vital role in society, the development of high-performance anti-icing surfaces for such demanding applications remains elusive.  This research will involve experiments and theory to reveal the role of length scale, geometry, and interfacial curvature on ice formation, and will develop new tools to address icing.\r\n\r\nNon-wetting, liquid-infused and hydrated surfaces have inspired routes for development of anti-icing surfaces. However, high freezing temperature, high ice adhesion strength (~50-100 kPa) and subsequent ice accretion, low mechanical durability, and high production cost have restricted their practical applications. The goal of this research program is to elucidate the underlying nano-scale physics of ice formation and adhesion on surfaces which involves studies of thermodynamics, heat transfer and mechanics of solid-ice interfaces. These physics provide fundamental routes for suppression of ice formation and minimization of ice adhesion on surfaces. We propose to break the limit of icephobicity at the nano-scale. Through studies of ice nucleation and growth at the nano-scale using Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy and confined nano-channels, we will explore the icephobicity limits. A new predictive mathematical model on ice adhesion is proposed that provides fundamental routes to achieve extremely low ice adhesion along with high durability. Investigators will examine this predictive model and subsequently develop and characterize a new class of icephobic materials called 3D nano-viscoelastic materials. These anti-icing materials will be examined through various icephobicity and durability metrics. The educational tasks in this research program will provide a platform to discover the talents of students from underrepresented groups and to equip them with micro/nano engineering skills required for future multidisciplinary work environments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Non-wetting, liquid-infused and hydrated surfaces have inspired routes for development of icephobic surfaces. However, high freezing temperature, high ice adhesion strength and subsequent ice accretion, low mechanical durability, and high production cost have restricted their practical applications. In this review, we provide a comprehensive definition for icephobicity through thermodynamics, heat transfer and mechanics of ice/water-material interface and elucidate physic-based routes through which nano-scale could help to achieve exceptional icephobic surfaces. Based on conservation laws, mathematical models are developed that accurately predict ice growth rate on various substrates and wind conditions. Through physics of fracture at ice-icephobic material interface, we cast a standard method for ice adhesion measurement that has the potential to eliminate discrepancies between reported ice adhesion from different laboratories. To assure long-time performance of icephobic surfaces, durability metrics need to be defined. We provide standard methods to examine mechanical, chemical, and environmental durability of icephobic surfaces. In the developed comprehensive framework on icephobicity in this review, performance of state-of-the-art icephobic surfaces are compared and main deficiencies in this field are highlighted.</p>\n<p>Next, we developed the underlying physics of the stress-localization concept to minimize adhesion of a solid on a surface. The fundamental underpinnings of this concept are elucidated and a simple formulation that could be used to characterize solid adhesion on various surfaces is derived. Using this concept, we developed a new icephobic material system with ice adhesion an order of magnitude lower than that of state-of-the-art materials while exhibiting long-term mechanical, chemical and environmental durability. As demonstrated, the concept of stress-localization is far more effective than previously studied surface-modified methods (e.g., perfluorinated or hydrated surface). Stress-localization is a volumetric phenomenon and remains effective even after long duration of operation of these materials. The concept of stress-localization could be implemented in a broad range of material systems to minimize adhesion of any solid, including bio-species, salt, dust and gas hydrates, and on surfaces, with a wide range of applications including aviation systems, oceanic sciences, energy systems and bio-sciences.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we explored water-ice transformation of few nm nanodroplets that plays a critical role in nature including climate change, microphysics of clouds, survival mechanism of animals in cold environments, and a broad spectrum of technologies. Despite computational efforts, experimental probing of this transformation at few nm scales remains unresolved. We directly probed water-ice transformation down to 2 nm scale.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/27/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Hadi&nbsp;Ghasemi</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1804204/1804204_10556510_1632784774936_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1804204/1804204_10556510_1632784774936_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Stress-localized surfaces\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1804204/1804204_10556510_1632784774936_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Stress-localized surfaces\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(a) Schematic of ice detachment from the material, (b) stress-localized icephobic surfaces, (c) Surface map of elastic modulus of stress-localized materials, (d) formation of crack at the coordinate of Phase II with minimal forces</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Materials Horizons, 6, 758-766, 2019.</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Hadi&nbsp;Ghasemi</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Stress-localized surfaces</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1804204/1804204_10556510_1632784234864_Fig4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1804204/1804204_10556510_1632784234864_Fig4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Ice Growth rate\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1804204/1804204_10556510_1632784234864_Fig4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Ice Growth rate\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The predicted ice growth rates on a substrate are compared with the experimental data measured in this work along with the reported ones in the literature</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Advances in Colloid and Interface Science, 269, 203-218, 2019.</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Hadi&nbsp;Ghasemi</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Ice Growth rate</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1804204/1804204_10556510_1632784108256_Fig3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1804204/1804204_10556510_1632784108256_Fig3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Ice growth on a sub-cooled surface\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1804204/1804204_10556510_1632784108256_Fig3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Ice growth on a sub-cooled surface\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(a) In no flow condition, the heat transfer by the solid substrate determines the ice growth rate.
