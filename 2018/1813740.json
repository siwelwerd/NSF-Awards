 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates how state-of-the-art creative and pedagogical agents can improve students' learning, attitudes, and engagement with computer science. The project will be conducted in high school classrooms using EarSketch, an online computer science learning environments that engages over 160,000 learners worldwide in making music with JavaScript or Python code. The researchers will build the first co-creative learning companion, Cai, that will scaffold students with pedagogical strategies that include making use of learner code to illustrate abstraction and modularity, suggesting new code to scaffold new concepts, providing help and hints, and explaining its decisions. This work will directly address the national need to develop computing literacy as a core STEM skill.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work brings together an experienced interdisciplinary team to investigate the hypothesis that adding a co-creative learning companion to an expressive computer science learning environment will improve students' computer science learning (as measured by code sophistication and concept knowledge), positive attitudes towards computing (self-efficacy and motivation), and engagement (focused attention and involvement during learning). The iterative design and development of the co-creative learning companion will be based on studies of human collaboration in EarSketch classrooms, the findings in the co-creative literature and virtual agents research, and the researchers' observations of EarSketch use in classrooms. This work will address the following research questions: 1) What are the foundational pedagogical moves that a co-creative learning companion for expressive programming should perform?; 2) What educational strategies for a co-creative learning companion most effectively scaffold learning, favorable attitudes toward computing, and engagement?; and 3) In what ways does a co-creative learning companion in EarSketch increase computer science learning, engagement, and positive attitudes toward computer science when deployed within the sociocultural context of a high school classroom? The proposed research has the potential to transform our understanding of how to support student learning in and broaden participation through expressive computing environments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We worked with high school teachers and their classrooms in Georgia, Illinois, and Florida to co-design and assess an initial CAI prototype in their computer science high school classes. Our initial research yielded a better understanding of how student learners collaborate in their classrooms to inform how we designed our AI. Our findings in evaluating our CAI prototype were mixed: while we found no significant quantitative results between using CAI to not using CAI with EarSketch, our qualitative results yielded a significantly richer understanding of how to build co-creative AI for EarSketch and other expressive/technical applications. CAIs development also yielded a useful standalone component that is now being used in the EarSketch annual competition: the first automated creativity assessment tool for expressive/technical environments.\n\n\nA major thrust of the early years of this work was investigating dialogues between pairs of human high school students as they co-created together. We analyzed the pairs dialogues and their actions within EarSketch using an AI approach (hidden Markov model), and we were able to identify three states related to dialogue and four states related to task actions.
