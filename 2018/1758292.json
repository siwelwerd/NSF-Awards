 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Collaboration for Excellence in Science and Math Education II project is a Robert Noyce Track 1 Scholarships & Stipends project at the University of Alabama Birmingham (UAB). The project joins UAB's Center for Community OutReach Development, UABTeach, and Lawson State Community College (LSCC), a local Historically Black College. Through these partnerships, the project aims to increase the number of STEM secondary teachers in this high-need area of the country and build a new student pipeline to secondary education STEM careers. Over the five-year project period, at least 42 undergraduate STEM majors and STEM post-baccalaureates will receive Noyce scholarships to become STEM teachers. Support for all scholars will continue through induction efforts during the graduates' first years in teaching in high-need schools. The project will also introduce community college students to STEM teaching careers. This experience will provide developmental support for community college students through a program of academics and practical experiences that lead to STEM teacher certification through either a Bachelor of Science degree or a master's degree with certification in secondary STEM education (MAEd). \r\n\r\nThe project will investigate the usefulness and success of three models for preparing STEM teachers: Model Type 1 is a multi-year program that will engage first and second year students and provide scholarships to juniors and senior STEM majors; Model Type 2 will engage students in their third or fourth year in a STEM major, leading to a 5th year MAEd degree with teacher certification; and Model Type 3 is a one-year program that will engage career changers who already have a STEM bachelor's degree. Model Type 1 students will enter the program by taking inquiry-based courses at UAB or LSCC and informal summer STEM programs for middle school or high school students. Many of the MAEd students will enter the program by participating as facilitators in UAB's Summer Science Institute, which will provide them with a taste of inquiry-based education and in-depth STEM educational experiences. The models will aggressively recruit students who are currently underrepresented in secondary STEM education. This project will support the graduates via classroom visits, Professional Learning Communities, UAB faculty support, and resources via many Center for OutReach Development programs for secondary STEM education. The project goal is to create a cadre of excellent teachers who will remain in secondary STEM education and be committed to teaching and improvising STEM education in high needs schools and to add to the knowledge base of how and why these three programs are successful.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Of the 48 students recruited, 23 were Alternative Masters program (MAEd) students and 25 were UABTeach undergraduate students. Of the 48 students recruited, only 5 did not complete the program prior to 2023. These 5 students were in the MAEd Program.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Throughout the grant period, recruitment was relatively seamless between UAB&rsquo;s School of Education and UABs Community OutReach Development CORD), and the partnership in recruitment improved each year. UAB&rsquo;s School of Education was instrumental in this process and each year partnered in several events to excite the STEM majors about the joy of an education career. Sandra McKell, the CESAME II Program Director, was invited to meet and share the benefits of becoming a Noyce Scholar with these students during their education classes. Applications and interview scheduling was provided during the meeting. Successful recruitment was further enhanced by having the fact that a former CESAME I Noyce Scholar was employed as a Master Teacher in the UABTeach Program.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Monthly Noyce Scholar meetings attracted all CESAME II students and 4-5 graduates, all of whom were excited to be at the meeting (not just for the food), highly engaged, and successful in their learning. UAB&rsquo;s Alabama Science in Motion (ASIM) and Alabama Math, Science, and Technology Initiative (AMSTI) staff led collaborative math and science activities using a variety of pedagogical methods that would all be freely available to the students in their classrooms. Scholars, not only, learned and networked over dinner, but they discovered a model for a career long support system. Finally, CESAME II provided a wide range of professional development for the Noyce Scholars. As students, they had the opportunity to enroll in ASIM, AMSTI, and CRISPR training for credit, and practice the latest hands-on pedagogy during the facilitation of summer science camps.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;ASIM and AMSTI training allowed the Noyce Scholars to borrow classroom hands-on modules to use throughout the school year. Not only does ASIM and AMSTI training save teachers/schools thousands of dollars in purchasing science supplies, but it also provides training by expert lead master teachers who will visit the classrooms to assist in leading the science labs. The summer science camps were week-long and grade specific. Noyce Scholars were matched at the grade level in which they intended to teach. With a small team of teachers, the Scholars taught a set curriculum and practiced a variety of pedagogical methods in this informal atmosphere. The Scholars learned the importance of working as a team, pacing the lesson, and managing the class.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;In summary, CESAME II already moved 43 well-equipped STEM teachers into high needs schools, in which most have remained. The ongoing challenge will be to find new ways to train and support teachers so they can thrive in some of the most difficult teaching environments.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/17/2023<br>\nModified by: J.
