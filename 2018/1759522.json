 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops new software tools for pangenomic analysis, which is a relatively new area of genomic research that studies large numbers of genome sequences from multiple organisms to understand how organisms adapt their genomes to their environments.  As the cost of DNA sequencing continues to decrease, it is now routine for multiple genomes per species to be available for analysis, giving much more information about the species. The approach makes use of a graph-based representation of a pangenome and exploits this representation to efficiently find both shared and unique regions of interest across genomes. Each individual?s genomic sequence corresponds to path in a graph data structure called a De Bruijn graph; these graphs are large and can have millions of nodes and edges.  The tools being developed are based on finding frequented regions (FRs) in De Bruijn graphs; these regions are hotspots that often represent features of interest in one or more genomes. Algorithms and software tools will be made available to the greater scientific community to facilitate new pangenomics research.  The project will provide support and training for a postdoc and an incoming PhD student at Montana State University. It will also support a summer intern in the last two years at the National Center for Genome Resources.  Aspects of the project will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate courses at MSU, as well as integrated into several outreach and training activities at NCGR. In addition, MSU has several programs in place to serve American Indian students and the PIs will actively recruit from and engage this community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe current trajectory of next generation sequencing improvements, including falling costs and increased read lengths and throughput, ensure that multiple genomes per species will be routine within the next decade. This project initiates work on a next generation of bioinformatics software that can exploit the increased information content available from multiple accessions and intelligently use the data for unbiased, species-wide analyses.  The proposed work will refine algorithms and develop software to address important problems in each of the identified areas. The research team has a variety of complementary expertise ranging from molecular biology, algorithms, machine learning and genomics research.  Pangenomic biology will be advanced through automatic identification of candidate regions of interest in a pangenome. Methods will be developed to discover regions that are conserved across evolutionary space, regions that are novel, and regions that have diverged due to positive selection.  Machine learning techniques will be used to search for interesting genomic regions. Lastly, this work will complement the work being done on the model plant, Medicago truncatula, contributing to research on its symbiotic relationships.  Results of the project can be found at: www.cs.montana.edu/pangenomics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project builds on new graph-based representations for pangenomes in which related genomes (e.g. from the same species) are jointly represented in a large graph (consisting of nodes and edges) called a De Bruijn graph.  The main outcomes of the project were to develop software tools to efficiently find conserved regions in the graph, where multiple genomic paths come together and traverse a common set of nodes.  These regions are referred to as frequented regions.  The software tool we developed is called FindFRs and is freely available to the public.  The second major aspect of the project was to investigate machine learning approaches to link frequented regions with phenotypic traits.  To study this we used a large yeast pangenomic data set (with over 1000 individual yeast strains) in which 35 growth-related traits were measured in each strain.  This allowed us to determine correlations between the traits and the frequented regions.  Our results indicated that the frequented regions improve the prediction of these traits relative to existing traditional methods that use simpler genomic features such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).  Better understanding of these connection between genomic features and phenotype is critically important to a variety of applications such as agricultural systems and natural populations in the face of changing climates.\n\nBesides developing new science, the project supported training students in computational biology related research, including primary support for one female PhD student and one female MS student.  The former student has recently accepted a tenure-track assistant professor position, while the MS student is planning to enter a PhD program.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/24/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brendan M Mumey"
