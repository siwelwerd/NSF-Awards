 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I project will develop an extended depth imaging variation of optical coherence tomography (OCT). OCT is an optical imaging method that can visualize tissue structures up to 1mm deep with microscopic resolution. It has been well adapted for retinal imaging but although available for skin imaging application, the performance and price point are not sufficient to encourage market adoption. Building on NSF supported research at Duke University, this project will extend the depth range of OCT from the current 1-2 mm, which is only the most superficial layer of skin, to 3-4 mm, enabling full imaging of skin layers down to the dermal junction. This will enable dermatologists to access OCT without a large financial outlay and provide a non-invasive imaging modality in the office setting.\r\n\r\nExtended depth imaging is also applicable to dental imaging and may allow dentists to reduce the need for X-ray imaging by providing cross sectional images of teeth and gums. Since these OCT instruments are highly portable, the deep imaging system can be widely used, across lab benches, in the field or shared throughout a medical office. This project will support the development of new products and the teams that design and build them. Extended depth imaging OCT uses a novel design to dramatically increase the depth penetration of OCT into skin, teeth and other samples. By using distinct illumination and collection apertures, extended depth (or dual axis) OCT can triangulate the signal to layers deep beneath the tissue surface. Compared to previous OCT systems, this increases the imaging depth by a factor of 2. This innovation will be combined with proprietary spectrometer design, which was developed to take advantage of 3D printing methods, to develop a disruptive new instrument for imaging with the performance and price necessary for commercial success in clinical dermatology and dentistry. This proposal will build a prototype system and test it on several types of animal tissue.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
