 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Robert Hausinger and Dr. Jian Hu from Michigan State University to characterize how a microorganism interconverts the two mirror image structures of lactic acid, a central element of carbohydrate metabolism. The enzyme that does this, called lactate racemase, requires both a protein component and nickel. Nickel is very rarely found in biology.  Even more remarkably, the nickel in lactate racemase is present in a unique environment never before observed.  This project investigates how the bacterium makes the cofactor that creates the unique environment.  This effort provides training to a postdoctoral researcher, a graduate student, and undergraduate students in the areas of structure and biochemical mechanisms. These researchers also participate in hands-on educational activities for the public related to this topic that will engage lifelong learners of all ages at the annual Science Festival at the university.\r\n\r\nThis research elucidates structure-function aspects of the four proteins required for lactate racemase activity. It characterizes how LarB catalyzes a new reaction, carboxylation of the pyridinium ring of nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide while hydrolyzing the phosphoanhydride linkage to produce pyridinium-3,5-dicarboxylic acid mononucleotide. Additional studies of LarE, a sacrificial sulfur transferase, establish how the two carboxylic acid groups are transformed into thiocarboxylate groups and define whether the resulting dehydroalanine side chain of the enzyme can be regenerated to cysteine. This work uncovers how LarC catalyzes the CTP-dependent installation of Ni into pyridinium-3-5-dithiocarboxylic acid mononucleotide, the first biological example of a cyclometallation reaction, to create the cofactor. Finally, these investigations show how the cofactor is bound to different LarA species and identifies other potential transformations catalyzed by the enzyme. In combination, the biosynthesis and roles of this novel nickel-containing cofactor can be described. This innovative research expands our understanding of nickel biochemistry and establishes a new paradigm for redox chemistry involving a tethered nickel-pincer cofactor.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These enzymes catalyze carboxylase/hydrolase, sulfur insertase, and nickel insertase reactions, respectively. The cofactor is then bound to and promotes catalysis by lactate racemase (LarA, which interconverts the D- and L-isomers of lactic acid) or it binds to various related proteins with distinct specificities for other 2-hydroxyacid compounds. During the period covered by this grant, new insights were obtained regarding the structures of LarA, several LarA homologs, LarB, LarE, and a domain of LarC. &nbsp;In addition, extensive information was obtained regarding the functions of these proteins. A cysteine residue in LarB transiently adds to the NaAD substrate and facilitates its carboxylation, then a nearby glutamate residue removes a proton and the cysteine is eliminated as the ring becomes aromatic. The carboxylated species then undergoes hydrolysis using water that is bound to a magnesium ion (Fig. 2). Two types of LarE were discovered, both of which activate their substrates using ATP (Fig. 3). The <em>L. plantarum</em> LarE sacrifices a cysteinyl sulfur atom of the protein, leading to inactivation, so two copies of the protein are needed for each cofactor made. By contrast, <em>T. maritima</em> LarE uses a sulfide bound to an iron-sulfur cluster and acts catalytically. The sulfide is derived from the amino acid L-cysteine requiring action by a cysteine desulfurase. LarC from <em>M. thermoacetica</em> catalyzes a CTP-dependent modification of its substrate, inserts nickel, and hydrolyzes the resulting species to release CMP and produce the NPN cofactor (Fig. 4). NPN becomes covalently attached to LarA from <em>L. plantarum</em> and the resulting enzyme removes a proton from either D- or L-lactate, translocates the hydride to the NPN cofactor, and the reduced cofactor then transfers the hydride back to either face of the pyruvate intermediate to achieve racemization (Fig. 5). Crystal or cryo-electron microscopy structures were determined for the LarA homologs from <em>Thermoanaerobacter thermosaccharolyticum</em> (lacking the cofactor and termed an apoprotein), which uses malate or tartrate as substrates, <em>Isosphaera pallida</em> (present as a holoprotein), which uses several short chain aliphatic 2-hydroxyacid substrates, and <em>Blautia wexlerae</em> (apoprotein), for which the substrate remains unknown (Fig. 6).</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/25/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Robert&nbsp;P&nbsp;Hausinger</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1807073/1807073_10552249_1658235611682_image-6--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1807073/1807073_10552249_1658235611682_image-6--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 6\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1807073/1807073_10552249_1658235611682_image-6--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 6\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Structures of LarA homologs from T. thermosaccharolyticum, I. pallidum, and B. wexlerae.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Robert P.
