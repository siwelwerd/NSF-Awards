 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomers are now convinced that many, if not most, stars are accompanied by planets.  They are interested in learning how planets form, and whether or not the Solar System is representative of the Universe. It is believed that planets formed from a disk of material around the young Sun; this disk is long gone for our Solar System. In this project, the investigator will use computers and his own computer code to model the properties of how such disks form and change under the effects of radiation from the star and magnetic fields.  He will compare his models with observations obtained from space missions and ground-based telescopes. He will work with educators at museums and supercomputer centers to generate visualizations to help the public understand this work.  He will also develop courses and workshops in computational methods for junior researchers and for students at his home institutions.\r\n\r\nThe proposed program uses the 3-D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code Athena++.  The PI will 1) Model the effects of radiation on the accretion process, 2) Construct models of both non-ideal MHD effects and thermal dynamics on the structure of protoplanetary disks, and 3)  Carry out simulations of disks around protoplanets that share similarities with the simulations described in 1 and 2.  He will compare his simulated models with observations from space missions such as Spitzer and Herschel and ground-based telescopes such as ALMA, EVLA, VLT, Subaru, and Gemini.  Finally, he will make predictions for future observations in the next decade with instruments such as the TMT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
