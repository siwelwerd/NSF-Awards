 "awd_abstract_narration": "Musculoskeletal disorders are a leading cause of injury among workers who are exposed to physical workloads, with overexertion in lifting causing over one-third of these injuries. Every year approximately $56 billion is lost due to lift related injuries. The emerging technologies of exoskeletons hold promising potential to reduce biomechanical loads, thereby preventing worker injury. The obstacles to widespread adoption of this technology, however, arise from discomfort due to excessive weight, restricted range of motion, and high-pressure concentration. This project seeks to explore a new design for wearable robots as ubiquitous co-robots to address these challenges. The proposed bio-inspired, soft, back-support exoskeletons will provide joint moment assistance, while being lightweight and unobtrusive. Our soft back-support exoskeleton consists of 1) a soft exoskeleton that is lightweight as its design architecture (bio-inspired, cable-driven mechanism) and actuation (high-torque density actuators) overcome the limitations of rigid exoskeletons (heavy, limit range of motion) and textile-based soft exosuits (medium weight, exert high pressure concentration on tissue); and 2) wearable sensors and its on-site estimation algorithms of biological joint moment to characterize and prevent injuries. The proposed exoskeleton presents a promising solution in assisting injury prevention and performance augmentation. In terms of its societal impact, it will improve the quality of life and work as well as address the social and economic impact of robots on our workers. Thus, it will have a direct massive gain to the economy, health, and welfare of our society.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to explore new research and design of soft wearable collaborative robots to minimize injuries of workers prone to fatigue and musculoskeletal disorders. The project will focus on 1) designing bio-inspired soft back-support exoskeletons which are hybrid wearable robots that combine the advantages of rigid exoskeletons and soft exosuits while minimizing their respective limitations; 2) exploring on-site estimation algorithms using wearable sensors to characterize the biological joint moments to detect fatigue onset; and 3) evaluating the performance of the exoskeletons and its effectiveness for injury prevention. \r\nThe contributions of this research entail both engineering innovations including new design methodology and enabling technologies for soft robots, as well as scientific foundation and tools to understand human-robot interaction and biomechanics. 1) Advances in robotics. Soft exoskeleton design architecture will enable a new type of wearable robot design that is comfortable, powerful, and versatile. High torque density actuators will significantly reduce the weight and increase the transparency of exoskeletons. 2) Understanding of human-robot interaction. The investigation into lifting biomechanics and assistive control strategy will shed light on human-robot interactions and improve human and robot performances.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Here list of the main outcomes of the robots and sensing system design, control, and evaluation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1) <strong>Robot design:</strong> designed and prototyped a back exoskeleton to support lifting activities and a series of knee exoskeletons to support squat lifting and multi-activities. We have developed a tethered version platform to evaluate the performance of the exoskeletons for research and a portable version platform for outdoor usage. To the best of our knowledge, we developed the first soft back exoskeleton for work injury prevention, and we pioneer the field of &ldquo;hybrid soft exoskeleton&rdquo;. The feasibility of our hybrid soft back exoskeleton prototype was experimentally tested on three healthy subjects. The root-mean-square error of force tracking is 6.63 N (3.3 % of the 200 N peak force) and it demonstrated that it can actively control the stiffness to the desired value. This continuum soft exoskeleton represents a feasible solution with the potential to reduce back pain for multiple activities and multiple forces along the human spine. Though the scope of the project is back injury prevention, we also studied lower limb injury prevention to gain a holistic understanding of the research questions for human augmentation. We developed a high-torque and highly backdrivable hybrid soft exoskeleton for knee injury prevention during squatting. The root-mean-square error of torque tracking is less than 0.29 Nm (1.21% error of 24 Nm peak torque).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2) <strong>Sensing system design:</strong> Developed portable in-house IMU system for exoskeleton control, human motion analysis, and performance evaluation. The developed IMU system includes 8 wireless IMU nodes and 1 receiver and can measure the Euler angle, angular velocity, and acceleration of the segments in real time. It can be used for human motion classification, gait detection, prediction implementation, torque profile generation, human kinematics, and kinetics estimation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3) <strong>Control algorithm development:</strong> Proposed a) dynamic model-based torque control algorithm for squat and stoop assistance; b) continuous torque controller that uses the stiffness model to estimate the biological torque in real-time; c) a two-stage artificial neural network based gait phase detection algorithm for multi-activities speed-changing conditions using only two thighs inertial measurement units (IMU) sensors, that can accurately (99.4%) classify four motions (standing, walking, stair ascending and stair descending), and accurately estimate and 200 ms ahead predict the gait phase percentage in the real-time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4) <strong>Human evaluation results:</strong> Our designed knee exoskeleton can reduce muscle activity, heart rate, and energy expenditure for able-bodied wearers. It can reduce 75% to 87.5% of muscle activities for three knee extensors during squatting, and 1.92%-10.24% of muscle activities for knee and hip extensors during walking. In addition, the proposed design can reduce the wearer's heart rate by 18.9%, 9.6%, and 5.3% and energy expenditure by 22.2%, 12.8 %, and 5.5% during squatting, stair climbing, and loaded incline walking.</p>\n<p>In terms of the results being disseminated to communities, our team published 7 publications, presented 10 posters, got 5 awards, and held 5 workshops in the leading journals and conferences. Among them, our one paper is published in the IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO), two are published in the IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics (T-mech), two are published in the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RAL), one is published in the Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, and one book chapter published in Soft Robotics in Rehabilitation. One of our papers obtained the Best Student Paper Award from the Dynamic Systems &amp; Control Division (DSCD), American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), selected from 4 international conferences (1200+ papers).</p>\n<p>As part of the training and professional development efforts of the project, the PIs are also guiding groups of undergraduate Engineering students in senior capstone design and mechatronics to develop direct-drive, hydraulic, and pneumatic soft exoskeletons and mentor students to join student competition and invocation challenges.
