 "awd_abstract_narration": "Algae are essential primary producers that profoundly affect the global environment, ecology, and economy. The Culture Collection of Algae at the University of Texas at Austin (UTEX) is one of only a handful of large biodiversity collections of living algae. UTEX maintains more than 3,000 distinct algal strains and is among the most genetically diverse assemblages of living organisms available to the public. Many of the algae in the UTEX Collection are unique and irreplaceable. UTEX distributes thousands of living algal cultures to scientists, educators, and students throughout the U.S. and the world. Great interest in algae as sources of transportation fuels, human food, animal feed, pharmaceuticals, and many other uses makes UTEX cultures and services essential resources for researchers. Every year, several hundred published research articles, many of which recognize NSF support, reference the use of UTEX strains. UTEX provides extensive student training, hands-on workshops on managing algal cultures, an informative interactive web site (https://utex.org/), species identification services, chemical composition analysis, and extensive correspondence with students engaged in algal research. UTEX personnel give presentations at public schools, conduct tours of UTEX facilities, assist teachers and students in conducting high school science projects, and provide presentations on the scientific importance of algae to hundreds of school children at local open house events.\r\n\r\nUTEX is a public resource whose mission is to promote, support, and enable the use of algae for research, education, and practical applications. The primary goals of UTEX that fulfill this mission are (1) maintaining a well-curated permanent repository for algal biodiversity that insures the continuity and consistency of algal research; (2) providing living algal cultures and related materials to the user community at a modest cost; (3) acting as a source of information regarding algae to researchers, educators, and the interested public; and (4) participating in outreach to the user community through training, support services, and supplies. Additional goals of this project are to (1) enhance the security of UTEX holdings through improved culture maintenance techniques and expansion of the number of strains in cryogenic storage, (2) increase the value of UTEX algal strains to the user community by characterizing their genomic and metabolic diversity, (3) expand interactions with K-12 and undergraduate education programs through the development of teaching kits and online teaching tools, and (4) accession and make available a greater diversity of strains that are of value for emerging and expanding areas of pure and applied research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

UTEX personnel collectively spend an average of 30-40 hrs./week assisting students and professionals who wish to learn to culture algae through personal dialog, telephone conversations, e-mail correspondence, and social media outlets (Facebook, Twitter, and&nbsp;LinkedIn). UTEX maintains an extensive, regularly updated, public web site (<a href=\"https://utex.org/\">https://utex.org/</a>) that contains UTEX strain data and information on algal culturing methods. UTEX provides and participates in many different local and national service activities. In an average year, UTEX provides demonstrations and facility tours for hundreds of school children, especially from low-income areas. UTEX provides algae-related materials, training, and living cultures to undergraduate students involved in educational projects such as the UT-Austin Freshman Research Initiative (FRI), the International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition (iGEM), NASA Internships and Fellowships Integrated Recruiting, and the Algae Technology Education Consortium (ATEC). UTEX employs 5 -10 undergraduate research assistants to work in the Collection every semester, with financial need as a major factor in hiring. These students become well-trained laboratory microbiologists during their time at UTEX, providing them with work experience and professional job skills. UTEX supports local science-fair projects through consultation and the provision of cultures for local projects and by allowing students to visit and learn how to culture algae. The UTEX website provides suggestions for science projects, and teaching kits are supplied for teacher and student use. UTEX supports local and national outreach events like Explore UT and AAAS Family Science Days by providing the opportunity for hundreds of grade-school students to interact with algae and see them through microscopes, and by providing information regarding the importance of learning science. UTEX hosts graduate students and Ph.D.-level professionals every year who come for extended periods of time to learn how to manage algal cultures. In addition to these NSF-supported service activities, UTEX personnel conduct research projects in the areas of large-scale cultivation, cryopreservation, biochemical composition, algal toxin production and detection, wastewater remediation, molecular genetics, and comparative genomics.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/28/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: David&nbsp;R&nbsp;Nobles</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1755220/1755220_10556071_1635342701622_AgarCultures--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1755220/1755220_10556071_1635342701622_AgarCultures--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"UTEX is an Algal Biodiversity Resource\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1755220/1755220_10556071_1635342701622_AgarCultures--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"UTEX is an Algal Biodiversity Resource\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Culture Collection of Algae at the University of Texas at Austin (UTEX) is a curated public collection that serves as a permanent, living repository of algal biodiversity.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">UTEX</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;R&nbsp;Nobles</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">UTEX is an Algal Biodiversity Resource</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1755220/1755220_10556071_1635342566796_Cryo--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1755220/1755220_10556071_1635342566796_Cryo--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Undergraduate Research at UTEX\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1755220/1755220_10556071_1635342566796_Cryo--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Undergraduate Research at UTEX\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">UTEX employs 5-10 undergraduate research assistants to work in the Collection every semester.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">UTEX</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;R&nbsp;Nobles</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Undergraduate Research at UTEX</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1755220/1755220_10556071_1635341689550_20190302_123209_HDR--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1755220/1755220_10556071_1635341689550_20190302_123209_HDR--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Explore UT\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1755220/1755220_10556071_1635341689550_20190302_123209_HDR--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Explore UT\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">UTEX supports local and national outreach events like Explore UT and AAAS Family Science Days by providing the opportunity for hundreds of grade-school students to interact with algae and see them through microscopes, and by providing information regarding the importance of learning science.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">UTEX</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;R&nbsp;Nobles</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Explore UT</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
