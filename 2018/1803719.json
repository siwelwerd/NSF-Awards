 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will explore possibilities for better control of electron beams.  Electron beams are used in an enormous variety of applications in science, technology and medicine, including semiconductor device fabrication and in radiation treatment of cancers which are close to the skin surface. This study is particularly focused on electron beams utilized for imaging the most fundamental atomic level processes at very short time and length scales, a technology that has been called \"making the molecular movie\". These movies provide unique insights into atomic processes occurring in complex molecules and materials, potentially enabling design of new devices for next generation disruptive technologies such as quantum computing.\r\n\r\nThe electrons in high intensity electron beams are in the space charge dominated regime where strong Coulomb repulsion leads to deleterious effects such as emittance growth. A key aspect of this project develops the concept of dynamical shocks in expanding Coulomb clouds and beams, using a combination of analytic fluid models and large scale computational studies. A surprising prediction is that dynamical shock formation may provide an avenue for reducing emittance by judicious use of beam apertures. We call this effect Coulomb cooling as it has some similarities with evaporative cooling utilized in trapped atom experiments. Applications of the models and methods to plasmas arising in other contexts, such as astrophysics and cluster physics, will also be explored.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project was very successful at developing new analytical and computational approaches to understanding the properties of high density charged particle beams.  High density beams are a priority research area in applications ranging from electron microscopes capable of making molecular movies to very high energy accelerators dedicated to studying the elementary particles that underlie the structure of our universe.  Outcomes of this project included new insights into understanding the effects of particle-particle charge interactions on beam quality, and strategies to identify and utilize domains of laminar flow where beam quality is improved.  A further outcome was analytical and computational demonstrations of the emergence of charged particle halos that dynamically emerge from charged particle bunches with initially normal density profiles.  Control of halo formation and removal provide interesting new avenues toward improved beam quality in high density charged particle beams.  NSF support was used to train a postdoctoral researcher in the area of accelerator physics and in the computational and statistical methods relevant to the field.  The postdoctoral fellow  mentored a graduate student that was also working in the field, but supported by a different grant.  The postdoctoral fellow is now working at one of the DOE laboratories (Los Alamos), and the graduate student is now working in a related field at the University of Chicago.  The outcomes of the project where used to guide experimental work and were communicated broadly via conference talks, publications and by teaching short courses.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/26/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Phillip M Duxbury"
