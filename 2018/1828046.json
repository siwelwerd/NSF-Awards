The purpose of the workshop is to convene experts in the field to plan a path forward that can test a new model based on a large number of degrees of freedom and potentially lead to a deeper understanding of hadronic parity non-conservation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The workshop was hosted by the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, March 15-16, 2018, and was cosponsored by the NSF Hub N3AS (Network for Neutrinos, Nuclear Astrophysics).  Attendance was by invitation: twenty three members of the community active in HPNC attended.\n\nHadronic systems involve strong and electromagnetic interactions.  The effects of the much weaker weak interaction can be probed in nuclear systems because of the parity violation the weak interaction induces.  The pseudoscalar observables induced by HPNC are still very difficult to isolate, as the effects are typically one part in 10,000,000.\n\nThe workshop covered meson-exchange models of HPNC, pionless effective field theory approaches and the five Danilov amplitudes, recent uses of large Nc QCD to establish a hierarchy among these amplitudes, global analyses of existing experiments, the suppression of the long-distance pion-exchange contribution to HPNC, the NPDGamma and NDTGamma experiments, n+4He, the possibility of studying HPNC in deuteron photodisintegration, three-nucleon effects, neutron spin rotation, the potential use of lattice QCD to determine the strength of isotensor HPNC, quantum Monte Carlo applications to HPNC, anapole moments, modern shell model applications to HPNC, and future opportunities.\n\nWorkshop discussions focused on the need to revisit many of the calculations found in the literature, to repair a number of inconsistencies that likely distort current analyses.  It also focused on the need for a formalism that can be related to low-energy EFT treatments while also allowing one to  do conventional full-space calculations of the sort that represent the state-of-the-art for few-body systems.  (The contact interactions used in EFT are troublesome, if used directly.)\n\nThere was clearly more to do than the two-day workshop format allowed.  The group plans to meet again in November, 2019, at the INT, to begin the program described above. \n\nNSF support provided through this grant allowed us to provide local support to those participants requesting it, and partial travel support for a few participants requiring this help.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/11/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Wick C Haxton"
