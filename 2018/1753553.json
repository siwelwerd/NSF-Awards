 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tectonic plates are consumed at subduction zones, vast undersea regions which stretch thousands of miles across the face of our planet. During subduction, one plate sinks beneath another to be recycled into Earth's mantle. Subduction zones are the sites of active volcanism, the largest known earthquakes, and a wide array of mineral deposit types. Tracing the history of subduction as recorded in mountain belts is essential for reconstructing plate movements, paleogeography, paleobiology, and paleoclimate throughout geologic time. The Appalachian-Caledonide mountain chain is one of the largest in the world, stretching from the southern and eastern United States up through Canada and Greenland and across to Europe. Nonetheless, the record of subduction in the northeastern United States is surprisingly cryptic in terms of the rock record it left behind, particularly in terms of the metamorphic rocks comprising the deep roots of the mountain belt. New discoveries, however, are providing fresh perspectives, including the recognition of \"ultrahigh-temperature\" metamorphic rocks in northeastern Connecticut (CT) formed in excess of 900 \u00b0C (about 1650 \u00b0F). Of major significance is that this CT locality also preserves tantalizing evidence for subduction of crust to great depths-perhaps in excess of 60-100 miles. The research project will focus on these CT rocks as they may be the first \"ultrahigh-pressure\" (UHP) metamorphic rocks definitively recognized in the United States; their presence would catalyze a rethinking of how, where, and why rocks were subducted during Appalachian mountain building. More broadly, a deeper understanding of the tectonic architecture of the region may help resolve longstanding questions involving Paleozoic plate movement and associated implications for the location and geologic formation of natural resources in the mountain belt (which extends into the Arctic and potentially as far west as Alaska). The project will support and train Yale Ph.D. and undergraduate students, and integrate research results into public science outreach programs at the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History. \r\n\r\nGneisses in the field area host garnets that contain spectacular examples of crystallographically-oriented lamellae minerals (rutile, ilmenite, apatite, amphibole, pyroxene, quartz, and other phases). Comparisons with other localities worldwide indicate that such lamellae correlate broadly with pressure-temperature conditions and, thus, they hold considerable but as yet mostly untapped potential as petrogenetic indicators. For example, lamellae assemblages including rutile, ilmenite, quartz, amphibole, and apatite are documented only from UHP settings. In order to be used to diagnose metamorphic regimes, however, lamellae origins must be understood. Consequently, this project will undertake mineralogical and petrological study of the lamellae in the CT garnets involving: (1) Characterization of lamellae assemblages and chemical compositions via electron imaging and microprobe techniques together with Raman spectroscopy. (2) Electron-backscatter diffraction and transmission electron microscopy studies to determine crystallographic relationships between garnet and lamellae. (3) Chemical mapping using the electron microprobe to image closed and open-system garnet behavior. (4) Field work to identify other lamellae-bearing garnet localities in the region. The results of the above research will be used to test whether or not the lamellae are the products of exsolution from garnet, or if they formed by some other mechanism such as coupled infiltration and precipitation. If the former, then the Si-, Ti-, and P-rich garnet compositions point strongly toward majoritic garnet precursors formed at UHP conditions ~5 GPa or higher during subduction. Regardless of hypothesis test outcomes, lamellae formation processes must be better understood to help guide petrotectonic interpretations in New England and other orogenic belts across the globe.",

The mineral garnet was our primary focus. Garnets that form deep in mountain belts may crystallize at ultrahigh-temperatures (UHT) greater than 900 <sup>o</sup>C and/or ultrahigh pressures greater than 3 GPa. Garnets that crystallize at these conditions can contain a range of trace elements including titanium and phosphorus. When the garnets cool and decompress as they are brought back to Earth's surface by tectonic forces, these constituents can ?unmix? or ?exsolve? from the garnet to form characteristically oriented precipitates of minerals such as rutile, apatite, ilmenite, and quartz. On the basis of these textures and other geologic relationships, our work has discovered a range of previously unknown UHT and UHP rocks in part of the eroded Acadian mountain belt in northeastern Connecticut. Our major findings can be summarized as follows. First, we documented the first UHT high-pressure granulite metamorphic rocks known in the United States, formed at temperatures in excess of 1000 <sup>o</sup>C and pressures of at least 1.8 GPa, corresponding to depths below the ancient ground surface of roughly 65 km (~40 miles). These extreme conditions were verified by both field-based and laboratory experimental study, the latter in collaboration with colleagues from the GFZ, Potsdam, Germany (the experimental work was funded independently of this project). Second, we documented the occurrence of UHP rocks in the field area, one of possibly only two from North America. These rocks were formed at truly extreme pressures exceeding 5 GPa, corresponding to depths of 150?200 km below the ancient ground surface. Third, we documented systematic crystallographic orientation relationships (COR) between host garnets and the minerals that ?unmixed? from them. Our approach includes the first mineralogical application of which we are aware of the edge-to-edge matching (E2EM) model developed in materials science. Overall, we were able to successfully predict, for the first time, 88% to 98% of the observed crystallographic alignments between garnet and the unmixed minerals.
