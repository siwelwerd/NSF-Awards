 "awd_abstract_narration": "Particles in the atmosphere play key roles in controlling the Earth's hydrologic, chemical, and radiation balances. In the troposphere aerosols provide surfaces for cloud formation, for the absorption of trace gas pollutants, and they either warm or cool the Earth depending on their optical properties. In the stratosphere they provide surfaces for the conversion of chlorine from a passive to an active state which will catalytically destroy ozone, crucial as a filter against damaging UV radiation. Stratospheric aerosols also contribute to increasing the solar albedo, and to the absorption of terrestrial infrared radiation.  Particles are self-limiting through the formation of new particles, growth through diffusion, coagulation, condensation of trace gases, and ultimately sedimentation and deposition or capture by clouds.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecent developments extend the observational possibilities. These are i) year round (aircraft) access to McMurdo during austral autumn (April-June) and ii) development of smaller, lighter, inexpensive condensation nuclei counters (CNC) allowing (balloon borne) profiles to higher altitude(>35km). This new instrumentation can now be deployed in the fall, when chances of recovery are limited, and flown to altitudes above 35 km, necessary to measure meteoritic smoke particles. Providing additional quantification of the contribution of meteoritic smoke particles to stratospheric aerosol will improve the understanding of the stratospheric aerosol budget. There will be training opportunities in polar measurements for a post-doctoral scholar\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This isolation allows the polar stratospheric air to reach temperatures below -80&#730;C during winter, which is cold enough to create polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) composed of nitric acid and water. During winter the PSCs sediment, thus removing the small stratospheric aerosol upon which they condense leading to a nearly aerosol free region above 20 km by late winter.</p>\r\n<p>At a larger scale there is a hemispheric circulation in the upper stratosphere comprised of tropical upwelling, meridional transport, and poleward subsidence of air containing gaseous sulfuric acid created from the evaporation of stratospheric aerosol upon tropical ascent to near the stratopause, ~50 km. As the air descends in the polar region it cools and reaches sulfuric acid condensation temperatures at ~25 km. At this altitude in late winter there are no particles for the sulfuric acid to condense upon so a new particle layer is formed. Figure 1c) shows the seasonal evolution of this layer from 20 years of McMurdo balloon-borne measurements. Figure 1a) shows a global climate model prediction of this austral spring layer, and also indicates there may be a similar if less significant layer in austral fall.</p>\r\n<p>This latter prediction, and austral fall access to McMurdo through nearly bi-monthly aircraft flights led to our proposal to complete austral fall balloon-borne aerosol measurements designed to address three scientific questions: 1) Does a new particle layer form in austral fall, similar to the one which regularly forms in austral spring as predicted by a global climate model? 2) Are there early onset PSCs, predicted by Lambert et al. (2016, ref in Figure 4) based on satellite nitric acid measurements, which are not observable by the satellite backscatter lidar CALIOPI? 3) What is the extent of meteoric influence on aerosol entering the polar vortex above 35 km? To address these questions we proposed a set of balloon-borne in situ aerosol size and concentration measurements. Figure 2 provides images of the instrument gondola, and balloons and load-lines just prior to release in June 2019 and April 2023.</p>\r\n<p>The short answer to question 1 is shown in Figure 1b) which shows profiles of total aerosol concentration from 2019 and 2023 indicating no new particle layer similar to the austral spring layer in Figure 1c). But there is a difference in the stratospheric aerosol concentration between austral fall and spring. Figure 3a) is an aerosol profile above McMurdo in August 1992. Above 23 km there are no aerosol except for the smallest particles. In contrast in Figures 3b), c) the smallest particles are not affected in this region; however, a significant layer of particles &gt; 0.3 &micro;m appears at this altitude, especially in 2019. The presence of the larger aerosol, in contrast to austral spring, allows the sulfuric acid to condense upon the pre-existing aerosol and avoid making new particles. This is a new finding previously unobserved as such particles are invisible to satellite sensors, and will be published in the future.</p>\r\n<p>The answer to question 2 is shown in Figure 4a). While the particles at 25 km appear, as just discussed, there is also a significant increase in particles &gt; 5-10 &micro;m below 25 km compared to Figure 3b). In this region Figure 4b) indicates the temperatures are consistent with PSC particles (red region), left, and there is a deficit in nitric acid between 12 and 25 km from MLS, right. Lidar backscatter is calculated from the measurements, Figure 4c). The maximum, ~7 x 10<sup>-5</sup> km<sup>-1</sup> sr<sup>-1</sup>, is &lt; the minimum signal the CALIOPI lidar is sensitive to, ~10<sup>-4</sup> km<sup>-1</sup> sr<sup>-1</sup>, left hand side red box. The nearby CALIOPI measurements are also shown in Figure 4c) indicating no PSCs 12-25 km. This result is planned for future publication.</p>\r\n<p>Question 3 is partially addressed by Figure 5. The mixing ratios increasing with altitude in Figure 5a) (Norgren et al., 2024) indicates a source of particles above 35 km in all seasons except perhaps autumn. The new particle layer discussed above is clearly seen between 21-26 km in spring. Figure 5b) shows that the non-volatile fraction of total aerosol is roughly constant at 20-40% up to 25 km, but then decreases above suggesting little meteoric influence on subsiding aerosol in autumn.</p>\r\n<p>The COVID induced delay to 2023 enabled an aerosol measurement the first year the Hunga Tonga&#8208;Hunga Ha'apai (HT&#8208;HH) volcanic aerosol entered the austral polar vortex.
