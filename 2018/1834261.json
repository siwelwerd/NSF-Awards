 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Ocean Observatory Initiative cabled array at Axial Volcano in the northeast Pacific provides an unprecedented opportunity to conduct long time-series seismic measurements in the deep seafloor environment, previously limited by the duration of autonomous ocean bottom seismograph deployment capabilities. On land, annual variations in crustal seismic velocities have been tied to seasonal changes in temperature, ground-water, or snow/ice pack. In the deep sea, no such seasonal variations should exist and yet recent observations at Axial Volcano using the cabled ocean bottom seismograph network find annual seismic velocity variations. This project will investigate the robustness of the deep sea observations by looking at seafloor cabled data from other nearby settings (e.g. Hydrate Ridge).  It is hypothesized that either there is a seasonal change in the characteristics of the noise source large enough to generate the observed velocity difference, or there is some geophysical process, such as crack opening, that is responding to annual forcings.  The results are likely to either demonstrate that current assumptions about seasonal variability in terrestrial observations need to be revisited, or that the crust may be deforming due to some external forcing such as annual solid earth tidal forces. Both have significant broader impacts for the field, and how ambient noise results might be interpreted. The project will also support one chapter of a graduate student's thesis.\r\n\r\nAmbient noise can be used to measure annual changes in geophysical properties through changes in seismic velocity. The correlation function of continuous ambient noise recorded at two seismometers is proportional to the Green's function of the medium between the two sensors. This can then be utilized to image the velocity structure of Earth's subsurface. Evidence for annual changes in velocity at Axial, which are consistent over 3 years of recording suggest that either there is a seasonal change in the characteristics of the noise source large enough to generate the observed velocity difference, or there is some geophysical process, such as crack opening, that is responding to annual forcings. This project will investigate both these options by looking at seafloor cabled data in other settings (e.g. Hydrate Ridge) to test the robustness of the observation, and by constraining the depth extent of the velocity changes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThere is increasing evidence for seasonal changes (also known as annual periodicity) in some large-scale geophysical process, and in particular changes in the seismic velocity of (the speed at which seismic waves travel through) Earth\u2019s upper crust.  On land these are attributed to seasonal changes in temperature, groundwater, or snow/ice-pack.  The deep seafloor provides a unique \u2018weather-free\u2019 environment in which to analyze other possible sources of annual variations in seismic velocity.\n\nOne way to consider annual changes in geophysical properties is to use ambient noise to measure changes in the seismic velocity.  Ambient noise is the general steady hum picked up by sensitive instruments around the world, and it can be studied to see if it travels more quickly or slowly through rocks at a given time. \n\nWe demonstrated that on the deep seafloor, despite seeing apparent seasonal changes in the velocity of the crust, these were most likely due to changes in direction and character of the noise sources generating the background hum.  For instance, if ocean waves from the storms hitting beaches on the other side of the ocean are generating this background hum of seismic noise, their frequency and direction might change with the seasons as storms increase in intensity from one hemisphere to another through-out the seasons.\n\nHowever, we also showed that the ambient noise measurements can detected longer-term trends in the seismicity velocity of an active volcano on the deep seafloor that seem to be changing in parallel with changes in earthquake activity and inflation of the volcano as it builds to its next eruption. For instance, as the volcano\u2019s magma chamber fills up with lava the volcano will inflate as measured by sensitive pressure instruments, and as it starts to push against pre-existing faults, earthquake activity will pick up.  At the same time the bulging up of the top of the volcano will cause cracks to open near the surface, letting in more water.
