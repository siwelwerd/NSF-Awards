 "awd_abstract_narration": "Software has bugs, quite commonly in libraries that are created by third-party developers.  Unfortunately, a bug in any library enables attackers to take control of an application.  Furthermore, since popular libraries are used across thousands of applications, these libraries become a high-leverage target for attackers.  This work improves the security of software by stopping bugs in one library from impacting other portions of the application.  This makes it much more difficult for attackers to compromise software and harm users.\r\n \r\nThis work builds a novel mechanism that can take legacy programs and convert them into a series of components that are isolated into different domains called cages. Cages are isolated from each other in a way that is similar to how operating system virtual machines are isolated. Each cage may have its own file system and network interface, and may handle system calls in a different manner. This includes the potential for blocking system calls that should not be needed by a cage, for example to disable the network interface in libraries that do not need it. This isolation also includes resource and performance isolation for a specific cage, preventing a malicious or buggy library from crashing or harming an application. The team is working to not only develop a research prototype for the effort, but also to use this work to secure large software projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project has explored a new technique for making software much more difficult to attack.  The basic idea is to automatically isolate portions of software from each other, so than an attacker compromising one part of a program, cannot easily harm another portion.  We discovered certain techniques that make memory accesses of a program much safer and faster to perform and are currently preparing a scientific publication on this matter. \n\n \n\nOur work has been successful in building a proof of concept implementation of the system that runs large, real world software.  This includes popular web servers and database software, which can now safely run together in a much faster way.  We were able to get good performance for our system.  In fact, in some cases running our security system is faster than not using it, due to the way in which we are able to prevent the switching cost of changing between programs while still isolating software. \n\n \n\nWhile this award has ended, this is not the end of this project for the project team.  We are continuing to develop the concepts in our implementation and improve them.  We have also started discussions with industry partners to explore how our research work can be piloted in product lines at different companies.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/19/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Justin Cappos"
