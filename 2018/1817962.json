The results may provide useful information for lessening environmental arsenic pollution. Other project outcomes could furnish useful information for the development of more effective herbicides and anti-infective drugs for farm animals and herbicide-resistance crops. The project involves the use of biochemical and genetics methods that examine the degradative pathways for organoarsenicals.  The project contributes to the education and research training of students. The project is performed at Florida International University which is a minority-serving urban public research institution in Miami. There are opportunities for broadening the exposure students of underrepresented groups to science.\r\n\r\nMethyl and aromatic arsenicals have been used as herbicides and anti-infective drugs respectively, for farm animals. These organoarsenicals are degraded into more toxic inorganic forms through microbial activities, leading to environmental pollution. Previously the Principal Investigator (PI) identified a novel organoarsenical degradation pathway that is composed of multiple steps catalyzed by a soil bacterial community. The PI further identified one novel gene involved in organoarsenical degradation and biochemically characterized the encoded enzyme. However, the pathways and molecular mechanisms of organoarsenical degradation are still largely unknown. The project employs combined approaches of genetics, analytical chemistry, biochemistry, microbiology, molecular and structural biology to identify and characterize major molecular components in the degradative pathways for environmental organoarsenicals. The knowledge obtained through this project may elucidate the ways that microbes change the environment through biotransformation of anthropogenic organoarsenicals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In the environment, arsenic mainly exists in inorganic forms (compounds lacking carbon), either trivalent arsenite (As(III), in low oxygen areas) or pentavalent arsenate (As(V), in high oxygen areas). Organic (carbon-containing) arsenic compounds, or organoarsenicals, also occur in the environment, both naturally and anthropogenically. Massive amounts of arsenic compounds have been utilized in agriculture in the United States for over a century. In particular, pentavalent organoarsenicals such as methylarsenate [MAs(V), Fig. 1a] and roxarsone [Rox(V), Fig. 1b] have been extensively used as herbicide and antimicrobial growth promoter for poultry in the last decades, because these compounds are relatively benign and much less toxic than inorganic arsenic compounds. Once introduced into the environment, however, those organoarsenicals are degraded into more toxic inorganic forms through microbial activities, which leads to environmental pollution.</p>\n<p>Previous reports of MAs(V) degradation proposed simple one-step pathways, where single organisms degrade MAs(V) to inorganic forms. In contrast, the results of this project demonstrate that the environmental situation is more complex, involving microbial communities with multi-step pathways. For MAs(V) herbicide degradation, the first step involves activation of benign MAs(V) to trivalent methylarsenite [MAs(III)] by one type of bacteria. Notably, MAs(III) is extremely toxic and even more toxic than inorganic forms. In the second step, another type of bacteria degrade activated MAs(III), transforming it into relatively less toxic inorganic As(III). it is clear that degradation of MAs(V) is the result of competition for survival among bacteria. In other words, bacteria wage &ldquo;arsenic warfare&rdquo;, where some microbes activate benign MAs(V) to extremely toxic MAs(III) and utilize them as antibiotics to kill off competitors &ndash; the first example of biological usage of arsenic as weapons for competitive dominance, whereas other members of the microbial community degrade activated MAs(III) into less toxic inorganic As(III) as an antibiotic resistance mechanism. Rox(V) is also degraded into inorganic forms by microbial communities via multiple step pathway, where the nitro group of Rox(V) is first converted to amino group, generating hydroxyaminophenylarsenate [HAPA(V)]. As with the case of MAs(V), HAPA(V) is decomposed to As(III) via a two-step process of activation [HAPA(V) to HAPA(III)] and degradation [HAPA(III) to As(III)].</p>\n<p>While there are a number of reports of microbial degradation of environmental organoarsenicals, molecular details are largely lacking. Indeed, this project has filled the knowledge gaps with the first molecular description of the degradative pathways for the agricultural organoarsenicals MAs(V) and Rox(V). The key reaction for degradation of organoarsenicals forms is carbon-arsenic (C-As) bond cleavage. The enzyme named &ldquo;ArsI&rdquo;, identified from an MAs(III)/HAPA(III)-degrading bacterial strain, is the only known enzyme that cleaves C-As bond, converting activated organoarsenicals to less toxic inorganic As(III). The project has elucidated the detailed molecular mechanism of this unique enzyme by characterizing the biochemical and enzymological properties, as well as by solving the protein crystal structures with different conformations in various conditions. Notably, ArsI has a unique flexible loop to capture MAs(III) (Fig. 2). The enzyme brings the MAs(III)-bound loop closer to its core part, where the enzyme cleaves the C-As bond of the MAs(III)/HAPA(III) by incorporating oxygen, degrading them to As(III). The project also identified a novel enzyme from a Rox(V)-activating bacterial strain. The project also identified another novel enzyme named MdaB, which is required for the 1<sup>st</sup> step of Rox(V) degradation, converting Rox(V) to HAPA(V). The mechanisms of actions of the MAs(III)/HAPA(III) antibiotic are not well known, especially for bacteria.

Novel enzymes identified and characterized by the project describe this new emerging area of organoarsenical biochemistry. Moreover, this work developed new methods to find novel enzymes involved in arsenic biotranformation.
