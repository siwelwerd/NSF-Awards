 "awd_abstract_narration": "An interactive scientific and educational workshop will be held at Masaya Volcano (Nicaragua) in February of 2019. The meeting will bring together graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and early career faculty to gain hands-on experience with collection, processing, and interpretation of ground- and satellite-based observations of volcanic processes, and will provide an immersive networking opportunity for students, early career faculty and international collaborators. The workshop will entail an initial (pre-workshop) deployment, ongoing field study during the workshop, lectures and presentations, and data analysis. A follow-up mini-workshop in the US will allow the workshop PIs to complete data analysis, integration, and publication. This workshop is the second in a planned series of innovative workshops involving targeted study of select open-vent volcanic systems.\r\n\r\nMasaya Volcano is the ideal locale for this workshop owing to the current presence of a dynamic and easily accessible lava lake. The volcanic activity is amenable to a range of geophysical data collection, including seismic, infrasonic, geodetic, optical, thermal, and ground-based UV and microwave sensing. It also presents an ideal opportunity the integration of remote sensing observations from satellite platforms (e.g., geodetic, gas, optical and thermal), with ground-based observations. The scientific program will focus on data acquisition, processing, and analysis techniques through hands-on demonstration and focused discussion. Novel scientific insights are expected from integration of diverse data sets.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
