Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to  John D. Berman is \" Algebraic foundations of equivariant homotopy theory\" The host institution for the fellowship is University of Texas at Austin, and the sponsoring scientist is Andrew Blumberg.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Over the duration of the project, trends in equivariant homotopy theory evolved substantially from a focus on finite group actions and applications to algebraic topology, towards circle group actions and applications to algebraic K-theory. Reflecting this change, the project emphasized the latter applications. The major results of the project concern topological Hochschild homology and its cyclotomic (circle equivariant) structure.

The results are expected to be useful in the study of algebraic K-theory of local fields and rings of integers, which have applications in algebraic number theory including to the 150 year old Kummer-Vandiver conjecture.
