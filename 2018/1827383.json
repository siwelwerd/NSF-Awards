 "awd_abstract_narration": "Overview:\r\nScripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) proposes to continue operating the research vessel Robert\r\nGordon Sproul to support NSF-funded scientific research for the five-year period 2018 -2022. Robert\r\nGordon Sproul is a capable, well-equipped general-purpose Coastal Class research vessel that is owned\r\nby the University of California and has been operated by SIO since the ship's introduction into the US\r\nAcademic Research Fleet in 1985. As a large shared-use facility scheduled within the collaborative\r\nframework of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS), Robert Gordon\r\nSproul will host scientists from across the United States to undertake research in a variety of disciplines.\r\nThe ship will be operated in a manner that promotes safety, capability and efficiency in order to\r\nmaximize NSF's investment in the ship and in programs that are conducted on board. SIO employs a\r\ndisciplined approach to vessel maintenance, regulatory compliance, foreign clearance, crewing and\r\nlogistics so that scientific missions can be completed successfully and on schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe observation, measurement, and collection of samples and data are accomplished on the US West\r\nCoast by scientific missions aboard Robert Gordon Sproul. SIO-operated ships have played a critical role\r\nin the exploration of our planet since 1907, and continue to contribute significantly to the U.S. ocean\r\nresearch effort. SIO's ship operations department supports NSF core values of scientific excellence,\r\norganizational excellence, learning, inclusiveness and accountability. The vessel management and\r\noperations proposed here enable transformative scientific research in physical and biological processes in\r\nthe natural environment upon which human well-being depends. The intellectual merit of this proposal is\r\namplified by the combined merit of research projects undertaken by scientists on board. Robert Gordon\r\nSproul is currently scheduled to conduct three different NSF-sponsored programs in 2018 in benthic\r\necology, ocean chemistry, paleoceanography, marine ecology, and ocean instrument research and\r\ndevelopment. Each scientific program contributes its own distinctive intellectual merit. NSF-sponsored\r\nprojects as currently scheduled will account for 20% (10 days) of Robert Gordon Sproul's work this year.\r\nThe remainder of the work will be supported by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (28 days, 54%),\r\nthe Navy (12 days, 24 %), and NOAA (1 day, 2%).\r\n\r\nSIO's management of Robert Gordon Sproul enables research, education and training that advance\r\ndiscovery and understanding while achieving far-reaching broader impacts. The proposed management\r\nsupports strongly collaborative, multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional use of the vessel. Through\r\nUNOLS, SIO coordinates the shared use of Robert Gordon Sproul with scientists and funding agencies so\r\nshipboard capabilities meet the current and anticipated needs of the community. SIO is committed to\r\npromoting a climate of fairness, cooperation, and professionalism on board that embraces diversity,\r\nequity, and inclusion as essential ingredients of discovery, technical development, and learning. SIO's\r\noperation of Robert Gordon Sproul leverages institutional programs that complement NSF's mission to\r\npromote achievement and progress in science, engineering and education for the benefit of the nation. For\r\nexample, SIO's UC Ship Funds Program enables graduate and undergraduate students, postdoctoral\r\nresearchers and early career faculty to pursue independent research and instruction aboard Robert Gordon\r\nSproul via an internal peer-reviewed competitive process for ship time. The vessel is integral to SIO's K-\r\n12 education program.  In the Footsteps of Robert Gordon Sproul, which uses oceanography to teach\r\nphysical science to economically disadvantaged seventh- and eighth-grade students. As a broadly subscribed\r\nshared-use facility, Robert Gordon Sproul similarly contributes to the education, training and\r\noutreach missions of scientists from institutions across America who conduct their research and\r\neducational programs on board. As proposed here, Robert Gordon Sproul will continue to serve NSF by\r\nsafely, capably and efficiently facilitating multi-disciplinary scientific research to advance our\r\nunderstanding of our oceans and Earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Statement of Merit Review\r\n This proposal supports peer-reviewed science through NSF evaluation process.  The renewal of this cooperative agreement included an external review panel.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
