 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds student and speaker travel to a workshop that brings together researchers from the computer vision and the privacy and security communities: The Second International Workshop on Bright and Dark Sides of Computer Vision: Challenges and Opportunities for Privacy and Security.  Computer vision is increasingly practical and useful in computational systems and has both strong potential benefits and risks for individuals' privacy and security.  The workshop brings together privacy, security, and computer vision experts to discuss how to better understand the potential threats of computer vision to people's security and privacy, as well as the potential opportunities and applications for enhancing them. \r\n\r\nProviding these travel awards will support a high quality workshop in emerging research areas of computer security and computer vision by increasing and broadening the pool of participants who will be able to attend.  In particular, the workshop organizers will work to include students from historically underrepresented groups in computing.  The impact will not only be on the students who are supported directly by the grants, but also on other participants, who will benefit from the increased diversity of voices that the award will enable.  Increased attendance also helps improve networking, idea exchange, and partnerships for all attendees of the workshop.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
