 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Arctic Research Consortium of the U.S. (ARCUS) will administer and implement, \"Teachers and Researchers Exploring and Collaborating (PolarTREC)\", a program that selects U.S. teachers and informal educators and prepares them to participate in cutting-edge field research with polar scientists in various, and often remote, locations in the Arctic and Antarctica. Through hands-on field experiences, participating teachers (pre-service and in-service) and informal educators will improve teaching strategies, develop resources for their careers, and change how they teach STEM in the classroom and to the public. The project's goal is to invigorate polar science education and understanding by bringing educators and polar researchers together in professional collaboration. By integrating research and education, PolarTREC will help sustain and grow the considerable scientific and public enthusiasm for polar research and education. \r\n\r\nTwelve teachers or informal educators will be  recruited, selected, and matched with polar researchers. ARCUS will maintain a website for dissemination of information about the expeditions, provide orientation training for the teachers that includes field safety and communication training, provide travel support for the teachers to meet with scientists prior to deployments and for them to join the scientific expeditions in the field. Participants in the TRE will not only increase their knowledge of polar science and effective teaching practices, but also will develop long-term collaborative professional relationships with polar researchers and become part of an ever-growing educator network.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The polar regions create a unique opportunity to get people excited about science as well as bring educators and polar researchers together in professional collaboration.</p>\n<p>The framework of this program stem from past NSF investments to ARCUS. In prior iterations of the program, the activities focused formal classroom teachers. For 2018, the goal was to expand the research opportunities to include both formal teachers (classroom) and informal educators (outside the classroom) with the idea of reaching out to new audiences.</p>\n<p>In 2018, a total of eight U.S. middle and high school teachers and four U.S informal science educators were placed with 12 polar focused research teams. The educators were located in both the Arctic (spring/summer) and Antarctic (fall/winter) and their experiences varied in duration from three to six weeks (<a href=\"https://www.polartrec.com/expeditions\">https://www.polartrec.com/expeditions</a>). By the end of 2018, we ended up having two Antarctica expeditions delayed for one season due to unforeseen circumstances.<em> </em>And, we added another expedition in 2019 with an informal science educator, deployed as part of the MOSAiC international science expedition. The selected teachers were from around the U.S. and taught at a variety of school settings, including urban, rural, public and private schools.The research they participated in was very also varied and ranged from studying sea birds in the Bering Sea, Alaska to gathering data from the Automated Weather Stations in Antarctica.</p>\n<p>Communicating science and making it accessible to \"all\" can be challenging in remote settings. To help share the experience, the PolarTREC website (<a href=\"../research-portal/exit.jsp?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.polartrec.com\">www.polartrec.com</a>) is designed to share information as well as assist the educators in their professional development and outreach activities. Each research expedition has its own page that includes journals written by the educators for their audiences, photos, comments, and links to resources created by the educators (e.g. lesson plans, video series, webinars). Additionally, there is a back side to the website for the program participants which includes training modules, additional resources, and planning tools related to their professional development. All the program participants were trained at an in-person orientation held in Fairbanks, Alaska. The training included program expectations, education and outreach planning, field safety, and communication training. Travel support was provided to the educators that shared their experiences at science and education conferences after their expedition.</p>\n<p>Despite the challenges of remote communications, these educators were successful in their outreach activities and wrote up their experiences in STEM Experience Reports (<a href=\"https://www.polartrec.com/resources/expedition-reports\">https://www.polartrec.com/resources/expedition-reports</a>) as well as producing lessons or products related to their expeditions. These are FREE resources and searchable here:<a href=\"https://www.polartrec.com/resources\">https://www.polartrec.com/resources</a>.</p>\n<p>Although evaluation data was not collected during this award, data collected in prior awards has shown that teachers significantly increased their own content knowledge of the polar regions as well as significantly increased their confidence in their ability to use inquiry science practices and their actual use of inquiry practices with their students. For 2018, there was anecdotal evidence that field experience did impact both the formal classroom educators and the informal educators. Below are quotes taken from two 2018 STEM Experience Reports:</p>\n<p><em>\"I'm surprised at how many angles I find myself integrating into my curriculum already from this experience. It has become so much more than seabirds.

This make shift virtual scientific community rallied behind me and the team as we continued our grueling daily treks into the mountains. I even witnessed the self-proclaimed ?bad at science? individuals asking pointed questions and wanting to know more about the science and geology of our expedition and the study area.\"</em> ? Lauren Neitzke Adamo (informal educator)</p>\n<p>In summary, <em>STEM at the Poles</em> participants had successful experiences.
