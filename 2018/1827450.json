 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will improve understanding of the influence of forest emissions on the production of ozone in the atmosphere.  Currently, atmospheric chemistry models tend to overpredict the concentration of ozone in forested environments.  Atmospheric radicals, such as the hydroxyl radical (OH), play an important role in the chemistry of the atmosphere and in the production of ozone.  This project includes additional measurements and modeling of atmospheric radicals to improve the understanding of atmospheric chemistry and for improving models that predict the production of ozone and fine particulates in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe following questions regarding the measurement and modeling of HOx radicals in forested environments will be addressed: (1) What is the source of the interference associated with measurements of OH radical concentrations in forest environments and can it be minimized? (2) How well do we understand the sources, sinks, and recycling of HOx radicals in forest environments? and (3) How does below canopy radical chemistry and transport impact the above canopy environment?\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
