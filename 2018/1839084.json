 "awd_abstract_narration": "On the Sun, solar flares release magnetic energy very quickly using a process called magnetic reconnection.  This grant will develop and use a method of studying the magnetic reconnection driving a solar flare.  The investigators will simulate solar flares powered by magnetic reconnection, and test the reality of these simulations against measurements made by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) spacecraft now studying the Sun. The new method they develop will be ready to analyze observations of the solar chromosphere made at much greater resolutions by the new Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) when it begins operation.  This project supports the mission of the NSF by promoting our understanding of magnetic field structure and activity at the Sun.  The research will contribute to the doctoral thesis of a physics graduate student supervised directly by the investigators.\r\n\r\nThe investigators will measure the reconnection characteristics indirectly, using spectroscopic observations of the solar transition region and chromosphere, where high spatial resolution and rapid time cadences are possible, using far ultraviolet measurements made by the IRIS spacecraft. They will develop numerical simulations of flaring loops energized by reconnection to compute the downward flows generated in the transition region and chromosphere. They will then test and calibrate these computations using existing spectroscopic observations of flare ribbons made by IRIS.  Future observations using the DKIST Visible Spectropolarimeter and the Visible Tunable Filter instruments each measure different lines of Ca II which, in flare ribbons, will contain information about the energy release by flare reconnection.  The calibrated model will be used with these data to measure solar flare magnetic reconnection at the smallest scales yet resolved.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSolar flares release stored magnetic energy high above the Sun's visible surface in the outer corona.  The release of this energy heats the material to temperatures of tens of million degrees, causing it to emit light in wavelengths like X-rays, that cannot be seen from Earth's surface.  Even when it is observed by spacecraft telescopes, X-rays cannot be observed in sufficient detail to reveal the small-scale structures we expect of the energy release.  Our research has attempted to identify signatures of large solar flares found in the lower, cooler layers of the solar atmosphere, which can be studied in exquisite detail and can be observed from the ground.  Energy from the flare reaches the cool, lower atmosphere, when it creates a sudden, brief downward recoil of the material there.  We have succeeded in showing that the velocity of this recoil can be mathematically related to the energy released by the flare in the corona.  We have found, however, that only about one third of the regions experiencing energy release exhibit these signatures.  The regions that do show a recoil are, however, far more extended than we had expected.  We now believe that energy follows a path from high to low, that is more complicated than we had originally expected.  This causes it to spread out in one direction, but thin down in another.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/19/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dana Longcope"
