 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project addresses the fundamental science associated with surface deformations induced by laser shock peening (LSP), and their use to improve the stress corrosion cracking (SCC) resistance of metallic components in addition to LSP's well-known effect on fatigue life. SCC is a phenomenon where the combination of a tensile load in a corrosive environment causes premature failure. This failure is often sudden, catastrophic and occurs at loading levels far below a material's yield strength, making it difficult to predict.  Depending on the material and environment, SCC can occur through different mechanisms, thus there is a need to identify mitigation approaches. Shockwaves generated on the surface using LSP impart compressive residual stresses, without thermal effects, and have traditionally been used to improve the material's fatigue life. They also induce other changes at the microstructural level, which may help mitigate SCC concurrently. Improving material performance will enhance the capability of existing technologies, potentially by allowing them to operate at higher tensile loads for longer times. In addition, the surface treatment methodology can be applied to different materials and geometric configurations, thus providing effective solutions for many industries ranging from nuclear reactors to oil production to medical devices. As such, the research has significant breadth and directly and positively impacts economic welfare and national security. By networking with minority groups such as National Society of Black Engineers, underrepresented students will be recruited. High school students and STEM teachers from neighborhood schools in northern Manhattan and the Bronx will be engaged in an innovative combination of \"reach out\" and \"let in\" activities.\r\n\r\nThis project will set forth the mechanisms that allow deformation processes to have stress corrosion cracking (SCC) mitigation benefits. Fundamental understanding of the interaction between the shockwave-induced microstructural changes and the SCC pathways will be developed. Hydrogen has been identified as a major component driving SCC, and thus entry of hydrogen into the surface and propagation of absorbed hydrogen within the lattice will be better understood. Movement of mobile dislocations can contribute to crack propagation.  Both of these components will be influenced by dislocation cell structures formed during shockwave processing. In addition, the electrochemical effects of the deformation process on SCC and their mitigation will be studies in a fundamental approach. Finally the project will perform scientific investigation into the balance between LSP's effect on fatigue life and SCC resistance.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The impact of such microstructure changes on SCC resistance is material-dependent and not well-understood. Besides the competing effects of compressive stress and dislocation generation, dezincification was identified as a contributor to SCC specifically in brasses. After LSP&nbsp;treatment, two-phase brass 280 samples were investigated in U-bend tests. Figure 1 shows that the LSP treated sample developed significantly shallower and narrower stress corrosion cracks than the untreated sample.&nbsp;&nbsp;To further characterize changes from LSP, sample cross-sections were observed to measure the dezincification layer thickness. EDS line scans in the depth direction along the sample normal confirmed strong dezincification in the film (Figure 2).&nbsp;&nbsp;The average of at least 16 thickness measurements of typical dezincification features in the LSP treated region was 5.33?0.13 ?m, which is 24% thinner than 7.06?0.18 ?m found in the untreated region.

Grain morphologies and irregular dislocation distribution resulting from crystallization schemes that occur during printing cause anisotropic mechanical properties in additively manufactured metal. Tension-compression asymmetry caused by back stress has been observed as one of these anisotropic properties. Such asymmetry complicates application of 3D-printed metal for mechanical design because 3D-printed parts will behave differently than traditionally manufactured parts under the same loading conditions. While heat treatments such as annealing and hot-isostatic pressing are shown to eliminate back stress, they do not also impart additional beneficial properties such as compressive residual stress. Hysteresis tensile testing measures the back stress from additively manufactured dog bone samples. Both LSPed and as-built conditions are tested and compared, showing that LSPed samples exhibit a reduction to back stress that varies for differing build directions. Electron backscatter diffraction performed under these conditions elucidates how grain morphologies and texture contribute to the observed improvement in back stress (Figure 5). Crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) modelling develops insights as to the mechanisms by which this reduction is achieved in comparison with EBSD results. In particular, the difference in plastic behavior across build orientations of identified crystal planes and grain families are shown to impact the degree of LSP-induced back stress reduction that is sustained through tensile loading (Figure 6).
