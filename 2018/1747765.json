 "awd_abstract_narration": "The U.S. Government, academia, domestic industry and the public increasingly acknowledge the imperative that we conserve energy and natural resources while exercising judicious stewardship of the environment. The issue of sustainability is and should be paramount in how we design, manufacture, use, and retire the many products consumed within the United States and throughout the world. Unlike solar or wind energy that can be cost effectively harnessed for a long time or agricultural products as a natural resource, inorganic materials, such as metals and minerals, are not renewable. Therefore, the need exists for the development of technologies to address materials recovery and recycling. Although considerable coordinated academic research is rightly underway to meet energy challenges, university efforts to build the basic science and technologies for materials sustainability are less extensive and fragmented despite the prospect for significant energy and environmental ramifications. Research supporting materials recovery and recyclability is inherently multidisciplinary and must respond to the needs of a multiplicity of commercial stakeholders from throughout the supply chain. CR3 brings together four leading universities with expertise in materials science and engineering. The industrial application of new advanced materials will require an increase in the efficiency of materials resource recovery and recycling to achieve a circular economy\r\n\r\nThe advanced manufacturing technologies that are available today do not have a natural route to implementation in industry. CR3 brings together key constituencies in the resource recovery and recycling area to develop comprehensive technology transfer pathways to industry. The primary focus of CR3 is on key sectors of iron and steel, non-ferrous structural metals, light metals, rare-earths, energy materials and photovoltaic metals, high value refractory metals and electronic materials. Technology development addresses the product manufacturing wastes, post-consumer wastes, instrumentation, sensors and controls, design for disassembly and conversion of trash to treasure. There are a number of key industry challenges in the area of resource recovery and recycling: specifically, scarcity of feed stock materials and increasing cost of material resources, increasing amounts of waste from industrial processes as well as end-of-life products, need for solutions for resource recovery, reuse, and recycling of critical materials, need for energetically favorable, environmentally compatible and economically viable industrial processes. These challenges are addressed by CR3 through the development of physical and chemical processes for secondary resource sortation, beneficiation and concentration, as well as value-extraction. Recycling technologies have widespread applications affecting all materials manufacturing, including, metals, plastics, paper, electronics, glass, organics, polymers & chemicals, etc.",

The sustainability can be increased by replacing OPC with an Fe-rich slag, which originates from the metallurgical industry and is nowadays used for low-value applications. This project investigated the effect of several components in the hybrid mixture on the early-age stiffness development, late-age shrinkage, creep and mechanical strength as compared to a commercial OPC-based 3D printable mortar.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Project: Recovery of Valuable Metals from Flue Dust and Other Fines from Mechanical Treatment of E-Scrap</strong></p>\n<p>A flue dust is generated during the smelting process of e-waste.

Four types of flue dust were investigated as a potential metal resource to obtain valuable metals which included gold, silver, copper and iron.&nbsp; Experiments of combining samples for effective recovery based on the content of Au, Ag, Cu and Fe were conducted. &nbsp;Based on project research, it was concluded that leaching and electrolytic experiments can be used for economic recovery of Au, Ag and Cu.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Project: Recycling of Waterborne Paint Sludge</strong></p>\n<p>Automotive paint sludge is considered a nuisance and hazardous waste material within the automotive industry around the world.

The paint sludge was used as a binder for iron ore pellets, typically used for iron and steelmaking. The development of this type of recycling application conducted during the project was aided by a review of different binders used in iron ore pellets, as well as the various techniques used to recycle automotive paint sludge materials. &nbsp;It was concluded that iron ore pellet made with paint sludge material were capable of withstanding typical transportation and handling used in the iron and steelmaking industries (see Figure 2).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Project: Separation of Eu and Y from Phosphor Dust</strong></p>\n<p>The purpose of this project was to produce europium and yttrium oxide from waste fluorescent lamp powder. &nbsp;Europium and yttrium are critical materials required for LED, florescent lamp, cell phone screen, and flat panel display production.

The scope of this project included all the steps required to scale up this initial work to produce the mixed rare earth oxide?91% pure europium and yttrium oxide.
