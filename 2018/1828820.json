 "awd_abstract_narration": "Innovations in agricultural biotechnology may fulfill biotechnology's longstanding promise to help feed the world's growing population while preserving ecosystem integrity. Yet past experience suggests that paths from technological innovation to improved sustainability and productivity entail considerable complexity and uncertainty. Meeting challenges of improving food, energy and water (FEW) systems requires the integration of knowledge from a number of natural sciences as well as from social, political, and ethical domains. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to North Carolina State University will provide graduate students who are enrolled in diverse natural and social science masters and PhD programs with the interdisciplinary knowledge and approaches needed to help forge futures where agricultural biotechnology applications enhance FEW systems while minimizing unintended consequences. In all, the AgBioFEWS program will train at least sixty-two (62) masters and PhD students, including twenty-two (22) funded PhD students, from biological, agricultural, and social sciences. The traineeship program will partner with two historically black universities, offering internships to their students, and will establish a path for these students to join the NRT program. Continuous interaction with experts from industry, government, and non-profit agencies will expose students to diverse career paths. \r\n\r\nFor a new generation of students to contribute to development and utilization of agricultural biotechnology in ways that enhance FEW systems, they must be able to integrate knowledge and uncertainties from diverse, sophisticated fields of study; understand how facts and values influence decision-making; and establish their trustworthiness through evidence-based engagement with diverse communities. Tapping into North Carolina State's extension network, AgBioFEWS trainees will begin their programs living together in a small farming community situated in an ecologically fragile landscape. They will receive hands-on learning from farmers, extension agents, conservationists, and other public stakeholders in rural North Carolina. This experience is also designed to build team cohesiveness. Subsequent coursework and activities will expand student perspectives on agricultural biotechnology and FEW systems to national and international scales. AgBioFEWS course offerings will be integrated into an established graduate minor in Genetic Engineering and Society and an emerging minor in Public Science. The courses will address techniques of genetic engineering, agriculture, policy analysis, science communication, and other topics needed to prepare students for careers in government, industry, international development, and academia. All AgBioFEWS trainees will participate in an interdisciplinary team project under the direction of 2-3 faculty members, and doctoral trainees are expected to incorporate interdisciplinary agricultural biotechnology and FEW systems into their dissertations. Major research efforts range from investigating the impact of current biotechnology products on FEW socio-ecological systems to the development of potential future products. \r\n\r\nThe NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This results in a tendency for biotechnology graduate training to become narrowly focused. At the same time, in other parts of campus, graduate students in the social sciences and humanities are being trained to evaluate emerging technologies such as biotechnology with little personal connection to the people who are developing and using these technologies.</p>\r\n<p>Our training program was designed to bring together graduate students and faculty from diverse natural and social science disciplines to develop a broad understanding of agricultural biotechnologies and related policy options, so that the potential positive effects of the overall technology could be enhanced while minimizing risks. One thrust in this training has been productive engagement with the public and policymakers.</p>\r\n<p>Students in the three successive cohorts of our program have come from PhD programs as diverse as Genetics and Genomics, Crop Science, Economics, Public Administration, and Communication. To accomplish our goals within the two-year training program, we started each cohort with a summer field experience where they spent two-weeks embedded in an agricultural community in Eastern North Carolina. The students met with a diversity of farmers, agricultural researchers, extension agents, seed producers, farm loan officers, private crop consultants and environmental groups. This experience has given students a deep appreciation for the real-world context into which new biotechnologies are integrated. It also has served to give students an introduction to each other&rsquo;s disciplines and how they all can contribute to the appropriate development and use of agricultural biotechnologies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In their first Fall semester, all of the students took a 3-credit, Genetics and Genomics course. This is a challenging course for the social science students, but also for natural science students who don&rsquo;t have a background in genetics. Over the three times that the course was offered, the instructors found better ways to make the course accessible and useful to all of the students. In each cohort, those students with the best genetics backgrounds served as peer mentors for the other students.</p>\r\n<p>In their first Spring semester, students participated in a 3-credit course titled &ldquo;Emerging Technologies and Society&rdquo;. This course provided frameworks for understanding emerging technologies and their social, political, and cultural contexts. It presented historical and current case studies that introduce students to diverse ways of thinking about science, technology and society. It is here that our humanities and social sciences PhD students helped the natural science students understand the nuances of qualitative and quantitative social science research and the theoretical contexts in which they are imbedded. Students worked together on a class project.</p>\r\n<p>The final formal course was on systems thinking and modeling. The goal of this course was to bring together all of the training to this point in a way that has the students broaden their reach in understanding the interacting components of agricultural systems and how to anticipate the complex biological and societal factors that can determine the positive, neutral and negative impacts of biotechnologies from multiple perspectives. This course leads into students working as a team on a specific issue that is at the interface of biotechnology and society. Each of the cohort projects resulted in a peer-reviewed publication, with other publications still to come.</p>\r\n<p>Throughout their time with the program, students are obligated to participate in a weekly colloquium that is administered by the Genetic Engineering and Society Center. Each session has a local or outside speaker give a presentation followed by discussions. The speakers come from academia, industry, government and NGOs. This gives students first-hand interactions with people who bring diverse expertise and perspectives to agricultural biotechnology.</p>\r\n<p>Beyond the cohorts of students who have a funded, specific program that results in them receiving a minor in &ldquo;Genetic Engineering and Society&rdquo;, the colloquium and NRT courses are open to all students at NC State. Some of the cohort students have completed their PhDs and have gone on to jobs in academia and industry.</p>\r\n<p>Even as the NRT funding has ended, the minor is in place with University funding supporting a 1-year program. We are also proud that NC State just received funding for a new NRT graduate training program that pulls together students in data sciences and plant sciences. Importantly, the new NRT will have its students participate in the field experience that was designed and fine-tuned by our past NRT.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/08/2024<br>\nModified by: Fred&nbsp;L&nbsp;Gould</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1828820/1828820_10574600_1733677226222_IMG_5897--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1828820/1828820_10574600_1733677226222_IMG_5897--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Interaction of genetic engineering and drought\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1828820/1828820_10574600_1733677226222_IMG_5897--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Interaction of genetic engineering and drought\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students got a demonstration of the complexity of field experiments designed to test the interaction of different corn varieties with soil conditions.
