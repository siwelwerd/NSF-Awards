 "awd_abstract_narration": "Data intelligence research on turning data into actionable intelligence and insights is at the heart of many disciplines, including computer science, mathematics, chemistry, business, and biology. This research instrumentation project involves the acquisition of a mass storage system to enhance the storage capacity of a High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster.  This will enable researchers at the awardee and neighboring institutions to conduct studies in: scalable computational algorithms for big data analysis; finding answers to customized questions by reasoning over large-scale unstructured data; the development of deep learning techniques for two- and three-dimensional biological and medical image analysis; and other big data research challenges.   The instrumentation also creates an opportunity for students to participate in a variety of research and training activities related to data intelligence.\r\n\r\nThe project provides better storage capacity to process and share massive data. The system enables data intelligence research and training activities by providing flexible storage configurations, data preservation and recovery, high-performance, large-scale data operations, and secure data sharing for a broad range of projects. It supports collaboration across various universities in California, and enables faculty and students to develop modern scalable solutions to data intelligence problems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
