 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is now well-established that the microbiome (the community of microbial species associated with a host organism) can increase host nutrient acquisition and protect against disease. Even so, which communities of bacteria will provide positive outcomes for their hosts cannot be reliably predicted. In large part, this is because there are seemingly infinite configurations of \"healthy\" microbiomes, making analysis of natural patterns difficult. Moreover, understanding of microbiome function is currently hampered by the complexity of host-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions underlying these positive outcomes.  Despite this complexity, however, recent research suggests that general principles underlying microbiome-mediated protection against pathogen establishment and disease may be identifiable. The combination of new sequencing technologies and the development of new experimental systems presents a unique opportunity to begin disentangling the interactions between the microbiome and disease, and to examine the generality of microbiome-mediated protection across different host species. A starting point for such an undertaking focuses on a broad host range pathogen, for which evidence of microbiome-mediated protection currently exists across multiple hosts. Using two different plant-microbiome-pathogen systems (one with direct relevance to forestry management and the other to agriculture) as proof of concept, the current work aims to build a predictive framework for identifying microbial consortia that synergize with the host immune system to protect against disease. \r\n\r\nBuilding upon existing data from Bleeding Canker disease of Horse Chestnut trees and Bacterial Speck of Tomato plants, both of which are caused by pathovars of the bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae, this project will test the idea that there are general rules underlying microbiome-mediated protection that are applicable across systems. In each of these two systems, previous evidence has linked the diversity and composition of the phyllosphere (above ground) microbiome to pathogen colonization success and/or plant disease outcome. This project will use culture-independent sequencing data from the natural tree system to generate predictions about microbiome-mediated disease protection based on microbiome composition, diversity, and/or function. These predictions will then be tested using synthetic microbiomes in tomato plants, where the relative contributions of direct (microbe-microbe) and indirect (plant-mediated) effects in shaping microbiome-mediated protection can be experimentally quantified. By combining high-throughput seedling priming assays with a synthetic microbiome approach, the project seeks to identify disease protective community properties that synergize with plant defenses. The general principles of microbiome-mediated protection that this project seeks to uncover have the potential to be broadly applicable across systems, and inform predictions about protective microbial communities in human health and agriculture. The ultimate goal of the work is to be able to leverage these host-microbiome-pathogen interactions to attain robust and durable disease protection, and the results will aid in management of both agricultural and natural systems, and the development of probiotic treatment against plant disease.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In this project, we used a combination of metabolic profiling, modeling, and empirical testing in the greenhouse and field to identify microbial consortia that synergize with the host immune system to protect against disease. Specifically, we developed a synthetic phyllosphere microbiome of Tomato (PhylloStart), for which each member has been whole-genome sequenced and profiled for growth on the plant and metabolic breadth in vitro, in order to generate and test predictions about microbiome-mediated protection against disease. We found that the 16 members of PhylloStart differ in their growth across carbon sources in a way that gives each a highly distinguishable phenotype, and that these data can predict how disease-protective each member should be against the bacterial pathogen, <em>Pseudomonas syringae</em>. Using consumer-resource modeling, we developed and tested a number of predictions regarding how niche overlap should allow identification of particular disease-protective microbial taxa and consortia. We then used a series of in vitro and in planta experiments to demonstrate that PhylloStart confers disease protection in both Tomato and Arabidopsis plants, and that the genetics of the plant (in particular ploidy level) alter how reliant the host is on the microbiome for this function. Specifically, we found interacting impacts of ploidy and the microbiome on disease outcome. We confirm that polyploids are generally more resistant to pathogens, but illustrate that this resistance may be in part due to a decrease in the reliance on beneficial bacteria. We then used RNA sequencing to show that diploids have many more differentially expressed defense-related genes in the presence of their phyllosphere microbiota, while polyploids exhibit constitutively activated defenses regardless of exposure to the synthetic community. Finally, we found that PhylloStart members successfully colonize the tomato phyllosphere and, in doing so, increase the production of tomato fruits in the greenhouse.

When compared to field grown plants treated in the same way (i.e. spayed pre-transplantation with PhylloStart), we further determine that the benefits of this application are likely specific to the greenhouse setting, as microbiome diversity can rapidly expand under natural field conditions but continues to be limited over the lifetime of greenhouse-grown plants. This finding lead to further examination of health benefits as a result of phyllosphere probiotic application and a patent application aimed at commercializing this disease-protective and growth-promoting consortia.
