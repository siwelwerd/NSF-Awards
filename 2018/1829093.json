 "awd_abstract_narration": "As droughts, floods, and wildfires increase in frequency, intensity, and devastation, new emphasis must be placed on understanding the climate system of the American West.  This project will study sediments from the Mono Basin, the most important water source for California.  Located in the eastern Sierra Nevada, Mono Lake is highly sensitive to changes in the amount of precipitation falling in the region. The project will develop well-dated lake data to compare with climate models for the last ~16,000 years to study the mechanisms that control environmental change.  In addition, the project will produce methodological improvements in sediment-dating techniques, produce virtual tours for the Flyover Country mobile phone app and develop educational materials for national park and community groups. The project also will use project datasets in hands-on STEM training for undergraduate and graduate students and high school teachers. \r\n\r\nWell-dated lake sediment cores provide one of the few terrestrial archives available to extend the record of climate change in the American West into the early Holocene and terminal Pleistocene. Interpretation of geochemical, sedimentological, and paleobiological proxy records from Mono Lake cores will provide continuous records of lake level and productivity that are tied to absolute lake levels available from paleo-shorelines. A sub-centennial-precision age model for the records will allow accurate and precise correlation of terrestrial climate conditions in the West to global records for the first time. This will shed light on the mechanisms controlling Western climate between the waning of the great continental ice sheets and the droughts and pluvials of the last 2000 years, which have been examined in detail in tree-ring records.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Snowmelt from the Sierra Nevada is crucial for California&rsquo;s water supply, which provides a pillar of the state&rsquo;s economy and the health and well-being of its vast population. Two long sediment cores were extracted from Mono Lake, one of America&rsquo;s oldest and most iconic lake basins, which sits in a tectonic depression (the Mono Basin) on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada.&nbsp; Core sediments were investigated using multiple biological proxies, high-resolution geochemical sampling (scanning &mu;XRF) and novel thin section analysis, to constrain patterns and processes of deposition with sufficient detail to support interpretations of environmental change. The project developed highly detailed stratigraphic and geochronological information for both cores, using radiocarbon applied to plant macrofossils, charcoal, and pollen purified by flow cytometry, and via development of the tephra chronology database for this region.&nbsp; Together, the cores span the last ~16,000 years, and record both shallow and deep-water information on past climate and ecosystem dynamics; these data provide a rare opportunity for comparison with well-dated paleoshorelines that form rings around the extant lake.&nbsp; The deepwater core was a focal point for paleolimnological and paleoecological study; pollen, spores, charcoal, diatoms, and ostracod microfossils were successfully separated from the sediments, identified to the species level using microscopy, and enumerated using statistical tools.&nbsp; These data illustrate how both the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems shifted in response to changes in temperature and precipitation in the Late Quaternary, and provided evidence for a connection between climate variability at high latitude (e.g., the North Atlantic) and ecosystem changes in the Mono Basin.&nbsp; Ongoing research on ostracod shell geochemistry, bulk sediment chemistry, and biomarkers show promise for refining our understanding of paleohydrology and quantifying temperature and precipitation changes.&nbsp; The project has supported two doctoral students, one M.S. student, and several undergraduate researchers. Further, project personnel have built a lasting connection with the non-profit Mono Lake Committee that is working to protect and restore the Mono Lake ecosystem.&nbsp; Project sediment cores are preserved at the Continental Scientific Drilling Facility and will serve as a publicly accessible archive of environmental information that can be leveraged in future research. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/06/2023<br>\nModified by: Michael&nbsp;Mcglue</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1829093/1829093_10569136_1699286380224_Coring_Platform_Mono_Lake--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1829093/1829093_10569136_1699286380224_Coring_Platform_Mono_Lake--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Coring Mono Lake\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1829093/1829093_10569136_1699286380224_Coring_Platform_Mono_Lake--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Coring Mono Lake\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Construction of a percussion piston coring platform on the shores of Mono Lake.
