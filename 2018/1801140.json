 "awd_abstract_narration": "Instrumentation and controls technicians are important in the nation's advanced manufacturing industry. These technicians troubleshoot and repair components of production lines that keep manufacturing processes running smoothly. Currently, industries in Northeast Florida face a shortage of skilled instrumentation and controls technicians. This problem is exacerbated by the predicted turnover of approximately one third of the manufacturing workforce over the next five years because of retirements. Advanced manufacturing industries regularly redesign and streamline production lines, including increasing the use of automated processes. As a result, there is an ongoing expansion of the skills that instrumentation and control technicians need to do their jobs. To address this need, Florida State College at Jacksonville (Florida) will develop a new Instrumentation and Controls concentration for its existing Associate of Science degree in Engineering Technology. The project team will work closely with industry partners to: modify the curriculum; obtain industry-standard equipment for laboratory exercises; and provide problem-based, hands-on learning experiences for students. The project will examine and contribute to what is known about hands-on instrumentation training, support effective strategies for recruiting underrepresented students to the instrumentation and controls field, and help fill the critical need for these technicians in Northeast Florida.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop and modify five courses to create a concentration in Instrumentation and Controls for the existing associate degree program. The courses will include hands-on simulation laboratory activities that engage students in the types of processes they will encounter on the job. The activities will give students access to new technologies, and increased practice to master essential industrial instrumentation skills. Authentication assessments and proper procedures for handling sensors and instrumentation will be central components of the curricular modifications. Laboratory tasks will emphasize the development of skills required to manage, operate, calibrate, and troubleshoot equipment. These tasks will also focus on enhancing knowledge associated with experimental, quality, and safety procedures. The project will foster technician skills training using a developmental curriculum that includes embedded and stacked credentials. Students' self-efficacy, sense of belonging, and career awareness related to advanced manufacturing will be measured. The result will be used to document the impact of the courses and lab activities on student learning and preparation for the workforce. Outreach activities will be conducted with area high schools to promote awareness of and career interest in instrumentation and controls technology. The project will emphasize involvement of students from underrepresented and underserved populations, to encourage diversity of the workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
