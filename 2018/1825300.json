 "awd_abstract_narration": "Graphene and other atomically thin, two-dimensional layered materials can be used as surface additives to tailor the mechanical properties of materials, despite their extreme thinness. For example, coating the surface of a metal with single layer of graphene can effectively stiffen and strengthen the underlying material, as well as enable unusual friction and wear properties. The organized stacking of a graphene layer on another surface, each having different atomic arrangements, results in what is called a heterostructure.  Moire patterns form as a result of periodic arrangements of aligned and misaligned atomic stacking in the layers. These Moire patterns are the signature of modifications of the electric and mechanical properties of the stacked materials, and the origin of new heterostructure behavior. This study will advance the science of two-dimensional materials by creating new theoretical and experimental tools to: probe the mechanics of the Moire patterns at the atomic scale, discover new useful material behavior, and reveal strategies to leverage these properties at larger scales. The success of the project will advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by facilitating design and fabrication of advanced materials with superior properties. As part of the project, a Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math (STEAM) activity on the Art of Moire will be created for middle and high school girls through an extensive collaboration with the School of Arts+Design. This will be an annual summer camps to excite and motivate female students about engineering by connecting art and design to the mechanics of materials.\r\n\r\nHeterostructures of 2D materials are a unique space for engineering design, both for discovering new emergent phenomena and for developing novel devices. The objective of the study is to explore the mechanics of Moire patterns observed in vertical, or stacked, interfaces between 2D materials and their defects.  The study is driven by the hypothesis that defects in stacked 2D materials endow heterostructures with unusual mechanical and electronic properties. A grand-canonical minimum hopping (GCMH) computational method will be applied within the LAMMPS molecular dynamics framework to resolve defect structure and motion in 2D material layers and their heterostructures. Mechanical Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) techniques will be used to measure the mechanics of the Moire patterns of graphene on various crystalline substrates. The use of calibrated multi-frequency and lateral force AFM to observe the Moire will give information on the local modulation of elastic, plastic, and frictional properties. These complementary studies will be used to uncover the energetics of partial dislocation reconstructions unique to 2D materials, defect interactions, and coupling to out-of-plane deformation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe properties of atomically thin or \"2D\" materials grown on metal substrates are strongly influenced by the relationship between the crystallinity of the 2D material and the crystallinity of the substrate.  This manifests in the formation of geometric patterns known as moir&eacute; patterns, and in the energetics of faceting behavior on the surface, as well as in changes to the macroscopic mechanical properties of the system.  The results have implications for technologies ranging from microelectronics to composite materials to materials for energy storage.  In this project, we studied the thermodynamics and kinetics of graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on metal substrates, focusing on the effects of graphene on the properties of the catalytic metal surface, and the consequences for the surface morphology in the graphene-covered material.  We also explored the effects of the moir&eacute; patterns created by the overlap of the graphene crystal and the metal crystal and created educational materials to demonstrate the science to the general public.\n\nOur findings showed first that graphene has the effect of stabilizing surface facets on a catalytic substrate like copper or palladium.  The interaction of the graphene and the metal has an effect similar to lowering the surface temperature of the metal, or, equivalently, to raising the melting temperature of the metal.  This lowers the mobility of atoms at the surface, which stabilizes areas of the metal that are covered by graphene, relative to neighboring areas of the metal that are uncovered.  Using a combination of experimental studies including graphene growth and surface characterization, and computational studies involving molecular dynamics simulations, we showed that the result of this effect is that on metal substrates partially covered by CVD graphene, the graphene covered regions tend to appear faceted, while the uncovered regions tend to appear unfaceted, or even amorphous.\n\nWe also showed that the facet orientations promoted by graphene coverage can be understood in terms of a balance between surface energy of the metal, interfacial energy between the metal and the graphene, and strain energy stored in the graphene.  Using an experimental characterization method that we developed, called Facet Orientation Analysis (FOA), and a comprehensive molecular dynamics study of surface orientations and pre-strain values in the graphene layer, we were able to successfully explain and predict otherwise anomalous vicinal facet orientations in graphene-copper systems.  This approach has future implications for predicting the microstructure of graphene covered metal surfaces, including the possibility of explaining the uniform spacing and grain boundary formation of graphene grown on liquid metal surfaces, which is the focus of ongoing work.\n\nWhile studying the science of graphene-surface interactions on crystalline metal substrates, we also developed educational materials to explain the existence of moir&eacute; patterns in crystalline systems.  We created a video, now widely available on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j62RleS3JpI), that includes scientific, artistic, and mathematical descriptions of moir&eacute; patterns.  The video includes links to accompanying python codes that allow users to create their own moir&eacute; patterns using their photos and images.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/23/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Harley T Johnson"
