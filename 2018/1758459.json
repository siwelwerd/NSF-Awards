 "awd_abstract_narration": "When pathogenic microorganisms infect plants, they respond by having plant cells release many different substances outside of the cell. In many instances, this collective response stops microbes from growing in this niche. However, it is mostly unknown how these substances are released by plant cells and how these substances stop pathogens from growing. Additionally, the project will identify substances that are released to the extracellular spaces during a plant immune response and determine which ones are important for the resistance to pathogens. The long-term goal of this project is to develop crops that are more resistant to pathogens. This project will offer camps for high school students within University of Nebraska, Lincoln's, Nebraska College Preparatory Academy program, targeting low-income and underrepresented minority high school students from urban centers of the state. Additionally, the project will offer research training for high school students within the Young Nebraska Scientist Program. The topics pursued in this proposal have important ramifications for plant immunity and plant biology, adding to the broad appeal of both programs to young scientists and enhancing high school student interest in STEM fields. \r\n\r\n\r\nPlant immunity triggers the release of proteins and metabolites to combat extracellular pathogens, which reside in the apoplast, the space between plant cells. While many of the products that are secreted or exported from the plant cell to the apoplast are known, it is not well understood which are important for resistance to bacterial pathogens or how they are secreted. A primary virulence strategy of the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae is to inject type III effector proteins into host cells to suppress plant immunity. Recently published indicate that the HopE1 effector targets MAP65-1 to perturb the microtubule network. HopE1 also inhibits the secretion of immunity-related proteins to the apoplast. These findings provide an entry point to better understand the involvement of microtubules in the secretion of immunity-related products to the apoplast. Arabidopsis mutants defective in MAP65-1 are more susceptible to P. syringae, and MAP65-1 over-expressing plants exhibit enhanced resistance to P. syringae. The overall goal of this project is to elucidate how MAP65 functions in the microtubule network, to better understand the involvement of the microtubule network in plant immunity, identify the apoplastic products that depend on microtubules for their secretion, and systematically mutate their corresponding genes to determine their involvement in cell wall-based extracellular immunity. The experimental methods that will be employed will range from biochemistry, molecular biology, cell biology and proteomics to newer techniques such as CRISPR-CAS9 mutagenesis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Both AtMAP65-1 and AtMAP65-2 have been shown to promote axial cell growth in etiolated hypocotyls as well as roots of Arabidopsis, with functional redundancy (Lucas and Shaw, 2012).

AtMAP65-1 was demonstrated to be a virulence target of the effector protein HopE1 from the phytobacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (P. syringae DC3000) in plants (Guo et al., 2016b). HopE1 interacts with AtMAP65-1 in a calmodulin-dependent manner and mediates dissociation from microtubules leading to impaired secretion of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins into the apoplast, suggesting AtMAP65-1 is a component of plant immunity against plant bacterial pathogens (Guo et al., 2016b). This is consistent with the maize ZmMAP65-1a being positive regulator of H2O2 amplification and enhances brassinosteroid-induced antioxidant defense response in maize (Zhu et al., 2013). By contrast, other MAP65 homologs may promote disease of different types of pathogens. For, example, during induction of root knot formation, MAP65-3 is essential for nematode-induced giant cell ontogenesis required for reproduction of the parasite, but does not affect feeding establishment or symptom development in Arabidopsis (Caillaud et al., 2008). In the soybean symbiotic microbial relationship, two MAP65-1 homologs along GmMAP3 and GmMAP4 are activated in young nodules displaying elevated expression in roots (Zhang et al., 2021). In the legume Medicago truncatula, the MtMAP65-1 protein is phosphorylated by Aurora kinase 1 (MtAUR1) leading to the formation of AUR1-MAP65 mitotic module recruitment in root hairs infected with endosymbiotic bacteria Sinorhizobium meliloti, consistent with MtMAP65&rsquo;s role in symbiotic interaction and nodulation in legume plants (Gao et al., 2022).</p>\n<p>Microtubule dynamics has also been associated with plant&rsquo;s adaptation to low temperature abiotic stress. Microtubule structure is critical to the low temperature response (Orvar et al., 2000), and the cytoskeleton is remodeled during low temperatures (Pokorna et al., 2004), suggesting that microtubule dynamics through MAP65-1 may be necessary. Microtubule depolymerization can be induced by cold stress, and MAP65-1 alleles have been associated with tolerance to a cold stress challenge, but the data have not been consistent in regard to MAP65-1 and tolerance to cold (Rutten et al., 1997; Mao et al., 2005b). The herbicide oryzalin, 3,5-dinitro-N4,N4-dipropylsulfanilamide, binds plant tubulin leading to inhibition of microtubule polymerization triggering depolymerization of microtubule organization in plants (Cleary and Hardham, 1988; Chang et al., 2005). Whether oryzalin directly acts on MAP65 proteins is not clear, given the sensitivity to the microtubule depolymerizing induced by oryzalin was indiscriminative between wild type and Atmap65-1/-2 mutants of Arabidopsis, however, the filamentous image pattern of GFP-AtMAP65-1 can be disrupted by oryzalin (Lucas et al., 2011). Despite its herbicidal activity, oryzalin-mediated disruption of microtubules could result in increase of the survival rate of seedlings under salt stress, which may be related to its ability to release MAP65-1 or other MAP65 proteins from microtubules (Wang et al., 2007; Winkler et al., 2021).</p>\n<p>Clearly, the integrity of the cytoskeleton matrix is a component of the innate immunity in plants (Li and Staiger, 2018; Wang et al., 2022), which is reflected by P. syringae DC3000 acquiring the ability to synthesize an effector protein to target a protein whose role is to stabilize microtubules (Guo et al., 2016b).
