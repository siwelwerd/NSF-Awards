 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemists can arrange atoms within molecules with extraordinary precision. However, it is extremely challenging to exert the same level of control over the structure and composition of nanoparticles, which are assemblies of hundreds to thousands of often diverse atoms. The precise organization of those atoms within nanoparticles is crucial in determining their overall properties and potential applications. In this project, Dr. Nie of the University of Maryland College Park develops new strategies to control the directional bonding of nanoparticles to form structures that resemble the geometry of small molecules. One goal of creating such molecule-like architectures from nanoparticles is to enable new technologies for applications in medicine, optoelectronics, energy production, and/or energy storage. Dr. Nie is also actively engaged in training students at different levels in the fundamental principles of polymers and nanoscience. Outreach activities of this project include hosting local high-school students for summer research projects, creating research positions for first-year undergraduate students and organizing one-day science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) events for middle to high school students.\r\nWith funding from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Nie designs a new class of supracolloidal analogues of polar molecular compounds comprising two or more elements. The project explores the assembly behaviors of these supracolloids at interfaces and in solutions. A combination of experimental and computational tools are used to achieve a deep fundamental understanding of colloidal interactions and properties. Some of the major questions to be addressed are how to break the symmetry of spherical nanoparticles to produce asymmetric supracolloids, how these supracolloids behave in assembly, and what optical properties can be expected. This work may lead to new research opportunities in many fields ranging from materials science to optoelectronics. Dr. Nie is actively engaged in outreach activities involving events for pre-college science, technology, engineering and mathematics (K-12 STEM) students. His group provides high-school student summer internships and undergraduate research positions with or without course credit.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
