Additional information about the conference can be found on the website http://u.osu.edu/costin.10/\r\n\r\nThe Workshop on Analysis, Approximation Theory, Operator Theory and their Interactions will engage participants in an interesting blend of approximation theory, operator theory, and general analysis. It is intended to provide opportunities for interaction among workers in these areas, to set future research directions and provide an opportunity for young workers to learn important aspects of the field. The latter will be accomplished by a series of expository lectures by leading experts. The following subareas will be emphasized during the workshop: orthogonal polynomials and systems, wavelet theory (and its use in approximation of Besov and Sobolev spaces), special functions, interpolation of operators, s-numbers and entropy numbers for operators on Banach spaces and their approximations, nuclear operators, eigenvalues of operators (including non-selfadjoint) and applications of approximation and operator theory. This will be an important conference on approximation and operator theory that will significantly impact the future interaction of these fields.",
