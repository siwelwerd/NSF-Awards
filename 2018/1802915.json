 "awd_abstract_narration": "The surfaces of devices such as a wind turbine blade, of an airplane wing, of a propeller or fan are all designed to manage the flow of air in a beneficial way. However, turbulence that inevitably accompanies the flow produces pressure fluctuations on a surface that can result in undesirable vibration or sound. This research effort is directed at understanding how treatments placed just above a surface might be able to substantially reduce the pressure fluctuations, without negatively impacting the beneficial effects of a surface on the flow. The work will involve coordinated wind tunnel experiments at Virginia Tech, and theoretical studies at Florida Atlantic University. As well as advancing science and engineering in the area of fluid dynamics, the effort will be focused on the research training of PhD and undergraduate students. In particular the experiments will be integrated with required undergraduate laboratories at Virginia Tech, impacting several hundred students over the course of the project.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of this work is to establish the fundamental scientific basis for surface treatments that reduce turbulent surface pressure fluctuations, while maintaining the wall-normal transport of momentum and low drag that is required in most fluid dynamic applications. Recent studies have definitively demonstrated that pressure shielding is possible. The purpose of this work is to provide a quantitatively usable fundamental understanding of the mechanisms behind these effects, and the mathematical methods needed for their prediction.  The research program is focused on the application of pressure shielding treatments to two fundamental flows; the shear-free boundary layer formed adjacent to a wall in homogeneous turbulence, and a conventional flat plate turbulent boundary layer. These flows have been chosen since they cleanly separate some of the major mechanisms expected to be responsible for pressure shielding. They are also geometrically simple and well characterized, since analytical or experimental models of the complete correlation structure of these flows exist. Large scale experiments on these configurations with and without treatment, will be performed at Virginia Tech. Parallel mathematical modeling will be carried out at Florida Atlantic University. Through this closely linked study we expect not only to extract the fundamental nature of the pressure shielding, but also to build mathematically well-founded analytical tools needed for its prediction. A key goal is to provide research education to a diverse group of students drawn from a broad range of academic levels. The planned work includes specific tasks to be conducted by groups of undergraduate and high school students across both institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Past research has shown that these pressure fluctuations can be reduced in intensity by placing a canopy just above the surface in a fashion that mimics the canopy formed by fine hairs that grow on the feathers of silent-flying owls. I this collaborative effort combining researchers at Virginia Tech and Florida Atlantic University, idealized canopies formed from fine rods, aligned with the flow direction were studied in an effort to reveal the fundamental mechanisms that cause the reduction in pressure fluctuations. Experimental studies involved measurements were made using microphones, to sense the surface pressure fluctuations, and particle image velocimetry (PIV) to reveal the flow details. The canopies studied were varied systematically in height, rod size and spacing in an attempt to reveal the causal relationships that influence the pressure fluctuations. Along with the modeling work performed at FAU, this resulted in some key findings. First the canopy suppresses pressure fluctuations at lower frequencies by lifting some of the turbulence away from the wall. The lift-up occurs because of the additional drag on the flow near the wall as it flows over the rods. In this range the frequency of the attenuation and the development of the attenuation with streamwise distance scale on the distance of the canopy from the wall and the flow velocity. At high frequencies, the canopy reduces pressure fluctuations by slowing the flow that passes underneath the rods. This slower flow results in less vigorous small-scale turbulence close to the wall. The attenuation here tends to scale with parameters associated with viscous friction. The PIV measurements not only revealed many details of the flow structure around the rods, they also allowed precise estimates of the intensity and scales of the turbulent fluctuations.&nbsp; These data were used as input to a mathematical model (the TNO model) to predict the wall pressure fluctuations, but did not give good estimates of the measured spectra. However, if the lengthscales were based on the overall wall jet characteristics, not the detailed PIV measurement, then good estimates of the measured spectra were obtained. This project has had a significant broader impact in terms of research training. This research has been the principal focus for the PhD studies of Nandita Hari who will graduate in 2022. It has also been a part-time research focus for post-doctoral scholar Mate Szoke. Four undergraduate students and a non-thesis MS student also benefited through their involvement in the research. The close collaboration with Florida Atlantic University has been central to the progress in advancing our understanding of the pressure-shielding phenomenon, through their computational and modeling efforts.
