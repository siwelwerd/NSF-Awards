 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project brings together researchers from several disciplines with community partners to develop a range of novel sensing, monitoring, and messaging technologies to create a Virtual Safety Net (VSN) system for community members in an underserved urban community. In this effort, researchers will collaborate with members of the Black Ministerial Alliance and Health Ministry leaders of member churches, along with volunteers who provide health promotion outreach, the church leadership and a community liaison affiliated with a hospital to improve the overall health of this predominately African American community. The VSN is a research infrastructure for development of crowdsourced health interventions, in which community members author or culturally tailor intervention rules and messages. The VSN will empower the community to collectively solve health-relevant problems it identifies as important and provide preventive and health interventions that leverage support and messaging delivered individually via smartphone apps or during group meetings. The VSN will also be used to help the community identify and address social determinants of health, including food insecurity, homelessness, and health literacy. This research will have immediate impact for the 20,000 members of the 30 churches in the Black Ministerial Alliance of Boston. The technologies implemented can be rapidly disseminated to other church communities, businesses and social organizations in the US.\r\n    \r\nThis SCC project aims to develop a research infrastructure that will be used to co-design and evaluate technologies in collaboration with community partners. The project will leverage the deep social support networks already existing in the Boston area. Key technologies developed in this effort include crowdsourced health interventions, in which community members author or culturally tailor intervention rules and messages. This will include developing methods to identify the range of modifications that laypersons can meaningfully make to expert-authored intervention dialogue and designing user interfaces to enable these modifications. It also includes advances in artificial intelligence-based indexing of community-authored narrative text for just-in-time messaging to motivate change in longitudinal, multi-behavior interventions. Advances in the automated generation of persuasive arguments for behavior change will also be developed. Dialogue-based interfaces to generate explainable artificial intelligence-learned models will be made to enable community members to understand and potentially modify how these models work.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Methods for designing and adapting health education and behavior change information for communities by collaborating with community members were developed. Specific technologies were also developed, including a smartphone-based embodied conversational agent that simulates face-to-face counseling with a health professional. These methods and technologies were used to develop a smartphone app to promote physical activity, diet, healthy hydration, mental health, and interpersonal violence awareness among members of churches in the Black Ministerial Alliance Tenpoint in the Boston area.<br /><br />We developed a method to adapt and deliver health information specifically as conversational agent dialogue for religious communities, and tested this with a coach agent that motivated church members to do more walking and improve their diet. When church members compared the adapted agent with one that was not religiously adapted, all indicated they preferred working with the adapted agent and reported significantly more trust in the adapted agent, and felt the adapted agent cared more about them compared to the non-adapted agent. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />We also compared different kinds of health tasks performed on a smartphone and discovered that people prefer using a standard smartphone interface for quick transactions, such as logging medication taking, or when under time constraints, but do not have preferences for a standard interface vs. an agent for narrative tasks such as asking about medication side effects. <br /><br />We developed several methods to motivate church members to continue using a health promotion app to maintain their health, including various app notifications, communications from their pastor, a prayer wall for posting prayer requests and receiving prayers from community members, and media requested by community members, including bible stories that are told by the conversational agent. We conducted a 4-week field study with 25 church members to determine which methods worked the best to keep community members engaged. <br /><br />We developed several health promotion modules for the app, in collaboration with church members. The physical activity module is designed to increase the amount of exercise a user performs, adapting its methods based on whether a user is able to walk and their degree of motivation and confidence to begin exercising. It then tracks user performance over time, adapting its methods as needed. The diet module is designed to increase user consumption of fruits and vegetables, using dynamically adapted methods similar to those used in the physical activity module. The healthy hydration module is designed to increase water consumption and decrease consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages. The healthy relationships module provides information on communication skills to improve relationships, and also information about domestic violence and resources.<br /><br />We also developed a module to help address depression in the community. There is often a reluctance to address mental health concerns among our community members due to feelings of shame or stigma associated with mental health. This module uses several strategies to both raise awareness of depression and reduce the shame and stigma surrounding it, to promote help-seeking both by a user who may be suffering, as well as another community member who the user may be able to help. This module was separately evaluated by church members who were largely satisfied with it, with many taking action based on the information provided. <br /><br />Finally, we conducted an evaluation of the overall integrated app among 295 church members for one month. Overall, participants were satisfied with the app and used it for half of the days they had it, on average. Several health behaviors were improved, including amount of fruits and vegetables consumed, although amount of sugar-sweetened beverages also increased. <br /><br />The results from these development efforts and experiments will inform the design of future health interventions targeting both religious communities and other communities with unique cultures and means of social support, including schools, businesses, and community organizations, with the ability to reach most Americans through custom-tailored messaging.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/08/2025<br>\nModified by: Timothy&nbsp;W&nbsp;Bickmore</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1831755/1831755_10581008_1736351013725_IMG2_agent_screenshots--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1831755/1831755_10581008_1736351013725_IMG2_agent_screenshots--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Embodied Conversational Agents\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1831755/1831755_10581008_1736351013725_IMG2_agent_screenshots--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Embodied Conversational Agents\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The embodied conversational agents used in the SCC app for promoting health.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Northeastern University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Timothy&nbsp;W&nbsp;Bickmore\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Embodied Conversational Agents</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1831755/1831755_10581008_1736351067563_IMG3_GUI_screenshots--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1831755/1831755_10581008_1736351067563_IMG3_GUI_screenshots--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"GUI Elements of SCC app\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1831755/1831755_10581008_1736351067563_IMG3_GUI_screenshots--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"GUI Elements of SCC app\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">User interface for the Smart and Connected Churches app.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Northeastern University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Timothy&nbsp;W&nbsp;Bickmore\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">GUI Elements of SCC app</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1831755/1831755_10581008_1736351246771_IMG1_user--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1831755/1831755_10581008_1736351246771_IMG1_user--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"User interacting with SCC app.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1831755/1831755_10581008_1736351246771_IMG1_user--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"User interacting with SCC app.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A user interacting with an embodied conversational agent in the Smart and Connected Churches app.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Northeastern University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Timothy&nbsp;W&nbsp;Bickmore\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">User interacting with SCC app.</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
