The unprecedented growth in the creation and use of data offers new opportunities\r\nfor fostering more effective bridges between researchers, industry and government colleagues, and a\r\ndiverse community to enable new scientific progress and tangible advances for societal benefit.  This workshop will focus on academic research and industry expertise to further cooperation and partnerships.\r\n\r\nTranslational data science is an emerging field that applies data science principles, techniques, and\r\ntechnologies to scientific challenges that hold the promise of having an important societal impact. It\r\nfocuses on the interface and interactions between foundational aspects of data science and their use in\r\nadvancing scientific frontiers. By convening a diverse community of stakeholders who can contribute to the strategic development of a Translational Data Science roadmap, this workshop will build and strengthen connections across sectors. The perspectives and insights shared from industry, government, nonprofits, and academia, coupled with discussions focused on actionable challenges and measurable outcomes, will serve to advance the field of data science as well as related fields and application areas. The workshop provides a mechanism for identifying high-priority topics and high-impact opportunities for future research, training, and collaboration.",
