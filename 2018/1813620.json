The workshop will look at the technical challenges and potential benefits of deploying a highly capable, next-generation R-AUV on the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) Cabled Array at Axial Seamount on the Juan de Fuca Ridge off Washington-Oregon. The workshop will serve as a forum for the open exploration of operational concepts and application spaces uniquely suited to R-AUV systems, with a goal of defining a roadmap leading to the deployment of such systems for a broad range of users. The proposed 2.5 day workshop will be held at the University of Washington in April 2018.",
