 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professors Schwarz and Altman at Yale University are developing a new approach for the visualization and characterization of single molecule surface chemistry. This new approach is allowing the groups to control each step of a reaction using the tip of a scanning probe microscope where the specific and unique reaction pathway is chosen at will. Professors Schwarz and Altman are using this technique to study the interactions responsible to drive the reaction and to ultimately reveal the influence of nearby surface defects or other molecules.  The research outcomes are opening new venues to study surface chemistry and catalysis. Professors Schwarz and Altman are using carbon-hydrogen and carbon-carbon bond formation to illustrate the power of the technique. These bond formation reactions are fundamentally importantly and could have great impacts to the chemical and petrochemical industry. Professors Schwarz and Altman are using their research outcomes to reach out to the general public.\r\n\r\nProfessors Schwarz and Altman are developing a high-resolution tool to locally map energy landscape between an adsorbed molecule and the surface underneath, with the aims of quantifying energy minima for specific chemical bond formation or dissociation and subsequently manipulating single molecule surface chemistry at will.  Specifically, they are (1) further developing their atomic force microscopy technique to quantify the interaction between the tip and a sample, and map potential, forces, and currents in three dimensions; (2) using the developed technique to study adsorption of aromatic molecules and hydrogen, and manipulate their chemical behaviors; and (3) testing the technique with local creation of benzyl radicals and formation of associated products.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
