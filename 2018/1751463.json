 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) grant will support research that will contribute new knowledge to the underlying mechanisms of coastal erosion, particularly with regard to extreme events and sea level rise.  Coastal erosion and land loss is threatening many sections of the U.S. coastlines and coastal communities.  Extreme events such as hurricanes driving storm waves and surges, as well as sea level rise are accelerating coastal erosion.  The prediction and assessment of coastal erosion has advanced significantly over the last decades.  However, significant knowledge gaps exist with regard to the characterization and mechanics of impacted coastal soils.  This award supports fundamental research to advance the understanding of soil behavior in response to waves, currents, tides, and associated morphodynamics in the coastal zone.  This knowledge will contribute to the improvement of the prediction, assessment and mitigation of coastal erosion and stability of coastal infrastructure.  The award involves several disciplines including geotechnical engineering, coastal sciences and engineering, geophysics, and oceanography.  The multi-disciplinary approach will feature field and laboratory experiments.  The education plan includes a field research experience for freshman undergraduates with an emphasis on students from low-income backgrounds.  It also includes an adult education program to educate the public about risks to coastal infrastructure associated with sea level rise, coastal inundation and erosion.  The education plan will help to train a new generation of coastal and geotechnical engineers, broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in civil engineering, and raise public awareness for risks associated to sea level rise, coastal inundation and erosion, and is aligned with NSF INCLUDES.\r\n\r\nThe role of geotechnical soil behavior for coastal erosion processes is still not fully understood, mostly resulting from a lack of geotechnical data in coastal areas affected by energetic hydrodynamics and morphodynamics.  This research is to fill this knowledge gap by: 1) measuring sediment strength and pore pressure of coastal and nearshore sediments under hydrodynamic forcing and morphodynamics, 2) testing a new formulation of the Shields parameter integrating shear strength and pore pressure, and 3) investigating the impact of variations of geotechnical soil parameters in coastal areas on erodibility during inundation and flood events.  The research objectives will be achieved through multi-disciplinary field and laboratory testing programs, enabling simultaneous observations of geotechnical parameters, morphodynamics, and hydrodynamics.  The knowledge gained will contribute to improving the understanding of the interaction between soil mechanics and subaqueous sediment transport processes, as well as to the improvement of current prediction methods for coastal erosion.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Landward migration of the shoreline reaches on the order of meters per year in many locations, and mitigation of coastal erosion and defense against coastal hazards is a concern in most coastal communities to-date. Despite this severe threat, prediction models have difficulty in correctly simulating the impact of severe storm events at many locations, leading to uncertainty in disaster preparation, management, and response, as well as in climate adaptation for decision makers as well as affected parties. Lack of understanding of the soil mechanics under active hydrodynamic forcing has been identified as a weakness in current prediction models. Thus, the long-term research goal of this research is to investigate the vulnerability of shorelines and coastal infrastructure regarding climate change, human impact, and extreme events through a detailed understanding of the correlation between sediment erodibility and geotechnical sediment characteristics under varying hydrodynamic forcing conditions and morphodynamics. This knowledge will contribute directly to the protection, conservation, and resilience of coastal communities and ecosystems. The specific research objectives of this CAREER award were to measure and assess the behavior of coastal sediments under active coastal processes (e.g., waves, and sandbar migration). It was then attempted to draw a relationship between those geomechanics, erodibility, and coastal change. Finally, it was explored if variations in sediment properties within coastal systems represent an important consideration and could improve prediction and assessment models. The project also included educational and outreach components, providing training for more than 10 graduate students and more than 20 undergraduate students in interdisciplinary aspects of coastal geotechnics, the development of field research experience program for undergraduate students, and the development of a sci-art event for broadening outreach to local communities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Data were collected to address research objectives through 20 field expeditions to Virginia, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Florida, Texas, Alaska, Canada, Germany, and Australia, and participation in one large wave flume experiment in Quebec, Canada. The field data collection included data collection after 4 tropical storms events and one riverine flood event. The data set collected represents one of the largest compilations of geotechnical field data collected in coastal and nearshore environments. The data is fully available to the public through publication in data repositories. Sediment samples were collected at all field sites. They underwent detailed laboratory geotechnical characterization and were included in the data assemblies. The data allowed to conclude that geomechanical properties of coastal sediment vary significantly within coastal systems and often at short distances and timescales. The data also showed that sediment packing and strength related to erodibility which is currently rarely included and predictive models. Specifically, onshore sediments above the high tide line were found to be more susceptible to erosion, and therefore, more at risk of breaching, scour, and landloss during extreme events over their nearshore counterparts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The project is built on multi-disciplinary collaborations and inclusion of undergraduate and graduate students. Students were trained through participation in research and through field participation opportunities in aspects of coastal geotechnics, coastal change, and interdisciplinary research. Four PhD dissertations and more than 7 MS projects utilized data collected through this project. Five undergraduate research projects were supported by this project.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A field research experience for early undergraduate students was developed. Particularly, female students and students from low-socioeconomic backgrounds were recruited. This was possible through the development of a self-sustained funding model that allowed a zero program fee plus stipend support for students of financial need. In post-participation assessments, more than 50% of the participants stated that the program was beneficial to them in terms of making career decisions. More than 25% of the participants applied for a STEM graduate school program.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For broader community outreach, a sci-art event was developed in collaboration with an aerialist. The event included an aerialist performance with a following discussion and Q&amp;A with the research team. The event succeeded in attracting more than 200 people. The concept was found successful in attracting and communicating to a broader audience that would typically not attend scientific events and presentations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In summary, this project advanced our current database and knowledge of soil mechanics under active coastal processes. The knowledge is relevant to improve current predictive models of coastal change under climatic shifts and extreme events. This project offered training and educational opportunities to many students at different stages of their education. The project explored a sci-art collaboration to conduct outreach to a broader community and provided a concept template for similar future sci-art collaborations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t
