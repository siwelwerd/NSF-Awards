 "awd_abstract_narration": "University of Minnesota proposes to support technical services on R/V Blue Heron, an 86? general purpose UNOLS research vessel operated by the UM Duluth Large Lakes Observatory as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.  They request support for basic services and specialized services. They will provide one technician on each lake-going research project of R/V Blue Heron to support lacustrine research projects and to maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation. \r\n\r\nThe Program received the proposal on 1/6/2018. As required, the report provided information regarding 2017 operations as well as outlining plans and a proposed budget for 2018.  Research vessels in the Academic Fleet provide support for researchers from a variety of federal and state agencies, as well as some private sponsors. All users (or the appropriate funding agencies) share support for basic technical services on the vessel equally, via a day-rate, with each paying a share of the costs based on fractional usage of the vessel. The rates are negotiated annually with the NSF Program Manager. The budget in this proposal is for the first year of a five-year continuing grant. Out years are provided as estimates and the awards will be negotiated upon receipt of the annual report.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

During the 2024 calendar year this award funded technical support for three NSF funded research projects including researchers from the Universities of Pittsburgh, Michigan, and Minnesota to study harmful algal blooms on the Great Lakes, researchers from Michigan State and Central Michigan Universities to study past environmental conditions on the Great Lakes, and researchers from the University of Rochester to study the release of methane from the Great Lakes.\r\n\n\nThe R/V Blue Heron is an 85 former fishing trawler that is outfitted with state-of-the-art research equipment. She is a member of the U.S academic research fleets umbrella organization - UNOLS (University National Oceanographic Laboratory System) - and is the only member of UNOLS on the Great Lakes. The vessel not only supports NSF funded projects but also projects funded by NOAA, the state of Minnesota and the University of Minnesota and is available to any organization doing research or education on the Great Lakes. The vessel primarily works with researchers in biology, chemistry, geology and physics but also works with educators to ensure that undergraduate and graduate students get a first-hand appreciation of field work on large bodies of water.\r\n\n\nDuring 2024 over 300 post-secondary, secondary and elementary students, and members of the public toured the vessel as part of our Science on Deck events or other dock-side tours. These events ensure that members of the public have a better understanding of the R/V Blue Heron and the work that researchers funded by NSF do onboard the vessel. We feel that this outreach is an important part of our mission. Additionally, roughly 90 undergraduates and close to 30 graduate students participated in class or research cruises in 2024 learning about oceanographic research and, in the case of those students participating in research cruises, collecting data and samples for their academic projects. This educational work helps to train the next generation of researchers.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/31/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RichardDRicketts\n"
