 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) program supports the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need.  This project at Bronx Community College and Lehman College, both Hispanic-Serving Institutions in the City University of New York system, will fund 575 scholarships in 10 groups of students who are pursuing associate degrees at Bronx Community College and baccalaureate degrees at Lehman College across STEM fields. Many of the participating students will be from New York's 15th Congressional District and surrounding area. This district is the poorest in America, with 34.2% of local residents living below the poverty level, as compared to 12.7% nationwide. The scholarship students will receive: (1) optimized student success supports (i.e. pre-College Summer Boot Camp, First Year Seminar, intensive advisement, a transfer bridge program); (2) scholarships and financial aid; (3) faculty mentoring; (4) active learning and collaborative research; (5) academic support; (6) opportunities to earn income as Supplemental Instruction Leaders; (7) professional development opportunities through participation in conferences, workshops, fairs, and STEM clubs; and (8) career advisement and internships. \r\n\r\nFaculty and Supplemental Instruction Leaders will be trained to help students intentionally build a growth mindset, the perspective that intelligence and academic success can be improved over time with effort and with the development of specific skills. There is evidence that students with growth mindsets develop the resiliency to overcome failures and set-backs. While there is ample evidence linking growth mindsets to improved academic performance, there is little evidence regarding what specific activities help students to develop growth mindsets and, in turn, improve their academic performance and persistence. This project will develop and test a Growth Mindset Development Model that creates a \"roadmap\" for developing growth mindsets.  This information has the potential to help colleges and universities across the nation increase the number and diversity of college students who complete STEM studies and enter the STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
