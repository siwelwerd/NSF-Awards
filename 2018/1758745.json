 "awd_abstract_narration": "Altering gene regulation, also known as transcriptional reprogramming, is at the heart of plant development, reproduction, and responses to various stresses. Simultaneously reprogramming multiple, specific genes is desirable for studying gene function and expression, dissecting complex signaling networks, engineering metabolic pathways, and building synthetic switches and circuits. However, genetic tools that would allow biologists to turn multiple genes on and off in this way in plant cells are currently unavailable. This project develops these tools and will not only aid basic research in plant science, but also allow plant scientists to seek novel solutions to global challenges such as devastating plant diseases, economical bioenergy production, sustainable agriculture and response to climate change. \r\n\r\nThis project applies recent technical advances in CRISPR plant genome engineering to build essential comprehensive genome reprogramming tools and demonstrate them in rice, an important crop. The specific aims of this project are to develop 1) an efficient multiplexed transcriptional activation system; 2) an efficient multiplexed transcriptional repression system; 3) a bidirectional multiplexed transcriptional regulation system; and 4) a CRISPR design tool within the software of the Integrated Genome Browser for transcriptional regulation in plants. The highly efficient plant transcriptional reprogramming systems and the design tool developed in this project will benefit the plant research community in advancing basic research and crop improvement. These easy-to-use, effective tool packages will be tested for sophisticated multigene, transcriptional reprogramming and made available to researchers at the public repository, Addgene. In addition, the project will provide cutting-edge training to a diverse group of students at various levels, including a postdoctoral scientist, two PhD students, and many undergraduate and high school students from diverse backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
