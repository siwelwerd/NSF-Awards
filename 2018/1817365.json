 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students from historically underrepresented minority populations (African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians or Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders) to successfully complete high quality degree programs in STEM.  \r\n\r\nThe Northern New Jersey LSAMP Bridge to the Baccalaureate (NNJ-B2B) project continue its partnership between four community colleges in the state, namely, Passaic County Community College (PCCC), Hudson County Community College (HCCC), Union County Community College (UCCC) and County College of Morris (UCM), to increase transfer rates to four-year STEM degree programs for traditionally underrepresented minority students.  PCCC leads the alliance which includes two new community colleges - UCM, an emerging Hispanic-serving community college, and HCCC during the three-year project. The goal is to increase the number of transfers by 900 students during the project period. \r\n\r\nNNJ-B2B institutions will leverage knowledge generated from prior NSF funded projects to bring expertise to the design and implementation of a range of high impact practices that will aide in achieving its transfer goal and transform its recruitment and retention interventions and institutions.  Students will benefit from early undergraduate research experiences and mentoring activities in addition to social integration activities with institutions in the Garden State Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation led by Rutgers University.  Leadership and governance activities of the alliance will continue emphasis on improving articulation policies with four-year institutions. A longitudinal study of students participating in the B2B project since 2014 is proposed along with process evaluation.  Project outcomes will be disseminated locally and nationally through conferences and on-line STEM education journals. Findings from this LSAMP B2B project will benefit educational institutions and the STEM community nationally in broadening participation efforts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAward II:  Creating A Cross-Campus Learning Environment.  The 2018  B2B award was designed to:   (1) expand the number of URM STEM students benefiting  from undergraduate research and/or experiential learning opportunities (N=200 students); (2) increase the involvement and number of community college faculty who guide these students in research-based activities (N=20); (3) establish a formalized cross-campus peer mentoring program (N=400). \n\nUnfortunately, the unexpected and sudden emergence of the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic forced a realignment of these goals that would extend through the spring of 2022.  However, despite a decrease in overall enrollment, several of these goals were achieved. Social distancing practices caused most alliance-wide activities to occur remotely.  For example, URM students were able to participate in a Virtual STEM Speaker Series to help expose URM students to novel STEM careers and introduce them to the successful minority STEM professionals. \n\n Main Initiatives &amp; Accomplishments.\n\nUndergraduate Research.  Even though the pandemic resulted in the cancellation of most of the summer 2020 research internships, several projects were reconfigured to operate remotely for 14 students by using computational resources  at the University of Pennsylvania biomedical program and the Fermi National Accelerator Lab in Chicago.  Nine other students were sponsored by GS-LSAMP institutions using remote platforms.  All of these students were able to present their work at the 12th Annual Alliance Research Conference which convened over a remote platform.  Additionally, four B2B students were invited to present their posters at the Virtual Research Conference of the Louis Stokes Regional Center of Excellence (LSMRCE).  To prepare students to field-based research, the Wildlife Conservation partnered with the B2B-LSAMP to present a formalized 3-day research training workshop in animal behavior in January 2021.  This intensive training program was so successful, it has occurred annually ever since and now gives students the added opportunity to apply for a summer internship at the WCS Bronx Zoo. A second research effort was established in 2021 by the Rutgers-New Brunswick LSAMP campus, giving B2B students the opportunity to conduct original research at the Jacques Cousteau National Estuarine Research Reserve. By the summer of 2022, in-person research opportunities began to return and our 14th Annual Research Conference occurred on-site at the New Jersey Institute of Technology in November 2022.  By Sumer 2023, in-person undergraduate opportunities were restored, bringing the total number of B2B students benefiting from research opportunities to 128. \n\nPeer Mentoring.  After five consecutive years of implementing a successful cross-campus peer-based mentoring program (CCPM) with the Garden State-LSAMP, over 230 community college students have been mentored by 4-year university peers, enhancing the ability of these to transition to a 4-year university environment.  The benefits of Cross-Campus Peer Mentoring apply to both mentor and mentee and provide inherent professional and personal development opportunities: (1) mentors learn to improve their listening skills and provide the inspiration and guidance required to support a less experienced peer who may not yet have a sense of belonging or who may feel inadequate and under-prepared; (2) mentees develop a better sense of how to develop a trusting relationship and benefit from the resulting networking opportunities of someone with greater experience.  The program proved especially valuable during the pandemic by having students meet virtually on Zoom. \n\nCCPM consistently remains among the top activities considered most beneficial in preparing B2B students to transfer to 4-year STEM programs.  In fact, those LSAMP universities most preferred by transfer students are those that have previously provided mentoring opportunities.   \n\n Show Your STEM Innovation Challenge (sySTEMic) was first begun in 2019 to support student interest in research.  It was designed as a competitive challenge where student teams would compete for prizes by innovating a solution around a real-world STEM problem.  Teams would then present their solution by way of a 5-minute \"Shark Tank\" presentation before a group of judges and their peers.  Problem-solving opportunities are an intrinsic component of the sySTEMic competition.  Team members also have the chance to exchange ideas with students of different backgrounds and skillsets, and work under the guidance of a faculty member. Extensive promotion of this event on social media helps promote high interest.  From the beginning, B2B teams have figured prominently in this activity by achieving 1st or 2nd place finish.  In addition, these student-developed innovations often result in opportunities for students to obtain fellowships from the Rutgers I-Corps program.   \n\nThe Virtual Speaker Series (VSS) was originally developed to maintain student engagement during the pandemic and it remains one of the most highly valued activities - one of the top four mentioned in student surveys.  Each session usually focuses on a single STEM professional, who discusses their background and pathway to success, while also highlighting some of the challenges they faced along the way. Sessions conclude with a 15-minute Q&amp;A. The series is extensively publicized on social media and often generates over 12,000 hits on social media platforms.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/10/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jacqueline W Kineavy"
