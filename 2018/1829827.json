 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drifting photosynthetic microbes in surface ocean waters carry out nearly half of global carbon (C) fixation, both supporting the marine food web and reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. The fate of C in ocean ecosystems is controlled by myriad individual interactions within a highly interconnected planktonic food web, the sheer complexity of which has hindered predictive understanding of global C cycling. Chemical cues govern microbial interactions, and during infection, marine viruses manipulate the metabolism of phytoplankton and bacteria, facilitating the release of dissolved organic matter from infected cells. This research aims to determine how viral metabolic reprogramming of and organic matter release from intact, infected phytoplankton influences microbial interactions and C cycling. The interdisciplinary, collaborative nature of the project will enable direct training of two postdoctoral researchers, one graduate student, and undergraduate students in viral ecology, microfluidics, and metabolomics. An educational outreach program that engages middle school students in hands-on, high speed imaging of microbes will be expanded, and the project will culminate in a three-day workshop to advance the application of microfluidic devices and mass spectrometry analyses in microbial ecology. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe overarching hypothesis behind this research is that viral infection alters the chemical landscape of intact, infected picophytoplankton cells, attracting neighboring chemotactic bacteria and protistan zooplankton, and altering C flux pathways. To test this idea, a series of linked multi-scale laboratory-based experiments will be run to 1) Characterize the response of diverse model marine microbes to dissolved organic matter (DOM) released from intact, virus-infected picophytoplankton using microfluidics-based chemotaxis assays, 2) Identify key viral-derived DOM compounds eliciting chemotactic responses using stable isotope labeling, metabolomics analyses, and chemotaxis assays, and 3) Quantify micron-scale cross-trophic encounter dynamics and evaluate their impact on bulk-scale C cycling using liter-scale measurements of C dynamics linked to high spatiotemporal resolution live imaging of microbial food webs. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop a mechanistic understanding of the role of intact, virus-infected cells in oceanic C cycling.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The fate of carbon in ocean ecosystems is controlled by myriad individual interactions within a highly interconnected planktonic food web. The role of marine viruses has proven difficult to quantify, in part due to poor understanding of the ecological and biogeochemical role of intact, virus-infected microbes. During infection, viruses alter host cellular metabolism and chemical cues released from intact, virus-infected cells likely attract neighboring plankton via chemotaxis. Virus-induced dissolved organic carbon release likely alters both marine microbial community composition and<em> </em>micron-scale spatial structure, increasing organism encounter rates, and subsequently, carbon flux across trophic levels. The goal of the proposed work was to develop a mechanistic understanding of the role of intact, virus-infected cells in oceanic carbon cycling to inform our view of viral impacts on ocean ecosystem function.</span></p>\n<p><span>Through a highly collaborative effort blending tools from microbial ecology, microfluidics, and metabolomics, the chemotactic responses of bacteria toward exudates from virus-infected cells and an array of identified metabolites and compounds were directly quantified, providing new key evidence for the mechanisms regulating carbon flux across trophic levels. Specifically, exudates from virus-infected cells (Synecchococcus) at different stages of the infection cycle were assayed using microfluidics to determine the degree to which they act as chemoattractants for model bacteria (Vibrio alginolyticus). These studies reveal significant chemoattraction to pre-lysis exudates. This work also motivated the development of new, high-throughput lab-on-a-chip microfluidic devices to vastly accelerate the pace of discovery for chemical ecology and other relevant applications. A multiplexed microfluidic device was successfully designed, fabricated, and tested, which automatically performs multiple chemotaxis assays in parallel across a range of predefined chemostimulus concentrations. The research themes examined under this award were extended to study the mechanisms regulating cell and chemical transport, and thus encounter rates, in physically relevant systems. New mathematical approaches were applied to quantify the collective motility of dense suspensions of swimming bacteria and how this motion contributes to the dispersal of chemical signals and nutrients. Furthermore, swimming cells are live in porous marine sediments and marine snow particles. Microfluidic model porous media were used to quantify the effects of porous microstructure and external cues on the navigation of swimming bacteria in such environments.</span></p>\n<p><span>This work supported the education and training of seven individuals, including: two postdoctoral associates, two graduate students, two undergraduate students, and one high school student.
