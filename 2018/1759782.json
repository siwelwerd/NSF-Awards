 "awd_abstract_narration": "A series of powerful earthquakes rocked the Apennine mountains in central Italy, between August 2016 and January 2017 causing loss of life and inflicting heavy damage to the historic towns of Amatrice, Accumoli and Norcia. This sequence produced six strong earthquakes over a period of five months as response and recovery operations were underway.  This rapidly evolving seismic crisis underscores the pressing need to better understand how earthquake sequences unfold. The goal of this joint project, funded by the National Science Foundation in the U.S. and the National Environmental Research Council in the U.K., in coordination with the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Volcanologia in Italy, will deepen knowledge of earthquake interaction by studying  these devastating earthquakes. An international team of earthquake expertss will use high-quality seismic data recorded during the sequences to  develop new approaches that can address current obstacles that not only impede deep understanding of the earthquake processes, but also delay the scientific response in the post-earthquake disaster environment. The observational capability to detect, locate and characterize even the smallest magnitude events within few hours developed in this project will be directly applicable to tectonic, induced, geothermal and volcanic seismicity in the U.S. and around the world. Findings of this research will enable improved and scientifically-informed response to the next earthquake crisis to strike the U.S. through existing partnership with the U. S. Geological Survey and support international collaboration amongst US and European earthquake researchers.\r\n\r\nThis study investigates the physics of complex earthquake sequences through the analysis of high-resolution earthquake catalogs to test increasingly sophisticated earthquake forecasting models.  To reach this goal this project will: 1) Use state-of-the-art techniques to develop a comprehensive high-resolution earthquake catalog for the devastating earthquake sequence that struck the Italian Apennines in 2016-2017; 2) Investigate the physics of earthquake triggering and the evolution of large-magnitude events within this sequence; 3) Develop and provide testable forecast models that can support decision-making process for future earthquake sequences. The reseach will use the unparalleled seismic data set recorded by more than 85 high-quality broadband sensors deployed in the epicentral region to analyze how each earthquake in the sequence contributes to the evolution of seismicity in space and time.  This sequence is particularly rich in this regard, with spatially intertwined episodes on August 24, 2016, October 26-28, 2016 and January 18, 2017. The seismograms of both large and small events will enable us to develop and test new full-waveform based algorithms for event detection, location and characterization that will yield precise source parameters and faulting mechanisms for even the smallest magnitude events. By improving the quality of seismic source parameters across the magnitude spectrum it will be possible to apply process-based models of earthquake nucleation and interaction, including the role of fault complexity, fault loading, relaxation, stress interaction, and fault susceptibility to stress perturbation to understand the evolution of this sequence. The improved fault mechanical understanding will help to develop innovative physics-based forecast models. Currently, real-time earthquake forecasts that describe short-term clustering probabilities are based predominantly on statistical/empirical models. However, these models lack an underlying physical model and therefore have limited predictability if no precursory seismicity exists. A common challenge for both physics- based and statistical forecasts that are based on routine catalogues is the low-probability and high-uncertainty nature of the resulting probabilities. Decision-making and scientific advice are all severely hampered under these conditions. Thus, using this new state-of the art earthquake catalog of the 2016-2017 Italian sequence to test physical, statistical and hybrid (physical and statistical) forecasts in space and time will help (a) to test physical models for earthquake occurrences in sequences, and (b) improve the resolution, accuracy and skill of the forecasts. The broader impacts of this project include improvement on seismic risk assessment as well as fostering collaboration between US and European seismologists.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

An international team of experts on earthquakes from the British Geological Survey, the University of Edinburgh, Stanford University, Columbia University, and the INGV was using the high-quality seismic data recorded during the sequences to develop new approaches that can address current obstacles that not only impede our understanding of the earthquake processes, but also delay the scientific response in the post-earthquake disaster environment. The three main tasks of this project were: 1) Use state-of-the-art techniques to develop a comprehensive high-resolution earthquake catalog for the devastating earthquake sequence that struck the Apennines in Italy in 2016-2017; 2) Investigate the physics of earthquake triggering and the evolution of large-magnitude events within this sequence; 3) Develop and provide testable forecast models that can support decision-making process for future earthquake sequences. This report covers work carried out under task 1 by the Columbia University group, in collaboration with the Stanford and INGV teams.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We used the unparalleled seismic data set recorded by more than 155 high-quality broadband sensors deployed in the epicentral region to develop comprehensive, high-resolution earthquake catalogs that we used to image the structures and evolution of faults activated during the sequence, and put the results in a seismo-tectonic context.&nbsp;&nbsp;A first study (Waldhauser et al., 2021) used correlation-based double-difference analysis based on an initial catalog of the INGV to develop a catalog (CAT4) that illuminates the complex, fine-scale geometry and structures of interacting fault zones (Figure 1, 2). The Mt. Vettore normal fault exhibits wide and complex damage zones, including a system of bookshelf faults that intersects the detachment zone (Figure 3). In the Laga domain, a comparatively narrow, shallow dipping segment of the deep Gorzano fault progressively ruptures through the detachment zone in four MW~5.4 that transfer stress from normal to detachment faults. Reconstructed fault planes (Figure 2) show that the detachment zone is fragmented in four sub-horizontal, partly overlaying shear surfaces that correlated with the extent of the mainshock ruptures.&nbsp;&nbsp;We find a deep reaching seismic barrier that coincides with a bend in the Mt. Vettore fault and may play a role in controlling rupture evolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In Tan et al (TSR, 2021) we analyzed the continuous waveform data from a dense network of 139 seismic stations to build a double-difference catalog of&nbsp;&sim;900,000 earthquakes (CAT5) spanning a 1-year period, based on arrival times derived using a deep-neural-network-based picker. Our catalog contains an order of magnitude more events than the catalog routinely produced by the local earthquake monitoring agency (Figure 4). Aftershock activity reveals the geometry of complex fault structures activated during the earthquake sequence and provides additional insights on the potential factors controlling the development of the largest events (Figure 5, bottom right panel). Activated fault structures in the northern and southern regions appear complementary to faults activated during the 1997 Colfiorito and 2009 L&rsquo;Aquila sequences, suggesting that earthquake triggering primarily occurs on critically stressed faults. Delineated major fault planes are relatively thick, compared with estimated earthquake location uncertainties, and a large number of kilometer-long faults and diffuse seismicity were activated during the sequence. These properties might be related to fault age, roughness, and the complexity of inherited structures. The rich details resolvable in this catalog will facilitate continued investigation of this energetic and well-recorded earthquake sequence.</p>\n<p>Finally, in&nbsp;Chiaraluce et al (2022) we&nbsp;documented six earthquake catalogues of the 2017 Central Italy seismic sequence&nbsp;that were developed using a variety of methods, including the ones described in Waldhauser et al (2021) (CAT4) and Tan et al (2021) (CAT5). The catalogues possess different levels of resolution&nbsp;and completeness resulting from progressive enhancements in the data availability, detection&nbsp;sensitivity, and hypocentral location accuracy (Figure 5). The catalogues range from real-time to advanced&nbsp;machine-learning procedures and highlight both the promises as well as the challenges of implementing advanced workflows in an operational environment. Seismic&nbsp;hazard assessment during complex sequences depends critically on up-to-date earthquake catalogues like the ones presented here to characterize the ongoing seismicity&nbsp;and fuel earthquake forecasting models. &nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 04/21/2024<br>\nModified by: Felix&nbsp;Waldhauser</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1759782/1759782_10538096_1713728485035_Figure_3_outcomes--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1759782/1759782_10538096_1713728485035_Figure_3_outcomes--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1759782/1759782_10538096_1713728485035_Figure_3_outcomes--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Event density plots (a, c) and fault model sketches (b, d) focusing on the intersection between normal and detachment faults at the base of the Mt.
