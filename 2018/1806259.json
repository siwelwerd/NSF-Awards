 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ultracold systems comprised of a few isolated trapped atoms permit quantum correlations and entanglement to be studied with an unprecedented degree of control. Using analytical and numerical techniques, this project studies correlations between spatial positions and spins in such ultracold atomic few-body systems. These theoretical studies are conducted in close collaboration with experimentalists exploring ultracold matter. The project aims at developing a microscopic, bottom-up understanding of the correlations in different prototype quantum systems, where theoretical predictions can be confronted with experimental results. The long term goals of this branch of physics include the development of significantly improved imaging systems and sensors, which could have widespread applications. As part of this project, graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in science and technology areas, in which there currently exists a high demand across the US. While conducting this research, the students will develop subsidiary skills in high performance computing.  \r\n\r\nThe idea behind the first study, which is motivated by on-going experiments in Jochim's group in Heidelberg, is conceptually simple. Preparing an initial few-fermion state in an external trap and then inducing an expansion by weakening the trap potential, the group will study how correlations of the initial state get imprinted on the time-evolved wave packet. They will try to develop methods to distinguish between \"trivial\" correlations induced by the particle statistics and \"non-trivial\" correlations due to the short-range contact interactions. Likewise, they will try to identify correlations which are signatures of the initial state, and contrast them with those developed during the expansion. The second and third topics are interrelated. They consider ultracold few-atom systems in the presence of synthetic gauge fields, which introduce a coupling between the spin and the linear momentum of an atom. The spin-momentum coupling leads to non-quadratic single-particle dispersions, which modify the large interparticle-distance-asymptotics of oscillatory scattering wave functions and exponentially decaying bound state wave functions. The second topic entails developing two-particle scattering frameworks for various spin-momentum coupling schemes that account for the correlations between the spin and momentum. The anticipated findings are expected to significantly modify the standard textbook framework of partial wave scattering. The third topic entails determining bound state spectra and wave functions of few-atom states in the presence of spin-momentum coupling. Particular emphasis will be put on the enhancement of the correlations in the near-threshold regime. Spin-momentum coupling is an essential component in a myriad of applications including the study of (fractional) topological insulators, interferometry and gravimetry, spintronic devices, and the creation of Majorana fermions and their use in quantum computers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
