 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Texas at Austin proposes a project - Expanding Computing Education Pathways (ECEP 2.0) - that builds on the National Science Foundation-funded ECEP Alliance that began in 2012. That alliance facilitated state leadership teams in broadening participation as they expanded opportunities in K-16 computer science (CS) education. ECEP states share a common agenda with respect to broadening participation in computing (BPC), participate in mutually reinforcing activities including landscape report development, state summits, and the ECEP Annual Meeting, engage in continuous communication through monthly virtual conferences, connect with other BPC-focused projects such as the National Center for Women and Information Technology and Access Computing, mentor new states, and serve as national leaders in the emerging development of shared measurement systems for evaluating progress toward BPC. ECEP 2.0 will continue these efforts through mini-grants and toolkits supporting state landscape report development, stakeholder meetings and state summits, the ECEP Expert Bureau, ad hoc coaching sessions, and the ECEP Annual Meeting. In addition, ECEP 2.0 investigators will leverage their expertise and experience to facilitate three Networked Improvement Communities (NICs) for ECEP states, one focused on pre-service teacher preparation, one on 2-year to 4-year post-secondary pathways, and the third on BPC-related professional development. ECEP state teams will continue their work on education policy reform efforts and serve as the laboratories for iteratively developing, testing, and refining new state-level strategies, policies and interventions for K-16 BPC. \r\n\r\nECEP 2.0 will employ three primary strategies: \r\n\r\nStrategy 1: Catalyze, incubate, and sustain state leadership teams focused on BPC. \r\nStrategy 2: Support states in developing long range goals for BPC as well as metrics and data infrastructures for tracking progress toward those goals. \r\nStrategy 3: Research best practices in BPC pathways at a state level, leverage the power of the ECEP network to capture best practices and lessons learned, and contribute to the emerging knowledge base around systems-level strategies for impacting BPC. \r\n\r\nECEP 2.0 will also develop and disseminate resources and research regarding K-16 BPC so as to benefit both ECEP and non-ECEP states.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

ECEP put its 5-Stage Model of State Change into action by incubating diverse state leadership teams and building their capacity to catalyze specific interventions, strategies and policies to advance statewide BPC goals.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>From 2018 - 2023, the ECEP Alliance grew from 17 states and the territory of Puerto Rico to 29 states and the territory of Puerto Rico while also serving as a national hub for BPC related resources for leaders in non-member states.&nbsp; In addition to growing the reach of the Alliance, some key accomplishments of ECEP 2.0 include:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Piloting the New England Common Metrics project to help states build shared measures for identifying underserved populations and tracking progress toward BPC goals. This pilot has led to a national scale up called the Common Metrics Project which is building state data collection and visualization capacity across the nation.&nbsp;</span></p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Publication and dissemination of the ECEP Landscape Report Toolkit and State Summit Toolkit, which have been used by numerous states as templates for creating their own CS data reports and hosting state summits.&nbsp;</span></p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Curation of sample state CS landscape reports, CS data dashboards, state summit agendas, state CS policies, and state strategic plans for K12 CS on the ECEP website to serve as a national resource for others engaging in similar work.&nbsp;</span></p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Development of an ECEP state application process, the ECEP Membership Framework to define both the benefits and responsibilities of ECEP members, and an onboarding process for supporting new states.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Using research on state journey&rsquo;s of systemic change to refine the ECEP How to Change a State Model by adding a fifth stage related to data collections and utilization.&nbsp;</span></p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Serving as a laboratory for refining the CAPE Framework (Fletcher &amp; Warner, 2021) as a tool for examining equitable capacity for, access to, participation in, and experiences of CS education at multiple, intersecting levels of the CS education ecosystem. CAPE has quickly become an influential resource for researchers, practitioners, policymakers and funders both in the U.S. and internationally who are building CS education programs and interrogating the root causes of inequities in CS education systems.&nbsp;</span></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Ultimately the goal of the ECEP Alliance is to improve underserved student outcomes in computing.&nbsp; For the 17 states with data which have been a part of ECEP 2 since 2018, ECEP states are outperforming non-ECEP states in numerous ways.</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>EQUITABLE CAPACITY</strong><span><strong>:</strong> ECEP Alliance states are more likely (82%) to collect and report disaggregated data regarding student enrollment in CS courses than non-ECEP states (72%). This data infrastructure allows ECEP states to identify disparities in student participation based on measures such as race/ethnicity, gender, and disability status and set goals for improvement. ECEP states are also more likely than non-ECEP states to have a CS state strategic plan, preservice CS teacher certification, state funding for CS teacher professional learning, a requirement that all high schools offer CS, and higher education admissions CS policies. For every policy in the 2023 State of CS Report, the percentage of ECEP states implementing that policy exceeds the percentage of non-ECEP states.&nbsp;</span></p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>EQUITABLE ACCESS</strong><span><strong>:</strong> On average, 75% of high schools in ECEP states offer at least one CS course compared to 55% of high schools in non-ECEP states.&nbsp;</span></p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>EQUITABLE PARTICIPATION</strong><span>: Female enrollment in CS courses in ECEP states is 32% compared to 28% in non-ECEP states.&nbsp;</span></p>\n</li>\n<li><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-bfeeb980-7fff-989e-67da-33323b83937b\"><strong>EQUITABLE EXPERIENCE:</strong> Females in ECEP states are slightly more likely to pass both the AP CSA and AP CSP exams than females in non-ECEP states. Black, Asian, Pacific Islander, and Multi-ethnic students from ECEP State passed the AP CSA and AP CSP exams at a higher rate than similar students in non-ECEP states.</span></li>\n</ol><ol> </ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>By connecting broad-base teams of diverse states leaders across the country, ECEP has been able to identify and address many of the deeply ingrained systemic barriers to BPC that have hindered large scale national progress toward diversifying computing education pathways. Most importantly, the structural changes ECEP supports are institutionalized through policy, thus laying a strong foundation for sustainable improvements over the long term.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 02/29/2024<br>\nModified by: Carol&nbsp;Fletcher</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n \n\n\nThe Expanding Computing Education Pathways (ECEP) Alliance 2.0 facilitated a collective impact network dedicated to broadening participation in computing (BPC) education pathways and focused on states as a unit of change. ECEP put its 5-Stage Model of State Change into action by incubating diverse state leadership teams and building their capacity to catalyze specific interventions, strategies and policies to advance statewide BPC goals.\n\n\nFrom 2018 - 2023, the ECEP Alliance grew from 17 states and the territory of Puerto Rico to 29 states and the territory of Puerto Rico while also serving as a national hub for BPC related resources for leaders in non-member states. In addition to growing the reach of the Alliance, some key accomplishments of ECEP 2.0 include:\n\n\n\n\nPiloting the New England Common Metrics project to help states build shared measures for identifying underserved populations and tracking progress toward BPC goals. This pilot has led to a national scale up called the Common Metrics Project which is building state data collection and visualization capacity across the nation.\n\n\n\n\nPublication and dissemination of the ECEP Landscape Report Toolkit and State Summit Toolkit, which have been used by numerous states as templates for creating their own CS data reports and hosting state summits.\n\n\n\n\nCuration of sample state CS landscape reports, CS data dashboards, state summit agendas, state CS policies, and state strategic plans for K12 CS on the ECEP website to serve as a national resource for others engaging in similar work.\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment of an ECEP state application process, the ECEP Membership Framework to define both the benefits and responsibilities of ECEP members, and an onboarding process for supporting new states.\n\n\n\n\nUsing research on state journeys of systemic change to refine the ECEP How to Change a State Model by adding a fifth stage related to data collections and utilization.\n\n\n\n\nServing as a laboratory for refining the CAPE Framework (Fletcher & Warner, 2021) as a tool for examining equitable capacity for, access to, participation in, and experiences of CS education at multiple, intersecting levels of the CS education ecosystem. CAPE has quickly become an influential resource for researchers, practitioners, policymakers and funders both in the U.S. and internationally who are building CS education programs and interrogating the root causes of inequities in CS education systems.\n\n\n\n\nUltimately the goal of the ECEP Alliance is to improve underserved student outcomes in computing. For the 17 states with data which have been a part of ECEP 2 since 2018, ECEP states are outperforming non-ECEP states in numerous ways.\n\n\n\n\nEQUITABLE CAPACITY: ECEP Alliance states are more likely (82%) to collect and report disaggregated data regarding student enrollment in CS courses than non-ECEP states (72%). This data infrastructure allows ECEP states to identify disparities in student participation based on measures such as race/ethnicity, gender, and disability status and set goals for improvement. ECEP states are also more likely than non-ECEP states to have a CS state strategic plan, preservice CS teacher certification, state funding for CS teacher professional learning, a requirement that all high schools offer CS, and higher education admissions CS policies. For every policy in the 2023 State of CS Report, the percentage of ECEP states implementing that policy exceeds the percentage of non-ECEP states.\n\n\n\n\nEQUITABLE ACCESS: On average, 75% of high schools in ECEP states offer at least one CS course compared to 55% of high schools in non-ECEP states.\n\n\n\n\nEQUITABLE PARTICIPATION: Female enrollment in CS courses in ECEP states is 32% compared to 28% in non-ECEP states.\n\nEQUITABLE EXPERIENCE: Females in ECEP states are slightly more likely to pass both the AP CSA and AP CSP exams than females in non-ECEP states. Black, Asian, Pacific Islander, and Multi-ethnic students from ECEP State passed the AP CSA and AP CSP exams at a higher rate than similar students in non-ECEP states.\n \n\n\nBy connecting broad-base teams of diverse states leaders across the country, ECEP has been able to identify and address many of the deeply ingrained systemic barriers to BPC that have hindered large scale national progress toward diversifying computing education pathways. Most importantly, the structural changes ECEP supports are institutionalized through policy, thus laying a strong foundation for sustainable improvements over the long term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/29/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: CarolFletcher\n"
