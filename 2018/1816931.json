 "awd_abstract_narration": "Robust and accurate occupancy assessment is key to many applications. Optimization of heating/cooling in buildings, smart lighting, retail business planning, smart home applications, smart city planning, and evacuation/emergency planning are just a few examples. The overall goal of this proposal is to introduce a new paradigm for occupancy assessment using ubiquitous wireless signals.  Not only are communication devices ubiquitous these days, but most smart devices whose main goal is not communication (e.g., smart speakers or thermostats) are now equipped with communication capabilities using cheap communication transceivers such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. This opens the possibility of using RF (Radio Frequency) signals for sensing and learning about the environment. This project proposes to use wireless links in a non-traditional manner: as a sensing mechanism for assessing the spatio-temporal occupancy dynamics in a large region. Spatio-temporal occupancy assessment refers to measuring several attributes of how people move and utilize their spaces, such as the total number of occupants in an area as a function of time, the average speed and dwell time of people, and the flow rate of people in between several areas, among other factors. More specifically, the project will develop the theoretical foundation and design tools for occupancy assessment with ubiquitous RF signals, with an emphasis on understanding the fundamental capabilities and limitations.  The proposed framework does not rely on people to carry any device, has through-wall sensing capabilities, and preserves the privacy.\r\n\r\nAccurate and robust occupancy assessment with everyday communication signals is considerably challenging.  The proposed effort has three major tasks to address the underlying challenges. The first major goal brings a foundational understanding to how a single link can be turned into an occupancy assessment sensor whose capabilities and limitations are well characterized. More specifically, it proposes a mathematical probabilistic modeling that reveals the relationship between the key attributes of occupancy dynamics and the key attributes of the wireless measurements.  The second major task then builds on the first one to develop the foundation of optimum joint processing of a number of links as an occupancy assessment sensor network.  The third major task develops the mathematical tools for designing an efficient occupancy assessment system over a large region that consists of several areas, with only a small number of wireless links.  Finally, the proposed theoretical foundation and design tools are extensively tested with several experiments in different areas, including local department stores.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Natural body fidgets are the small in-place body motions that people naturally engage in while seated, e.g., adjusting seating positions, crossing legs, etc. More specifically, we proposed that the aggregate natural fidgeting and in-place motions of a seated crowd carry crucial information on the crowd count, and showed how to estimate the total number of people from the aggregate crowd fidgets.&nbsp;In developing our method, we first revealed how this problem resembles a several-decade-old queuing theory problem, a seemingly-unrelated problem from a completely different field. This then allowed us to borrow mathematical tools from queuing theory to develop a completely new technique for counting the total number of stationary people with WiFi.&nbsp; We tested the proposed approach with a total of 37 experiments, including many through-wall settings. A video of this work went viral in 2021, and several reputable news agencies such as BBC, ABC Australia, ACM tech News, Gizmodo, covered the new invention (e.g., BBC coverage&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/w3ct1lsp\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/w3ct1lsp</a>&nbsp;minute 14).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2) We have proposed a new method for imaging objects and scene understanding, using RF signals, based on tracing edges, using the Geometrical Theory of Diffraction (GTD).&nbsp; More specifically, while most RF imaging approaches focus on surfaces, we instead focused on edges (surface points with a small curvatures).&nbsp; When an incoming wave is incident on an edge, a cone exits, known as a Keller ones, according to the GTD. &nbsp;The orientation of the edge then dictates the orientation of the cone, leaving a footprint on the receiver array which implicitly carries information on the edge orientation.&nbsp; Based on this principle, we then developed a new signal processing pipeline for RF imaging using diffraction. &nbsp;We extensively tested this approach for complex scene understanding through walls, with 37 experiments.&nbsp; For instance, we showed how WiFi can read the English alphabet through walls for the first time, in a recent ACM MobiCom 2022 paper.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3) We developed a new framework that has enabled, for the first time, identifying a person through wall from a candidate video footage, using only WiFi signals.&nbsp; Consider the case that a video footage of a person is available.&nbsp; A pair of WiFi transceivers are inserted outside of a building and are tasked with figuring out if the person in the video is behind these walls.&nbsp; We have shown, for the first time, that this is indeed possible.&nbsp; More specifically, we have proposed a framework that can translate the video content to the RF domain by using 3D mesh recovery algorithms and an efficient electromagnetic wave approximation on the extracted mesh.&nbsp; Then, our proposed signal processing pipeline extracts several key features from both the real RF signal, measured on the WiFI cards, and the video-to-RF one, and established if they belong to the same person.&nbsp; A video of this work went viral online in 2019, and several reputable news agencies such as BBC covered the new invention.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4) Past attempts towards solving an RF sensing problem with a DNN are not generalizable, due to the lack of sufficient RF training data.&nbsp; In this grant, we have shown how to solve this problem.&nbsp; More specifically, we have proposed a novel, generalizable, and scalable idea that eliminates the need for collecting Radio Frequency (RF) measurements, when training RF sensing systems. Recent years have seen a growing, massive number of online videos involving various human activities/motions. We then proposed a pipeline that can translate such already-available online videos to instant synthetic RF data for training any human-motion-based RF sensing system, and extensively validated it with several experiments.</p>\n<p>5) we have proposed a new framework to estimate the occupancy dynamics and traffic flow over a large area (e.g., a retail store), based on the received power measurements of wireless links that are sparsely installed throughout the space, and without relying on people to carry any device.&nbsp; We have thoroughly validated our framework with several experiments in three different retail stores.</p>\n<p>6) Outreach: Over the course of this project, Mostofi?s lab has been involved in a variety of outreach activities. Examples include a number of talks to inspire the next generation of women scientists at the IEEE Women In Control (WIC) luncheon of the IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, at the Women in Engineering (WIE) IEEE IoT panel, and at the Society of Women Engineering (SWE) at UCSB.&nbsp; Mostofi further hosted three undergraduates in her lab that helped the graduate students with various aspects of the project.
