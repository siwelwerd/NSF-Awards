 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2018 Center for Mathematics at Notre Dame program will consist of a series of three programs, held from June 11 to 29 of 2018 at the University of Notre Dame. The three programs include an undergraduate summer school June 11-15, a graduate summer school June 18-22, and a conference on Geometric Representation Theory and Symplectic Varieties June 25-29. The purpose of the program is to introduce students at various levels to important ideas in geometric representation theory, which is an active and important area of mathematics. The goal of the first week is to expose undergraduates to fundamental ideas they would not normally see until graduate school. We will introduce material through a combination of lectures and active learning sessions, with the aim of inspiring students to take advanced courses or reading courses in their future studies. The second and third weeks will consist of a summer school geared towards graduate students in the field, followed by a conference that will present current research on topics developed in the second week. The goal of the second week is to inspire graduate students to explore connections between different areas of mathematics, beyond the level they may see in their own graduate program. We also hope to bring together graduate students and postdocs from different institutions so they can develop productive professional relationships.  We note that many students from previous Center for Mathematics at Notre Dame programs have gone on to get a Ph.D. in mathematics, and one invited speaker at our 2018 conference attended our 2011 program as a graduate student.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the program Geometric Representation Theory and Symplectic Varieties is to bring together researchers working in these areas and make these techniques accessible to a broad audience. The first week will discuss generalized flag varieties and their geometry, as well as the Beilinson-Bernstein correspondence for sl(2). The second week will expose basic ideas from geometric representation theory of symplectic resolutions, and includes lecture series by recognized experts in the field. The third week will consist of an international conference on the program topic, and will present current research on many of the ideas from the graduate summer school. The program website is available at www3.nd.edu/~cmnd/programs/cmnd2018/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The first week consisted of an undergraduate summer school with 22 participants, and the goal was to introduce accessible aspects of the subject to undergraduates who do not ordinarily see this material until graduate school. The second week was a summer school aimed at graduate students and postdoctoral researchers who have already begun their study of this area.   The third week was an international conference, which was made more accessible to students by the lectures of the previous week.   The NSF grant supported 66 participants in the program, with remaining funds provided by the Center for Mathematics at Notre Dame.\n\nIntellectual merit: the undergraduate program introduced high level ideas to undergraduates through lectures and extensive problem sessions.   We also held a panel on graduate school.   The second week featured an exposition of important high-level ideas not yet accessible in textbook form.   This was accomplished through four lecture series given by Kevin McGerty, Ben Webster, Victor Ginzburg, and Tom Braden, and one problem session each day.  The third week featured talks by leading international researchers in the area, and provided a relaxed setting where junior people could discuss relevant ideas with leading researchers, and collaborations could develop.\n\nBroader impact: the 22 undergraduate attendees the first week represented 20 diistinct undergraduate institutions, including leading private universities like Columbia, Cornell, and the California Institute of Technology, elite liberal arts colleages like Williams College, Oberlin College, and Smith College, and large state universities like University of North Carolina, University of Virginia, University of California Berkeley, University of Pittsburgh, and Wichita State University.   Five of the students were women, and one was African-American.  One of the lecturers and the main teaching assistant were women.     Lecture notes were distributed to the students, and the lecturers and teaching assistants plan to use these notes in future courses. There were 51 participants during the graduate week, including 7 women.    Lecture notes were distributed, which will help students further develop their understanding of this area.   There were a number of participants from University of Toronto and University of Illinois Urbana Champaign, but also participants from midwestern state universities like Indiana University, Wisconsin-Madison,  and Ohio State, participants from state universities like North Carolina, University of California branches at Berkeley, Davis, and Riverside, Texas A&amp;M and Utah, and private universities like Harvard, Cornell, Northwestern, and Northeastern.
