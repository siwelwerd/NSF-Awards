 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the primary tasks of engineers is to optimize designs, i.e., improve the performance of designs, through computer simulation. Since this can be time-consuming and expensive, engineers are faced with the following set of tough questions: Is it worth optimizing a given design? How much can the performance be improved through computer simulation? Can one predict the benefits of design optimization, without investing several days of computing? This project will address these questions through fundamental research on predictive simulation techniques. New algorithms will be established that will permit engineers to rapidly predict the benefits of design optimization, prior to investing time and effort into a detailed investigation. This has the potential to improve industrial competitiveness significantly by allowing designers to focus their limited resources on only the most promising optimization problems. The research team will publish the findings in journals and conference proceedings; the team will also release the resulting software to the scientific community. The team will conduct engineering workshops for high-school students, including underrepresented minority students, on engineering simulation and optimization. Case-studies from local industries and student-car projects will be used as design challenges. The broader impact of the industrial interaction is on budding engineers who will be exposed to a unique blend of research, industrial experience, and formal education.\r\n\r\nIn the project, the concept of Pareto-optimal distances will be used as a metric for predicting the benefits of design optimization. The Pareto-optimal distances, for a given design, is a set of axis-aligned distances to the Pareto-optimal manifold; these distances will be estimated via the topological sensitivity field. Preliminary results indicate that these Pareto-optimal distances can indeed be used to estimate the benefits of design optimization, i.e., greater the distance, greater the benefit. Using this simple concept, designers can make rational decisions on design optimization. The following questions will be addressed in this project: (1) Can the Pareto-optimality concept be applied to problems beyond the structural mechanics problems considered thus far? (2) Can this concept be used to rank-order parts within an assembly for design optimization? (3) How can these concepts be generalized to include constraints, multi-load scenarios, and material design? (4) Can second-order and error-correction strategies be developed to improve the efficacy of these predictive methods?\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
