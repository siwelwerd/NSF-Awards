 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research activities of Professor Daniel Robbins at the University at Albany. \r\n\r\nConformal field theories (CFT's) are used in physics to describe phase transitions (such as ice melting into water), or to understand what happens in a quantum theory at very low or very high energies.  CFT's also play a central role in string theory, which is the leading candidate for a quantum theory of gravity that unifies all of the fundamental forces of nature.  Strings moving in different geometrical spaces are described by different CFT's that in turn lead to different physical phenomena and properties.  This research program will explore the connections between CFT's, geometry, and the resulting physical laws.  This work advances the national interest by fostering the progress of fundamental science at the interdisciplinary boundary between physics and mathematics, and thereby strengthening fundamental science within the United States.  Students, both graduate and undergraduate, will also be involved in this project, receiving research training from Professor Robbins and receiving opportunities to present their work to other researchers.\r\n\r\nOn a more technical level, this project will apply recently developed CFT techniques to a class of superconformal field theories (SCFT's) constructed from special holonomy manifolds. The philosophy and tools of the conformal bootstrap program and the modular bootstrap program, both of which exploit CFT consistency conditions in order to derive constraints on the defining data of a CFT, will be used to find constraints on the geometrical data of a class of manifolds that play an important role in string theory, and to explore aspects of their moduli spaces and the physical properties of the corresponding string theory constructions. The project will also apply recent ideas and tools from the study of CFT defects to the same class of SCFT's, investigating connections between theories connected by domain walls, boundary SCFT's, D-branes in the associated string theories, and the study of mathematical invariants of special holonomy manifolds.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nString theory is a proposed framework in physics in which point particles are replaced by strings. One reason that physicists study this possibility is that it provides a quantum theory of gravity - it allows the unification of Einstein's theory of general relativity with quantum mechanics. However, for consistency, string theory requires the strings to live in nine spatial dimensions instead of three, or at least that should be the effective description at very high energies. In order to connect to the relatively low-energy physics which governs the universe as we observe it, we must figure out how the extra dimensions get curled up, or \"compactified\". If they are curled up tightly enough, then they would not be directly visible to existing physics experiments, and so this scenario has not been ruled out. There can be many ways of doing this compactification, and making different choices leads to different effective physics. As an example, if we want to have supersymmetry (a property of particle physics for which there are hints, but as of yet no experimental evidence) at relatively low energies, then we should look for our curled up dimensions to have a restricted, or special, \"holonomy group\". The holonomy group of a space is roughly a measure for how much a vector can get rotated as we move around the space. So in a space with special holonomy, vectors can only get rotated in certain ways. If this is arranged correctly, it leads to supersymmetry in the low energy physics.\n\n\nPart of the research pursued in this project involved the study of strings moving in these special holonomy spaces. There is a three-way dialog at work between the geometric properties of the compactification spaces, the quantum theory governing string propagation, and the low energy effective physics. By taking theoretical tools and techniques for studying quantum field theories and applying them to the theory of strings probing these spaces, we learned about the geometry of special holonomy spaces, and improved our understanding of the effective theory of low energy physics.\n\nIn general, extrapolating physics between energy scales in a quantum theory is a non-trivial task. One very important method to connect these regimes is to look at the symmetries of the theory. Traditionally, physicists have thought of symmetries in terms of transformations on configurations (also called states) of the theory. A symmetry is a transformation that commutes with the dynamical evolution of the configuration, i.e. if we apply the symmetry transformation and then wait for a fixed time t, we get the same result as if we waited for time t and then applied the transformation. In recent years, new perspectives have been developed in how to think about symmetries in quantum theories, and how the idea of a symmetry can be generalized in useful ways. A major outcome of the research funded by this award was to apply these new perspectives to the case where some symmetries leave all configurations invariant, and how such cases connect (via a procedure called \"gauging\") to theories which split into different sectors that can only communicate with each other through certain non-local (extended) operators. This latter phenomenon, called \"decomposition\" was also shown to play a role in describing how certain generalized symmetry operators interact with each other.\n\n\nFinally, this award also supported work studying non-supersymmetric compactifications of string theory, where the supersymmetry is broken before we try to curl up any of the extra dimensions. We found examples of such solutions that were stable under small perturbations and existed in a regime where calculations could be performed. We even found examples that were intrinsically quantum in nature; they could only exist by balancing classical (tree-level) and quantum (one-loop) effects with each other. There will be much to learn from these examples in the coming months and years.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/01/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DanielGRobbins\n"
