 "awd_abstract_narration": "The transfer of genetic material between cells outside of reproduction is horizontal gene transfer and is common within bacterial populations. Gene exchange changes the activity and functional capabilities of microbes. Control of gene exchange will enable new experimental methods to understand the function of microbial communities and will aid in the development of advanced biotechnologies. Three traditional mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer are transduction, transformation, and conjugation, although extracellular vesicles made by most bacterial species also facilitate gene exchange. This research will analyze the parameters that impact the production and exchange of extracellular vesicles within bacterial populations to better understand how cells utilize extracellular vesicles for gene exchange. The broader impacts will be achieved through work with local STEM organizations to develop hands-on activities to teach middle and high school students the biophysics of the genome as well as developing a quantitative modeling of biological processes course for undergraduates studying biophysics. \r\n\r\nVesicle-mediated gene transfer may be a universal route of gene exchange within microbial populations, although parameters that modulate the efficiency of gene exchange through vesicles remain unclear. The project examines how the formation and uptake of DNA containing extracellular vesicles are influenced by characteristics of the exchanged genetic material and the donor and recipient bacterial species, including properties of the outer membrane. Transposon mutagenesis screens will reveal additional factors that regulate the dynamics of vesicle-mediated gene transfer. Gene transfer into wild isolates will be experimentally measured and theoretically modeled to assess the contribution of vesicles to gene exchange in wild populations. A quantitative understanding of the processes that shape the dynamics of gene transfer in vesicles will help formulate strategies to control the transfer of specific genetic components within microbial populations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The focus of our work was the transfer of genetical material, pieces of DNA, between cells. The exchange of DNA between bacteria, a process known as horizontal gene transfer, naturally occurs within bacterial populations and is important to bacterial evolution and the development and spread of antibiotic resistance. The project examined how DNA and cell characteristics influenced the ability of genes to be exchanged within bacterial vesicles.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong></p>\n<p>The exchange of genes within vesicles involves three basic processes: the formation of vesicles by a donor cell, the loading of vesicles with DNA, and the uptake of vesicles by a recipient cell. This project analyzed several biological parameters that influenced these three steps of vesicle formation. First, the loading of different types of DNA into vesicles was measured. A type of DNA commonly exchanged by bacterial cells is called plasmid DNA. Plasmids are small, circular pieces of DNA that contain several genes. There are several types of plasmids, which differ in the mechanism used to replicate the plasmid. Plasmid can also have different sizes, the total length of DNA in the plasmid, and different copy numbers. The copy number of a plasmid is the number of plasmid molecules that can be found in one cell, with most plasmids having copy numbers between 1 and 500. The ability of different types of plasmids to be packaged into vesicles as molecular cargo was measured. These measurement revealed that the copy number of a plasmid and the plasmid mechanism of replication both were important factors that determine plasmid loading into vesicles.</p>\n<p>Next the project examined how molecules produced by cells can influence vesicle production and uptake. Both vesicle production and uptake involve cellular membranes changing shape. There are many molecules known to bind to membranes and deform their shape. Such membrane deforming molecules were added to cultures of bacteria and the rates of vesicle production and uptake were measured. The results demonstrated that several molecules bacteria naturally produce, including signaling molecules and molecules that act as antibiotics, have the ability both to influence vesicle exchange. Addition of these molecules to cell cultures increased vesicle production by nearly five-fold and decreased the time needed to uptake a vesicles by several hours. When these compounds were added to cultures of cells containing two different bacterial strains, gene exchange between these strains was greatly increased.</p>\n<p>To put these findings in the broader context of gene and biomolecule exchange within vesicles, this work also used computer simulations to analyze the exchange of bacterial signals within vesicles and gene exchange within diverse, microbial ecosystems. The simulations related to signal exchange in vesicles revealed that vesicles can play an important role in bacterial communication. The ability of vesicles to deliver many biomolecules simultaneously during vesicle uptake significantly changes the response to a signal. In another simulation, the ability of DNA to move between different species of bacteria was analyzed. These simulations incorporated all known mechanisms of gene transfer between cells, including vesicle-mediated transfer. The simulations demonstrated that gene exchange in vesicles, although slow, has the potential to enable DNA exchange between distantly related species of bacteria, which likely has a large influence on evolution within natural bacterial ecosystems.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong></p>\n<p>Outreach associated with this project also served to educate the public about gene exchange by bacteria and raised awareness of research in microbial ecology.
