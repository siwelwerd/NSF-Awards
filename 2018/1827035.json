 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microbiomes play an important role in the health and development of their plant or animal host, as well as contributing to the nutrient and element cycles that are fundamental to maintaining balance in soil, water, and air. Research into microbiomes and their impact on ecosystems and the environment represents a new and exciting challenge for the scientific community. New technologies offer an opportunity to bring the excitement of microbiome research to undergraduate students through training in the scientific process and engagement in research. Using a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) model, microbiome projects allow students to conduct experiments that reveal the diversity and complexity of local environmental microbiomes. The Research Experiences in Microbiomes Network (REMNet) project will organize a national network of microbiome experts and CURE practitioners who will create a set of resources for college faculty to involve undergraduate students across the country in microbiome research.\r\n\r\nThe REMNet will provide and distribute tools for metagenomic analysis tools and lesson plans appropriate for undergraduate classes and will advance our understanding of the diversity of local environmental microbiomes. The REMNet will work closely with the American Society of Microbiology (ASM) at national meetings such as the ASM-Conference for Undergraduate Educators and Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students to recruit new members. Existing microbiome CURE research projects at the City University of New York, the lead institution of the Authentic Research Experience in Microbiology, currently serve hundreds of students from diverse ethnic and academic backgrounds each year; this RCN-UBE project will expand this effort to a national scale as new schools are recruited. The REMNet will broaden participation in microbiome research by undergraduates and will lead to the development of new resources and a standardization of the tools used for microbiome data analysis.\r\n\r\nThis project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange/finalreport/).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In order to achieve this, we formed the RCN-UBE Research Experiences with Microbiomes Network (REMNet).</p>\r\n<p>The study of microbiomes, the microbes (bacteria, viruses, fungi, and others) that colonize a specific host organism or specific environment, such as water, soil, or built infrastructure, has increased rapidly over the past decade. The role of microorganisms in human, animal, and plant health and function has been found to be more significant than initially expected, as has the role of environmental microorganisms in contributing to cycling of nutrients and elements, such as carbon and nitrogen. The study of the dynamic field of microbiomes has in part been driven by advances in next generation DNA sequencing and the availability of tools and computational power to analyze large data sets. As costs have dropped, and accessibility has increased, the resources needed for microbiome studies are now available to many undergraduate faculty and students. As these changes have come quickly, and with a broad array of options, an important role of REMNet has been to identify and adapt the sequencing and data analysis tools for use in the undergraduate classroom and laboratory environment, and to train faculty to use these resources.</p>\r\n<p>In 2018, at the outset of REMNet, we focused on using the Illumina sequencing platform to sequence microbiome DNA samples, and the Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME 2) analysis pipeline for the DNA sequence data. Our model was to have faculty and their students develop and design an experiment, or identify a set of samples they wanted to explore, and carry out the sample collection and DNA extraction using standard methods. At REMNet, we helped with tailoring protocols for scaled-up undergraduate laboratory settings, and finding ways to reduce reagent and equipment costs. Once DNA samples had been collected, we worked with a handful of commercial sequencing companies to carry out the Illumina sequencing. When the sequencing was complete and the data had been delivered by the sequencing company, the REMNet support team carried out the initial data processing and analysis with QIIME 2, which often required computer coding expertise than many faculty lacked. When more user-friendly sequence data analysis pipelines became available, such as Nephele (from NIH-NIAID) we provided training sessions and workshops to help faculty learn the skills needed to carry out their own data analyses with their students. During the COVID pandemic (spring 2020 through fall 2021) we focused on remote online webinars and workshops to provide training in microbiome data analysis and data presentation. In the summer of 2023, we made a transition from the Illumina sequencing platform to using the inexpensive, small, and versatile Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencer. The benefits of using the MinION sequencer, in addition to the reduced costs for smaller microbiome sequencing projects, are that the DNA sequencing can be done on site in the classroom or lab and that allows greater flexibility and teaching and training opportunities for students to gain hands-on experience in sequencing their DNA samples. The last year of the REMNet Microbiomes for All! Efforts focused on developing training resources and running workshops for microbiome sequencing using the MinION system.</p>\r\n<p>Over the course of the REMNet Microbiomes for All! Active grant period we worked directly in training and supporting ~450 faculty members at over 300 academic institutions across the country. The REMNet training included faculty at diverse institutions, including: 4 PBIs, 61 HSIs, 12 HBCUs, and 41 AANAPISIs. In addition to the training, we provided directly to faculty, we estimate that an equivalent number of faculty used REMNet resources available on the REMNet Microbiomes for All! Website, the REMNet YouTube channel, and the workshop videos recorded and made available by the ASM. Finally, we expect the work of REMNet to continue past the period of NSF support. Through the resources and expertise we have accumulated since the inception of the grant, we can continue to provide online training and local workshops for faculty interested in getting training for microbiome research projects with their students.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 02/05/2025<br>\nModified by: Theodore&nbsp;R&nbsp;Muth</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1827035/1827035_10573818_1738792374399_Microbiomes_for_All_Website--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1827035/1827035_10573818_1738792374399_Microbiomes_for_All_Website--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Microbiomes for All! website\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1827035/1827035_10573818_1738792374399_Microbiomes_for_All_Website--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Microbiomes for All! website\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Microbiomes for All! website homepage</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Theodore Muth</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Theodore&nbsp;R&nbsp;Muth\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Microbiomes for All! website</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1827035/1827035_10573818_1738792442072_REMNet_Summer_2025--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1827035/1827035_10573818_1738792442072_REMNet_Summer_2025--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"REMNet workshop 2025\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1827035/1827035_10573818_1738792442072_REMNet_Summer_2025--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"REMNet workshop 2025\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REMNet Nanopore MinION training workshop 2025 - at Texas A&M, San Antonio</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Theodore Muth</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Theodore&nbsp;R&nbsp;Muth\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">REMNet workshop 2025</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1827035/1827035_10573818_1738792317866_REMNet_GRC_Poster--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1827035/1827035_10573818_1738792317866_REMNet_GRC_Poster--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"REMNet GRC poster\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1827035/1827035_10573818_1738792317866_REMNet_GRC_Poster--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"REMNet GRC poster\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REMNet GRC poster</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Theodore Muth</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Theodore&nbsp;R&nbsp;Muth\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">REMNet GRC poster</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1827035/1827035_10573818_1738792492223_REMNet_YouTube--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1827035/1827035_10573818_1738792492223_REMNet_YouTube--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"REMNet YouTube site\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1827035/1827035_10573818_1738792492223_REMNet_YouTube--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"REMNet YouTube site\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REMNet YouTube site - training videos.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Theodore Muth</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Theodore&nbsp;R&nbsp;Muth\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">REMNet YouTube site</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
