 "awd_abstract_narration": "The temperature within the Earth is high enough to melt rocks as evidenced by volcanoes and volcanic rocks.  It is thereby probable that parts of the Earth's crust and mantle are partially molten even though they are dominantly solid. The goal of this proposal is to improve the understanding of the relationship between the state of partial melting and changes in elastic properties of the media.  The focus will be the upper mantle of the Earth.  Since elastic properties quantitatively define the speed that seismic waves propagate through the media, the results of this research will enable better associations between maps of seismic speed variations and degrees of partial melting.  The approach of this program is to probe the physics and chemistry basics of melting and mechanics yielding a deeper understanding of the underlying principles in order to provide a robust model that can then be applied to a wide variety of environments.   While the focus of the proposal is the upper mantle region of the Earth, an improved model will also be relevant to the crust.  Indeed, the results could also have applications in defining this relationship in industrial settings in detecting incipient stages of melting of various materials.  This program provides a cutting-edge learning experience for students including graduate students in the preparation of their PhD and undergraduate students in the focus of a summer research project.  The results will be used throughout the Earth sciences as fundamental information on the behavior of the Earth's interior.  The tools that are developed will be made available to other researchers for studying strength related properties of materials.  These tools (software and hardware) will immediately become part of the COMPRES-operated synchrotron facility and available to all in the community that wish to use them.  The tools developed here will be useful for studying material properties under extreme environments and will be useful to develop better industrial materials.\r\n\r\nThe authors have recently demonstrated that the current models of the mechanical properties of solid/melt combinations are inadequate and have proposed that the interaction between the solid and melt has a significant effect on the elastic properties.  The new model, \"dynamic melting,\" changes the predicted effect of melting on the relationship between the bulk modulus and the shear modulus. In the dynamic melting model, the kinetics of melting introduces a change in the frequency dependence of the elastic properties.  The current proposal is to carefully test the dynamic melting model by studying a broader range of chemistry of the material and alter the experimental conditions and protocols in order to compare the predicted changes with the experimentally observed changes.  The experiments are made possible by new high pressure capabilities on multi-anvil high pressure apparatus installed at synchrotron light sources.  These systems enable the generation of pressure and temperature of the upper mantle on samples that can then be axially compressed, with the synchrotron yielding images of the sample with very high precision measurements of length, and diffraction profiles that yield state of stress.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n     This research project focused on defining the mechanism and the magnitude of the effect of small amounts of partial melt on the seismic velocity.  This goal is motivated by the broader goal of defining the mineralogy of the Earth?s interior by comparing seismic velocities with those predicted for specific mineralogical models.  In this broader picture, the environment of the Earth, set by the local pressure and temperature, will affect the properties of the minerals, and may alter the crystal structure of various components changing the seismic velocities.  Partial melting has often been associated with low velocities such as the classic LVZ (low-velocity-zone) at around 100 km depth under oceans or the super-low-velocity zone near the core mantle boundary.\n\n      The central question is: will small amounts of partial melting lower seismic velocities and if so, what is the mechanism and by how much?  In a previously supported NSF program, our group discovered that a small amount of partial melt (&lt;5%) could lower the Young?s modulus by over 50%.  This would have an enormous effect on reducing the seismic velocities.  The current models which have been in place for over 50 years would not be able to explain such a large effect.  These models estimate the elastic effect of a non-interacting mechanical mixture of a solid and a liquid.  We expanded this image to include the effects of thermodynamic interactions between the solid and liquid.  A seismic wave is simply a propagating stress wave.  Changes in stress cause a partial melt to further solidify or melt.  The change in the amount of melt changes the volume of the system.  The change in volume with change in pressure changes the bulk modulus.  Using thermodynamical models of partial melting of mantle rocks, we calculate that this phenomenon will have the big effect that we measured.  Thus, the central role of this project was to test this ?dynamic melting? model.\n\n      One big difference between the dynamic melting model and the conventional model is that the bulk modulus is strongly affected by melting with dynamic melting, while conventional wisdom would predict that there would be very little effect of a small amount of melting on the bulk modulus.  Thus, our research focused on the signature of melting on the bulk modulus.  For the dynamic melting model to be operative, the rate of melting in response to pressure change (the kinetics of the reaction) must be fast enough that it can occur within a cycle of the acoustic wave.  Our prior study indicated that near-equilibrium melting happened at times as short as one second, but our resolution could not define the shortest time for melting.\n\n      Our laboratory includes a high-pressure system operating on a synchrotron beamline and an ultrasonic acoustic wave velocity system.  During this research program, we developed modifications of the ultrasonic system that enabled higher amplitude data signals and new data inversion tools that improve the accuracy for small samples. We measured ultrasonic acoustic velocities on a natural peridotite (KLB-1) and found a decrease in velocities progressing with increased melting.  The bulk modulus was lower than conventional models predict by a few per cent.  However, the ultrasonic system creates signals of about 50 MHz yielding the period of the stress wave of nanoseconds.  Based on our kinetic study, we can?t assume that these short periods will see the effect of dynamic melting even if it is operative at seismic periods (1-1000 seconds).  We developed a procedure to sinusoidally compress the sample.  We measured volume via sample imaging and pressure with x-ray diffraction from the sample.  As the data gathering system proceeded, we incrementally increased the temperature from the subsolidus region through into the partial melting region.  Our data was taken for a period of 360 seconds.  The result indicated a precipitous drop in the bulk modulus from around 120 GPa to about 20 GPa over a temperature region corresponding to about 4% melt.  This is consistent with the dynamic melting model but could not be explained with the conventional model. \n\n     Our results indicate that partial melting is an importance process to affect the seismic velocities.  We can quantitatively predict the amount of softening of the seismic velocities by the presence of partial melting using our dynamic melting model, which is supported by our experimental results.  In short, we have presented an important mechanism which can explain the low-velocity zone of the Earth.  We also underscore that acoustic frequency needs to be considered for many issues in relating rock properties to seismic velocities.        \n\n     A second lesson is that we should always test models with real Earth samples.  Experiments using the standard synthetic rock consisting of olivine plus basalt will likely miss the dynamic melting region because the melting relations are completely different from that of mantle rocks.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/29/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Donald J Weidner"
