 "awd_abstract_narration": "Soft solids such as gels, pastes, and emulsions will change their shape and flow when subjected to sufficient forcing.  Understanding and controlling this behavior is central to the processing of these materials in applications ranging from ceramics and pharmaceuticals to food and personal care products.  At the microscopic level, this deformation and flow involves rearrangements of the constituents that are often difficult to identify and characterize.  Furthermore, once flow stops, the force needed to maintain a soft solid's new shape can display a long, slow evolution with time that depends on details of the preceding flow.  This phenomenon provides a potential mechanism for tailoring the properties of the soft solids; however, the microscopic motions within the material that underlie this slow evolution are poorly understood.  This award will support a novel experimental investigation to identify the key microscopic motions associated with the onset and cessation of flow in soft solids and to connect these motions with the solids' macroscopic properties.  A central feature is a technique that uses x-rays to provide unprecedented resolution of the motions within materials at lengths as small as a molecule.  The development of these x-ray methods for investigating soft solids under deformation and flow will have impact far beyond the planned experiments.  This new tool has potential applications that span physics, chemical engineering, and the biosciences.  Graduate and undergraduate students who will be trained in advanced x-ray methods will further contribute to the talent pool needed to advance research and development in the United States.  In addition, the award will provide Baltimore City public school students with opportunities for research internships in the Investigator's laboratory through partnership with a local magnet science high school.\r\n\r\nSoft disordered solids can possess characteristic mechanical properties, such as the emergence of a yield stress, shear thinning upon flow, and thixotropy.  This deformation and flow behavior is central to the utility of these materials in a range of technologies and provides a point of contact with theoretical concepts such as jamming and soft glass rheology.  At the root of the nonlinear rheology are shear-induced changes to the internal microstructure and microstructural dynamics of the soft solids.  Understanding the connections between these microscopic structural dynamics and macroscopic rheological properties remains a central goal for the fields of mechanics and colloid science.  This effort is made challenging by the strong spatial and temporal fluctuations that can characterize the microscopic response to stress and by the out-of-equilibrium nature of many soft disordered solids, which causes their properties to depend not only on thermodynamic conditions but also on their history.  The proposed research will take advantage of the unique strengths of x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) for illuminating the salient nanometer-scale structural dynamics in soft materials to bring insightful perspectives to this problem.  Specifically, the research will leverage and expand newly developed experimental capabilities that combine XPCS with rheometry in novel ways to reveal the particle-scale and mesoscale dynamics at the origins of macroscopic deformation and flow.  Through three specific and inter-related projects focused on nanocolloidal suspensions that form soft-glass and concentrated-gel phases, the experiments will elucidate the microscopic processes leading to stress relaxation, yielding, and aging in ways that enable tests of prevailing theoretical ideas regarding the mechanical properties of soft disordered solids.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Understanding and controlling this behavior is central to the processing of these materials in technologies ranging from ceramics and pharmaceuticals to the production of food and personal care products.  At the microscopic level, this deformation and flow involves spatially heterogeneous rearrangements of the constituents that are often difficult to identify and characterize.  This grant has supported the development and application of a new approach to interrogate such microscopic motion and to relate it the macroscopic forcing and resulting macroscopic deformation.  The approach is based on advanced x-rays techniques that create what are effectively movies of the motion within materials that can resolve displacements on lengths smaller than a nanometer.  \n\n\nThe research employing this new approach had several thrusts.  One thrust addressed the phenomenon known as stress relaxation in which the force needed to maintain a soft solid\u2019s new shape follow cessation of flow decays very slowly with time.  Here, we uncovered unexpected microscopic motions in the form of slow backflow of material that is responsible for this decay.  A second thrust of the project interrogated the rearrangements among the microscopic particles within a soft solid composed of a concentrated suspension of nanometer-sized particles as the solid yielded mechanically in response to an oscillating applied force.  Here, we observed that the amount of irreversible rearrangement among the particles decreased with increasing number of oscillations and showed how this evolution involved a change in the microstructure that effectively encoded a history of the applied forcing.  In a third thrust, we employed the x-ray technique to map the spatially dependent flow velocity within in a particulate suspension whose viscosity decreases strongly with increasing flow rate.  In a fourth thrust, we studied the transformation from fluid to gel in aqueous suspensions of sticky nanometer-scale silica particles.  Here, we tracked the evolution in the microscopic mobility of the particles and quantitatively correlated it with the time-dependent macroscopic mechanical behavior of the suspensions.  Finally, in a fifth thrust, we investigated how the gel properties responded when the strength of attraction, or stickiness, of the particles was suddenly changed.  We discovered that the properties showed a non-monotonic time variation like that seen in studies of glass, thus making a connection between these types of materials with microscopic disorder.   \n\n\nBeyond the scientific advancements made under the grant, we further anticipate that the development of these x-ray methods for investigating soft solids under deformation and flow will have broad impact by providing a new tool whose applications span several traditional disciplines including physics, materials science, chemical engineering, and the biosciences.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/09/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert L Leheny"
