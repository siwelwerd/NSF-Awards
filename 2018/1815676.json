 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part 1: The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to have a multifaceted impact on economy, industry, society, and everyday life. Scaling, performance and complexity of management are among the key challenges in IoT and will largely determine its success. This project aims to leverage Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) in IoT to address those challenges. SDN and NFV facilitate innovation in network control, lowering the barrier to entry for new and advanced functionality in the network. However, so far, the research on these technologies has been primarily focused on centralized systems such as cloud-based telco and enterprise networks.  There are major challenges in applying them to IoT networks because of the large number of heterogeneous and resource-constrained devices and services in IoT (e.g. for health, home, environmental, and transportation monitoring).  This project seeks to address that challenge by developing new approaches for the design of IoT network control, specifically in the SDN control plane and the deployment and management of NFV functionality in data plane, in order to support the large and expanding number of IoT applications that are becoming more critical in everyday life.  \r\n\r\nPart 2: In this project,  a hierarchical decentralization of the SDN control plane is proposed along with an optimization framework for the dynamic balancing of data transmissions and virtual function processing allocations. First, this project will explore a decentralized SDN control plane optimized specifically to meet IoT needs. Second, it will provide a systematic methodology for optimizing the deployment and management of NFV functionality in the data plane based on a solid conceptual foundation.  Cutting-edge theoretical methodologies will be pursued for addressing the above issues, in parallel with network prototyping and experimentation, leveraging ongoing network experimentation efforts at Yale. This will verify the efficacy of the proposed solutions, and will facilitate further development the SDN/NFV-enabled IoT architectures under consideration.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
