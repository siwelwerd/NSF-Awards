The PI will focus on a substrate that is made of an array of closely packed nanoscale cylinders of carbon with diameters on the scale of nanometers and up to about a centimeter in length. These carbon nanotubes resemble rolled \"chicken wire\" on the nanoscale with carbon atoms at the vertices. By adjusting the carbon nanotube structure, the electronic properties of the substrate can be controlled and so the properties, including the optical properties, of the nearby molecule or quantum dot, including how they emit light, can also be controlled. The PI will use a theoretical approach based on quantum mechanics, solid state physics, and optics combined with computer simulations to understand qualitatively and quantitatively how this system may be used for molecular sensing, controlling chemical reactions, as a sensitive probe of the electromagnetic and optical properties of molecules and nanostructures, tunable light sources, and other possible applications.  \r\nThis project is aimed to provide theoretical understanding of capabilities and practical guidance for the experimental development of these closely packed periodically aligned carbon nanotube arrays - ultrathin multifunctional metasurfaces - a new flexible advanced photonic metamaterial platform with the near-field characteristics adjustable on demand by means of the nanotube diameter, chirality and periodicity variation. \r\nThis award supports training a new generation of scientists and engineers capable of harnessing the opportunities presented by nanomaterials for new technologies and to better understand the world around us. This theory and simulation project will help to shape the graduate curriculum of the Department of Mathematics and Physics at North Carolina Central University, the nation's first state-supported public liberal arts college for African Americans. Relevant graduate courses offered by the Department will be revised and enhanced to include aspects of low-dimensional carbon nanomaterials inspired in part by the research. Advanced graduate students will have opportunities to participate in cutting-edge research, attend research symposia, present seminars, and develop Master's theses. Increased exposure of students to this exciting and rapidly expanding field of nanotechnology will lead to increased participation of underrepresented minority students in scientific careers and in graduate studies in scientific fields. This project will thus contribute to broadening the diversity of the next generation of scientists, researchers and engineers and to directly address national needs in the areas of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.\r\n\r\nNONTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis award supports theoretical and computational research and education to advance the fundamental theoretical understanding of near-field interactions and quantum processes in planar closely packed periodically aligned carbon nanotube arrays. Intrinsic mechanisms of plasmon enhanced spectroscopic detection, molecular sensing, and control will be studied using rigorous methods of theoretical solid-state physics, quantum electrodynamics and quantum optics, combined with computer modeling and simulations. Carbon nanotubes have been successfully integrated into miniaturized electronic, electromechanical, and chemical devices, scanning probes, and into nanocomposite materials, offering extraordinary stability, flexibility, and precise tunability of their physical properties. Recent progress in the fabrication of closely packed periodically aligned carbon nanotube arrays opens new opportunities and challenges to develop new material functionalities with these highly anisotropic ultrathin metamaterial structures. Plasmonic bands form because of the nanotube array periodicity, and so the planar closely packed periodic carbon nanotube arrays should behave as epsilon-near-zero plasmonic metasurfaces in the near field while remaining strong light absorbers and polarizers in the far field. The spatial anisotropy and the periodic in-plane transverse inhomogeneity of the array make the electromagnetic field in its vicinity anisotropic and nonlocal, adding both extra flexibility in designing the arrays with desired electromagnetic properties and extra challenges in developing the problem theoretically. Plasmon generated near fields can strengthen weak electronic and/or vibrational molecular transitions to enhance low-energy absorption, scattering and chemical reactivity features for molecules near the planar nanotube array. This project will be focusing on the quantum theory development for near-field electromagnetic absorption and far-field reflection/scattering by extrinsic emitters coupled to spatially anisotropic, periodically inhomogeneous, dissipative magneto-dielectric environment in close proximity to the periodic carbon nanotube array. Process cross-sections will be derived in universal forms suitable both for the experimental interpretation and for the practical guidance of the experimental development to uncover novel functionalities of the planar periodic carbon nanotube arrays as a new flexible advanced photonic metamaterial platform with near-field characteristics adjustable on demand by means of the nanotube diameter, chirality, and array periodicity. Particular practical applications of this theoretical effort include: (a) efficient Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering substrate development for single atom/ ion/molecule detection, trapping and manipulation; (b) precision control of spontaneous emission, absorption and scattering by atomic type emitters trapped near the planar nanotube array metasurfaces; (c) near-field control of molecular chemical reactivity and peculiar Casimir-Polder forces in close proximity to the periodic carbon nanotube arrays.\r\n\r\nThis award supports training a new generation of scientists and engineers capable of harnessing the opportunities presented by nanomaterials for new technologies and to better understand the world around us. This theory and simulation project will help to shape the graduate curriculum of the Department of Mathematics and Physics at North Carolina Central University, the nation's first state-supported public liberal arts college for African Americans.

Present-day nanofabrication techniques make it possible to produce ultrathin films of metals and semiconductors of precisely controlled thickness down to a few monolayers. Often referred to as TD materials, such films offer tailorability of their optoelectronic properties not only by altering their chemical and electronic composition but also by varying their thickness (number of monolayers). Their quantum properties can be understood in terms of confinement-induced nonlocal electromagnetic (EM) response models which allow one to study what the 3D-to-2D continuous transition has to offer to improve material functionalities.</p>\n<p>Thin self-assembled quasiperiodic SWCN arrays and films have recently been experimentally shown to exhibit extraordinary optoplasmonic properties. To facilitate experimental research of these new emerging quantum materials, we study the collective quasiparticle excitations responsible for their EM response. For ultrathin single-type SWCN arrays we show that the real part of their collective dynamical EM response has a negative refraction band near a quantum transition of constituent SWCNs, whereby the system behaves as a hyperbolic metamaterial at much higher frequencies than those provided by classical plasma oscillations. By decreasing SWCN diameters one can push this negative refraction band into the visible region, and using of weakly inhomogeneous multi-type SWCN films can broaden its bandwidth. Our theory exhibits periodically aligned, homogeneous and weakly inhomogeneous SWCN films as excellent candidates for the development of multifunctional optical hyperbolic metasurfaces with characteristics adjustable on demand by means of the nanotube diameter, chirality, periodicity, and film thickness variation.</p>\n<p>We compute spontaneous and stimulated emission intensity lineshape profiles for a quantum dipole emitter (DE) near the surface of a TD film as functions of laser excitation energy, film thickness, and DE distance from the film surface, followed by the analysis of two-photon intensity correlations to explore the quantum effect of photon antibunching. We show that the film thickness can be used to tune the DE coupling to the plasma modes of the film. Controllable thickness reduction greatly improves the quantum effect of photon antibunching and nonclassical sub-Poissonian photon counting statistics. Knowledge of these features is advantageous for solid-state single-photon source device engineering and for the development of the new TD material platform for quantum nanophotonics.</p>\n<p>We perform a comparative study of the basic heat transfer processes in TD systems using the confinement-induced nonlocal EM response model developed by the PI and the standard local Drude EM response model (an old \"workhorse\" used in plasmonics). Our study suggests that the theoretical analysis and experimental data interpretation for radiative heat transfer in TD structures must include the confinement-induced nonlocal effect to provide reliable results. We advance our study to include the long-range Casimir force for in-plane isotropic and anisotropic TD material slabs. We show that the confinement-induced nonlocality not only weakens the attraction of ultrathin in-plane isotropic slabs but also changes the distance dependence of the material-dependent correction to the Casimir force. We use closely packed array of parallel aligned SWCNs in a dielectric layer of finite thickness to show strong orientational anisotropy and crossover behavior for the inter-slab attractive force in addition to its reduction with decreasing slab thickness. We give physical insight as to why such a pair of ultrathin slabs prefers to stick together in the perpendicularly oriented manner, rather than in the parallel relative orientation as one would customarily expect.</p>\n<p>This NSF project has provided great opportunities for professional development and physics curriculum upgrade at NCCU.
