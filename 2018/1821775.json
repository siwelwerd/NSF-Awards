 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anonymity networks, networks that allow users to remain anonymous, are becoming increasingly popular.  It has been reported that Tor, a second the second generation anonymity network, has about 1.2 million regular users.  Although research efforts have generated important results regarding anonymous communication, and that anonymity networks are widely adopted by Internet users, the education on anonymous communication is very limited.  This project will develop and implement a curriculum that will teach students the basics of anonymity networks using game-based learning.  Students completing the curriculum, will have an extensive knowledge of anonymous communication, and will be able to apply this knowledge to combat a range of cybersecurity attacks when they enter the workforce.  Given the increasingly pervasive nature of computing and communication settings and the increasing popularity of anonymity networks, protecting communication privacy, privacy of various Internet applications such as VoIP telephony, and privacy in cyber-physical systems (CPS) is of great societal importance.  Corporations, governments, and security agencies need to understand the capacity of existing anonymous communication networks.\r\n\r\nThe curriculum that will be developed through this project will be based on information theory and will provide a solid scientific foundation by understanding and analyzing the complex relationship among quality of anonymity networks, usability of anonymity networks, and the amount of network resources needed for different anonymizing approaches.  Student assignment and projects will be developed to provide extensive hands-on experience with anonymous communication.   This project will enhance cybersecurity education through:  (1) curriculum development; (2) developing projects using GENI networks for easy replication; (3) utilizing game-based learning; and (4) providing students with the opportunity to do research on anonymous networks.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
