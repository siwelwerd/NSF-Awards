 "awd_abstract_narration": "Catalysts play an essential 'behind-the-scenes' role in many aspects of modern society. For example, catalysts lower the energy loss of producing high performance gasoline from crude oil.  In the production of plastics, catalysts selectively lead chemical reactions down a certain pathway to produce desired products.  The number of potential pathways in catalytic reactions is large, and the catalyst structure itself may change significantly during the reactions.  Due to this complexity, molecular-level aspects of many phenomena in catalysis have not been fully elucidated. Despite being discovered nearly thirty years ago, the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) is one such phenomenon that remains poorly understood at a molecular level. SMSI refers to the strong interaction between a catalytic metal nanoparticle and an oxide support, to which the metal is anchored.  Under reaction conditions that are relatively common, a portion of the oxide support may actually form a film that partially covers the catalytic nanoparticle.  This film can either promote or inhibit catalytic processes, depending upon the particular catalytic materials involved, and a general strategy to understand and control its properties does not exist.  The central goal of this project is, therefore, to unravel the molecular science of how the different components of these catalyst systems work together to enhance catalyst performance.  \r\n\r\nTo use SMSI to promote catalysis by leveraging molecular-level insights, this project will combine periodic Density Functional Theory calculations with surface science experiments and measurements on model nanoparticles to study trends in the structure, energetics, and electronic properties of ultrathin (hydroxy)oxide films on transition metal substrates.  Rigorous models of the films' structures as a function of ambient pressures and temperatures will be developed. The predictions will be performed on single crystal substrate models, and will be refined against a series of ultrahigh vacuum surface science experiments.  The trends that emerge from these combined theoretical and experimental studies will then be validated on nanoparticle models.  It is anticipated the project will provide a wealth of information about ultrathin (hydroxy)oxide/metal interfaces and will suggest new strategies for controlling and exploiting the SMSI.  This fundamental knowledge may, in turn, lead to the development of robust catalysts for energy and health applications.  The work will be carried out by two graduate students who will be trained in state-of-the-art techniques in theoretical and experimental catalysis.  The students will be assisted by high school interns from economically disadvantaged backgrounds who will also be exposed to these forefront scientific methods.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nHeterogeneous catalysts underlie much of the modern chemical industry, and without such catalysts, many products that are used in daily life, from plastics to fuels, would be impossible to produce. Most heterogeneous catalysts consist of active metal nanoparticles immobilized on an inexpensive oxide support. Often, the oxide support is inert, and the metal nanoparticle completely controls the catalysis. However, in certain situations, a phenomenon known as the Strong-Metal Support Interaction (SMSI) may occur, in which the oxide is chemically transformed and either partially or fully covers the active metal. The SMSI often involves the formation of ultrathin (2-3 atomic layers thick) oxide films on the metal nanoparticles, and it can cause profound changes to the properties of the catalyst. However, it is very challenging to control or suppress the SMSI since the chemical transformations that take place, the molecular features of the resulting ultrathin films, and the particular catalysts on which SMSI is likely to occur, are poorly understood.\n\n\nThe fundamental lack of knowledge described above has motivated the present study. To understand how, and under what circumstances, the SMSI occurs, our research team has combined molecular modeling through electronic structure calculations, ultrahigh resolution measurements of catalyst surface structures in clean environments, and practical measurements of catalytic properties under industrially-relevant conditions. The calculations and experimental measurements have been deeply integrated to produce a detailed picture of the molecular transformations that occur when the oxide support interacts with the catalytic metal nanoparticles through the SMSI. Three key results, as well as multiple publications in the scientific literature, have resulted from these investigations. First, we have discovered that hydrogen, which is present in many heterogeneous catalytic reaction environments, can have a profound effect on the structure of ultrathin oxide films that are formed during the SMSI. Second, we have developed of a simple set of physical/chemical principles that, when combined with electronic structure calculations, can estimate the particular reaction conditions (temperature, pressure) and catalyst materials that are likely to experience SMSI. Finally, our team has found that the understanding of oxide/hydroxide structures developed during the project can be used to understand the properties of similar structures on electrocatalysts, which are central to the operation of low temperature fuel cells. In particular, we have learned how ultrathin oxide/hydroxide films can tune the properties of the electrocatalysts, leading to more efficient fuel cell operation.\n\n\nThe fundamental knowledge that has emerged from this project helps to clarify longstanding questions about the nature of the SMSI. Further, the work has facilitated the identification of conditions under which the SMSI is likely to occur, and it has identified ways in which the SMSI, and similar phenomena, may be controlled to promote more efficient heterogeneous catalysts for chemical and renewable applications.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/21/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JeffreyGreeley\n"
