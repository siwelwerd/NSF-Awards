 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is evidence that well-developed spatial skills are strongly correlated with student success in the STEM disciplines. Indeed, the National Science Board identified spatial skills as one of the three critical cognitive skills, along with mathematical and verbal skills, that promote high-level thinking and reasoning leading to the success of students in STEM.  This project aims to improve undergraduate engineering students' spatial skills by updating and assessing an educational technology called 3D Interactive Virtual and Physical Manipulatives (VPM). The VPM technology simultaneously integrates virtual (computer) manipulatives and physical (real-world, tangible) manipulatives, so learners can use multiple senses to process a series of dynamic mental images while performing spatial tasks. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to develop new types of manipulatives with real-world engineering applications to improve undergraduate students' spatial skills and to motivate and inspire interest in engineering. The effectiveness of the VPM technology for undergraduate engineering students will be studied through traditional educational research methods involving quantitative and qualitative data collection, and electroencephalography measure neural efficiency while student participants are performing relevant assessment tests. The research findings from this project will add to the STEM education knowledge base by generating new insights into how simultaneous integration of virtual and physical manipulatives works to enhance learning, and why. The successful completion of this project will enable STEM undergraduates, particularly engineering undergraduates, to improve their spatial skills, helping to prepare them for a successful career in STEM. The research results of this project will be disseminated to the STEM education community through conference presentations and journal publications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSpatial skills are a person\u2019s skills to mentally image the new position or orientation of an object in a 2-dimensional or a 3-dimensional space if its initial position or orientation changes.  Spatial skills are important not only in daily life but also in learning many subject matters in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.  A large amount of research evidence has shown that spatial skills have a statistically significant correlation with student performance and career choices in numerous STEM disciplines.  However, spatial skills are not the skills explicitly taught in the undergraduate STEM curriculum and often get lost among the contents and skills specified in STEM education programs.\n\nThe overall goal of this project was to develop and assess an innovative educational technology called Virtual and Physical Manipulatives (VPM) to improve undergraduate engineering students\u2019 spatial skills.  A manipulative is an object the position or orientation of which a person can change. Over the project period, the project team successfully developed this technology, in which virtual manipulatives are simultaneously integrated with physical manipulatives in a concurrent and interactive manner.  This integration enables learners to simultaneously use multiple senses - see with their eyes while touching with their hands - to help the brain process a series of dynamic mental images while performing spatial tasks. \n\nA total of ten manipulatives were developed in this project.  All manipulatives have real-world applications, such as spinner flasks, door locks, shaft arm valves, and vacuum pumps.  Two groups of engineering undergraduate students were involved in the assessment of VPM technology.  One group consisting of 37 engineering undergraduates, called the invention group, used VPM for learning.  Each of them received one or two manipulatives each week during the course of VPM training.  They also completed pre- and post-tests.  Another group consisting of 34 engineering undergraduates, called the control group, did not use VPM and only completed pre- and post-tests.  The analysis of pre- and post-test results shows that the intervention group achieved 41.2% of the average learning gain; whilst the control group achieved only 8.4% of the average learning gain.  A learning gain is defined as [100% - pre-test score (%)] divided by [post-test score (100%) - pre-test score (%)].       \n\nThe project results demonstrate that spatial skills can be trained with appropriate educational technologies.  The project has provided numerous opportunities for training and professional development of the project team, including not only faculty members but also graduate and undergraduate students.  The project results have been disseminated through both journal publications and conference presentations to reach the broad STEM education community.  In future work, an interdisciplinary research team will be formed to conduct an in-depth study on why and how VPM technology works from the neuroscience perspective.   \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/05/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ning Fang"
