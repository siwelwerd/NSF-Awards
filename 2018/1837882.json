 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will help to develop a better understanding of the processes that influence tropospheric ozone variability in forested regions.  New analytical tools will be used to collect comprehensive observations of the atmosphere-canopy exchange of gases and the associated ecological response to ozone. The interdisciplinary team of scientists who are leading this effort have expertise in atmospheric chemistry, landscape and organismal ecology, and land-atmosphere exchange, as well as broad experimental expertise in advanced instrumentation design and use in field and laboratory settings. The results of this project have the potential to improve air quality modeling by better representing ecosystem feedbacks to ozone pollution. \r\n\r\nThe team of scientists plan to collect two years of continuous data at the Virginia Forest Laboratory (VFL) in central Virginia, coupling ozone flux measurements with observations of canopy-level photosynthesis by solar induced fluorescence (SIF), isomer-resolved ozone-reactive biogenic organic compounds (BVOCs), and critical ecosystem parameters of canopy conductance and carbon dioxide exchange.  These same variables will be measured by analogous instrumentation in leaf-scale laboratory experiments using plant species prominent at the VFL under the range of typical local environmental conditions, in which perturbations will be induced to test for ecosystem feedbacks.\r\n\r\nThe three hypotheses to be tested are: (1) Interactions between ozone flux to the canopy and the SIF technique, that directly detects fluorescence of chlorophyll molecules, are directly measurable, are independent from interactions between ozone flux and stomatal conductance and have a distinguishable effect on the ozone lifetime; (2) Ozone flux to the canopy is often controlled by sparsely measured but highly reactive BVOCs. Variability in ozone flux to the canopy caused by these BVOCs can be quantified by their molecular identities and concentrations;  (3): Uptake of ozone by plants leads to one or more of 3 detectable and significant ozone-ecosystem feedbacks: (a) ozone uptake reduces stomatal conductance, leading to longer ozone lifetimes against plant uptake; (b) ozone uptake reduces canopy BVOC concentrations by impairing photosynthesis, leading to longer ozone lifetimes against within-canopy chemical oxidation; and (c) ozone uptake enhances BVOC emissions, leading to shorter ozone lifetimes against within-canopy chemical oxidation.  The results of this research are expected to produce new observational constraints on relationships between atmospheric composition and ecosystem function.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Specifically, the project examined how changes in ozone loss rates to the forest canopy on many timescales (days, seasons, years) are driven by changes in the ecosystem, and whether their relationships are coupled. To do this, we required observational approaches collecting measurements over multiple, continuous years on both atmospheric and ecological processes, and balancing our need for detailed and novel datasets with techniques requiring minimal intervention. Our work was conducted at the Virginia Forest Laboratory (VFL) in central Virginia, where we produced multi-year observations of canopy-scale ozone loss rates, vertical distributions of ozone within the forest canopy, photosynthesis, leaf surface temperatures, reactive organic compounds, and ecosystem parameters like carbon dioxide and water exchange that can be used to estimate plant-atmosphere exchange rates. Here, we modified numerous measurement techniques to operate largely routinely and remotely, modifications which can be used by other researchers to answer their own questions. With the unique suite of observations, and supporting laboratory measurements, we examined three core hypotheses: ozone uptake by a forest is related to photosynthesis, reactions with plant emissions are a major source of ozone loss in this forest, and relationships between ozone uptake and plant function lead to measurable feedbacks. While all three hypotheses were investigated, not all were supported, demonstrating the importance of and continued need for such observations.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span><strong>Intellectual merit</strong>: </span><span>Ozone is an air pollutant that is harmful to people and plants.

A major outcome from this project was the production of a unique, continuous, multi-year dataset of atmospheric and ecological parameters with sufficient selectivity, chemical understanding, and time resolution to consider both stomatal (direct plant uptake) and within-canopy chemical loss. Data collection is continuing and will be a community resource for studying atmosphere-ecosystem interactions with environmental change. The project devised solutions to technical challenges associated with measuring canopy-scale ozone loss rates and reactive and low-volatility biogenic organic compounds over multi-year timeframes largely remotely. To date, six peer-reviewed articles have been published. The project has generated a range of new insights on controls over plant reactive carbon emissions on variable timescales that are not well captured by models; refocused attention on stomatal pathways compared to within-canopy ozone chemical loss; produced new observations of species-dependent responses to drought; and elucidated roles of temperature-dependent chemistry and loss in ozone-temperature relationships.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Broader impacts</strong>:</span><span> As regulatory controls have reduced emissions of anthropogenic ozone precursors, the biosphere exerts an increasingly large influence over surface ozone issues.

One question addressed in this project is to what extent can we adapt to the effects of higher temperatures on ozone (ozone pollution tends to be worse on hot days) by reducing nitrogen oxide emissions. We showed ozone production chemistry has been, and continues to be, an important term in the levels of ozone pollution and that nitrogen oxide controls reduce ozone?s temperature sensitivity sooner than ozone production chemistry suggests.
