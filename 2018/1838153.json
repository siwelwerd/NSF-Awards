 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) supports conferences that seek to increase the research capacity of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) faculty at HBCUs. Virginia Union University will host a one-day workshop to provide information on STEM funding opportunities to faculty and administrators from non-research intensive HBCUs and community colleges in the mid-Atlantic region. The workshop will include NSF program officers from various directorates to engage with faculty, administrators and sponsored program officers from institutions typically underrepresented in NSF funding to discuss funding opportunities and grant management strategies. The proposed date of the workshop is September 21, 2018 and 100-150 participants are expected to attend. \r\n\r\nHBCUs are a group of approximately 100 institutions of higher education across 20 states and the District of Columbia that make a disproportionately positive contribution to the diversity of the STEM workforce. Despite the significance of the relationship between HBCUs and STEM, HBCUs and community colleges, as a group, are underrepresented in the federal funding streams intended to support STEM activities. This workshop will allow NSF program officers to engage with faculty and staff from institutions typically underrepresented in NSF funding, while generating discussions on how to improve the overall funding rates of these underrepresented institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Faculty learned about NSF funding opportunities while administrators and sponsored programs officers learned strategies for successfull managing grants and advocating for faculty success at their home institutions.  The synergy of NSF representatives and the participants helped to create meaningful relationships that will ultimately prove viable as new NSF grant opportunities emerge. As the emergence of new grants are discovered, this body of professionals are now reaching out to other HBCUs and PWIs to seek collaborative and partnership STEM grantsmanship experiences.  The nature of the experience reinforces the need for ongoing technical assistance that provokes NSF awareness of the vitalness of HBCUs in the STEM and research spaces.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/16/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Linda R Jackson"
