 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) to support the acquisition of a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and associated instrumentation for shared use by a large number of research curators, students, interns, and visiting scientists. Scanning electron microscopy can produce striking images that are able to convey the complexity of life easily to researchers and the general public.  Images and descriptive text will be posted quarterly on NYBG's social media platforms and on NYBG's Tree of Life Exhibit in the Britton Gallery that houses public science exhibits. These images will illustrate how microscopic characteristics help to infer relationships among groups of plants and fungi. In addition, a display case will use objects (stubs of prepared samples, used targets, etc.) and images to explain SEM and its uses to the general public. The new system will also be important for training the next generation of scientists and graduate students doing work at NYBG.\r\n \r\nScanning electron microscopy is a key component of botanical and fungal research at NYBG which is focused on identifying species, determining the evolutionary relationships among species, and comparing the development of species to better understand their evolution. NYBG researchers are working to understand the evolution and systematics of plant and fungal species ranging from ferns to redwoods and from truffles to orchids.  The research involves detailed analyses of structural features of leaves, flowers, pollen, roots, and even associated symbiotic organisms (e.g., fungi) in specimens collected from all over the world.  The new variable pressure SEM will facilitate examination of these delicate samples at a wide range of magnifications, and using multiple imaging modes (e.g., backscatter and secondary detection).  This new equipment will allow researchers to capture high-resolution images of coated and uncoated specimens as well as the ability to merge detector images. It also allows for imaging under a variety of pressure and voltage conditions. The associated software will allow researchers to efficiently and effectively stitch together multiple high-resolution images and to 3D map captured images, providing new means of understanding and documenting plant and fungal diversity. The instruments will be housed in a core facility for shared use by a large number of research curators, students, interns, and visiting scientists. Results from these research efforts will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, presented at scientific meetings, and used in public outreach activities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
