 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research defines a newly discovered light color sensing system in bacteria that has the potential to regulate responses in synthetically created bacterial life forms. Such customized organisms have the potential to produce a wide range of beneficial products for humankind, but their activities must be strictly controlled. At present, there are few highly robust control systems available to synthetic biologists, therefore the discovery and development of additional regulatory pathways is of paramount importance. Building on recent discoveries in a highly abundant, photosynthetic marine bacterium, this project uses mathematical modeling to predict the mechanism through which shifting ambient light color from green to blue results in a 35-40-fold increase in the bacterium's gene expression. The project also involves the use of molecular, genetic, and biochemical tools to test the models and define the photo-regulation process. This system has tremendous potential for significantly contributing to the areas of microbial biotechnology, green chemistry and the new and rapidly growing field of optogenetics. In addition to the basic scientific value of the project there is training received, by three graduate students, in modeling and molecular genetics research. There is also training received, in science pedagogy, by high school teachers. Students from underrepresented groups in science benefit from a summer research immersion program at Indiana University.\r\n\r\nMathematical modeling is used to predict the mechanism through which a newly discovered signal transduction pathway operates. Predictions from the model are tested using molecular biological and biochemical approaches. Diametrically regulated by blue and green light and widely used by Synechococcus, this simple but robust signaling system is unique. The regulation element consists of three regulatory proteins named FciA, FciB, and FciC, and three genes whose expression is highly upregulated in blue light and downregulated in green light. FciA either operates with, or independently of, FciC, and modeling these components provides weighted evidence for one of these two models. Using RNAseq and Western blot analyses a time course of RNA and protein responses is examined after a switch from growth in green light to growth in blue light. Both in vitro and in vivo approaches are used to determine the specific DNA sequences that are bound by FciA, FciB, and FciC. Methods include Electromobility Shift Assays, DNaseI footprinting, and exoChIPseq. Finally, the signaling system is transferred to another cyanobacterial species and to a non-photosynthetic bacterium to begin to develop this regulatory system for use in species that are commonly used in microbial biotechnology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our studies showed that nearly 40% of&nbsp;<em>Synechococcus</em>&nbsp;can sense the ratio of blue light to green light and adjust their pigments to optimize light capture for photosynthesis.

We identified MpeZ and BbaA, the two proteins responsible for the pigment changes during CA4, and FciA, FciB, and FciC, the three proteins that regulate CA4. Our preliminary data suggested that FciA (activates gene expression in blue light) and FciB (represses gene expression in green light) acted before FciC. Because FciC was too small to delete with the tools available at the time, we used mathematical modeling to predict if FciC worked in concert with FciA and FciB (amplification expression model, AE) or after them (serial expression model, SE). We developed two mathematical models (using systems of four differential equations) to represent the AE and SE models, and found that both models could fit expected relative expressions equally well, but that the SE model would predict subtle differences in&nbsp;<em>timing</em>&nbsp;of FciC expression, with FciC abundance initially dominating MpeZ and BbaA during a light source switching. Neither model could be ruled out without further time-resolved expression data following light source switching.

Both are AraC transcription factor family proteins, which sense and respond to many signals. Light is not one of these, so if FciA and FciB are sensing light color, they will be novel photoreceptors.
