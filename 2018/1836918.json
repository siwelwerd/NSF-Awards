 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey (CMPS) Summer Research Conference to be held at UCLA, August 8-10, 2018. The conference will bring together a multidisciplinary group of about 80 scholars at varying stages of their academic careers to: (1) present cutting-edge research using the 2016 CMPS, merged with hundreds of aggregate level variables from the 2000, 2010 Census, and the 2015 American Community Survey (ACS); (2) contribute to the development of the 2020 CMPS; and (3) build an academic pipeline of scholars in the political sciences and social science more broadly. Invited conference attendees will include a diverse and interdisciplinary group of junior and senior faculty, graduate and undergraduate students, as well as postdoctoral fellows from large research institutions, smaller liberal arts colleges, community colleges, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs). Invited research papers will use data from the 2016 CMPS to examine the role of race, ethnicity, gender, religiosity, linked fate, partisanship, health disparities, political mobilization, and other sociodemographics in shaping political behavior, attitudes and public opinions toward various policy concerns. Broad racial/ethnic diversity, gender balance, and junior-senior collaborations among the presenters will be encouraged. While research papers will be invited, the conference will be open to the broader public.\r\n\r\nThe proposed 2016 CMPS Summer Research Conference and Planning Meeting has several broader impacts: (1) enhance the shepherding of existing manuscripts from preliminary drafts to publication in the study of race, ethnicity and politics, immigration, political psychology, political behavior and public opinion; (2) broaden cross-institutional faculty and student collaborations and co-authorships; (3) enhance junior-senior networks and mentorship opportunities (4) collaborative planning sessions for the 2020 CMPS, to be fielded following the 2020 Presidential election. Our planning sessions will include topics such as: (1) expanding the CMPS in several ways including increasing the sample size from 10,000 to 20,000 cases including the following groups: Latinos, African Americans, Asian Americans, Whites, Muslim Americans, black Caribbean immigrants, black African immigrants, Native Americans, and Native Hawaiians; (2) we will develop our strategy to incorporate the first CMPS Panel Survey, following a Presidential election, which focuses on a subset of issues important to the study of race, ethnicity and politics in the United States over time; (3) survey question development. The conference will deepen and diversify the participants' network ties throughout the discipline. The conference will have positive spillover effects within the discipline of political science and within the participants' Colleges/Universities: Participants can use the insights from the research conference towards postconference activities to collaborate, train, mentor, and network with scholars in our profession.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Led by co-Principal Investigators Matt Barreto (UCLA), Lorrie Frasure-Yokley (UCLA), Edward Vargas (Arizona State University) and Janelle Wong (University of Maryland-College Park), the 2016 CMPS represents the first cooperative, multi-racial, multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, post-election online survey in race, ethnicity and politics (REP) in the United States. All questions were generated through funding contributions from a national team of more than 85 researchers, from 55 colleges and universities across 17 academic disciplines. The 2016 CMPS, we queried 10,145 people in five languages ? English, Spanish, Chinese (simplified and traditional), Korean and Vietnamese. The 2016 CMPS includes large and generalizable samples of Blacks (n=3,102), Latinos (n=3,003), Asian and Pacific Islander (n=3,006), and Whites (n=1,034) which allow for the analysis of an individual racial group, or comparative analysis across groups.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2018 CMPS Workshop events ranged from research presentations as well as planning and brainstorming sessions for the 2020 CMPS. The workshop encouraged collaboration to strengthen the academic pipeline in the study of race, ethnicity and immigration, through co-authorships and research opportunities, particularly for graduate students, post-docs and junior faculty. This 2-day meeting also served as a professional development and networking opportunity for scholars of race, ethnicity and immigration in the United States.This event was an important incubator for feedback on more than a dozen current projects and served as an opportunity to brainstorm on efforts to update and improve the survey before it is launched again following the 2020 presidential election.</p>\n<p>Following the meeting we distributed a Post-Workshop Evaluation via email using Google Docs to all conference attendees. A total of 48 respondents completed the survey - nearly half of about 110 attendees. Nearly 90% of those who submitted a post-workshop evaluation form identified as non-white, including 25% who identified as Black or African American and 31% who identified as Latino/a. More than half identified as first- generation college graduates, meaning that they are the first in their family earn a degree from a four-year university. Fifty-eight percent identified as female. Twenty-two percent had attended an HBCU or Hispanic serving institutions (HSI) and nearly 1-in-4 currently teach at an HBCU/HSI.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Twenty-three percent of the participants were graduate students, 32.6% were untenured tenure track faculty, and about 25% were tenured faculty or held administrative positions.
