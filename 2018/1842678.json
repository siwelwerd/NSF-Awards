 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the world becomes more connected every day, the topic of information security becomes more important.  While researchers and students from universities across the nation are conducting important research and outreach that results in advances in information security, the impact of these efforts could be widened at a forum to share research findings, best practices, foster collaboration, and provide a forum for students to interact with other scientists and practitioners in the field. The proposed project from the University of Kansas requests funds to provide travel support for students attending the Central Area Networking and Security Workshop (CANSec). The CANSec Workshop is an annual regional workshop that aims to bring together researchers and practitioners in security and networking related fields across the Great Plains region. Since its inception, eleven workshops have been successfully held. The workshop will offer a variety of sessions including keynote talks, research presentations, posters, industrial/academic panels, and cyber defense competitions. It provides students a chance to present their ideas and research to other students, faculty, and professionals in a constructive environment, and to learn and practice cyber defense skills in a real-world scenario.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the Central Area Networking and Security Workshop (CANSec) is to provide a regular forum for researchers and students across several Midwestern states (Kansas, Missouri, Colorado, Iowa, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Texas, and Indiana) to present research and educational activities, and to promote interactions and collaborations. This grant would provide travel support for students attending CANSec, so they can interact with peers and faculty from across the region. The CANSec organizing team strives to keep low costs for the attendees to accommodate more student participants and a broader audience. The CANSec workshop also promotes the development and collaboration in information security research and education in the Great Plains region with several EPSCoR states including Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Nebraska.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
