 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Description\r\n\r\nRivers provide water that is essential for supporting human life and biodiversity. People are searching for ways to manage rivers to meet societal and ecosystem needs as human populations and demands for freshwater increase globally. Communication among diverse stakeholders is necessary for achieving solutions for how to simultaneously utilize and protect freshwater resources. This project aims to further communication of river science and to identify and share perspectives about river ecosystems with a variety of public audiences, ultimately improving understanding of these complex systems and access to knowledge as people decide the future of rivers. Fellowship activities will be conducted in collaboration with the University of New Mexico, where the PI and a trainee-level researcher will investigate historic and present influences on water-use decisions and develop approaches for combining digital technologies, like time-lapse camera systems and sound recorders, with creative ways of sharing information about connections within and across river systems. By becoming better communicators, project participants will be prepared to model these techniques for public audiences and students, as well as to broadly improve public understanding of river-floodplain systems and the various forms of life they support.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\n\r\nRivers are interconnected, complex systems that sustain aquatic and terrestrial life, including humans. They are also at the forefront of ecological, economic, and social controversies as human populations increase and freshwater resources remain finite. Interdisciplinary approaches that bridge research, technology, and public literacy of river science offer potential to provide information to stakeholders so that they will be better equipped to address challenges about meeting societal and ecosystem needs for water resources during a time of rapid ecological change. The goal for this fellowship is to develop content, methodologies, and strategies to communicate science to public audiences, drawing upon multimodal digital technologies to obtain, analyze, and convey complex ecological data in a variety of forms. The work will be conducted in partnership with the University of New Mexico and will include learning techniques for reaching public audiences; characterizing drivers of change across river basins; and creating content to support science communication, featuring dynamics of ecosystem change on regulated and freely flowing rivers, as well as historic and present dimensions of water-use decisions. Fellowship activities will guide development of novel integrative digital media strategies for communication that can be shared and evaluated across diverse audiences to understand how people respond to and learn from various forms of multimodal content. Outcomes will help to establish a framework for understanding and conveying complex river science; increase public scientific literacy about ecosystem connections in river-floodplain systems; and provide people with a deeper connection to rivers and the coupled human-environmental systems they sustain.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Through collaborative interactions with colleagues at the University of New Mexico, researchers explored various themes of how river ecosystems change across time and roles that people have played in changing them. Project participants used integrated tools to document and convey change along rivers, learned about and practiced different approaches to science communication, and delivered presentations. The project focused on rivers where the PI had prior connections and research history, the Central Platte River in Nebraska and Middle Rio Grande and Gila River in New Mexico. Activities included using historical photography to examine how landcover, such as position of river channels and extent of vegetation, had changed since the 1930s and ecological effects of those changes, as well as pairings of recent photography, soundscape recordings, and data visualizations to show commonalities and differences among the focal rivers, with the aim of appealing to different senses, ways of knowing, and interests of diverse audiences. Activities culminated in creation and delivery of a seminar-style presentation <em>Tales of Three Rivers</em> that was shared with over 800 people and evaluated through pre- and post-presentation questionnaires with a subset of audience members. Responses to questionnaires revealed that people came away from the presentation with a deeper understanding of the focal rivers, were more likely to talk with friends and family about river science and conservation after viewing the presentation, and enjoyed and took away a diversity of lessons. Other outcomes included creation of a guidance document about multimodal monitoring and science communication, development of web pages to share information about the multimodal approach to understand watersheds, and analysis of riverine landcover change that was included in conference and other presentations and will be integrated into manuscripts. Experience gained throughout the project allowed the PI to advance in the field of science communication; contribute to growing a new graduate program in Public Communication at the University of Nebraska at Kearney; provide additional learning opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students; and develop new research directions and outreach activities with colleagues to advance ecohydrological research and communication using ground-based cameras. Project activities also encouraged exchange of knowledge about river-floodplain systems and featured examples of ways that people interact with and create sustainable futures for rivers and the ecosystems they support.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/26/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Mary&nbsp;J&nbsp;Harner</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1833020/1833020_10573452_1674672058517_GilaMogollonView_20181111_Harner--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1833020/1833020_10573452_1674672058517_GilaMogollonView_20181111_Harner--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Gila River\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1833020/1833020_10573452_1674672058517_GilaMogollonView_20181111_Harner--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Gila River\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Autumn view of the Gila River in southwestern New Mexico</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Mary Harner</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Mary&nbsp;J&nbsp;Harner</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Gila River</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
