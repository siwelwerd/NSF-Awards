 "awd_abstract_narration": "Category 4 Hurricane Harvey, the most intense wind and rain event to strike Texas in 56 years, made landfall on August 25, 2017, with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph and a storm surge of over 2 m. In addition, the hurricane brought 30-50 inches of rain and caused record-breaking freshwater flooding throughout southeastern Texas, inundating large tracts of coastal marshes with flood waters from rivers and the Gulf of Mexico. Severe freshwater flooding also occurred in inland fluvial wetlands along the Brazos, Trinity, and San Bernard Rivers. Harvey provides an excellent opportunity to study the sedimentary signatures of a rare wind-and-rain event and to estimate its return period by documenting past similar event deposits in the geological record. In addition, there is growing public awareness of the detrimental effects of climate change, particularly in coastal areas threatened by accelerated sea-level rise. This research will help determine whether coastal marshes can survive rising sea-level by providing new information on the role of hurricanes in contributing sediment to marshes, causing accretion and counteracting relative elevation loss due to sea-level rise. This is a collaborative project by research teams at Louisiana State University and the University of North Texas encompassing the complete sedimentary impacts of Hurricane Harvey along a coastal (saltwater)-to-fluvial (freshwater) transect across southeastern Texas.\r\n\r\nStudies conducted to date suggest that hurricanes are major contributors to marsh growth, with the\r\nmagnitude of Hurricane sedimentation (millions of metric tons) exceeding annual riverine and coastal sediment inputs, but the topic is still debated.  Through marsh coring along the freshwater to marine transect, this study?s main objectives include: (i) documenting the magnitude, character and extent of washover and flood sedimentation in coastal marshes in southeast Texas, and (ii) to measure the magnitude and inland extent of washover sedimentation in the lee of foredune barriers to evaluate whether relatively subtle increases in barrier dimensions can cause substantial reductions in the magnitude of washover sedimentation in marshes. The study will inform coastal management agencies on the use of barriers to block or reduce storm overwash, potentially reducing washover sediment magnitude and inland extent in adjacent marshes, at a time when such sedimentation may be a crucial factor in survivability of marshes in the face of accelerating sea-level rise. This study also aims at producing centuries-to-millennia-long multi-proxy records of hurricane-generated extreme events for southeastern Texas. These long-term records are vital for estimating the return period of such extreme events as Harvey and is critically important for hurricane- and flood-risk assessments and coastal management decision-making.",

The Cl/Br ratio of the Harvey layer is only slightly elevated compared with the sharp spike associated with the Ike layer, suggesting that the storm surge-driven saltwater intrusion was mitigated by freshwater flooding during the Harvey event.  Pollen data from this core corroborated the geochemical data, suggesting that a multi-proxy approach, especially by coupling the biological proxies with geochemical proxies, is promising for deciphering the relative contributions between freshwater flooding and saltwater intrusion in compound flooding events. \n\nThe McFaddin National Wildlife Refuge component of this collaborative project was led by co-PI Dr. Harry Williams of the University of North Texas.

This study contributes to improving our understanding of Harvey?s compound flooding event by sharpening the research methodology for investigating it in the sedimentary record.  By deciphering what happened in the past it helps society to better prepare for what will happen in the future.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/29/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kam-Biu Liu"
