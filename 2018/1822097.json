 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support student attendance at the 33rd Annual Computational Complexity Conference (CCC), in San Diego, CA, June 22 to 24, 2018.  The field of computational complexity forms the backbone of theoretical computer science.  The conference aims to foster research in all areas of computational complexity theory, studying the absolute and relative power of computational models under resource constraints.  The search for efficient algorithms has important ramifications in many areas of business, technology, and science.  Complexity theory has helped with our understanding of fundamental difficulty underlying algorithmic issues and in turn has been able to motivate algorithm design for some of the most challenging computational problems.\r\n\r\nThis award will provide partial support to approximately 15 students to attend this top conference in the area of complexity theory.  Efforts will be made to support students from under-represented groups and geographic diversity among students will be taken into account.  The award will encourage and facilitate the student participation in this top-tier computer science conference.  It will contribute towards attracting more under-represented groups to computer science research giving students an opportunity to engage in the important technical, professional, and social exchanges that CCC fosters.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nComputational Complexity is one of the main subfields of theoretical computer science.  The original main goal of the project was to provide travel support for students to attend the 2018 CCC (Computational Complexity Conference) that was held in San Diego, California (at UCSD). Because  funds remained after the 2018 CCC conference, funds were also subsequently used to provide travel support for students to attend the 2019 CCC (Computational Complexity Conference) that was held in New Brunswick, New Jersey (at Rutgers).\n\n \n\nA total of 21 students received travel support to the 2018 and 2019 conferences from this award. Students supported included undergraduate students, female students, and members of under-represented minority groups. Priority was made, in choosing recipients of the travel grant support, to provide support to students who would not otherwise have been able to attend the conference.  \n\n \n\nThe project provided valuable opportunities for professional development in making it possible for students to attend the CCC conference, the premier venue focusing on research in computational complexity.  In addition to the intellectual and research benefits of conference attendance, students also gained valuable opportunities to network and become acquainted with members of the CCC community.\n\n \n\nThe hoped-for impact of the project is that it will help foster the next generation of researchers in computational complexity theory, by exposing students to cutting edge research and researchers in the field.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/07/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rocco A Servedio"
