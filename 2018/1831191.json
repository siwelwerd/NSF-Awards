 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will address two societal needs. It will enable mass charging infrastructure for electric vehicles (EVs) at minimal cost, and will enable the provisioning of energy services to help integrate renewable energy\r\nsources. This is critical as electricity generation and transportation together consume close to two-thirds of all US energy and emit more than half of all US greenhouse gases. To drastically reduce greenhouse gases will therefore require electrification of our\r\ntransportation and renewable generation of our electricity. California (CA) has a mandate to have 1.5 million zero-emission vehicles by 2025 and, currently, half of the nation's EVs are in CA. If the project is successful, the proposed technology, when deployed at scale,\r\ncan potentially save CA $144M annually in operating costs and $1.1B in capital cost when CA reaches its ambitious goal by 2025. This can help reduce greenhouse gases annually in CA by 5.5 million metric tons. This project will therefore make an impact in both clean\r\ntransportation and clean energy.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will develop an adaptive EV charging system that can implement a number of innovations that are not currently available in the EV charging industry. It will offer a site host a solution to recover costs,\r\njointly optimize onsite distributed energy resources such as solar panels and battery banks, minimize operating cost for site host and charging cost for drivers, and optimally trade off preferences and constraints of different drivers and of the site host, subject to\r\ninfrastructure capacity constraints. These technologies will be based on unique real-time sensing, communications, and control capabilities, as well as advanced optimization and learning algorithms. These technologies will provide a target charging capacity at minimal infrastructure and operating costs, as well as a platform for energy services to the grid.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Our EV charging solution became generally available to commercial customers in Q2 of 2019 and has grown in maturity rapidly since. Over the last three years, PowerFlex Systems has grown from a team of five people to a team that is now 25+ strong after the acquisition by EDF Renewables and has become a significant player in large-scale EV charging in the state of California.\n\n \nWe have successfully completed the objectives in our SBIR Phase II proposal despite two significant market challenges: the PG&amp;E bankruptcy that affected many of our projects for 2020 as well as the the Covid-19 pandemic.  We now have a strong portfolio of intellectual properties and a growing customer base.  We are very encouraged by the fact that we have achieved a large number of customer wins within a short period of time.\n\n\nNSF SBIR I and II grants have enabled PowerFlex to grow its market share in large-scale EV deployment (i.e., deployment with more than 40 charging stations per site) to 26% in CA and 26% in the US, according to data from the Department of Energy\u2019s Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC) that tracks the number of charging stations in the US reported by major companies in this space.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/20/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Cheng Jin"
