 "awd_abstract_narration": "Overview:\r\nThis request is to fund the first year, 2018, of a five-year cooperative agreement for Ship Operations of\r\nthe Research Vessel Savannah. Built at the Maine shipyard of Washburn and Doughty and delivered to\r\nthe UGA/Skidaway Institute of Oceanography in 2001, the 92-foot coastal research vessel was designed\r\nto provide researchers with a versatile platform to conduct primarily federally-funded oceanographic\r\nresearch and educational activities in the southeastern U.S. With its moderate draft, the R/V Savannah is\r\ncapable of working in a variety of environments, from coastal rivers and estuaries to the outer continental\r\nshelf and beyond.  The ship funds will support a variety  peer-reviewed NSF funded projects. \r\n\r\nA technical Description:\r\nOver the past 17 years, and in the next five, the R/V Savannah has continued and will continue to\r\ndemonstrate its ability to host a large number of scientific cruises with a broad spectrum of mission\r\nrequirements by providing a vessel with excellent range and endurance for its class, robust overboard\r\nhandling systems and the capacity to berth 16 scientists plus 6 crew. For example, federally-funded\r\nprojects over the past two years used the R/V Savannah to assess the role of vitamin B-12 and nitrogen\r\navailability on the regulation of oceanic dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) and dimethylsulfide (DMS)\r\nacross a 250 nautical mile transect from the inner continental shelf to the Sargasso Sea; to study soluble\r\niron fluxing in continental shelf margins using benthic lander deployments to 2500 meters and sediment\r\ncollections to 1000 meters off the North Carolina capes; to quantify the cryptic diet of the globally\r\nsignificant pelagic tunicate Dolioletta gegenbauri on the mid-shelf of the South Atlantic Bight, and to\r\nmeasure the health of fish stocks from northern Georgia waters to south Florida. The R/V Savannah has\r\nalso supported Navy ship trials and shock tests, ONR glider operations and the maintenance of\r\nmeteorological data buoys as well as a variety of educational programs. All of the aforementioned\r\nprojects were federally funded by NSF, ONR or NOAA. 2018 and years following will have some\r\ncontinuing projects and new research activities, mostly supported with federal funds.\r\n\r\nPurposefully designed with a large science berthing capacity, the R/V Savannah is well suited to provide\r\nlearning opportunities in ocean and estuarine environments and to demonstrate oceanographic research\r\nmethodologies to diverse student populations. In 2017, the R/V Savannah hosted 30 undergraduate, 40\r\ngraduate students, 23 high school science teachers and students, and 19 observers across 25 cruises. In\r\ncollaboration with Savannah State University, the R/V Savannah continued to host the two-day Research\r\nExperiences for Undergraduates (REU) cruise (OCE-1460457) in 2017, giving students from all over the\r\nU.S. the opportunity to experience life at sea aboard a working research vessel by conducting standard\r\nsampling regimes across the continental shelf to be used in student research papers. The state of Georgia\r\nand Skidaway Institute of Oceanography regularly provide 5+ days per year, to support beginning\r\ninvestigator and graduate student research. To better inform and educate the public about advances in\r\nocean sciences, the R/V Savannah is open to the public for guided tours each year, including the annual\r\nUGA/Skidaway Institute of Oceanography Marine Science Day which draws 1800-2500 participants\r\nannually.\r\n\r\nThe Statement of Merit Review:\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
