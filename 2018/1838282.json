 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biodiversity is critically important, however unprecedented losses are occurring in response to environmental change and human development of the planet. Since many species have survived past and present changes, understanding how they do so can provide clues for conserving biodiversity. This project seeks to address this question by evaluating different factors that contribute to a species' survival within its natural range. The research team will focus on the tailed frog, which lives only in cold, fast-flowing mountain streams in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Within this region, many populations of frogs live in low elevation habitats that are warmer than high elevation habitats. These populations are likely to be the first to experience temperatures higher than what tailed frogs can tolerate as climates warm. It is possible, however, that frogs from these populations may also be able to tolerate warmer temperatures relative to those that live only in colder, high-elevation streams. This project will examine the implications for how tailed frogs or similar species might survive in the face changes in temperature. Uncovering these rules for how species may persist requires understanding how differences in the environment affect thermal tolerance and other traits that can allow species to survive as conditions are altered over time. This project will provide research training and mentoring for a postdoctoral scholar, and graduate and undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nThe researchers will uncover rules for spatial patterns of vulnerability using a four-pronged integrative framework. This research links environmental heterogeneity to genetic and phenotypic variation in resilience traits. First, the study will characterize variation in the thermal environment and food resources in tailed frog streams. Second, it will test the effects of landscape heterogeneity on genome-wide variation and microevolutionary processes (selection, drift, and gene flow) using a landscape genomics approach. Third, it will estimate the contributions of genetics and the environment in generating variation in key resilience traits related to thermal performance using quantitative genetics, a genome-wide association study, and acclimation experiments. Finally, they will predict current and future temperature tolerance and population vulnerability by modeling changes in stream temperature, food resources, traits, and population responses.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Although climate change has already negatively impacted biodiversity, our capacity to predict which species and populations are most vulnerable remains poor. The dominant paradigm in ecological studies assumes that traits conferring resilience to climate change (e.g., thermal tolerance) are largely invariant across a species? range. However, from an evolutionary perspective, populations occupying divergent environments, such as along elevational gradients, should be locally adapted to their historical temperature regime. These contrasting hypotheses have important implications regarding which populations will be most vulnerable to climate change (Fig. 1). The goal of our RoL FELS EAGER grant was to uncover rules for spatial patterns of vulnerability to climate change using an integrative framework that links environmental heterogeneity to genetic and phenotypic variation in resilience traits (Fig. 2).<br /><br />We used this framework to test hypotheses regarding relative vulnerability across elevation and temperature in two cold-water stream species--Coastal tailed frogs (<em>Ascaphus truei</em>) and Rocky Mountain tailed frogs (<em>A. montanus</em>)--in the U.S Pacific Northwest (PNW). In Aim 1, we characterized spatial and temporal variation in the thermal environment (the \"thermalscape\") in our stream reaches. In Aim 2, we tested the effects of landscape heterogeneity on genome-wide variation and microevolutionary processes (selection, drift, and gene flow) using a landscape genomics approach. In Aim 3, we estimated the contributions of genetics and the environment in generating variation in critical thermal maximum (CTmax, a measure of thermal tolerance). Finally, in Aim 4, we predicted population vulnerability by modeling changes in stream temperature, traits, and population responses.<br /><br />We deployed stream temperature loggers to characterize annual and seasonal variation in stream temperatures in 15 <em>A. truei</em> and 15 <em>A. montanus</em> stream reaches (focal sites). We found substantial temporal variation in maximum stream temperatures, setting the stage for potential thermal adaptation (Fig. 3). In contrast, we found little fine-scale spatial temperature variation, suggesting little potential for behavioral thermoregulation.<br /><br />We tested for genomic evidence of local adaptation to stream temperatures using a combination of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in 8 focal sites and targeted capture in our remaining focal sites. We found that ~1.8% of ~40 million single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genetic markers genotyped in <em>A. truei</em> and ~1.9% of ~34 million SNPs genotyped in <em>A. montanus</em> using WGS were related to maximum stream temperature and/or CTmax. Targeted capture of a subset of these loci across additional populations verified that many markers were related to maximum stream temperature and/or CTmax across multiple populations. These results provide evidence for thermal adaptation related to temperature, and indicate that CTmax is genetically based and highly polygenic.<br /><br />We conducted one of the largest-scale and spatially in-depth analyses of CTmax for any wild species. We found contrasting patterns of CTmax in our two focal species (Fig. 4). In <em>A. truei</em>, we found no consistent relationship between CTmax and maximum stream temperature. In contrast, in <em>A. montanus</em>, CTmax was positively related to maximum stream temperature. Our acclimation experiments revealed minimal plasticity in CTmax (Fig. 5). Finally and importantly, we found that CTmax predicts mortality at high, but ecologically realistic temperatures, indicating that it is a useful index of thermal tolerance (Fig. 6).<br /><br />In conclusion, our thermalscape, genomic, and CTmax results provide support for some of our previous hypotheses. In <em>A. montanus</em>, both the genomic and CTmax results support thermal adaptation to temperature, suggesting similar vulnerability to climate change across temperature gradients (Fig. 1b). In <em>A. truei</em>, the hypothesis supported depends on the data type, highlighting the importance of integrative studies such as ours for nuanced inferences. Our genomic results suggest that all populations are equally vulnerable (Fig. 1b), but our CTmax results suggest that relatively warm, low elevation populations are most vulnerable to increasing temperatures (Fig. 1a).<br /><br />Our RoL FELS EAGER grant revealed that understanding local adaptation in sensitivity traits matters for predicting which parts of a species? range will be most vulnerable to climate change. Within-species variation in these traits also represents evolutionary potential necessary to adapt to rapid climate change. We are currently integrating results from our empirical work in a simulation model to more precisely characterize and predict spatial and temporal patterns of vulnerability in our two focal species.<br /><br />This project has contributed to the training and development of one post-doctoral fellow, one graduate student, three post-baccalaureates, and four undergraduate students. We have developed a diverse group of trainees, including students from traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM. We have also presented our results to natural resource managers in the PNW responsible for managing streams and forests in the range of tailed frogs.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/01/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: W.
