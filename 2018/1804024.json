 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of natural gas is increasing worldwide. Methane, the primary component of natural gas, is a highly potent greenhouse gas (GHG) that contributes to climatic changes.  Recent research suggests that methane can be released from natural gas fields, but large uncertainties in these data do not allow accurate quantification of the amount. The proposed research will reduce this uncertainty and advance knowledge in measurement methods and modeling tools for the quantification of methane emissions in natural gas fields. The project will support graduate and undergraduate researcher from underrepresented engineering students in rural Appalachia, addressing societal needs for broadening participation in science and engineering. If successful, the results of this research will help protect the Nation's energy security by potentially influencing regulatory activities and improving the efficiency of natural gas production.\r\n\r\nDue to maturation of technologies such as directional drilling and enhanced recovery, natural gas production continues to grow in the U.S. However, the magnitude and fate of leaking methane emissions from natural gas fields remain highly uncertain and unresolved. Recent studies show significant variations in methane losses, from less than 1% to 17% of the total natural gas produced. These large variations are generally attributed to uncertainty in top-down (indirect aerial fluxes or downwind measurements) and bottom-up (direct component level measurements and emissions factors) estimates, which include measurement uncertainty and a general lack of high fidelity data sets. The goal of this research is to reduce these uncertainties by collecting and analyzing temporal top-down measurements of methane fluxes and environmental variables based on eddy-covariance flux techniques and Gaussian plume measurements in concert with direct bottom-up measurements. This research will employ advanced data analytics using empirical models and artificial intelligence to improve the mechanistic understanding of methane emissions in natural gas fields across West Virginia and the greater Appalachian region. Accurate quantification with indirect measurement techniques would decrease the need for the labor-intensive leak detection schemes currently employed. The research findings will be broadly disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. The researchers will leverage industrial collaborations at the Marcellus Shale Energy and Environmental Laboratory (MSEEL) in Morgantown, WV, to communicate the research outcomes. The research group will also work with the West Virginia University Energy Institute to develop outreach materials and conduct seminars in the Marcellus region.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and regulations worldwide are focused on decreasing emissions from the natural gas industry. A state-of-the-art solar powered data acquisition and flux trailer was created and deployed during controlled releases and at an active well site.&nbsp;We examined various machine learning and data analysis methods to improve the understanding of methane emissions through indirect quantification. &nbsp;Common methods to indirectly quantify methane emissions included Other Test Method 33A (OTM) and eddy covariance (EC) flux measurements. Both conventional methods yield high uncertainty in mass emissions. We estimated that the minimum attainable measurement uncertainty of OTM 33A was +/- 17% at best. We found that a Taguchi optimized OTM 33A could reduce RMSE and standard deviation by 22% and 30%, respectively. Further, we showed that methane concentrations correlated with the variance in flux emissions with only small impacts from wind speed and ambient temperature measurements. This may suggest that accuracy in measurements of a few key variables is more important than exact sensor placements. &nbsp;Minimum attainable measurement uncertainty of the EC method to estimate mass emissions was determined to be &plusmn;42% based on the H&amp;R method for controlled methane releases.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we combined the common methods with Random Forests (RF) and Neural Networks (NN). This research demonstrated that methods for improving estimates was possible through both&nbsp; traditional methods (OTM 33A) or a combined (EC and OTM) approach with machine learning algorithms (RF or NN). RF and NN models were developed and optimized, reducing baseline RMSEs by 4% and 40%, respectively. The NN and RF reduced the standard deviation of estimates with a DQI less than 10 by an average of 63% and 74%, respectively, compared to Taguchi optimized estimates. Across the full release dataset, the NN and RF RMSEs were 44% and 69% lower than Taguchi optimized OTM. The novel methodology produced by this research is applicable with technology and measurement methods already in use by research and industry. The data processing methods are already available. It is believed that with more collected data and the combination of these methods with the simple and effective machine learning algorithms presented here that the methods would become more robust and accurate.</p>\n<p>Better understanding of the temporal distribution of methane emissions could help industry target reductions. Improvements in long-term indirect measurements that are low cost will help researchers and industry understand the problem of &ldquo;super-emitters&rdquo; as well. It may turn out that sites are only &ldquo;super-emitters&rdquo; intermittently, which would drastically change their emissions profiles compared to simply assuming that emissions are constant. Elucidating a clearer picture of emissions profiles both temporally and geo-spatially will drastically improve our understanding of the methane problem. While this work has not solved the problem explicitly, we identified methods that could enhance OTM 33A alone, by reducing variability and increasing average accuracy. By using data from multiple approaches and with the inclusion of machine learning methods, the work performed here could provide a pathway to a better understanding of emissions. The research is also applicable with currently available state-of-the-art instruments and would not require extensive sensor counts or computational resources as industry seeks to decrease their carbon footprint.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/29/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Derek&nbsp;Johnson</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1804024/1804024_10562449_1672343589283_DrAbdul-AzizandMsJahan--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1804024/1804024_10562449_1672343589283_DrAbdul-AzizandMsJahan--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Diversity Conference\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1804024/1804024_10562449_1672343589283_DrAbdul-AzizandMsJahan--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Diversity Conference\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Dr. Omar Abdul-Aziz and Ms. Samira Jahan presenting research results at the first annual Statler College Diversity Conference - Fall 2022</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Omar Abdul-Aziz and Samira Jahan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Derek&nbsp;Johnson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Diversity Conference</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1804024/1804024_10562449_1672344367029_InitialDAQ--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1804024/1804024_10562449_1672344367029_InitialDAQ--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Flux Equipment\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1804024/1804024_10562449_1672344367029_InitialDAQ--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Flux Equipment\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Installation of state-of-the-art flux equipment on the solar DAQ trailer prior to deployment.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Robert Heltzel</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Derek&nbsp;Johnson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Flux Equipment</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1804024/1804024_10562449_1672344592001_WellSites--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1804024/1804024_10562449_1672344592001_WellSites--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Wellsite Audit\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1804024/1804024_10562449_1672344592001_WellSites--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Wellsite Audit\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">WVU researchers conduct methane emissions audit at well site prior to long term monitoring with the solar DAQ flux trailer.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Derek Johnson</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Derek&nbsp;Johnson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Wellsite Audit</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1804024/1804024_10562449_1672344727190_Johnson--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1804024/1804024_10562449_1672344727190_Johnson--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Controlled Release Experiments\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1804024/1804024_10562449_1672344727190_Johnson--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Controlled Release Experiments\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Dr. Johnson using a range finder to determine the distance from the methane controlled release point and the solar DAQ flux trailer.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Robert Heltzel</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Derek&nbsp;Johnson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Controlled Release Experiments</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
