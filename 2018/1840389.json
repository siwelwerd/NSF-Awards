 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Planning Grants for Engineering Research Centers competition was run as a pilot solicitation within the ERC program.  Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research.  This award funds an effort by the University of Arizona and its partner institutions Stanford University, Harvard University, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and Northwestern University for a technical planning and convergent team exercise that will engage stakeholders in academia, industry, and government laboratories.  The objective is to put elements in place that will support the development of the first scalable photonic quantum network for secure communications, quantum advanced sensing, and information processing, that paves the way to the first quantum internet.  The planning process will develop a plan for an integrated research and education plan for students from k-12 through the graduate level, with a focus on the inclusion of diverse perspectives throughout the project.\r\n\r\nThe planning grant will support a project that will advance knowledge by developing transformational technologies for quantum networks.  A versatile quantum repeater node will support virtually any application that requires quantum communication or entanglement as a resource, to be seamlessly integrated with a core photonic network.  Three research thrusts will be considered: Quantum Network Architectures, Systems, and Networks, Quantum Nanophotonic Subsystem Integration, and Quantum Materials, Subsystems, and Devices.  The planning exercise will provide early feedback to prioritize key device metrics for system-level goals and chart out the applications-driven design of a network.  A plan to train students for industrial success, international skills, and systems-wide experience in quantum information science and engineering will be developed.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The proposed CQN-ERC progressed through convergent workshops, multiple team meetings, a pre-proposal, invited full proposal, being selected as a finalist for an NSF site visit, and finally a Blue Ribbon Panel at NSF. The Planning Grant accomplished its goals:</p>\n<p>1. Establish a foundation of convergent research topics to realize the ambitious vision of a socially-responsible quantum internet, lay the technical scope and engineering groundwork, and assess the case of a gen-4 ERC to realize the mission.</p>\n<p>2. Assemble a well-rounded world-class team of scientists, engineers and social scientists best positioned to successfully execute CQN.</p>\n<p>3. Gauge interest in the core engineered system of CQN, applications, and technology transition opportunities from defense, commercial/startup industry, and VCs.</p>\n<p>4. Garner support from national and international stakeholders in the core mission of CQN, including renowned domain-area experts to potentially serve on the EAB, and leaders of the major international funded efforts in quantum networking R&amp;D.</p>\n<p>With funding provided by this grant, supplemented by a 30% match provided by UArizona's Provost Office, several networking events commenced. Through these events (workshops, collaborative meetings, teaming discussions, and technical brainstorming) a foundation of convergent research topics was established to address the ambitious goal of CQN. These events also allowed gauging how the proposed program vision, research, and technical approaches would be received by the quantum information science community. The support received is overwhelmingly positive, and led to several collaborative relationships to blossom.</p>\n<p>Two major networking activities were funded:&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;5th&nbsp;Workshop on Scalable Information Processing with Quantum Nano-Photonics -- with the goal of gathering representatives from nano-photonics, quantum optics, and quantum information processing theory communities to brainstorm high-impact applications, challenges, and R&amp;D pathways for scalable realizations of photonic quantum information processing, focusing on networked quantum technologies. (2) 1st International Workshop on Quantum Network Science -- with the goal of gathering international experts with backgrounds in network science, condensed matter physics, communication network engineering, applied probability, and atomic physics to brainstorm fundamental principles, new mathematical tools, and experimental platforms to research large quantum networks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Through a purposeful team-building exercise led by Prof. Guha, a team of world-leading experts with highly transdisciplinary expertise were brought together to address the extremely challenging and ambitious program goals.&nbsp;Besides a successful team building and technical planning process, a key outcome of the exercise was a highly-successful convergence among technical (engineering, sciences, mathematics) and social science (law, social policy, behavioral sciences, economics) disciplines--spanning UArizona and partner institutions--in brainstorming important research questions on the societal impacts of the quantum internet and associated technologies.</p>\n<p>The envisioned Three-Plane Chart comprised initially of three technical thrusts. After numerous discussions following the pre-proposal review, CQN decided to add a fourth Thrust: Societal Impacts of the Quantum Internet, which will interact with the rest of CQN through a living document called the Applications Roadmap. This will document 20-year-projected applications of the quantum internet and associated technologies. Thrust 4 research will focus on law, policy, business practices, and social norms relevant to key quantum-internet applications, but have pre-quantum information science origins, as they will have to be revisited, reinterpreted, and possibly revised in the light of the transformational impacts CQN will have on society.</p>\n<p>The planning process involved articulating a brand-new Masters Program in Quantum Information Science and Engineering (QISE), offered at UArizona, starting Fall 2020. The program is built upon existing courses and several new, to create a two-year Masters program: suggested tracks in quantum communications, computing and sensing. Also planned is a CQN-wide certificate program which will build upon the aforesaid MS-in-QISE program; hosted on CQN's digital portal, course and content contributions will come from all CQN partner institutions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A comprehensive engineering workforce development (EWD) program was envisioned for the CQN that spans all phases: from k-12, undergrad/graduate to post-college education; with every partner university contributiong to the EWD program in a complementary way, based on a confluence of evidenced-based methods.</p>\n<p>Beyond measuring success by accomplishing goals, the planning exercise has found success in the form of response from NSF. The support that the funds from this planning grant provided has paid dividends throughout the ERC proposal process. Not only was the team selected to submit a full proposal, but they were selected to participate in a site visit. Although funds from the planning grant were not used for the site visit, the initial support is seen through all phases of the proposal process.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/30/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Saikat&nbsp;Guha</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1840389/1840389_10577813_1577719820317_IMG_8911--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1840389/1840389_10577813_1577719820317_IMG_8911--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SIPQNP Group Photo\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1840389/1840389_10577813_1577719820317_IMG_8911--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SIPQNP Group Photo\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">) 5th Workshop on Scalable Information Processing with Quantum Nano-Photonics, or SIPQNP (www.sipqnp.com) in March 2019 at the Biosphere II in Tucson</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Brianna Moreno</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Saikat&nbsp;Guha</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SIPQNP Group Photo</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1840389/1840389_10577813_1577719724857_IMG_8936--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1840389/1840389_10577813_1577719724857_IMG_8936--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Quantum Workshop\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1840389/1840389_10577813_1577719724857_IMG_8936--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Quantum Workshop\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A photo of attendees from ) The 1st International Workshop on Quantum Network Science (https://wp.optics.arizona.edu/quantumworkshop) in May 2019 at the College of Optical Sciences, at the University of Arizona in Tucson</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Brianna Moreno</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Saikat&nbsp;Guha</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Quantum Workshop</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1840389/1840389_10577813_1577719632952_FourPlaneChart--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1840389/1840389_10577813_1577719632952_FourPlaneChart--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Four Plane Chart\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1840389/1840389_10577813_1577719632952_FourPlaneChart--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Four Plane Chart\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">CQN Version of Four Plane Chart</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Saikat Guha</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Saikat&nbsp;Guha</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Four Plane Chart</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
