 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent studies have shown that moderate, severe, and more crucially, repetitive traumatic brain injury can cause the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. Failure of this critical protective barrier between the contents of the bloodstream and rest of the brain can cause both short- and long-term problems because of increased invasion of the brain by disease causing agents. The causes of breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, as well as the potential of repetitive injury to more severely degrade the blood-brain barrier is poorly understood.  There are very few non-animal laboratory models that copy the mechanical, structural and functional complexities of the blood-brain barrier that can be used to study traumatic brain injury. This project will use a new non-animal (benchtop) model of the blood-brain barrier to study its breakdown after repetitive traumatic injury. The project will advance health by determining the biological and structural causes for reduced barrier function in the brain following traumatic injury.  The educational and outreach work in the project is centered on engaging high-school students who will use the latest technologies of Biomedical Manufacturing and Innovation in a week-long summer camp. \r\n\r\nThis project will advance fundamental insights within the field of blood-brain barrier mechanobiology, specifically the understanding of the role of strain, deceleration and repeated injury, in causing altered structure and dysfunction of the blood brain barrier and the overall neurovascular unit. Three-dimensional in vitro models of the blood-brain barrier neurovascular unit (organ-chips) incorporating neural and microvascular cell types, and capillary fluid flow will be designed and engineered. These organ-chip constructs will be subject to single or multiple traumatic injuries in custom-designed bioreactors to quantify and model the temporal evolution of blood-brain barrier breakdown as a function of injury magnitude, number of impacts and time between impacts. This project will thus provide important insights into the mechanoregulation of blood-brain barrier cellular phenotype, metabolism and function.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
