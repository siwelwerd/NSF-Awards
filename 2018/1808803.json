 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award was provided as part of NSF's Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (SPRF) program. The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Christine Drea at Duke University, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating the role of oxytocin (OT) in primate behavior. This project uses an animal model, a genus of Malagasy lemurs housed at the Duke Lemur Center. Species within this genus (Eulemur) vary considerably in their social systems, including the degree of female dominance and existence of monogamous mating bonds. Thus, Eulemur is a natural experiment that permits an investigation of how OT is involved in the complex nature of pair bonds. Insights from this project will inform the literature across several scientific fields, including zoology, evolutionary biology, and neuroscience. More broadly, findings from this project have the potential to inform efforts to harness OT for therapeutic purposes.\r\n\r\nFunctional significance of the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) has become a topic of debate within social endocrinology. Evolutionary biologists have argued that ancestral functions for OT were co-opted in some species to mediate formation and maintenance of other social bonds. A large literature supports and espouses OT's potential as a biological foundation for the interdependent relationships, including monogamous pair-bonds, characteristic of highly social species. Psychological studies report a number of both prosocial and anti-social effects or correlates of OT. Functional interpretations are often derived from model systems of a single species. Evolutionary biologists argue that model systems do not sufficiently represent the diversity of mammalian socio-ecologies. This project expands the current state of knowledge in behavioral OT research by collecting behavioral, hormonal, and anatomical data on the OT system in a unique animal model - Eulemur, a genus of group-living primates. The combination of close genetic relatedness and divergent social behavior within the Eulemur genus acts as a natural experiment. Seminal studies revealed that inter-species differences in structure and function of the OT system are essential to understanding the biological bases of mating system variation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Historically known for their roles in regulating physiological processes, these molecules have recently become the focus of intense scientific and public interest for their involvement in social behavior. Based on an ever-growing body of findings, some scholars have promoted oxytocin and vasopressin as potential \"love hormones\" that facilitate the behavior, cognition, and emotions characteristic of strong interdependent bonds across highly social species. Clinical researchers have eagerly tested if these hormones can be effective therapeutic treatments for disorders of sexual functioning, attachment, or social cognition. However, as much of the evidential base for these claims come from rodent studies, substantial challenges exist in interpreting and translating rodent findings to other mammalian groups, including humans. Research on non-human primates may be crucial to fill this gap. Both monogamous and non-monogamous species exist within <em>Eulemur</em>, a genus of strepsirrhine primate, offering a rare opportunity to broaden a comparative perspective on how oxytocin and vasopressin are involved in monogamous mating and social behaviour, with increased evolutionary relevance for humans.</p>\n<p>Our project investigated the oxytocin and vasopressin systems in monogamous and non-monogamous <em>Eulemur </em>using three different methods: (1) brain imaging comparing distributions of oxytocin and vasopressin receptors within species of differing social systems; (2) measurements of circulating hormones during a number of naturally-occurring circumstances; and (3) the administration of a non-harmful, temporary oxytocin receptor blocker, followed by a comparison of its effects on social behavior between species of differing social systems. Our results are clear that forces identified as key to pair-bonding in rodents cannot be directly invoked to explain pair-bonding in primates. \"Maps\" of oxytocin and vasopressin receptors across the brain generally look quite similar across lemur species, and of the regions that differ, they fall outside of traditionally emphasized regions. When given an oxytocin receptor blocker, lemurs exhibit inconsistent changes in affiliative behavior that do not cleanly map onto their differing mating systems.</p>\n<p>These results have important implications, as they demonstrate the diversity by which these hormones may have their manifold effects on social bonding behavior, and they suggest a revisitation of the implications rodent studies might have for humans. In addressing our specific questions regarding oxytocin and vasopressin, we have also generated a wealth of fundamental information regarding <em>Eulemur </em>social behavior and neuroanatomy, which we hope will provide the basis for future research on lemurs, who represent an underutilized but powerful model for studying primate biology and evolution. In addition to scientific insights, these investigations have directly led to professional development, outreach programs, and training opportunities for a broad range of students and trainees, including those traditionally excluded from research in primatology and biological anthropology.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/28/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Nicholas&nbsp;Grebe</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1808803/1808803_10565756_1624913484763_DSC_0352--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1808803/1808803_10565756_1624913484763_DSC_0352--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Eulemur Mongoz Family\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1808803/1808803_10565756_1624913484763_DSC_0352--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Eulemur Mongoz Family\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A family of monogamous mongoose lemurs (Eulemur mongoz) huddling at the Duke Lemur Center.
