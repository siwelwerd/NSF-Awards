 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is tremendous growth in advanced manufacturing in western Nevada, with production technician careers expected to grow in the region by 15% annually for the next five years. With large manufacturers such as Tesla and Panasonic Corporation moving into the Reno area, the need for manufacturing technicians has become a dominant issue for ensuring the success of this industry and for the economic development goals of the region. Truckee Meadows Community College (TMCC) has also identified access to online content as a major barrier for students whose work schedules or home location interfere with their participation in traditional, on-campus courses.  are working or who live far from campus. To generate the workforce necessary for the continued prosperity of the region, TMCC will create easy to use, flexible courses that it hopes will appeal to incumbent workers, lower skilled workers, and workers with non-traditional schedules. This approach may enable students who are unable to attend traditional classes to enroll in the courses necessary to complete programs.  In turn, these programs have the potential to provide these students with employability skills, access to a stackable degree program leading toward the completion of an Associate of Applied Science with Production Technician emphasis, and upward mobility.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the project are to: 1) provide an educated workforce using industry-validated curriculum to meet regional needs; 2) provide students easier access to course material online; and 3) use a scheduling application to reserve lab stations for student use. To achieve these goals, TMCC proposes to: 1) conduct DACUM analyses with industry employees; 2) provide students easier access to course content online using uniform course design and Quality Matters standards; and 3) research and install a lab scheduling application that will allow distant learners to reserve lab stations before commuting to campus. Additionally, TMCC students will have the opportunity to participate in the Tesla and Panasonic Registered Apprenticeship Programs. The project results will be disseminated at regional and national conferences.  In addition, the flexible scheduling model is expected to be adaptable to other industries nationally supporting both traditional students and those incumbent workers seeking upskilling or re-skilling.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Originally, our Advanced Manufacturing students were learning in a traditional lab setting that met once or twice a week with an instructor at a designated time and day.  Due to many of our local industries having 10 to 12-hour work shifts, TMCC realized it was necessary to provide technicians with easier access to course materials.\n\nTo increase capacity to meet our regional demands, TMCC created easy-to-access labs and added videos to class activities that mirrored the instructors lectures in the classroom.  This allowed students access to lectures online.  Combining the online access to course material with drop-in labs scheduled at convenient times, students could attend when it was convenient for them.  With this easier access to material and labs, TMCCs total percentage passing in the Advanced Manufacturing classes showed an increase of over 9%.  TMCC was also able to accommodate up to 300 students a semester in the same classes that were originally limited to 40 students with fixed times and days.\n\nTo allow technicians to reserve stations in the labs, an online reservation system was tested.  This would permit students to reserve a lab station which would set aside a space for them when they arrived at the campus lab and they would be ready to start without having to wait for an open site.  While students utilized this system of reservations, TMCC found that a great many students did not show up during their intended time.  Because of a limited number of lab stations, it became problematic to have one station tied up all day for reserve.  After testing the lab reservation system, the instructors decided that it was not a good use of the lab to move forward with that concept.  Currently, TMCCs Advanced Manufacturing labs are on a first-come, first served basis.\n\nTMCCs curriculum was validated with local industry by holding a DACUM (Developing a Curriculum).  Industry employees were invited to spend two days at TMCC to discuss what their needs were and what training they would like to see.  The results were analyzed and a chart was developed listing job duties and related tasks that would benefit employees.  This was compared to the current curriculum and any changes necessary were implemented to match up to what was necessary for training in the local industries.\n\nAfter all the changes to our online material, TMCC wanted to make sure that the class content was relevant, accessible, and paired with the current learning outcomes.  One of our classes that runs every semester (and summer) was submitted to a Quality Matters (QM) review to determine if it met their strict standards.  At this time, the corrections that were requested have been made and TMCC has been notified that the course is Quality Matters Gold Standard approved.  These changes can be made to all other courses offered online in Advanced Manufacturing so all courses are consistent, well-organized, and accessible to all students.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/30/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Pat Jarvis"
