 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Conference on Epigenetics and Bioengineering 2017 (EpiBio 2017) is sponsored by the Society for Biological Engineering, and will be held in Miami, Florida. This international conference will bring together established biologists, engineers, biochemists, and clinician-scientists, as well as graduate students to train one another in complementary viewpoints and expertise. To encourage interaction and further discussions, the entire meeting is held in a single-track format, with most meals taken together and with multiple poster sessions (typically presented by students, postdocs, or junior faculty/scientists). This conference is designed to achieve several NSF missions, including; enhancing collaboration with international communities, integrating the engineering sciences with the life sciences, encouraging research and development in multidisciplinary areas, and educating the next generation of young scientists.\u00a0EpiBio 2017 will focus on growing the scientific exchange among epigenetic and bioengineering researchers, and increasing collaboration between international and American scientists.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe elements of the meeting will include scientific talks from leaders in the field, held in plenary format (no concurrent sessions), and poster sessions, with an emphasis on participation from graduate students, postdocs, and young investigators, held in the evenings. Session topics will include: Detecting epigenetic modifications, Editing the epigenome, Epigenetics in bioprocess engineering, and Epigenetics in human health. The organizers are collaborating with the conference chairs on a 10 page supplement to be published in the CEP Magazine on the technologies discussed at the conference.\u00a0The conference proceedings will be published both online on the conference website and in one or two of the AIChE journals, including Biotechnology Progress, in collaboration with Wiley.\u00a0",
