 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU site at Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station aims to provide learning experiences for undergraduate students in the emerging area of Cybermanufacturing. The project will support 10 undergraduate participants from across the nation with an emphasis on recruiting women and underrepresented minority groups. The REU site will engage participants in high quality research, enrichment, and development experiences through a 10-week long summer research program. The project will increase enthusiasm and research skills in advanced manufacturing among early stage undergraduate students thereby preparing them with professional skills to enter the STEM/knowledge workforce and/or to pursue graduate school. Furthermore, this project will provide a valuable entry point for a wide array of students from institutions with limited access to research facilities and a strong impetus to pursue graduate school and careers in this critical and growing industry.\r\n\r\nThe REU projects will leverage the diverse Cybermanufacturing-focused efforts and testbeds of the Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station's Institute for Manufacturing Systems faculty to provide the students with a broad perspective of Cybermanufacturing with specific focus on three critical aspects: a) design and planning, b) in situ prognostics and process control, and c) enterprise-wide optimization and coordination. The research testbeds are co-located as part of the Advanced Manufacturing Facility. REU students will be exposed to this intellectually stimulating research environment and gain critical skills to contribute to this emerging research area.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The theme of this site was cybermanufacturing. The REU site engaged the participants in high-quality research experiences along with enrichment and development experiences through a 10-week summer research program. Overall, this project supported 39 undergraduate participants from across the nation, with over 70% from women and/or underrepresented minority groups. The CM-focused project has also increased&nbsp;enthusiasm and research skills in manufacturing among students in the early stages of their undergraduate education, thereby preparing them with professional skills to enter the STEM/knowledge workforce in manufacturing and/or graduate school.

Almost all of them were either rising juniors or seniors. Ten students were from outside of R1 Research Universities. Figure 1 shows the demographic attributes of the participants. As noted in the graphs, over 70% of the students were from various underrepresented population groups, including 31% female, 28% Hispanic, 26% Asian, and 10% Blacks or African American.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Outcomes related to goal 2:</strong></p>\n<p>The project employed an external evaluator to assess project outcomes independently. The report demonstrates that the student substantially increased their research and other professional skills because of the summer REU experiences (Figure 2).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Outcomes related to goal 3:</strong></p>\n<p>The REU participants were able to conduct high-quality research, some of which were converted into journal articles (see the publications [1-8]). The REU students participated in the Aggies Invent program and visited a large air-conditioning equipment manufacturing company near Houston, Texas (Please see Figure 4 for sample pictures). More importantly, our survey results showed that the students felt they were more prepared to conduct research, join a graduate school, or pursue an industry career in advanced manufacturing after the REU experience (See [11]).</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Publications References:</strong></p>\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Medelin*, A., Du, W., Miao, G., Zou, J., Pei, Z., Ma, C. 2019.
