 "awd_abstract_narration": "PART 1: NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe development of new materials to meet technological goals of society as related to topics that range from energy storage, waste remediation, sustainability, and medicine is increasingly important. Such materials are developed by scientists with diverse backgrounds including chemistry, physics, materials science, and engineering. Approaches to develop novel materials are created by teams of such scientists, where interactions between experts and younger generation researchers are critical to not only stimulate collaboration, but also set a course for the future. The Gordon Research Conference on Crystal Engineering will bring together leading and emerging scientists in Crystal Engineering to enable presentation, networking, and overlap that will serve to meet future materials challenges in a changing world where cost for infrastructure and personnel are at a premium. NSF's Division of Materials Research (DMR) and the Materials Engineering and Processing program in the Engineering Directorate acknowledge the importance of the Crystal Engineering Gordon Research Conference and corresponding Gordon Research Seminar by supporting stipends for registration fee and/or travel support for some young researchers, including students and postdoctoral researchers.\r\n\r\nPART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe 2018 Crystal Engineering Gordon Research Conference, themed ?Progress in Crystal Engineering ? Design, Properties, and Function?, is dedicated to knowledge and understanding by experts in the field on how to design and control the assembly of molecules and ions to form crystals. The Gordon Research Seminar, themed ?Applications and Interfaces in Crystal Engineering?, will provide a forum for graduate students, post-docs, and other scientists with comparable levels of experience and education to present and exchange new results and cutting edge ideas in crystal engineering. Knowledge and understanding in crystal engineering is needed to develop advanced materials for applications ranging from magnetism, energy storage, pharmaceuticals, and chemical synthesis. The 2018 conference will highlight the breadth of crystal engineering as it spans fundamental topics of crystal design to opportunities for commercialization. The conference, with support from NSF's Division of Materials Research (DMR) and the Materials Engineering and Processing program in the Engineering Directorate, will gather leading scientists from academia, industry, and government labs that represent the major areas in crystal engineering. The scientists will interact with the next generation of researchers to promote broader outreach within the crystal engineering community. Progress in prediction, engineering, assembly, and application of crystalline materials will be addressed by a diverse group of experts to push forward the goal to construct tailor made materials with designed function.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
