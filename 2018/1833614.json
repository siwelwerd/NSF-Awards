 "awd_abstract_narration": "The multi-agency Materials Genome Initiative for Global Competitiveness (MGI) evolved from priorities set by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and was based on a recognition of the importance of materials in technology and to society at large. The NSF program \"Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future\" (DMREF) is the primary program by which NSF participates in the national MGI. This project supports travel expenses for participants of a one day symposium: NSF-Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) Minisymposium on the NSF DMREF Program; see http://www.siam.org/meetings/ms18/ for the detail.  This Symposium will be held on July 10, 2018 at the SIAM Conference on Mathematical Aspects of Materials Science (SIAM-MS18) in Portland, Oregon, July 9-13, 2018.  The goal of the symposium is to highlight the recent and current successful projects supported by the DMREF Program in the area of interdisciplinary materials science. \r\n\r\nThe symposium will serve to raise awareness in the applied mathematics community of the features and opportunities of the DMREF program. In particular, SIAM researchers will see two avenues of DMREF participation: as Principal Investigators on mathematics-led proposals or as participants on proposals led by materials scientists and engineers from non-mathematical departments. It is expected that the symposium will tap the potential for the mathematics community to contribute to MGI that has not yet been realized. This includes several diverse mathematical domains outside of those that are typically regarded as \"mathematical materials science,\" for example, optimization, image analysis, and data science and statistics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
