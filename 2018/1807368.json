 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will support a workshop on Molecular Thermodynamics that will be held on the campus of the University of California-Berkeley, from January 7 to 9, 2018. The workshop will bring together technology leaders and junior researchers to develop a roadmap for basic research in response to emerging opportunities and challenges in the Chemical Process Industries. The workshop will foster debate and discussion among scholars from different areas of the Molecular Thermodynamics community to uncover fundamental research questions whose answers will enable overcoming current technological challenges. It will also will also cover topics related to modernizing Engineering Education. Successful development and implementation of new tools for process design and optimization will ensure sustained competitiveness of the U.S. chemical industry while also addressing environmental challenges and promoting energy efficiency.\r\n\r\nRecent trends emphasizing environmental sustainability and improved energy efficiency in the chemical process industries have created new research opportunities in the field of Molecular Thermodynamics. By connecting the physicochemical properties of matter at all length scales, Molecular Thermodynamics has been an enabling tool to accelerate scientific innovations, catalyze emerging technologies, and provide core knowledge for design and optimization of diverse industrial systems, ranging from energy production, materials synthesis, and chemical processing to pharmaceutical and environmental applications. The rapid emergence of new methods in computational algorithms, data science and artificial intelligence provide a unique opportunity for innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration by integrating experimental and computational methods into powerful tools for process design and optimization. In addition to defining new research frontiers in the field of Molecular Thermodynamics, the workshop will also address curriculum development and workforce training issues to ensure continued world-wide competitiveness of the U.S. chemical industry.",
