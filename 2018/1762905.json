 "awd_abstract_narration": "Globally, there is untapped power equivalent to approximately 2,000 nuclear power plants that could be generated at coastal estuaries from the mixing of fresh and salt water. To date, however, there have been no economical ways to extract this clean 'blue' energy from natural salt gradients. This is largely due to the poor efficiencies and high cost of existing membrane technologies. This Grant Opportunity for Academic Research with Industry (GOALI) collaborative award supports fundamental research on a new approach to manufacturing membranes for efficient energy conversion from salinity gradients, using boron-nitride nanotubes (BNNT) as uniquely smooth, highly charged nanoscale pores. The new nanomanufacturing process enables fabrication of energy-harvesting BNNT membranes with power densities ten to 100 times greater than existing membranes, in an efficient and cost-effective manner that can be scaled up to high production rates and large-scale membranes many meter-square in size.  The knowledge base and nanomanufacturing methods that are developed enable renewable energy generation from an under-utilized and non-intermittent power source, and are also generally applicable to the design and manufacture of the specialized membranes that are critical to many industrial processes.  This GOALI collaborative research, between an industrial partner, Chasm Technologies, and Chemical and Mechanical Engineers at two universities, helps students develop multidisciplinary skills and gain industry-relevant experience.  Concerted outreach efforts to spark interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics among women and under-represented minority students enhances diversity and help fill US workforce needs. \r\n\r\nThe GOALI collaborative research project devises the first scalable, roll-to-roll-compatible method for producing vertically aligned boron-nitride nanotube (BNNT) membranes. This is achieved with a solution-based approach that deposits and aligns oligomer-dispersed BNNTs under the influence of an external electric field, and locks the nanostructure in position by in situ polymerization. The project develops a fundamental understanding and methods for solution-based fabrication at lab scales, targeting 1-10 cm2 membranes with pore densities of 108 - 1010 BNNTs/cm2. The availability of such membranes provides answers to basic questions regarding ion and liquid transport in highly charged nanoscale pores, the implications for molecular separations and electrokinetic energy conversion. The academic collaborators are planning to work with industry partner Chasm Technologies to develop the subsystems and processing steps (e.g., coating, electrokinetic alignment, curing, and post processing) to enable roll-to-roll manufacturing of large-area BNNT membranes. Together, the team studies scalability of the manufacturing process, membrane yield and performance as the size is increased to 100 cm2 and beyond.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Through this research, we have successfully developed two fabrication approaches for BN membranes: (1) CVD-coating hBN onto an anodic-aluminum-oxide filter template (Pendse et al., Highly Efficient Osmotic Energy Harvesting in Charged Boron-Nitride-Nanopore Membranes, <em>Adv. Funct. Mater. </em><strong>2021</strong>, <em>31</em>, 2009586), and (2) a novel, solution-based fabrication technique that uses BNNTs in a powder form and provides unparalleled flexibility in the use of different types of nanotubes (Pendse et. al, Intrinsic ion transport of highly charged sub-3-nm boron nitride nanotubes, <em>Materials Today.<strong> </strong></em><strong>2022</strong>, in press). In the latter, solution-based approach, we suspended BNNTs in a liquid urethane prepolymer, and aligned them with an external magnetic field.&nbsp; The BNNTs were then locked in place by UV polymerization to form a vertically aligned BNNT membrane.

In a salt-concentration gradient, the macroscopic BNNT arrays generated per-pore osmotic-power densities up to 15,300 W/m<sup>2</sup>. Compared to other comparably sized ion-selective membranes, these new BNNT membranes had a two-orders-of-magnitude increased per-pore power density. In fact, they maintained the per-pore power densities of previous single- or few- nanopore systems, while increasing the total open area by four orders of magnitude.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The broader impacts of this project are potentially significant and diverse. This research could help enable the efficient harvesting of clean &ldquo;blue&rdquo; osmotic power anywhere there is an osmotic gradient - even a fraction of the global potential of 2.6 TW available at global estuaries would be significant. There may also be opportunities to take advantage of the ultrafast, cation-selective transport in the BNNT membranes for applications such as the concentration of Li<sup>+</sup> ions from salt brines and the desalination of water (Pendse et al., Charged Layered Boron Nitride-Nanoflake Membranes for Efficient Ion Separation and Water Purification, <em>Small </em><strong>2019</strong>, <em>15</em>, 1904590). More broadly speaking, the basic knowledge and nanomanufacturing methods that are developed could be generally applied to the permselective membranes that are at the heart of a wide variety of important applications. The solution-fabricated membranes, which can be made with different nanotubes and functionalizations, could have potential applications ranging from hemodialysis to petrochemical separations. The manufacturing processes that are developed have the potential to impact the industrially important and growing membrane market, which was estimated to be $12.4B in size in 2008 and growing at a compound annual rate of 9%.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/18/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Sangil&nbsp;Kim</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1762905/1762905_10544114_1668813953152_Slide1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1762905/1762905_10544114_1668813953152_Slide1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2D BN membrane fabrication\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1762905/1762905_10544114_1668813953152_Slide1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2D BN membrane fabrication\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Highly Charged Layered Boron Nitride Nanoflake Membranes for Efficient Ion Separation and Water Purification</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sangil Kim</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sangil&nbsp;Kim</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2D BN membrane fabrication</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1762905/1762905_10544114_1668814063326_Slide2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1762905/1762905_10544114_1668814063326_Slide2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2D BN membrane - press release\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1762905/1762905_10544114_1668814063326_Slide2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2D BN membrane - press release\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Press release of 2D membrane work acknowledging the NSF.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sangil Kim</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sangil&nbsp;Kim</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2D BN membrane - press release</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1762905/1762905_10544114_1668814114348_Slide3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1762905/1762905_10544114_1668814114348_Slide3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"BN AAO membrane\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1762905/1762905_10544114_1668814114348_Slide3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"BN AAO membrane\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Highly Efficient Osmotic Energy Harvesting in Charged Boron&#8208;Nitride&#8208;Nanopore Membranes</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sangil Kim</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sangil&nbsp;Kim</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">BN AAO membrane</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1762905/1762905_10544114_1668814180801_Slide4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1762905/1762905_10544114_1668814180801_Slide4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2.7-nm-diameter BNNT membrane\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1762905/1762905_10544114_1668814180801_Slide4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2.7-nm-diameter BNNT membrane\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Intrinsic ion transport of highly charged sub-3-nm boron nitride nanotubes</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sangil Kim</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sangil&nbsp;Kim</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2.7-nm-diameter BNNT membrane</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
