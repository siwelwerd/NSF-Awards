 "awd_abstract_narration": "Downbursts, referring to downward high intensity winds associated with thunderstorms, pose a major threat to power transmission grids in many parts of the United States.  Considering the distributed size of the power transmission infrastructure, significant investments will be needed in order to upgrade the existing systems and properly design new infrastructure to resist downburst wind forces. The goal of this research is to develop an integrative experimental and numerical framework that is capable of characterizing the extent of vulnerability of the power transmission infrastructure against downbursts, and identify the most critical components. The framework will provide knowledge that can help reduce outage-induced societal disruptions caused by downbursts, and thus enable continued national prosperity and welfare following a downburst event. Using this framework, various significant factors for the downburst performance of transmission systems and potential causes of past failures will be investigated. Moreover, this research will develop the first generation of downburst fragility models for transmission tower-line systems (TLSs) using experimentally validated numerical models. These fragility models are crucial for risk-informed decision making for design and management of the transmission grid in order to mitigate future failures and enhance the resiliency of the grid against extreme weather events. The numerical and experimental studies will provide the knowledge needed to enhance design methodologies to include downburst wind loads for transmission line systems.  The research findings will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate courses at Florida International University (FIU) and The Ohio State University to better prepare the future generation of infrastructure engineers. Project data will be archived and publicly shared in the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org/). \r\n\r\nThis research will develop an integrative experimental and numerical framework to characterize the fragility of transmission line systems against downbursts. The experimental research will involve developing a versatile downburst simulator at the NSF-supported NHERI Wall of Wind (WOW) Experimental Facility (EF) at FIU. Using this simulator, a scaled, aeroelastic multi-span TLS will be tested; the results will be used to experimentally validate high-fidelity finite element models of coupled transmission tower-insulator-conductor-foundation systems. Through these experimental and numerical investigations, new knowledge will be gained with regard to the aerodynamic behavior of conductors and drag and shielding effects on lattice tower sections under non-synoptic downburst wind fields. Moreover, these investigations will reveal extreme nonlinear behaviors of transmission line systems in post-elastic regimes when towers are damaged or conductors fail. The research also will provide new physics-based insights into the role of uncertainties in the downburst performance of TLSs. Failure modes that are unique to or are more likely to occur under non-synoptic downburst loadings, as compared to those under synoptic hurricane loadings, will be identified and characterized. The produced data and models will be integrated to develop the first generation of multi-dimensional demand and fragility surfaces for TLSs under downbursts at component- and system-levels using highly efficient and accurate machine learning techniques. In addition, the experimental downburst simulator at the NHERI WOW EF at FIU will provide the natural hazards community with a unique testbed with dual simulation capabilities to generate both non-synoptic and synoptic winds and analyze the impacts on buildings and other structural systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The FIU team expanded the capabilities of the NSF NHERI Wall of Wind Experimental Facility (WOW EF) to simulate downburst winds for the first time. After a successful design stage, the team adopted the wall jet approach to simulate a downburst-like outflow by redirecting the horizontal flow produced by the original WOW 12-fans using a blockage wall equipped by louver slats that open at a predetermined angle. It is crucial to delineate the effectiveness of this approach in simulating the main structural features of downburst events. In addition to extensive flow field point measurements using Cobra Probes, the newly added Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system at the WOW EF was incorporated to provide a more detailed picture of the flow field. The results indicated that although the wall jet approach only produces the outflow portion of the downburst outflow, termed a two-dimensional (2D) simulation, the Primary Vortex (PV) and the trailing vortices can be simulated similar to the impinging jet approach. Furthermore, this approach outperforms the impinging jet in its capability to incorporate larger geometric scales.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Also, information about the flow characterization using PIV system will be provided in a research paper that is currently under development entitled &ldquo;<em>Aeroelastic testing of partially damaged transmission tower prone to downburst-like outflows.&rdquo;</em>.</p>\r\n<p>A grounding step was to design a scaled transmission tower-insulator-conductor system with a geometric scale of 1:50 in the vertical direction and a distorted scale of 1:150 in the horizontal direction. This design was made in three steps: (1) designing and constructing a damaged transmission tower, (2) designing and constructing an undamaged transmission tower, and (3) incorporating the undamaged transmission tower into a TLS comprising three transmission towers. In each step, the model was tested under ABL and downburst winds, except in step (1), where the model was only tested under downburst winds. We also included two special test cases to heighten the realism level by simulating non-uniform loading and conductor breakage cases. All testing cases were conducted at NSF NHERI Wall of Wind Experimental Facility (WOW EF).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The study has shown that the peak dynamic response of a self-supporting tower can be slightly higher under downburst wind loads in comparison to synoptic wind loads, evidenced by the higher acceleration rms the higher standard deviation of base shear and base moments and higher dynamic amplification factor.

This effort focused on improving the accuracy, efficiency, and applicability of advanced methods for risk analysis and decision-making.

This method was validated through benchmark problems and practical engineering applications, demonstrating its robustness in reducing errors in failure probability estimates. Another key advancement in reliability analysis was achieved through the development of adaptive multi-fidelity gaussian process for reliability analysis. This novel approach introduced a collective learning function to simultaneously optimize training point selection and information source, improving efficiency and accuracy. By leveraging high-fidelity and low-fidelity models, this approach achieves precise reliability predictions while reducing computational costs. The method was applied to several complex engineering problems, including fragility analysis of transmission towers, demonstrating its ability to produce high-fidelity fragility models. The limit state function was established using the load factor corresponding to the top node displacement of 0.25 m in the pushover analysis.
