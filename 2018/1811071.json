 "awd_abstract_narration": "Topology is usually thought of as a qualitative form of geometry. This flexibility is important for the role it plays in other areas in being able to deal with somewhat noisy or imprecise data, and reason rigorously about it.  For many purposes, however, one wants to know how large or complex topological constructions are, and how stable solutions are to perturbations.  This requires, technically, that one studies not just nonlinear functions from one space to another, but also spaces that bound measurements (such as the size of derivatives) on the functions.  This mixed analytic topological study will be at the core of the project, with applications to geometric complexity, to spaces with singularities, which benefit from such study, but also require additional geometric and algebraic tools. Application to problems of numerical computation with natural resource bounds is anticipated\r\n\r\nIn more detail, this project will study the complexity measured in terms of Lipschitz constants and bi-Lipschitz constants of homotopies, embeddings, immersions and (volumes for) cobordisms in smooth and PL settings.  In some sense this should have the same relation to usual geometric topology as theoretical computer science has to logic. Indeed, using undecidability results, one can prove lower complexity bounds (as in Nabutovsky's ICM talk), but much homotopy theory, especially stable homotopy theory are decidable, but not effectively so (following Brown). The new information can be thought of as providing geometric information about function spaces of Lipschitz maps, showing that they have some bounds on diameter that are quite striking in comparison to the much larger estimates (that underly approximation theory, and some learning theory) for their volumes (also known as entropy, or covering numbers).  Besides the intrinsic interest in these questions, they also bear on variational problems and perhaps on computation (as in, for example, the Blum-Shub-Smale model).  Earlier variants of these quantitative concerns have already arisen in the study of square integrable cohomology and controlled (and bounded) topology.  These theories will continue to be studied, hopefully revealing more subtle refinements of the Borel/Baum-Connes conjectures in special cases (such as virtually solvable groups) and applications to understanding group actions on aspherical manifolds.  Interestingly, although there is currently no known quantitative bound at all on the number of embeddings of one manifold in another in codimension at least three, finiteness is known (for any Bi-Lipschitz bound), there is a natural strategy combining controlled topology with new information about function spaces to give, conjecturally, sharp estimates for these finite numbers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project was about topology, the rubber sheet geometry.  Topologists study properties that don't change when objects are deformed into one another.  As a result, it is a powerful method for studying qualitative problems.  One of the major threusts of this project was to develop tools for understanding how much distortion actually arises in problems of topology.\n\nOne area within topology where such deformations occur is in hommotopy theory.  It studies nonlinear functions and when one can be deformed to another. The question Chambers, Dotterer, Manin and the PI studied was how much distortion must there be when deforming one function to another provided the functions are not too complicated (measured by the \"Lipschitz constant\" which is roughly the size of a derivative).  When the target is \"non-simply connected\" the estimates are not computable in a precise sense.  No computer can compute the relevant size.  This study would be a generalization of the subject of geometric group theory.\n\nWhen the target is simply connected, we made progress and showed that sometimes (but not always -- \"when it is is\" a new research direction, as is \"what is true, when linearity is not\" ) a linear bound on the complexity of the deformation is all that's needed.  \n\nManiin and the PI applied this to get new information about a problem of Gromov from the 1970's.  We show that spaces that are boundaries are boundaries of spaces that are not much more comlex than they are.  In other words, if a manifold bounds anything, then it must bound something not that complicated.  (Complicated solutions imply the existence of simple ones).  Here the bound is slightly nonlinear.  The method of proof is somewhat classical but building on the above work, but it also involves a new method (based on work of Gromov and Guth) of embedding complicated manifolds in Euclidean space without introducing \"too much\" distotion.  The PI believes that this can have applications elsewhere, such as data science, where dimension reductions with such properties arise.\n\nManin and the PI also studied how complexity restricts the number of functions from one space to another, essentially proving some conjectures and disproving others from the 1970's.\n\nWith Cappell and Yan, the PI studied propblems related to the symmetry of topological spaces by algebraic methods.  We saw a role for the fundamental group (a measure of the 2 dimensional geometry of the space) that changed regarding the natures of the symmetries concerned.\n\nWith Xie and Yu, the PI showed that a certain connection between surgery theory and operator theory preserves algebraic structure - a long held belief of the workers in these fields.  The proof of this enables more precise applications of analytic tools within topology.  Chang, Yu, and the PI exported a topological idea of Siebenmann to give a new index theory of noncompact manifolds that contains very subtle obstructions to geometric problems -- it enables one to see that problems that can be solved inn arbitrarily large parts of a manifold cannot be solved compatibly on the whole space.\n\n \n\nBroader impacts.\n\nThe PI is now chair of Mathematics at University of Chicago, which involves much work on keeping that program running well and is involved in improving it and developing long term infrastructure.
