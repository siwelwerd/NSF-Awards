 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates damage created by natural and anthropogenic vibration sources in freestanding rock landforms, such as arches, towers and fins. While the ability of earthquakes to trigger slope failure is well known, comparably little attention has been given to the role of human vibration sources in driving rock damage, as well as the cumulative effects of repeated exposure on the long-term stability of rock landforms. The investigators identify several sources able to excite resonance and generate damage: earthquakes, wind, trucks, trains, helicopters, and sonic booms. To achieve broader impacts, the investigators will work with National Park Service managers to share knowledge and materials for public dissemination, including animations and sound files, as well as conduct management briefings on potential effects of anthropogenic vibrations on the long-term stability of geologic features. They will train students at the bachelor's, master's, and doctoral levels, including groups underrepresented in STEM, and conduct outreach activities with Native American tribal organizations. They will develop a new science-art collaboration that will result in a publicly shared art piece communicating the dynamic nature of Earth surface landforms. \r\n\r\nThe investigators will develop methodology to assess vibrational modes of geological features from ambient resonance sensing, compile vibration source energy characterizations from seismic and infrasound field data, generate important new data sets measuring resonance induced by select transit sources, and create new statistical analyses of monitoring data to contextualize individual events and sources. They will then use monitoring data to parameterize a broadly-applicable, conceptual fracture mechanics model generating quantitative comparison of the long-term cumulative impact of purely natural or added anthropogenic vibration energy in driving rock mass damage. The analysis creates a unique opportunity for quantitative comparison of anthropogenic and natural contributions to the mechanical degradation of geological features, including the cumulative effects of vibration events across a broad range of magnitudes. This study focuses on culturally valuable rock features in Utah, but the results will be broadly applicable across the world.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We hypothesized that added energy created by these sources may have adverse effects on structural fatigue of rock landforms. Through the project tasks, we generated new data and performed new analyses to explore this hypothesis and quantify the potential effects. Our first study analyzed infrasound generated by helicopters as an energy source capable of exciting resonance of rock arches and towers. We collected data on the frequency of energy generated by different helicopter types, as this energy must match the natural frequencies of the landforms to excite resonance. We then performed in-situ testing to show that helicopter-generated infrasound can excite resonance of rock arches and towers, and defined a metric of admittance that allowed us to quantify this effect. In general, the measured vibration amplitudes on rock landforms were low, but our data allowed us to predict scenarios where these levels might grow higher and reach potentially damaging levels. Our next study looked to create a compilation of the natural frequencies of a variety of different rock towers of varying heights and materials, in order to understand resonance susceptibility to different energy sources. We compiled new vibration data from 14 rock towers in Utah, supplemented by data from sites across the world, to show that first the natural frequencies of towers scale with a ratio of the tower?s width to its squared-height, following a theoretical model which then allows rapid approximation for other towers where measurements are not possible. Our next study used new data to show that rock arches substantially amplify incoming ground motion, e.g. generated by earthquakes, meaning they shake far harder than might be otherwise anticipated. Data from 13 rock arches in Utah demonstrated that peak ground velocities (PGV) on arches are 20?180 times that on adjacent bedrock. The outcome is that because arches experience highly amplified ground motion, the range of earthquakes considered potentially damaging may need to be revised to include lower-magnitude events. These studies provide crucial foundation to evaluate our project?s main hypothesis. However, in order to evaluate the overarching question, we need additional datasets quantifying the vibration energy landscape in natural ?quiet? areas as compared to anthropogenically ?noisy? areas. For this, we collected a year of continuous vibration data from the site of a collapsed rock arch located near a busy highway and rail line, and used available seismological datasets from remote areas in Utah for comparison. We created a new way to describe the vibration environment using magnitude-cumulative frequency models, which then allowed us to generate randomized time series that we could use to evaluate crack propagation. For this, we turned to subcritical fracture mechanics to assess fracture growth rates under the varying stress conditions relating to the different ambient vibration environments. We found that in a single year, a representative crack in an arch will grow ~1% longer in a ?noisy? environment as compared to an area not experiencing added anthropogenic vibration energy. We then added additional vibration events of varying magnitude or frequency of occurrence, informed by field data, imitating arch response to different anthropogenic sources. Our results showed that few moderate magnitude events or many low-magnitude events cause a marked increase in crack growth rates, validating our project hypothesis. Our approach provides a valuable new framework for assessing vibration fatigue and damage to natural rock arches under a broad variety of scenarios, supporting future hazard analyses and conservation efforts for similar landforms across the world.</p>\n<p>Broader outcomes:</p>\n<p>Our project has offered substantial opportunities to share our scientific outcomes and results with the broader public. Working closely with National Park Service personnel, we have been able to share scientific findings with interpretative staff who in turn interface directly with visitors, greatly amplifying our reach, in addition to providing relevant technical inputs for particular resource issues at certain parks. Our studies have also generated substantial interest from national and international news media, receiving extensive coverage that helped broadly share our scientific findings. In addition, we have found that by translating ambient vibration data into sound, we are able to share the dynamics of these landforms in a new way, and have worked with artists in different settings to help communicate this message and inspire a sense of excitement and reverence for these landforms and their associated landscapes. Finally, our project has afforded many opportunities for student supervision and mentoring, starting with the primary PhD dissertation covering all technical aspects of the project, but also including several masters degree projects offered for practicing STEM teachers, a number of undergraduate research opportunities, and several presentations in high school classroom settings.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/02/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jeffrey&nbsp;Moore</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1831283/1831283_10556533_1667419416895_Image5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1831283/1831283_10556533_1667419416895_Image5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Arch cracks\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1831283/1831283_10556533_1667419416895_Image5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Arch cracks\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Example beam-like rock arches with various observed cracks.
