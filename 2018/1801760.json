 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will assess the effectiveness of multifaceted pathways to increase recruitment, engagement, and ultimately graduation rates and career placement of Earth Science majors, focusing on underrepresented Latinx and female groups at Weber State University. The pathways integrate varying combinations of early outreach to high school students, university courses taught in collaboration with local high schools, a summer bridge between high school and university classes, community engaged learning, early introduction to undergraduate research, and support of student cohorts through degree completion. Two different cohorts of students will be recruited each year of the project, cohort 1 from classes taught in local high schools who receive early intervention in preparing for college and participate in the summer bridge program, and cohort 2 from general education classes taught on campus. Both cohorts will then follow a similar pathway of courses, conduct summer research, and receive mentoring from teachers and classmates. By comparing retention rates, changes in student attitudes, and professional socialization for the different pathways, we will assess what combinations of activities and timing best prepare students for geoscience careers. This project will help address the projected shortfall in geoscience workforce nationally.\r\n\r\nThe GETUP (Geoscience Education Targeting Underrepresented Populations) project will develop and assess the effectiveness of a multifaceted approach to increase recruitment, retention, and ultimately graduation rates and career placement of geoscience majors, focusing on underrepresented Latinx and female students at Weber State University (WSU). Although the number of Latinx students attending WSU had risen, participation in STEM fields lags, and despite a growing demand for qualified geoscientists, many students entering WSU are first-generation college students who do not have family traditions in STEM fields. To overcome these challenges, this project will develop pathways to geoscience careers that integrate varying combinations of early outreach to high schools, early collaborative research, student cohorts, community engaged learning, and multiple pedagogies to support varied learning styles. Specific activities include: a Geoscience concurrent enrollment class taught in collaboration with high school teachers that incorporates project-based learning activities and promotes early recruitment; a summer bridge program that helps with a transition to college; community-engaged learning in an environmental geoscience course; a summer research program where students conduct collaborative projects centered around a newly developed Great Salt Lake field observatory; and student cohorts who take a structured sequence of core classes, including a new sophomore-level class that emphasizes work-force skills and career planning. Student successes and attitudes will be assessed at multiple points to evaluate what combinations and timing of activities best enhance recruitment, retention, and professional socialization of underrepresented groups. Two pathways will be compared: one in which students enter the pipeline earlier in high school and have a summer bridge experience; and a second where students are recruited from college courses. Results will be disseminated via publications, workshops, and a dedicated webpage, and materials will be made available to other universities for enhancing recruitment and retention efforts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The primary components of this grant included: 1. a Concurrent Enrollment Physical Geology Course that incorporated project-based learning activities and was taught in collaboration with regional high schools; 2. a Summer Bridge Program, where students joined the university community, learned about university resources, and conducted local research to start building a science identity and explore the dynamic geology and ecosystems in our surrounding area; and 3. a Summer Early Research Experience, where first- and second-year Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences students conducted collaborative projects centered around a newly developed Great Salt Lake Microbialite Observatory.</span><span> </span><span>Following those initial programs, students matriculated into the Department of Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences where they, along with all EES majors, continued work on research projects and were guided as they navigated their degree path, built skills, and looked for jobs and internships in Earth science fields.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The Summer Early Research Experience focused on microbialite reefs that make up the base of the ecosystem in the Great Salt Lake, which generated significant scientific research products. While the program was running, the Great Salt Lake dropped to historic low levels in 2021 and 2022 (Figure 1), exposing large expanses of microbialite reefs to desiccation. We now understand that microbial communities are key contributors to primary productivity in the lake, and the loss of these structures had detrimental effects on the lake ecosystem (Figure 2). Students documented changes to the microbiology, chemistry, and sedimentology of microbialite reef areas during periods of desiccation, and also conducted experiments to assess the potential for microbial community recovery with lake rebound. They found that the consequences of desiccation to the microbial communities and integrity of the microbialites were rapid, but that partial recovery was possible if the structures were re-submerged (Figure 3). The findings and follow-up research conducted by students resulted in a published paper with eight student co-authors in addition to presentations at regional and national meetings. The study emphasized the urgency of managing lake levels in order to protect Great Salt Lake&rsquo;s ecosystem. Students also conducted research on the mineralogy of the microbialites, and found that previously-reported dolomite was actually high-magnesium calcite, a result they presented at multiple geoscience meetings.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The Summer Bridge Program, along with the Summer Early Research and continued independent research projects related to Great Salt Lake and geologic processes in the Ogden area, directly trained more than 55 students in geosciences research methods (Figures 4 and 5).

The increase in students enrolled is a direct result of instructor recruitment and training done by PIs along with course material development and continued instructor professional development over the course of the last five years. We now have a full digital course resource available to all instructors, including assignments utilizing virtual field trips developed and updated over the course of this grant (Figure 6).
