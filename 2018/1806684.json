 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide support for the \"Beyond Standard Model Physics with Driven Neutrino Sources\" workshop. It will be held January 18-19, 2018 on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology campus. The primary intellectual merit of the workshop is in its potential to find a new approach to Beyond Standard Model (BSM) experiments.\r\n\r\nWith respect to benefits to society, this workshop will aid in developing a diverse STEM workforce and encouraging multidisciplinary projects. The plan involves inviting a high fraction of talks by under-represented individuals.  Also, the funding will be used to attract graduate students to this event. With respect to the multidisciplinary nature, the workshop will bring together members of the nuclear-, particle-astro-, experimental-particle-, theoretical-particle- and accelerator-physics communities. \r\n\r\nFunds are provided to support travel for attendees to a workshop that will allow theorists and experimentalists to develop new searches for beyond-Standard-Model (BSM) signatures using driven isotope decay-at-rest sources paired with existing underground detectors. The driven isotope decay-at-rest sources offer high intensity, very pure neutrino flavor sources.  A driven source uses an accelerator to produce an isotope which beta-decays-at-rest.  This enables the use of fluxes from very short lifetime elements, such as lithium-8.   The short lifetime isotopes have relatively high energy endpoints for the flux, typically greater than 10 MeV.    No such source has yet been produced, but the availability of such a source would transform the field.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAlthough the Standard Model has had great successes in predicting the interaction of particles, the story must be incomplete.    The model does not incorporate observations of dark matter, nor explain the massive neutrino, the lightness of neutrino mass, the source of the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe, the periodic-table-like nature of the particle properties, and many other observed results.       This leads us to postulate that there is beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics that unifies and explains these observations.    For many years,  the primary venue for searching for BSM physics was at the highest energy scales, especially at LHC.   However, the consistent set of LHC null search results is now leading particle physicists to look elsewhere.\n\nA promising venue for BSM searches is at neutrino experiments that exploit driven isotope decay-at-rest sources.   These sources offer fluxes of high intensity, that are of a very pure neutrino flavor, and that have very little ``wrong sign\" content.  A driven source uses an accelerator to produce the isotope which beta-decays at rest, thus allowing the use of very short lifetime elements, such as lithium-8.   The short lifetime, in turn, correlates to relatively high energy endpoints for the flux, typically in the 10s of MeV&mdash;much higher than reactor fluxes.     Unlike reactor fluxes, the single-isotope spectrum is much better understood, allowing for precision tests.    Unlike the usual isotope sources that are produced at reactors and then taken to the detector site, driven sources do not require transport of radioactive material, they are constantly replenished so suffer no change in the rate of flux with time, and they can be turned off for beam-off running to determine backgrounds.\n\nThis workshop brought together theorists interested in BSM signatures and experts in driven isotope decay-at-rest sources to discuss and expand the physics case for these experiments.    This grant funded travel for about half of the participants.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe intellectual merit arises from the fact that this was a unique workshop.  There is no other workshop or conference that has been held on this subject.  Also, it is important to note that this was a workshop, not a conference.  We held the minimum of talks to set the stage, worked through the remainder of the time period in small groups, and then reported back regularly.   The smalll groups brought together individuals who had not collaborated together before.   The ability to support travel allowed us to bring an intellectually  diverse group together.   Overall nine individuals of 19 attending the workshop received a travel grant.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThe funding from this grant also allowed us to enhance diversity of gender and academic experience.   This is in keeping with NSF's vision to broaden participation and encourage under-represented groups to enter the field.  Nineteen people attended.  Four were women, and two were supported for travel by this travel grant.   Two under-represented minorities attended, one of whom was supported by this travel grant.    Travel for three graduate students and three postdocs was supported by this grant.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/04/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Janet M Conrad"
