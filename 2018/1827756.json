 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs.  Professor Nigam Rath from University of Missouri-Saint Louis (UMSL) and colleague William Tollman have acquired a single crystal diffractometer equipped with a copper microfocus source and a highly sensitive detector. In general, an X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here impact many areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of graduate and undergraduate students in chemistry and biochemistry at this institution. The new instrument transforms how users approach chemical research. Regional chemistry undergraduate and non-PhD grating institutions such as Webster University and Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville have access to this advanced instrumentation. Outreach programs advance STEM curricula for high school and UMSL undergraduate students via participation in hands-on activities, demonstrations and access to teaching modules.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts single crystal structure determination of weakly diffracting crystals, the use of copper complex models of metalloenzyme active sites and catalyst development for sustainable polymer synthesis, and employment of template-directed syntheses of electroactive and porous materials. The diffractometer is also used to create chiral organometallic architectures to be used as chiral catalysts, the exploration of supramolecular synthesis of metal halide and metal oxide clusters, and for investigating the glycosylation reaction and the synthesis of complex oligosaccharides. The instrument is also used for the characterization of synthesized amphiphiles, for controlling the chemistry of the organic solid state in studies carried out at Webster University. The diffractometer also serves researchers  carrying out structural and reactivity studies of organometallic high-valent group 10 transition metal complexes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
