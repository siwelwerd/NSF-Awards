 "awd_abstract_narration": "A request is made to fund Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) for R/V Roger Revelle, a 273? general purpose Global vessel, and Sally Ride, a 238' general purpose Ocean Class vessel. Both ships are owned by Navy and operated by Scripps Institution of Oceanography as part of the US Academic Fleet. The vessels are scheduled by the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS).  Both vessels support multidisciplinary oceanographic research in all the world?s ocean basins. \r\n\r\nIn 2017, REVELLE completed 282 days, 87 (31%) of which were for NSF. In 2018, she is currently scheduled with 243 days, 146 (60%) of which are for NSF. Sally Ride completed 189 days in 2017. 10 (6%) of these days were for NSF. In 2018, Ride is scheduled for 246 total days of which 96 (39%) are for NSF.\r\n\r\nThe prioritized SSSE request includes the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n1)\tRevelle Crane Replacements\t$388,360\r\n2)\tTopping Hoist Lift Winch\t$104,499\r\n3)\tLebus Shell for RIDE\t$23,892\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$516,751\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
