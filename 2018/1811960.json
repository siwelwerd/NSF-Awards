In addition to disseminating the latest results, CIPANP facilitates both formal and informal exchanges of information and the building of connections between physicists in these fields. The 13th CIPANP will be held May 28 through June 3 in Indian Wells, California and will bring together physicists from around the word. This award supports the participation of early career physicists and will be used to encourage a diverse group of participants. \r\n\r\nCIPANP 2018 is organized with public lectures, plenary, parallel and poster sessions. Topic areas include Physics at High Energies; Precision Physics at High Intensities; Cosmic Physics and Dark Energy/Inflation and Strong-Field Gravity; Neutrino Masses and Neutrino Mixing; Tests of Symmetries and the Electroweak Interaction; Dark Matter; Particle and Nuclear Astrophysics; Heavy Flavors and the CKM Matrix; QCD, Hadron Spectroscopy and Exotics; Parton and Gluon Distributions in Nucleon and Nuclei; Nuclear Forces and Structure, NN Correlations, and Medium Effects; and Quark Matter and High Energy Heavy Ion Collisions.  Proceedings will be published and presentations will be posted on the conference website.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

As this conference series has developed since the first meeting in 1984, the overlap of these areas has markedly increased. For example, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is exploring both elementary particle physics and heavy ion physics, with the ALICE detector particularly designed for studies of lead ion collisions. Explorations of the neutrino sector have attracted both traditional nuclear and traditional particle physicists to measurements of solar neutrinos, reactor neutrinos, long baseline neutrinos and double beta decay. Rare Isotope Facilities have opened up the possibility of innovative studies of the decaying nuclei responsible for the afterglow associated with the neutron star merger Advanced LIGO recently observed.  There is extensive overlap between particle physics and nuclear physics in both theoretical ideas and experimental methods. The CIPANP series has facilitated both formal and informal interchange of information among elementary particle physicists, nuclear physicists, and particle/nuclear astrophysicists.  A consistent goal of this workshop series has been strong participation by younger scientists (senior graduate students, postdoctoral fellows/research associates).\n\nIndian Wells, CA, near Palm Springs, served as the site for the 2018 13thConference on the Intersections of Particle and Nuclear Physics.  The host hotel, the Hyatt Regency Indian Wells, has conference facilities well suited to CIPANP18's 350  participants.  The meeting dates were May 28-June 3, 2018.\n\nThe meeting was organized into morning plenary sessions and afternoon parallel sessions.  The themes around which the program was organized were:\n\n1.  Physics at High Energies \n\n2.  High Intensity and Precision Physics \n\n3.  Cosmic Physics: Dark Energy, Inflation, Strong-Field Gravity \n\n4.  Neutrino Masses, Mixing, and Interactions \n\n5.  Tests of Symmetries and Electroweak Interactions \n\n6.  Dark Matter \n\n7.  Particle and Nuclear Astrophysics\n\n8.  Heavy Flavor and the CKM Matrix\n\n9.  Hadrons: Spectroscopy, Form Factors, and Exotics \n\n10. Parton and Gluon Distributions in Nucleons and Nuclei\n\n11. Nuclei, NN Correlations, and Medium Effects on Hadron Properties  \n\n12. Quark Matter and High Energy Heavy Ion Collisions  \n\nWe made a major effort to encourage participation of younger researchers, with essentially all of the meeting's available support going to such researchers.  Typically we were able to cover half of the hotel costs of such registrants, together with a reduced registration fee.  In addition to support received from the NSF and DOE, most of the US national laboratories and TRIUMF contributed.   This support allowed us to assist 78 participants.  Twelve of these were the student and postdoc convener assistants who helped the conveners by downloading talks.\n\nThe CIPANP18 program -- plenary and parallel talks -- is archived as an Indico site at http://http://cipanp18.berkeley.edu/.  Conference proceedings will be published as an eConference, using the SLAC facility.\n\nReports back to the organizers were fuill of praise for the scientific program and for the choice of venue.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/11/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Wick C Haxton"
