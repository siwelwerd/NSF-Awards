 "awd_abstract_narration": "Active matter is one of the most exciting frontiers in soft matter science. Unlike typical fluids, active fluids are not in equilibrium.  Instead, they consume energy locally, translating this energy into internal flows and spontaneous mixing. In this project, mass transport and chaotic mixing in active fluids will be investigated using a fluid consisting of microtubules and kinesin, biological molecules found in the cell. Densely packed microtubules slide antiparallel to each other at a controlled rate due to coupled kinesin molecular motors. An exciting outcome of this work could be the development of a new class of self-mixing active solvents. Such a solvent could revolutionize our understanding of the kinetics of mass transport and chemical reactions. The present proposal concerns much larger length scales than that of standard solvents and will thus serve as an experimental model for these new ideas, helping to establish fundamental laws that govern the behavior of active matter. Since the contents of biological cells are highly complex active materials, far from equilibrium, this work is expected to yield new insights into the role of active materials in biology. A proposed Telluride workshop on transport in active fluids will help to bring together the relatively disparate fields of liquid crystals, biological fluids and nonlinear dynamics.  This work will have a significant educational impact at UC Merced, a new university in one of California's most socio-economically disadvantaged areas. This research will provide the basis for several undergraduate theses and the PIs will use insights from this work to introduce cutting edge materials to their graduate and undergraduate teaching. \r\n\r\nThis project focuses on transport and mixing in a biologically inspired extensile active nematic. Densely packed microtubules slide antiparallel to each other at a controlled rate due to kinesin molecular motors and the resulting chaotic advection will be measured on different length scales, using the experimental tools of particle tracking, particle image velocimetry, and fluorescence imaging of labeled tracers. Experimental data will be theoretically interpreted using the tools of nonlinear and topological dynamics, thereby merging the fields of chaotic advection and liquid crystals in a unique collaborative effort. Topological entropy will play a central, unifying role in this study. Topological entropy is well known in studies of chaotic advection, but has been thus far overlooked in studies of active nematics. Specific aims are to: 1) use bead tracking and velocity reconstruction, together with tools from nonlinear dynamics, to measure the topological entropy of active nematic mixing; 2) measure the effective diffusivity, enhanced by chaotic advection, of the active nematic on the macroscale; and 3) investigate correlations between molecular-scale dynamics, mesoscale mixing, and macroscale diffusion by varying system parameters.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In our case, we         investigated an active material composed of microtubules and         kinesin molecular motors, powered by the biomolecule ATP         (Adenosine triphosphate). The active material we studied is a         so-called active nematic, a material consisting of small         rod-like biomolecules (microtubules) which exhibits local       orientational order.  At certain points in the material, called       topological defects, the organized molecular order breaks down and       these points turn out to be particularly important regions for the       dynamics of the material.  The topological defects move, turn, and       dance around one another in a very active manner that we describe       with braiding patterns.  Such braiding dynamics have been       previously studied in the context of the chaotic dynamics of       traditional fluid systems, and a theme of this present research       was to adopt such tools from nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory       and apply them to the dynamics of topological defects in active       nematics. \n\nThe         research methodologies consisted of experimental imaging       of the microtubule material using fluorescence microscopy, data       analysis of the resulting movies, especially using nonlinear       dynamics tools, and the development of new nonlinear dynamics       algorithms.  Specifically, we were able to quantify the degree of       mixing in the active fluid using the concepts of topological       entropy and Lyapunov exponents, taken from chaos theory, and show       quantitatively that the defect braiding motion was responsible for       the generation of this mixing.  We also demonstrated fractal       self-similarity, i.e. structure within structure, in the active       nematic and developed a simple theoretical model that could explain the creation of the fractal self-similarity from the       self-generated stretching and folding dynamics of the material.       Furthermore, we studied how different confinement geometries,       including wells, cardioids, pillars, channels and stairsteps,       influenced the fluid speeds and the degree of mixing. This work       involved developing new microfluidic techniques to handle the       active material and confine it successfully. We discovered that       the motion of the defects can be controlled using microfabricated       topologies and specific confining geometries.\n\nActive matter is currently a \"hot topic\" at the nexus of         physics, biology, materials science, and applied math.  The         present research is important to the broader field of       active materials because it helps one understand better how to       control these materials and how to coax them to more efficiently       mix.  This could, in turn, help produce better micro-mixing in       microfluidic systems.  Furthermore, since this system is inspired       by biological processes, and indeed is made of biological       molecules, it might provide insight into the mixing dynamics of       biological systems.  Finally, we have shown that microtubule-based active nematics provide a new platform for the study of chaotic       dynamics in fluid systems, helping to advance the field of applied       nonlinear dynamics.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/21/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kevin A Mitchell"
