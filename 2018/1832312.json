The 2018 Expeditions PI Meeting builds on the previous Expeditions PI Meeting and Expeditions research by fostering collaboration and promoting close interaction between academia and industry, governments, research labs, etc. The meeting is a unique opportunity to interact with a broad cross-section of the scientific community, CISE leadership, as well as with leaders in both industry and academia. It also provides an important venue for scanning horizons activities, establishing new collaborations between different collaborating teams, and exploring possible technology transfer and partnerships.\r\n\r\nThese meetings are designed to advance knowledge by exposing the progress of compelling and transformative collaborative research conducted by multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary research teams that promise disruptive innovations in computer and information science and engineering, to allow PIs to showcase their research, and to provide an opportunity to network. The 2018 Expeditions PI Meeting will bring together approximately 150 stakeholders comprising academia, industry, and government. The Expeditions PI Meeting 2018 will take place on the 10th year anniversary of the Expeditions program launch.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The meeting was designed<em> </em>to expose the rich accomplishments and impact on society at large of CISE's center-scale, flagship projects, to discuss future directions for the program, and to serve as an \"Aspiring PI Meeting\" where PIs of medium and large CISE project can learn about what it takes to run an Expeditions project.</span></p>\n<p><span>Expeditions are the single largest CISE-funded projects.

Expeditions are important because they last longer over space and time and provide good ROIs to the Federal government.
