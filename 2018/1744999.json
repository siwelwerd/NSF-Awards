 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Southern Ocean contains an extraordinary diversity of marine life. Many Antarctic marine organisms have evolved in stable, cold ocean conditions and possess limited ability to respond to environmental fluctuations. To date, research on the physiological limits of Antarctic fishes has focused largely on adult life stages. However, early life stages may be more sensitive to environmental change because they may need to prioritize energy to growth and development instead of maintenance of physiological balance and integrity- even under stress conditions. This project will examine the specific mechanisms that young (embryos, larvae and juveniles) Antarctic fishes use to respond to changes in ocean conditions at the molecular, cellular and physiological levels, so that they are able to survive. The aim is to provide a unifying framework for linking environmental change, gene expression, metabolism and organismal performance in different species that have various rates of growth and development. There is a diverse and robust education and outreach program linked with the research effort that will reach students, teachers, young scientists, community members and government officials at local and regions scales. \r\n\r\nPolar species have already been identified as highly vulnerable to global change. However as yet, there is no unifying framework for linking environmental change to organismal performance, in part because a mechanistic understanding of how stressors interact at the molecular, biochemical and physiological level is underdeveloped is lacking for most species. In the marine environment, this paucity of information limits our capacity to accurately predict the impacts of warming and CO2-acidification on polar species, and therefore prevents linking climate model projections to population health predictions. This research will evaluate whether metabolic capacity (i.e. the ability to match energy supply with energy demand) limits the capacity of Antarctic fishes to acclimate to the simultaneous stressors of ocean warming and CO2-acidification. If species are unable to reestablish metabolic homeostasis following exposure to stressors, increased energetic costs may lead to a decline in physiological performance, organismal fitness, and survival. This energy-mismatch hypothesis will be tested in a multi-species approach that focuses on the early life stages, as growing juveniles are likely more vulnerable to energetic constraints than adults, while different species are targeted in order to understand how differences in phenology and life history traits influence metabolic plasticity. The research will provide a mechanistic integration of gene expression and metabolite patterns, and metabolic responses at the cellular and whole organism levels to broadly understand metabolic plasticity of fishes.  The research is aligned with the theme \"Decoding the genomic and transcriptomic bases of biological adaptation and response across Antarctic organisms and ecosystems\" which is one of three major themes identified by the National Academy of Sciences in their document \"A Strategic Vision for NSF Investments in Antarctic and Southern Ocean Research\". Additionally, this project builds environmental stewardship and awareness by increasing science literacy in the broader community in three main ways: First it will increase the diversity of students involved in environmental science research by supporting one PhD student, one postdoctoral scholar and two undergraduate students and promoting the training of young students from groups traditionally underrepresented in environmental biology. Second, the project will participate in UC Davis's OneClimate initiative, which leverages the community's expertise to develop broad perspectives regarding climate change, science and society, and engage K-12 students, government officials, and local and statewide communities on topics of Antarctic research, organismal adaptation as well as ongoing and potential future changes at the poles. Lastly, summer workshops will be conducted in collaborations with the NSF-funded education program APPLES (Arctic Plant Phenology: Learning through Engaged Science), to engage teachers and K-12 students in polar science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
