 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parity and time (PT) symmetry underlies the fundamental laws of physics, and has been extensively studied in atomic, molecular, solid-state, and high-energy physics. Lately, PT symmetry has emerged as an interesting subject of optics research, and as a versatile resource promising a multitude of capabilities not offered by conventional systems based on coherent optical effects. Yet most studies thus far have been concentrated in classical optics. This project will make an experimental attempt, guided by theoretical efforts, to study PT and anti-PT symmetry in quantum optics, where a breadth of new phenomena and application opportunities are expected in optical computing, secure communications, and others. To this end, a scalable nanophotonic platform will be developed so that the project outcomes can be quickly adopted by broad research communities and industrial stakeholders in quantum computing, quantum communications, single mode laser, and others. The project will be carried out collaboratively by experimental and theoretical researchers from Stevens Institute of Technology and Kennesaw State University. Scholars and students in both institutes will get exposed to this new research front and encouraged to think outside the box, such as seeking unconventional solutions to critical technological challenges. Through the Stevens Technical Enrichment Program and institutional affiliations with organizations such as the Women in Engineering Program and the National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering, focused outreach activities will be made to students from low income and under-represented groups. At Kennesaw, a Physics Day program will be hosted for local elementary and middle school students with displays of science and knowledge through hands-on demonstrations. In addition to the standard knowledge dissemination via publications and conference presentations, quantum science and technology workshops open to public will be held yearly rotating between the two institutes. \r\n\r\nA chip-integrated optical platform for probing exotic quantum dynamics under PT and anti-PT symmetry will be developed based on lithium niobate nanophotonics and quantum nonlinear optics techniques. The effects of PT symmetry and its broken phase will be examined at a single photon level by linking spontaneous parametric down-conversion with phase sensitive amplification. The quantum anti-PT effects will be explored using three evanescently-coupled micro-ring cavities, one with strong dissipation, and by measuring the resultant transmission spectra and photon correlation. The successful outcomes of this project will deepen the understanding of the fundamental roles that gain and loss play in quantum physics and their implications for open quantum systems, while providing experimental insights to several outstanding questions in this field. Furthermore, the new quantum phenomena under PT and anti-PT symmetry may lead to elegant solutions to several key challenges in quantum information processing, including those caused by dissipation and decoherence. Although the present experimental research is to study specifically a couple of fundamental quantum effects, the developed systems and techniques are ready to be deployed for other optics and photonics research and applications. Overall, this collaborative project will extend PT and anti-PT studies to the experimental domain of quantum optics, and potentially pave a way to new opportunities in quantum science and optical engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
