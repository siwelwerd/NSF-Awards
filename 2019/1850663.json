 "awd_abstract_narration": "The UCSB Mathematics Summer Research Program for Undergraduates aims to provide a full research experience to undergraduate students in mathematics from different backgrounds. Over the course of the eight-week program, the students will learn to investigate and solve open problems in diverse areas of mathematics, to work in a collaborative environment, to communicate their mathematical results through talks and written reports, and to publish their findings in appropriate journals with the goal of disseminating their research. The program will expose the participants to daily life in graduate school, through interactions with graduate students, graduate advisors, faculty and postdocs in the UCSB math department. In addition, through professional development workshops, the participants will learn about different areas in industry that demand professionals with good research skills. \r\n\r\nHistorically, the UCSB REU has not focused on a specific area of mathematics. However, the program intends to be accessible to students with a variety of backgrounds in mathematics. Thus, the research projects are likely to be in linear algebra, matrix analysis, numerical linear algebra, combinatorics and graph theory; that is, in areas that do not require extensive mathematical background from students. Examples of topics that have been studied in this program before include 1) primitive circulant matrices; 2) matrix polynomials and linearizations; 3) matrix equations; 4) parking functions; 5) Alexander and Jones polynomials; 6) sequential dynamical systems.  The topics will change every year depending on the active research areas of the mentors involved in the program. The final goal is to expose the students to the techniques and methods used to tackle problems in these areas, to publish papers in refereed professional journals, and to participate and give talks in conferences for undergraduates. The REU concludes with a poster conference in which undergraduates doing summer research in all the UCSB departments present their results and make it accessible to non-experts in the area. Previous projects and publications as well as more information about the program can be found on the website http://math.ucsb.edu/REU.\r\n\r\nThis site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our program offered the participants the opportunity to experience a full research experience as well as professional development training. Each student&nbsp; was assigned to a research group led by a UCSB faculty, sometimes supported by a graduate student. The goal was producing publishable material. This goal&nbsp; was achieved in several opportunities. In fact, the program has produced 5 papers, 3 of which have already been published and 2 of which are submitted and still under consideration. Additionally, a paper from the previous cycle of our REU was also published recently. The title of some of the projects are \"<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03268\">Linearizations for interpolatory&nbsp; bases - a comparison: New families of linearizations</a>\", \"<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04369\">Almost Abelian Lie groups, subgroups and quotients</a>\", \"<span>Linear maps preserving the Lorentz spectrum: the 2x2 case\", \"<span>On why using DLP to solve the symmetric polynomial eigenvalue problem might need to be reconsidered.\" A full list of the projects can be found in our annual reports.&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span>The students were trained to produce mathematical conjectures, do numerical experiments in a computer, test their conjectures, prove their conjectures, work cooperatively, write a technical report or paper for a journal, give presentations in a conference, produce a poster and present it to non-experts, etc. During the pandemic the program was ran fully online in a successful way.
