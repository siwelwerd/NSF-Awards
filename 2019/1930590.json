 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports three conferences, called KUMUNU, focused on research in commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, and related areas to be held in the falls of 2019, 2020, and 2021 at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, with the 2019 conference being held on September 21-22. The general goal of KUMUNU is to provide a setting to share cutting-edge mathematical research and promote collaborations among algebraists in or within driving distance of the Great Plains region. KUMUNU aims to advance mathematics through the dissemination of new and innovated results and techniques via research talks.  These talks may inspire participating mathematicians with new ideas, and promote collaboration among them. Informal discussions while talks are not running should also help spread new results and ideas. The conferences will also give opportunities for early-career mathematicians to showcase their work.\r\n \r\nConfirmed speakers for the 2019 conference are Federico Castillo (University of Kansas), Srikanth Iyengar (University of Utah), Linquan Ma (Purdue University),  Hamid Rahmati (University of Nebraska), Liana Sega (University of Missouri - Kansas City), and Gordana Todorov (Northeastern University). The conference will also include a poster session for junior researchers.  The talks will be held from noon on Saturday to noon on Sunday, to minimize expenses for participants. Since some of the talks will not be focused purely in commutative algebra or algebraic geometry, new connections may be made. Moreover, the conference will hold a poster session aiming to give a number of junior researchers exposure in the commutative algebra and algebraic geometry community, a chance to meet potential collaborators, and a venue to network with senior researchers. More details are available at the conference website: https://www.math.unl.edu/~tmarley1/KUMUNU/KUMUNU2019.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
