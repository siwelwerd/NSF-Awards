 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Division of Chemistry is supporting the research of Professor Aaron Aponick of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Florida.  The project focuses on the design of new kinds metal-containing complexes used in the synthesis of organic compounds used in agriculture, clean energy technologies and pharmaceuticals. The chemical industry relies on such reactions as means of producing new compounds and materials more easily than classical reaction chemistry (with less energy, time or required separations).   The team led by Professor Aponick is developing catalysts that show promise for the applications in advanced manufacturing. This project also provides hands-on training for students.  Public outreach is achieved by public lectures at the University of Florida. Public outreach also includes Chemistry Day at the Mall, Molecular Mania. This event is popular with children and fosters interactions with the public in general. Many visitors with diverse socioeconomic backgrounds\r\nparticipate.\r\n\r\nThe Chemical Synthesis Program of the Division of Chemistry is supporting the research of Professor Aaron Aponick of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Florida who is developing a new class of ligands for homogeneous catalysis. His \"P-N\" ligands incorporates imidazole substituents in an atropisomeric chiral biaryl backbone.  Many P,N-ligands are known, but Professor Aponick's imidazole-based systems exhibit distinctive and often superior catalytic behavior.  A major aim of the research is to elucidate the principles underpinning the reactivity and selectivity imparted by this modular ligand platform.  Mechanistic studies are being employed to provide a fundamental understanding of the organometallic chemistry.  The Aponick group is utilizing kinetic and crystallographic studies to interrogate how the coordination chemistry of these so-called Stack-ligands influences the catalytic activity.  Further studies utilize the more basic and geometrically constrained imidazole moiety to enable new reactions that rely on what appears to be a bifunctional and hemilabile coordination motif.  With this strategy, new enantioselective copper- and palladium-catalyzed reactions are being developed. This research program is providing hands-on training for students.  Their professional development is emphasized in all aspects of the work.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe development of chiral ligands for catalytic enantioselective organometallic reactions is of the utmost importance for the advancement of a variety of different fields.  Pushing the boundaries of synthetic chemistry enables the synthesis of next generation materials, medicines, and fine chemicals.  This project centered on advancing a unique family of ligands under development in our laboratory, now dubbed Stack-ligands.  These ligands contain a phosphine and an amine for coordination (a P,N-ligand) and feature a chiral biaryl imidazole where the chiral axis is stabilized by pi-pi interactions.  The research here was centered on developing new chemistry that is enabled by the novel ligand structure.  Over the course of the project, the work focused on furthering copper acetylide addition chemistry and expanding the scope of the applications available with these ligands to palladium chemistry.  Through this work, we found that using a small subset of ligands from the StackPhos family provides useful information on the chiral space needed for efficient and selective catalysis, thereby streamlining reaction development.  This was applied to copper-acetylide chemistry where it was used to produce useful chiral materials.  Additionally, we have found that our Stack ligands are quite selective in palladium catalyzed processes such as cross-coupling and are uniquely suited to interesting new palladium (II) chemistry as they are superior at recognizing enantiotopic olefin pi-faces.  This latter information led to the development of a novel lactone synthesis that is a reverse Tsuji-Trost reaction, of sorts.\n\nIn addition to the scientific aspects of this work, the broader impacts stem from a variety of activities.  The human resource development component of the work originates from the training that the research participants receive.  Their development is both technical, where they learn the essential skills and techniques needed for employment as a synthetic chemist in fields such as the pharmaceutical industry, agrochemistry, or materials science, and intellectual as they build the skills needed to devise, optimize, and troubleshoot new reactions and reaction sequences.  We are also committed to outreach and education.  Although, during the award period, this was impacted by the Covid epidemic, we participated in Molecular Mania, which is an outreach event at a local shopping mall.  In addition, the PI is the conference chair of the FloHet conferences that bring approximately 200-250 synthetic chemists together in Gainesville, FL every other year.  In 2020, we increased the participation from primarily undergraduate institutions by inviting and encouraging professors and undergraduates to attend and present their work.  This was successful in that their attendance and participation increased, but this also resulted in students, some from groups that have historically been underrepresented in the sciences, to apply and attend our graduate program, and likely others.  Through these training, teaching, and outreach efforts we are impacting the next generations of scientists.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Aaron Aponick"
