 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is directed toward gaining a better understanding of wintertime air pollution in the United States.  Chemical modeling will be used to analyze data from a recent field study, the NSF-funded Wintertime INvestigation of Transport, Emissions, and Reactivity (WINTER) campaign conducted during February and March of 2015. The results of this research will be relevant for policy decisions regarding improvements in air quality.\r\n\r\nThe three research objectives of this project are to: (1) improve the constraints on wintertime pollutant emissions; (2) elucidate the origin of oxidants during winter; and (3) examine the seasonal response of particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5) and ozone concentrations to past and future changes in emissions. The GEOS-Chem chemical transport model will be used to interpret the observations from the WINTER field campaign.  Because emissions of ammonia (NH3) from livestock operations and fertilized fields are highly uncertain, this project includes an examination of the ability of different NH3 emissions inventories in the model to capture the observed winter concentrations of ammonium (NH4+) and NH4+ wet deposition fluxes over the US.  Primary and secondary organic aerosol precursor emissions will be constrained in order to improve the representation of organic aerosol in the model.  Wintertime ground-based and aircraft observations of HCHO and ClNO2 will be used to investigate their sources during winter. Finally, the model will be used together with surface observations to further understand the seasonal sensitivity of surface PM2.5 composition to emission changes over the entire US.  This project will support a postdoctoral scholar and a graduate student.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
