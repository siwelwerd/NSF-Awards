 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) workforce through the development of highly competitive students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African-Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity is to increase the quantity and quality of STEM graduate students from underrepresented populations, with emphasis on Ph.D. matriculation and completion. For the U.S. to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy. BD programs implemented in the nation's institutions of higher education contribute to addressing one of the objectives in NSF's 2018-2022 Strategic Plan, namely to \"integrate education and research to support development of a diverse STEM workforce with cutting-edge capabilities.\" \r\n\r\nThe Illinois Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (ILSAMP) is led by Chicago State University, which is a Predominantly Black University (PBU). The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), a minority-serving institution, will host the 2019-2021 BD cohort of 12 historically underrepresented minority postbaccalaureate students pursuing graduate degrees in STEM disciplines.  UIC will offer a comprehensive program that includes rigorous academic preparation and research training experiences as well as mentorship and professional development activities. Since the strategies implemented at UIC will result in the production of well-trained, highly-skilled STEM professionals from underrepresented minority groups, the project contributes significantly to increasing the diversity and representation in academia and the STEM workforce, thereby ensuring the nation's global competitiveness. \r\n\r\nSince 2006, the ILSAMP BD at UIC has produced 29 STEM PhDs to this population of participants.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
