 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the biggest questions that ecology asks is, how can so many different kinds of species coexist? Species interact with each other in many different ways. Some species compete for resources like food or places to live, some eat or parasitize others, some need other species in order to survive. Given all of these relationships, how do we explain, or even better predict, which species will be able to live with each other long-term (i.e. stably coexist)? This question is particularly important today, as global changes are altering which species are encountering each other. Ecologists have devised several theories to address the question of how species coexist. For example, species that compete for food may coexist by eating different types of food when they co-occur. Or, species may be better at acquiring food in different types of environments, and so may coexist by using different microhabitats. If species differ in traits that allow them to use resources or habitats in different ways, then trait differences can be used to predict if and how species can coexist. Whether trait variation predicts coexistence in consistent ways across all types of communities is a potentially powerful hypothesis that if true would allow researchers to predict how communities will change over time in response to environmental change. In principle, this hypothesis should apply across the tree of life. However, key aspects of the underlying theory have only been tested in a handful of study systems, mainly plants and microorganisms. As a result, the generality of these ideas and therefore their full impact remains untested in animal communities. This research will integrate morphology and ecology to test whether these ideas can apply to a lizard community. This research will contribute to broadening participation in science by providing research training to undergraduate students from the University of Hawaii, one of the most diverse college campuses in the country. \r\n\r\nThe research strategy is to 1) measure traits, 2) generate predictions for experimental outcomes based on trait differences and hypothesized coexistence mechanisms, and 3) test predictions using a mesocosm experiment. The study species are two anoles (Anolis carolinensis, A. sagrei), and a day gecko (Phelsuma laticauda), all of which are non-native to Hawaii. Lizards will be introduced to experimental enclosures with two different habitat treatments. The degree to which prey are differentially depleted by each species will be measured in the two habitats as a proxy for R*, which is the minimum resource level that can support a population. This will allow for determination of the importance of resource partitioning vs. spatial heterogeneity in competitive ability. Monitoring of mortality due to predation in the different habitat types will indicate the potential role for spatial heterogeneity in predator susceptibility in driving coexistence. By distinguishing among these mechanisms and connecting them to traits this research will generate and test predictions regarding the outcome of species interactions in arboreal lizard communities specifically, and more generally provide a case study to guide future work testing coexistence theory in macrofauna.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Contemporary environmental change takes many forms, such as warming temperatures, habitat change from natural to urban or agricultural uses, and the introduction of species to new areas to name a few. If we can understand the mechanisms by which animals interact with the physical environment as well as the other organisms they live with, then we can make predictions for how animals will respond to these changes. Better predictions will allow us to better manage these changes for the wellbeing of humans and all life on Earth.</p>\n<p>Our study system was the introduced lizard community in Hawaii, USA. Hawaii is extremely geographically isolated, such that no lizards have colonized it naturally. Species introductions have resulted in a unique community of arboreal lizards from opposite sides of the planet: anoles from the Americas, and day geckos from Madagascar. Our previous work has shown that our three focal lizards differ in their ability to cling to surfaces, and that this determines how they use their habitat. For example, day geckos (<em>Phelsuma laticauda</em>)<em> </em>are superior clingers on natural smooth surfaces, and they almost exclusively use smooth surfaces like leaves in the field. Our grant built on these relationships to determine how traits affect a key aspect of species interaction: competition for food.</p>\n<p>We found that traits predicted competitive ability in different microhabitats by measuring what happens to prey in the presence of the different lizard predators. We measured over 29,000 prey items (e.g., insects, arthropods) in experimental enclosures, each with a different lizard predator population present. If lizards are competing for prey, then whichever species can deplete prey the most will be the best competitor for prey. Day geckos depleted prey the most in the vegetation, while brown anoles (<em>Anolis sagrei</em>) depleted prey most on the ground, and these differences were consistent with our previously determined patterns of clinging ability and habitat use. In other words, in the presence of day geckos, the amount of prey we collected in the vegetation was the lowest, and in the presence of brown anoles, the amount of prey we collected on the ground was the lowest. In contrast, green anoles (<em>Anolis carolinensis</em>), were inferior competitors in both microhabitats because they have intermediate traits and use both microhabitats equally. This result helps explain the pattern observed on the landscape: green anoles have been declining in Hawaii since the introduction of the other two species (brown anoles and day geckos) in the 1980s. In addition, we did not find evidence for resource partitioning. In other words, lizards did not differ in which types of prey they depleted the most.</p>\n<p>Thus, we were able to distinguish between two distinct mechanisms by which lizards could be competing for food, and these mechanisms make different predictions for how lizards should respond to a change in their environment. For example, if a diversity of microhabitats is available, then brown anoles and day geckos should be able to coexist, since each is the superior competitor in a different microhabitat. Green anoles should be able to coexist with either one of the other species, but not both. If there is a change in the environment that affects microhabitat availability, then our results would allow us to predict which species could still coexist. For example, if a large predatory lizard that lives on the ground was introduced, this would effectively remove the ground microhabitat as source of prey, and brown anoles would be outcompeted by the other species in the vegetation. Importantly, the finding of no prey partitioning means that environmental changes that affect insect community composition would not be predicted to affect lizard species interactions. This underlines how understanding the mechanism by which traits affect performance and ultimately ecology is critical for predicting how species and communities will respond to change. Different mechanisms make different qualitative predictions. Our grant was successful in building a compelling case study for how this process works and can be used to understand the outcome of species interactions in novel communities. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another key outcome of this grant was building STEM capacity through training diverse scientists.
