This is the twentieth in a series of biennial logic meetings at UCLA which, starting in the mid-1970s, has been one of the most important forums for mathematical logic on the West Coast. \r\n\r\nThe meeting is a key opportunity for logicians to learn about and discuss important advances in research, to exchange ideas, and to collaborate on scientific projects. About half the grant funds are dedicated to travel awards for graduate students and early-career researchers. Sharing of information among meeting participants will have a positive impact on their research and teaching. The meeting's webpage is at http://www.math.ucla.edu/~ineeman/Conf/VIG2019/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
