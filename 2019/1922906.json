 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a pressing need to build a skilled and diverse STEM workforce in the United States. Determining how to navigate aspirations and aptitudes during college is a major hurdle for many students. Examining the transcript \"stories\" of undergraduate cohorts can help postsecondary institutions and future students (1) contextualize the range of course-taking possibilities and performance levels associated with destination majors, and (2) identify key crossroads that students on certain paths will likely encounter. The study helps uncover barriers to STEM degree completion by examining the relationship between course-taking pathway and student characteristics. This project builds on prior knowledge regarding common \"leaks\" in the STEM pipeline and offers a new framework for assessing the overall health of academic majors relative to each other, taking into account patterns of migration both in and out of STEM. Drawing on social sequence analysis and network science and incorporating student demographic information, this study provides essential information to inform policies and practices for STEM education. \r\n\r\nCollege course sequences from eight consecutive semesters of transcript data for two cohorts of undergraduates at a public university are used to document in- and out-migration patterns through STEM and non-STEM majors. As with all campus-specific transcript studies, these data reflect the sorting of a student population that (1) is subject to the same institutional policies, (2) experiences the same exact classroom environment when co-enrolled in a given class, and (3) constitutes true peers in terms of classroom performance hierarchies. Each cohort is first described using an origin-destination typology, which classifies students who start and finish in STEM, students who migrate out of STEM, students who migrate into STEM, and students who start and finish in non-STEM majors. Second, network methodology is employed to quantify the typicality of a student's course-taking sequence relative to other students, an approach that offers insight into the distribution of pathways through academic majors. Finally, course-taking pathways are linked with student characteristics, including gender, race/ethnicity, first-generation student status and ACT scores. These results will be of immediate utility for many stakeholder groups, including students, educators, and policymakers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

First, we developed a new concept related to the college major, which we refer to as 'path homogeneity.' We define this as the extent to which students enrolled in a major take the same courses in the same sequence. In the extreme, course-taking paths are perfectly homogenous when all students within a cohort flow through a program in the same way at the same time (i.e., course-progression uniformity). To illustrate, a nursing program that creates cohorts by assigning all new students into the same course schedule would be highly path homogenous. In contrast, a major that exhibits a high degree of path heterogeneity is one in which cohorts exhibit a low degree of course-taking overlap; students take courses at different times from one another, and perhaps take different courses altogether. For example, a degree in history or literature that might require only one or two core courses while offering students a broad menu to select coursework matching their interests would likely be highly path-heterogenous. Path homogeneity can originate from multiple sources. One likely driver of course-progression uniformity are course and sequencing requirements maintained by the department in which the major is housed. These departmentally enforced requirements likely come from broader accreditation standards or disciplinary norms that are larger than any one institution. But path uniformity might also be idiosyncratic to a major's department or institution and therefore amenable to policy nudges.

We theorized that students? deliberations about persistence are shaped, in part, by the extent to which they perceive their major--their local organizational context--to be flexible and open versus narrow or rigid.
