 "awd_abstract_narration": "Economists often analyze questions such as whether a consumer will buy a car or not (yes or no) and if so how much to spend on the car (an amount that takes any value).  Economists do not have a good method to analyze these questions.  This research project will develop a new and efficient method to analyze data that has these characteristics.  The results will give social science researchers an important tool to analyze problems that involve complicated data structures.  With ever increasing sophisticated data collection and the availability of powerful computing power, a method that can be used to efficiently analyze such complicated data sets will be extremely valuable to researchers and policy makers in all fields.  The methods developed in this research will be programmed and be freely available to all researchers.  The results of this research will allow researchers to give more accurate advice to policy makers and thus improve decision making and economic growth.\r\n  \r\nThis research project develops a framework for estimating mixed discrete-continuous distributions where the multivariate discrete part of the distribution can have either a large or a small number of support points; may be smooth or not, and these characteristics can differ from one discrete coordinate to another.  The optimal convergence rates for estimation of discrete-continuous distributions will be derived in these settings.  Preliminary results suggest that smoothing is beneficial only for a subset of discrete variables with a quickly growing number of support points or sufficiently high level of smoothness.  The proposed estimation procedures are based on Bayesian mixtures of multivariate normal distributions with covariate dependent mixing weights.  The proposed methods will deliver practical and optimal adaptive nonparametric alternatives to standard econometric models such as ordered probit and Poisson regression, and first stage estimators in two stage estimation procedures for structural discrete choice models.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNonparametric or very flexible estimation methods have become more accessible and useful as fast computers and large datasets have become widely available.  The theory and practical implementation of such methods for continuous data are very well developed at this point.  However, in most applications, especially in economics and other social sciences, the data contain both continuous and discrete or categorical variables such as the number of filed patents or the number of firms entering a particular market.  Nonparametric methods for multivariate discrete and mixed discrete-continuous distributions and their theoretical properties are less understood and developed.  This research project addresses this issue. \n\nThe standard flexible approach to estimation of discrete distributions is to use observed frequencies as estimators of the corresponding probabilities.  When the number of values that discrete variables can take is large, which is common in practice at least in the multivariate case, the standard frequency estimators perform poorly.  A natural solution to this problem is to smooth the observed frequencies.  The estimation procedures developed in the project optimally take advantage of smoothness in the data if it is present and at the same time perform no worse than the standard frequency estimators if the data are not sufficiently smooth.  More specifically, first, we propose a theoretical framework for estimation of mixed discrete-continuous distributions where the multivariate discrete part of the distribution can have either a large or a small number of possible values and it can be either very smooth or not, and these characteristics can differ from one discrete coordinate to another.  In these settings, the best possible (optimal) convergence rates for estimation of discrete-continuous distributions are derived.  Second, we develop feasible estimation procedures that adaptively, without a priori knowledge of smoothness levels of the data, achieve the derived optimal convergence rates. These procedures are shown to have better theoretical properties and performance in applications than the existing methods. \n\nThe project research was presented in several scientific conferences and invited seminars.  The project resulted in three articles published in the top general interest and top field journals in economics. The computer code for the implementation of the estimation procedures is publicly available on the PI university website and on the websites of scientific journals as data supplements for the published articles.

The methods for estimation of discrete-continuous distributions developed in the project can improve analysis of discrete or discrete-continuous data in any scientific field.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/10/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andriy Norets"
