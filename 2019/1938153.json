 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Puerto Rico Rio Piedras, California State University Stanislaus, University of the District of Columbia and Northern Michigan University will address the dearth of Ancestral Computing for Sustainability in computer science education. The primary goal of this project is to research the incorporation of ancestral knowledge systems and computer science education as disciplines that co-create positive learning ecologies for marginalized communities, especially women of color, towards sustainable computing. This project aligns with the and can fill a void in the current broadening participation body of work.\r\n\r\nDespite aggressive broadening participation efforts from a wide range of initiatives, those focused on women of color continues to lag.  There is a need for women of color to see themselves as intellectual contributors to society within the curricula. Expanding on  culturally responsive curriculum and ethnomathematics, this project intends to research students' multiple identities as these relate to ancestral knowledge systems and sustainable computing. This is done to create computer science education curricula that ensures women of color lived world experiences are endogenous. In addition, Ancestral Computing for Sustainability has the vision to create new epistemologies and axiologies to reconfigure the bodies of knowledge that are mediated by computer science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
