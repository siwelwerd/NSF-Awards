 "awd_abstract_narration": "The emergence of quantum computers poses a serious threat for existing security standards, which motivates post-quantum cryptography (PQC) research. Various PQC schemes have been proposed for standardization, whose mathematical soundness are under investigation. Unfortunately, even a mathematically sound cryptography scheme may be attacked at the implementation level. The primary research goal of this project is to develop secure implementations for lattice-based cryptosystems, a major class of PQC encryption proposals. This work specifically addresses the fundamental power and electromagnetic side-channel vulnerabilities of physical implementations which may leak information. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project is a novel framework that employs instruction set extensions to compose side-channel protected software, which can provide comprehensive side-channel security.  By contrast, research on side-channel analysis of lattice cryptosystems have so far been limited to point solutions that evaluate a single instance. The research tasks are to extract a set of common operations for lattice-based cryptosystems, to build side-channel resistant versions of these arithmetic computations, to use a side-channel aware compiler for re-composing the software with the protected instructions, and to evaluate/benchmark side-channel security and countermeasure overheads.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the project include disseminating publications, distributing open-source hardware and software, and bridging the research on computer architectures and hardware security. This bridge is critical as secure computer architectures currently exclude physical side-channels in their threat model. This work may also help the ongoing quantum-secure encryption standardization effort led by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), by evaluating the submitted lattice cryptography-based proposals. \r\n\r\nThis project will use a repository with multiple back up servers to store and log the data, and the major results and hardware and software products will be made publicly available by using resources over the world wide web. Further information on the project repository will be made accessible at https://research.ece.ncsu.edu/aaysu/research.html. The repository is intended to be actively maintained for the duration of the project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\n \n\"This project has enabled the primary investigator to initiate and grow a research agenda on the critical topics of post-quantum cryptography, side-channel security, and efficient hardware development.  The project tackled the important problem of developing efficient and secure solutions for cryptographic systems that can survive quantum computer attacks.  Although such systems had previously provided mathematical security against quantum computers, this research has shown that their implementations may leak information through power consumption or electromagnetic radiation.  These side-channel leakages in turn exposes the secret keys. \nThe major outcomes of this Research Initiation Initiative project involve conducting research on efficient and secure implementation for next-generation cryptosystems and publishing 8 peer-reviewed papers.  The published research findings demonstrated the implementation, optimization, and hardware design automation for the building blocks of lattice-based post-quantum cryptography such as the number theoretic transform.  Furthermore, the project revealed new side-channel vulnerabilities for several algorithms that are being evaluated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology for the U.S. post-quantum standards.  All findings of the project were prototyped and shown as hardware and/or software solutions.  The project will, therefore, help the chosen U.S. post-quantum standards become ready for real-world applications.\"  \nThe project has helped establish a new course on hardware security focusing on quantum-secure cryptography and side-channel security with hands-on experiments.  The developed course has been taught at North Carolina State University four times and related contents have provided a professional development opportunity for 65 graduate and 7 undergraduate students.  This is a key enabler for preparing the next-generation cybersecurity-aware workforce.  The project has reached a broader audience through disseminated research results by North Carolina State University press releases and popular science magazines.  Lastly, the project has identified emerging problems in the security and implementation of post-quantum cryptosystems, and the related experience and data obtained on this project were utilized for submitting subsequent research proposals for future explorations.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/26/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Aydin Aysu"
