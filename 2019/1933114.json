 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will contribute to national prosperity by establishing new methods for the development of complex engineered systems and products.  Design of real-life engineered systems and products involves uncertainties in applied forces, material properties, and manufacturing processes.  If not appropriately accounted for, these uncertainties can directly impact the anticipated performance of a product, resulting in a significant loss of revenue or even catastrophic failure.  This award supports fundamental research on design optimization for discovering the best possible design solution while explicitly considering the uncertain system behavior.  These methods will lead to improvements in computational engineering design tools that will support the design of commercial products that are more durable, robust and reliable.   The algorithms and tools developed in this project will be applicable to a broad multidisciplinary engineering design community.  The award will support a graduate student, and the educational outreach activities will help broaden participation of underrepresented groups in research and engineering education.\r\n\r\nThis research will establish a sound mathematical foundation, create robust numerical algorithms, and build practical computational tools for design optimization of high-dimensional complex systems in the presence of uncertainty.  This effort will involve: (1) new multivariate orthonormal basis splines (B-splines) and non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS), leading to a new spline dimensional decomposition (SDD) method; (2) new formulae and scalable algorithms of the SDD method for calculating the statistical moments, including estimation of design sensitivities of moments from score functions; and (3) new computationally expedient robust design optimization (RDO) algorithms comprising a single or at most a few stochastic simulations.  The research is novel, debuting the stochastic version of B-splines and NURBS for the very first time.  New formulae and scalable algorithms generated for estimating the statistical moments will account for discontinuous or nonsmooth stochastic responses.  The integration with score functions will concurrently determine both the stochastic response characteristics and design sensitivities from the same computational effort, thereby solving RDO problems from a few stochastic simulations.  As a consequence, the speed of design process will be substantially enhanced, producing rare or potentially unprecedented solutions to large-scale stochastic design optimization problems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
