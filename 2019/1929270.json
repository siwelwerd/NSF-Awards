 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for a summer school that will provide an intensive and hands-on education experience to graduate students on the topic of cognitive robotics. The summer school will bring together students and experts in both robotics and artificial intelligence, providing the attendees with a strong introduction to both fields and knowledge of how they can be combined through Cognitive Robotics. Students attending the summer school will gain insight into planning, reasoning with risk and uncertainty, robust execution, perception, manipulation, and robot learning. The interdisciplinary nature of the summer school will expose graduate students to research and methodologies combining robotics and cognitive systems, educating and creating the next generation of researchers in this field. It is anticipated that the summer school will have a broad impact on the research community through facilitating new research collaborations in the field by bringing diverse researchers together to share ideas and knowledge. The travel and participation scholarships funded through this award will serve to ensure a broad participation that maximizes community impact. The content will be streamed live as well as archived online making it possible for a much larger number of students from academia and industry to benefit from the summer school.\r\n\r\nThe summer school will be held July 17-21, 2019 at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, California. The summer school will be a combination of invited talks and tutorials that are designed to introduce researchers and students to issues in planning and executing robot behavior from experts in both robotics and artificial intelligence. Daily hands-on labs will provide students with experience with robotic hardware and software tools for developing robot behaviors. The summer school concludes with a grand challenge combining and testing what the students have learned during the week through a hands-on task with robot hardware.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
