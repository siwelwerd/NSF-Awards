 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marine robots can be used to accurately map and track marine life, leading to a better interpretation of variability and migration patterns that are important to fisheries managers in marine protected areas (MPAs).  Principles of engineering and oceanography can be used to maximize the impact of a network of marine robots, but because fisheries managers, oceanographers, and roboticists have different perspectives and knowledge bases, it can be difficult to take advantage of cutting-edge research in each field without significant effort to translate among the groups. Researchers will develop a computational interface that translates human-specified missions of fisheries managers into multi-level planning for a fleet of marine robots to monitor fish populations in a dynamic coastal ocean environment. The system will be designed with input from fisheries managers through a series of workshops, and will be field-tested at Gray's Reef National Marine Sanctuary, a federally-managed MPA off the coast of Georgia.  The research will lead to more accurate and effective ways to monitor fish populations in MPAs, as well as breakthroughs in key areas of artificial intelligence and autonomous systems. Many of the results will be applicable to other smart and autonomous systems in challenging environments.  In addition, the project will train graduate students and broaden undergraduate education in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), and offer a number of outreach activities, including working with the University of Georgia Marine Extension service to develop a summer camp for middle and high school students.\r\n\r\nThe project is focused on developing an intelligent physical system (IPS) that consists of a heterogeneous fleet of marine robots, cooperatively tracking fish movement and surveying the habitat with minimum request for human intervention. The IPS will translate the human-specified missions of fisheries managers into goal-driven task designs for each robot, and automatically generate executable plans for the networked mobile sensing agents. The system will autonomously and persistently collect in-situ measurements and acoustic detections of fish species while maintaining multi-scale data streams and constructing multiple spatial-temporal maps reflecting the conditions of the ecosystem. The research aims to discover the hotspots (e.g., spatial locations with sustained congregations of fish), as well as illuminate more information about how and when fish move among these hotspots. This goal is quite challenging due to a number of gaps between project needs and the state-of-art autonomy research. Researchers will address the challenges through new developments that accomplish three main tasks: (1) Developing the goal-driven marine autonomy for fish habitat survey, (2) realizing the goal-driven autonomy on physical systems, and (3) evaluating the developed framework through real-life field work, experiments, and data analysis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

For this project, the team developed a computational interface that translates human-specified missions of fisheries managers into multi-level planning for a fleet of marine robots to monitor fish populations in a dynamic coastal ocean environment. Designed for fisheries managers at Gray\u2019s Reef National Marine Sanctuary, a federally-managed MPA off the coast of Georgia, the system includes components that reason human goals and task a group of different kinds of robots to work together in an optimal way given the conditions and how they may change in time.  Real time data from the robots are used not only to detect fish in the area, but also can be used to estimate how far close or far the robots must be to detect the signals; this information allows the larger-level planning to retask robots based on real-time conditions, moving them closer together or farther apart when environmental conditions change detection range.  The research has already led to more accurate and effective ways to monitor fish populations in MPAs, and is likely to lead to a better statistical understanding of the likelihood that fish were present but not detected based on the environmental conditions.  The SkIO/UGA component of the project trained 6 undergraduates, who participated in piloting, software development, and other activities, and 3 graduate students, leading to 1 PhD thesis in 2022 and 2 others pending for 2024.   \n\n \n\nThroughout the project, efforts on the science, engineering, and analysis side were translated and shared with communities of interest to maximize their impact.  The work was presented at local, regional, national, and international meetings, within the fisheries management and science community at the local, regional, and national level, with young audiences to stimulate interest in science and engineering among under-represented groups, and with the general public through a very active outreach program.  A novel week-long \"Girls Code Games\" camp developed through the project encouraged 35+ girls in grades 5-9 to follow their interests in coding by designing, developing, and programming their own games based on ocean robots, fisheries robotics, and the science they enable.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/25/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Catherine R Edwards"
