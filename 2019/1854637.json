 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many modern empirical and experimental researches routinely produce massive amounts of high-dimensional and complex data. Graphical model is one of the most important tools to visualize and exploit hidden, latent, low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional complex data. Motivated by neuroscience and genomics applications, the research project aims to develop cutting-edge graphical model based computational and statistical methods to uncover latent network structures in large-scale complex data. To enhance the reproducibility of scientific studies, the project provides rigorous tools on uncertainty quantification. The software packages will be developed to implement the proposed methods. \r\n\r\nThe research project focuses on theoretical and methodological development for graphical models in high-dimensional complex data arising from neuroscience and genomics applications. Specific projects include proposing clustering based latent variable models for dimensional reduction with a large number of variables, optimal distributed learning and inference for massive heterogenous data under communication constraint, and exponential family random effect graphical models for high-dimensional longitudinal data under complex dependence. The proposed models are equipped with a powerful multiple testing procedure to control false discovery rate in a rigorous manner. The computational algorithms will be developed in each application.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The first aim is to integrate the clustering method into graphical models in order to reduce the dimension of the variables. The second aim is to address the data heterogeneity in the statistical analysis for large data. The last aim focuses on how to deal with graphical models with repeated observations over time and also unobserved confounding variables. The PI accomplished all these aims, leading to a sequence of papers published in top statistics journals and machine learning conferences. The software for implementing the proposed statistical methods is also developed. In particular, the software can be used by neuroscientists to analyze complex brain image data. The project provides valuable opportunities for training graduate and undergraduate students. In particular, two Ph.D students are involved in the project and supported by the research assistantship provided by this project. The PI also included a brief introduction to graphical models in his undergraduate course STSCI 4740 Machine Learning and Data Mining.
