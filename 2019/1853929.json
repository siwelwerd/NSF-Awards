 "awd_abstract_narration": "This effort involves an aircraft study of the chemistry and dynamics of the Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM).  This atmospheric circulation takes place in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere and spans the Pacific Ocean east of Asia westward to the Middle East.  The vertical transport of pollutants within the ASM can have a global impact on atmospheric chemistry and radiation.  This project includes the training of graduate students and post-doctoral scientists.\r\n\r\nThe four main objectives of the project are: (1) Investigate the transport pathway of the ASM uplifted air from inside of the anticyclone to the global upper troposphere-lower stratosphere (UTLS); (2) Sample the chemical content of air processed in the ASM to ascertain its role in UTLS ozone chemistry, and in re-distributing active species and short-lived climate forcers to examine the respective roles of Asian pollution and the monsoon strength in chemistry and climate, and to understand two-way coupling between chemistry and climate.  Chemical tracers of different lifetimes can also help characterize the ASM uplifting time scales, which are difficult for the models to estimate; (3) Obtain information on aerosol size, mass and chemical composition necessary for determining the radiative impact of the ASM, for constraining models of aerosol formation and for contrasting the organic-rich ASM UTLS aerosol population with that of sulfate-rich volcanic plumes and the background aerosol population; and (4) Measure the water vapor distribution associated with the monsoon dynamical structure to evaluate transport across the tropopause, and determine the role of the ASM in water vapor transport into the stratosphere.\r\n\r\nThis project is scheduled to take place during July-August 2020 and will establish and expand collaborations between several academic institutions, government partners, and international institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The system brings precipitation to South, East and Southeast Asia and impacts the region's economy. In recent decades, satellites with instruments observing the Earth from space have revealed an additional role of the Asian monsoon: it is changing the atmospheric composition near the tropopause altitude (approximately 16-18 km altitudes). The satellite observations indicate that when frequent thunderstorms bring rains to the Asian continent, they also uplift the surface pollutants to the tops of the storms, which forms a layer of anomalous chemical composition during monsoon seasons. This vertical redistribution of chemical species from the Earth&rsquo;s boundary layer is identified as an important topic of research, because the Earth&rsquo;s climate is very sensitive to the chemical composition of the tropopause layer. The Asian summer monsoon Chemical and Climate Impact Project (ACCLIP) was designed to investigate the specifics of the Asian monsoon vertical transport, such as the types and quantities of chemical species that are lifted, and to understand the monsoon&rsquo;s impacts on atmospheric chemistry and its effects on climate.</p>\r\n<p>ACCLIP was centered on a field campaign with the deployment of two research aircraft, the NSF/NCAR Gulfstream V and the NASA WB-57, each equipped with a large suite of advanced instruments (see image 1).&nbsp; The campaign was conducted in summer 2022 from Osan Air Base in South Korea. A total of 29 research flights were conducted which measured more than 100 chemical species and aerosols over the northwestern Pacific region, including Korea and Japan, from the surface to 19 km altitude. Images 2&amp;3 show the flight tracks and the research aircraft at Osan. These measurements have provided a wide range of new information, including record-breaking abundances of carbon monoxide and a suite of very-short-lived chlorinated species, all of which are pollutants from human activities and are chemically active at the tropopause level.</p>\r\n<p>A large team of scientists were involved in the ACCLIP experiment. Image 4 shows a fraction of the team at Osan during the experiment. The team consisted of scientists from multiple countries, bringing top expertise in both measurements and modeling. The experiment was also supported and participated by scientists from Korea and other Asian countries. Analysis and modeling to interpret the data are ongoing.
