 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hurricane Irma was a massively destructive storm that traveled directly over the lower Florida Keys. While the above water damage was obvious, effects from the hurricane on shallow benthic marine habitats in the Florida Keys is unknown. Shallow water habitats, which are important nurseries for economically important fisheries, likely experienced the strong effects from the storm. Sponge communities in these ecosystems perform vital ecological functions due to their feeding behavior, which involves pumping large quantities of water and filtering material from the water column. The project tests important hypotheses about sponge responses to ecological disruptions that are caused by hurricanes. Sponges are abundant in many reef ecosystems, and play essential ecological roles, so learning about system responses to sponge community disturbances is important. The work trains undergraduates in field research, data management and analysis, and science communication. Some of the activities developed as part of this project are incorporated in the University of Richmond Integrated Science Experience (URISE), and the first-year Science, Math and Research Training (SMART) course, both of which are designed to increase participation in STEM disciplines by individuals from underrepresented groups. Furthermore, the research is presented in a variety of public forums to disseminate as widely as possible. \r\n\r\nSponges represent a significant benthic-pelagic coupling point in tropical reef habitats. The recently proposed sponge loop hypothesis predicts that these animals release detritus as a function of their biofiltering capabilities, which is then consumed by organisms at the base of the food web. Hurricane Irma may have disrupted components of the sponge loop, and the investigators are exploring four hypotheses related to the storm's effects. First, the proposed work tests whether sponge damage from the storm was non-random, disproportionately affecting larger sponges. The second hypothesis examines the effects of the storm on macroinvertebrate communities in these habitats. This work builds on sponge and macroinvertebrate surveys conducted by the investigators in the years preceding the storm. Thirdly, the hypothesis that the hurricane influenced bacterioplankton populations through disruption of sponge feeding is tested. The PIs also compare pre- and post-hurricane plankton structure via flow cytometery using inhalant-exhalent water samples collected as part of an on-going study of sponge feeding behavior. Finally, inhalant-exhalent water samples are collected from shallow-water populations of several sponges from different size categories to determine if feeding behavior shows any demographic shifts based on the size of the sponge. Samples are processed to examine the retention efficiencies and prey selectivity of the host sponges using flow cytometry. Initial surveys are conducted of sponges (size, density, diversity) and macroinvertebrates in December, 2017. Preliminary sponge pumping activity occurs then too. Extensive surveys take place again in May-July, 2018 with further monitoring to occur in subsequent years.",

The effects of the storm in shallow water habitats were studied with a focus on sponge and microcrustracean populations, which are important portions of the tropical food web that supports important fisheries and the broader reef ecosystem. We found that the sponge <em>Ircinia campana</em>&nbsp;suffered significant size-dependent mortality related to the effects of the hurricane. We mapped close to 200 sponges in a 100m x 100m area so that we could follow growth of the sponges over several years. Our goal was to assess growth rate characteristics and to estimate the rate of recovery of this population post-hurricane. We found that the sponges add about 1 cm to the diameter of their vase each year, which suggests that the population will require nearly a decade to recover from the damage caused by the hurricane.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The microcrustracean community was represented by more than 40 morphospecies. We focused on microcrustacean communities in these habitats since they may feed on sponge detritus and serve as the base of tropical fish food webs. Pre- and post-hurricane community characteristics differed in that density and diversity were both lower immediately after the hurricane. Some aspects of the community rebounded to pre-hurricane conditions by the next summer though this pattern was not generalizable. The fact that the hurricane hit at the beginning of the fall and we couldn't sample until December 2017 meant that our sampling opportunities were confounded by season (i.e., summer vs. winter). To overcome this limitation, we focused attention on&nbsp;the size of the microcrustaceans in these habitats. Some crustracean species decreased in size immediately after the hurricane but rebounded by the next summer. The size of other species of crustacean were unaffected by the hurricane or were found to have slightly larger populations after the disturbance. Explanations for these findings are forthcoming as data analysis continues. Nonetheless, our study demonstrates how little we know about these habitats, the organisms that reside in them, and how they respond to disturbance. It is clear that the role the sponge-loop plays in the size of mesograzers like the crustaceans we examined deserves greater attention. Our findings offer an important perspective on the dynamics of the base of fish food webs - especially as they respond to hurricane-based disturbances.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/28/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Malcolm&nbsp;S&nbsp;Hill</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1854644/1854644_10525336_1593380969028_IrciniaMaxHeight--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1854644/1854644_10525336_1593380969028_IrciniaMaxHeight--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Ircinia campana population changes after Hurricane Irma\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1854644/1854644_10525336_1593380969028_IrciniaMaxHeight--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Ircinia campana population changes after Hurricane Irma\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Tagged Ircinia campana sponges were measured in 2018 and again in 2019 to assess growth rate characteristics.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Malcolm Hill</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Malcolm&nbsp;S&nbsp;Hill</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Ircinia campana population changes after Hurricane Irma</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1854644/1854644_10525336_1593380827122_MS3a--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1854644/1854644_10525336_1593380827122_MS3a--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Crustacean morphospecies\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1854644/1854644_10525336_1593380827122_MS3a--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Crustacean morphospecies\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Example of one of the micrograzer crustacean species examined in this study.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Malcolm Hill</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Malcolm&nbsp;S&nbsp;Hill</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Crustacean morphospecies</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1854644/1854644_10525336_1593379594567_IMG_24482--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1854644/1854644_10525336_1593379594567_IMG_24482--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Ircinia campana damaged by Hurricane Irma\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1854644/1854644_10525336_1593379594567_IMG_24482--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Ircinia campana damaged by Hurricane Irma\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Immediately after Hurricane Irma, many dislodged large-bodied Ircinia campana sponges were found in the flats in front of Summerland Key, FL.
