This project at Morgan State University provides a strategic approach to infuse learning initiatives into two computer science courses to increase students' proficiency and success  in programming skills with the goal to retain them as computer science majors. Undergraduate students are involved in this project as researchers. \r\n\r\nThis one-year pilot project seeks to implement problem solving strategies involving programming to develop strategies that can enhance the students' ability to develop proficient critical thinking skills as they learn to program. The project will study the psycho-social\r\nattributes that students exhibit towards programming using qualitative and quantitative measures. The project is guided by formative and summative evaluation and an advisory committee.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
