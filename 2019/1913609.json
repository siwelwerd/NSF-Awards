 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from the development of a quick, easy, and accurate way to count cattle and detect bovine illnesses on feedlots and ranches via Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).  Current methods for counting cattle are extremely time-consuming or inaccurate, and sometimes both.  Additionally, bovine illnesses are often diagnosed too late, leading to 50% of cattle mortalities on feedlots and yielding a $1.9 billion economic loss to the cattle industry.  The proposed technology will leverage aerial images to (a) count cattle accurately and efficiently and (b) identify ill cows up to one week before clinical symptoms appear without the need to install expensive health-monitoring equipment on each cow.  Ultimately, the proposed technology promises to more broadly impact the way wildlife and endangered species are tracked by automating wildlife counting on aerial images.  \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop an imaging-based solution for feedlot accountants, nutritionists, and auditors to monitor cattle.  The project will leverage aerial photos of feedlot pens to automatically count all cattle breeds - regardless of season and ground conditions - using a combination of deep learning and traditional image processing tools.  Additionally, this project will leverage aerial thermography to measure bovine temperatures; machine learning tools will be developed to differentiate between elevated body temperatures associated with illness and those associated with normal confounding factors.  The goals of this Phase I project are to develop and fully validate the technology for cattle counting on feedlots and to establish the technical feasibility of leveraging aerial thermographic imaging for prediction of cattle health.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCattle ranchers need to monitor their herds to prevent cattle rustling and detect cattle illnesses before they spread, while cattle lenders need to audit cattle inventories for collateral verification purposes.  Surprisingly, cattle inventory estimation is more of an art than a science, and centuries-old cattle counting methods are still the status quo.  Both cattlemen and their financiers need a way to monitor cattle quickly, efficiently, and accurately.\n\nIn this Phase I SBIR project we developed COWculator, a deep learning algorithm that automatically counts cattle on aerial drone-based feedlot images.  When COWculator was validated on 91 images from 10 feedlots, 98% accuracy was achieved overall.  This accuracy increased to 99% during normal weather conditions but decreased slightly to 97% or 96%, respectively, when flood conditions or snow was present.  COWculator is already in use as the driving force behind our CattleQuantsTM feedlot inspection service, which is currently being marketed to banks and accounting firms that need to count cattle on feedlots. \n\nAdditionally, preliminary research was performed into the development of novel image processing and machine learning solutions for diagnosing bovine respiratory disease (BRD) using aerial radiometric thermal imaging, counting cattle on ranches, and estimating cattle liveweight based on drone images.  In partnership with Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Research Center, we evaluated the efficacy of radiometric imaging for diagnosing BRD in 15 steers with BRD and 15 healthy controls and found that accuracies of 90% or higher could be attained by a logistic regression classifier that differentiated between the aerial radiometric imaging signatures of healthy and ill cattle.  Exploratory research into estimating cattle liveweight via drone were highly encouraging and suggested that predicted liveweight can be leveraged to accurately differentiate between calves and cows on cow-calf livestock operations.   Nevertheless, more research is necessary to develop an automated solution for cattle counting on pastures and ranches; algorithms for cattle weight estimation and breed classification; and a robust model for diagnosing bovine respiratory disease regardless of cattle breed, ambient temperature, and season.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/03/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Shoshana Ginsburg"
