 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students in STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project at North Carolina Central University (NCCU) will develop an integrated undergraduate education, training, and research initiative in behavioral genetics and engineering design by creating Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) in two courses: a sophomore elective and a junior required course. The infusion of cross-disciplinary CUREs into two biology courses, development of a cross-disciplinary summer research experience and the strengthening of the existing relationships with surrounding Research institutions will have a direct impact on students and faculty at NCCU. The project will facilitate student retention and motivate underrepresented minority students (URM) to pursue graduate studies and/or careers in STEM disciplines.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of the project is to educate, train, and provide cross-disciplinary research experiences to URM students at NCCU; thus, facilitating a successful undergraduate matriculation within STEM majors and into graduate programs at nearby Research-1 institutions (Duke, UNC-Chapel Hill and NC State University). The specific goals are:  1) to infuse real-world research experiences including engineering design challenges and measuring Drosophila Behaviours and relating these behaviors to Genetics (DaBuGs) through two CURE courses and 2) to have sophomore/junior-level research fellows participate in a cross-disciplinary, summer research experience tied to a research mentoring course with the primary goal of completing authentic research and design projects begun in the two CURE courses. The long-term goal is to create an integrated engineering and DaBuGs education, training, and research initiative at NCCU. This is expected to increase student performance and enthusiasm in STEM, and expose URM students to engineering design and behavioral research through the sophomore- and junior-level biology CUREs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The long-term goal of the project is to begin to establish a cross-disciplinary training program in the emerging biological science field of behavioral genetics and the burgeoning 3+2 training program in engineering design at the oldest, public Historically Black College or University (HBCU) in the country.\n\nHow do we begin to create a bridge for undergraduate students attending HBCUs to institutions research-intensive institutions throughout the country?  We assembled the scaffold by infusing two biology-based courses with introductory engineering design theory and practice.  Additionally, we designed an innovative 6-week multi-disciplinary summer internship as described in the initial grant application objectives:\n\nObjective 1: To provide students with real-world engineering design challenges and behavioral genetics research experiences through a multi-faceted infusion of Drosophila Behavioural Genetics (DaBuGs) CUREs into two courses:\n\nA      newly created sophomore-level Biology elective, honors CURE course (year      1)\nCURE      infusion of the teaching lab of a required, junior-level Genetics course      (year 2).\n\n\nObjective 2: To enhance student`s intrinsic motivation to pursue behavioral genetics and engineering through a DaBuGs Summer Internship Program (SIP), wherein DaBuGs Research Fellows, trained in the above courses, apply for 1-4 positions in a summer research programs to be co-mentored by the Biology PI, the Fab Lab co-PI and the Physics co-PI in a cross-disciplinary, summer, independent research course experience with the primary goal of completing authentic research and engineering design projects initiated in the Objective 1 CURE courses.
