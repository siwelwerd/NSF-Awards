 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program is funding Professor James Larrabee at Middlebury College to carry out fundamental studies of three metallohydrolases using magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy. These metallohydrolases are able to detoxify chemical warfare agents and thus are of current importance for society.  MCD spectroscopy allows the researchers to monitor changes that occur in the active sites of the enzymes when they are attached to nanoparticles and/or genetically modified and it provides clues about the chemical origins of the changes in their activity. This research could provide a scientific basis for creating improved bio-remediation agents.  The funded research is conducted at Middlebury College by undergraduate students. Research experiences strengthen the interest of undergraduate students in furthering their science education and the pursuit in careers in science. \r\n\r\nThe aim of the research project is to attach three metallohydrolases to silica, alumina or magnetite nanoparticles.  Earlier studies conducted in the Larrabee lab were on the free enzymes, not on the enzymes attached to nanoparticles. The enzyme attachment to nanoparticles could improve both the activity and stability of the enzymes. The Larrabee research group also studies mutant forms of the enzymes that have enhanced activity. The active sites of the three enzymes are chemically and spectroscopically similar. The research group of Professor Larrabee studies the enzymes in the form in which they contain Co(II) ions.  MCD spectroscopy is used to study the changes of the metal environment caused by the binding of the enzymes to the nanoparticles or by mutations. The outcome of the research could be used to make these enzymes more useful as bio-remediation agents.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
