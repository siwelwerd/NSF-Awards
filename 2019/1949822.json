 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to conduct a National Science Foundation (NSF) proposal-writing workshop concurrent with the 46th Society of Manufacturing Engineers North American Manufacturing Research Conference (NAMRC) and the ASME Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC 2018). The workshop will be held at Texas A&M University on Monday, June 18, 2018, building on the success of previous similar workshops held at the three previous NAMRC/MSEC conferences. The aim of the workshop is to aid future NSF proposal submitters in communicating clear research objectives and improving proposal quality. Participants will learn guidelines for writing a quality NSF proposal with an emphasis on the research objective. Interactions during the workshop will help build meaningful collaborations. This will positively affect the attendees' academic career and, subsequently, will help develop the nation's human resources. Additionally, when proposals are well written, the reviews tend to be more consistent and NSF panel meetings are more efficient. \r\n\r\nMajor activities of the workshop include: presentations by NSF program directors, breakout sessions to discuss example research objectives, a group question/answer period, and a conclusions session. Professors and graduate students from across the US will be invited to attend the workshop.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
