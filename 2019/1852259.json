 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras, located in San Juan, PR, will support the training of 10 students for 9 weeks during the summers of 2019- 2021. IQ-BIO-REU offers opportunities to be immersed in research and receive training in statistics, data analysis and its application to investigate biological phenomena from molecules to ecosystems. Participants will take on projects that allow for the simultaneous exploration of multiple STEM domains, such as the integration of quantitative analyses towards understanding changes in the physical and biochemical traits of organisms and the use of big data and machine learning approaches to document the effects of environmental changes on biological systems. Skill development workshops on the use of statistical and computational tools to address biological problems will scaffold the hands-on work. Career development workshops will offer guidance in the process of applying to graduate school, obtaining funds for research, and exposure to career opportunities. The criteria for evaluation will be academic performance and a demonstrated interest in pursuing a career in science at the intersection of biology and computational sciences.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students in any STEM field, particularly individuals from groups historically underrepresented in science, are encouraged to apply. Students will participate in a scholarly environment throughout the summer including the presentation of their work and achievements at a student hackathon. After participating in the program, students will be encouraged to present their work at national and international conferences.\r\n\r\nA common web-based assessment tool used by all REU Site programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program is available by visiting http://iqbioreu.uprrp.edu, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Juan S. Ramirez-Lugo at juan.ramirez3@upr.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Patricia Ordonez at patricia.ordonez@upr.edu).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The activities were held in person at&nbsp;University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras (UPR-RP)&nbsp;in 2019 and virtually in 2020 and 2021.</p>\n<p>Participants were immersed in a mentored research projects&nbsp;centered around genomics, bioinformatics, novel representations of biological data, land use dynamics in tropical ecosystems using satellite images, honeybee behavior using video, among others. In addition to participating in research, all three cohorts received training and practice for fluency in computational skills, data analysis and the use of statistical and computational tools to address biological problems. Postdoctoral scholars and graduate students from the Harvard BD2K center and the Center for Brain, Minds and Machines at MIT hosted workshops all three years, to provide participants with a wider perspective on the use of computational approaches in the life sciences. Furthermore,&nbsp;students participated in professional development workshops, including guidance in the process of applying for a graduate school, and the use of social media for professional networking. Following their summers in IQ-Bio-REU,&nbsp;<strong>1</strong><strong>1</strong>&nbsp;of our participants went on to share their research work at local and national conferences&nbsp;(5 at ABRCMS [1 award winner], 2 SACNAS, 1 Genetics Society of America,&nbsp;1 ASBMB,&nbsp;2 Local Conferences), one was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship and another one was a semi-finalist and one student was a second author in a peer-reviewed publication based on work that she started in our 2019 Hackathon&nbsp;(Table 2). Many of our participants have continued to be engaged in research, specifically computational research and have also gone onto prestigious graduate programs. Considering the diverse profile of our students and their achievements, we are confident that our program has succeeded in its aim of channeling students from diverse backgrounds into productive research careers at the forefront of the biological sciences.</p>\n<p>Assessment of program objectives, along with student reflections, were indispensable to improve IQ-Bio-REU in every iteration. Based on student input, most of the time and attention to training activities of the program were moved to earlier dates, thereby allowing participants to have ample time to devote to research in the latter weeks of the summer when research projects are more active and&nbsp; mature.&nbsp; Likewise, we have been keen to analyze&nbsp;URSSA survey results to ensure that program objectives have been met.&nbsp;Based on these results we observe that participants perceive having significant gains in computational research skills after the program. Notably when asked to gauge their skills in \"working with computers\" and \"analyzing data for patterns\" on a 5-point scale, where 1=no gain and 5=great gain, the median score of all participants in all years has been consistently high. Likewise, students perceive good gains in confidence in their ability to do research, a high level of a sense of belonging and integration to the scientific community and an understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of science (Table 3). Taken together, these results suggest that students embraced the interdisciplinary nature of the program and perceived that the program is useful for the development of computational research skills in an interdisciplinary setting.</p>\n<p>To further build research capacity in interdisciplinary and quantitative biology&nbsp;beyond our institution, we&nbsp;requested a Research Experience for Teachers (RET) supplement to this project. Through the RET supplement we engaged two science teachers in research and skill development activities associated to the REU program. One participant teaches 6<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;and 7<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;grade science at a rural public middle school and one teaches biology at an urban public high school. To effectively engage in research, RET participants received training, along with the 2020 REU cohort, in research computing, R programming and its application as a tool to understand biological diversity. Both teachers worked together in a research project in the lab of Dr. Riccardo Papa, which is focused on using computational tools to study the genetic regulation of butterfly wing color patterns.&nbsp;Using observations collected during their research experiences, the two teachers jointly created an educational module for students at the seventh to tenth grade levels. The module consisted of three lessons: (1) \"How are species classified\", (2) \"Technology and the study of species\", and (3) \"Physical structures in species\". Each lesson was planned for two class sessions and are all aligned with the standards and expectations of the Puerto Rico Department of Education corresponding to each grade level. All the generated curricular materials are in Spanish and are being prepared for publications and dissemination. We look forward to having more teachers participate in IQ-Bio-REU related activities through new collaborations and efforts at our institution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/05/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Juan&nbsp;Ramirez-Lugo</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1852259/1852259_10594056_1649201502135_ScreenShot2022-04-05at7.30.37PM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1852259/1852259_10594056_1649201502135_ScreenShot2022-04-05at7.30.37PM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Data Tables for Project Outcomes\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1852259/1852259_10594056_1649201502135_ScreenShot2022-04-05at7.30.37PM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Data Tables for Project Outcomes\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Data of project outcomes for IQ BIO REU 2019\ufffd2021</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Juan S Ramirez Lugo</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Juan&nbsp;Ramirez-Lugo</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Data Tables for Project Outcomes</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1852259/1852259_10594056_1649201207453_ScreenShot2021-06-26at3.18.00PM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1852259/1852259_10594056_1649201207453_ScreenShot2021-06-26at3.18.00PM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2021 IQ Hackathon\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1852259/1852259_10594056_1649201207453_ScreenShot2021-06-26at3.18.00PM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2021 IQ Hackathon\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Screen Capture of 2021 Virtual IQ Hackathon</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Juan S Ramirez Lugo</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Juan&nbsp;Ramirez-Lugo</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2021 IQ Hackathon</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1852259/1852259_10594056_1649201342603_ScreenShot2022-04-05at7.27.38PM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1852259/1852259_10594056_1649201342603_ScreenShot2022-04-05at7.27.38PM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2019 IQ Hackathon\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1852259/1852259_10594056_1649201342603_ScreenShot2022-04-05at7.27.38PM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2019 IQ Hackathon\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2019 student cohort at IQ Hackathon</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Juan S Ramirez Lugo</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Juan&nbsp;Ramirez-Lugo</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2019 IQ Hackathon</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1852259/1852259_10594056_1649201099513_ScreenShot2020-08-03at4.08.56PM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1852259/1852259_10594056_1649201099513_ScreenShot2020-08-03at4.08.56PM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2020 Hackathon\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1852259/1852259_10594056_1649201099513_ScreenShot2020-08-03at4.08.56PM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2020 Hackathon\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Screen Capture of participants in 2020 Virtual IQ Hackathon</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Juan S Ramirez Lugo</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Juan&nbsp;Ramirez-Lugo</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2020 Hackathon</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
