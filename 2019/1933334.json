Student participation will be encouraged and they will have the opportunity to interact with leading researchers in the field. The workshop is anticipated to catalyze important collaborations. Participants will discuss ways to share unique research infrastructure at their instiuttions to streamline efforts and consolidate resources. Finally, the proposal will foster collaborations with the EU Graphene Flagship and US Scientists, for planning innovative international activities that can facilitate joint collaborative projects in the near future.\r\n\r\nTechnical\r\n\r\nThe  purpose of this workshop is to bring together leading scientists working on graphene, 2D materials and devices, from Europe and the United States to help promote future collaborations and address common  challenges in this dynamic field. In doing so, it is envisioned that such interactions will help promoting  new synergistic activities and hence research progress. The Workshop will also promote the participation  of students who will have the opportunity to interact with experts in the field and learn about the latest  advances in 2D materials and devices. This workshop will foster advances in the leading research on 2D atomic layers and devices by gathering a diverse group of experts and researchers. The presentations and scientific exchanges will focus on a wide range of 2D layered materials such as phosphorene, transition metal di-chalcogenides, hexagonal boron nitride, tertiary compounds of carbon nitrides, and complex oxides. It will prompt collaborations with the EU Graphene Flagship program administrators and NSF that will lead to international activities that can facilitate joint collaborative programs in the future.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
