 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine warming of the continental shelf of the northeast US and determine the relationship to warm core rings from the Gulf Stream. Historical observations from several sources including the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) Pioneer Array will be analyzed to determine the connection between shelf warming and warm core rings. A field campaign will include observations from autonomous underwater vehicles equipped with sensors to observe the dynamic processes that govern the warm and saline intrusions of water. The results will yield insights into how and why warming events occur on the continental shelf. The trend in warming on the New England shelf has implications for regional climate and local commercial fisheries. The project includes collaboration with the Commercial Fisheries Association and communication of research results to local fishing communities. \r\n\r\nThis project will use field observations and analyses of historical data to examine process known to drive exchange between the shelf and warm core rings on the Northeast U.S. continental shelf and the relationship to recent warming on the shelf and slope region. The study will focus on the pycnocline salinity maximum and Gulf Stream warm core rings. The field work, which will take place during two cruises (in 2020 and 2021) will employ autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) equipped with sensors to profile velocity, temperature, salinity, microstructure, turbidity, chlorophyll, fluorescence, and colored dissolved organic matter. The observations will be used to produce three-dimensional maps of one or more saline intrusions and to distinguish between the relative importance of double diffusive and turbulent dynamics in the pycnocline salinity maximum.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The Commercial Fisheries Research Foundation (CFRF) and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) developed the Shelf Research Fleet, composed of commercial fishermen, that collects oceanographic data offshore and along the continental shelf that includes water temperature, conductivity (salinity measure) and depth.&nbsp; This research fleet started finding warm, salty water masses being transported further inshore and unusual fish catches during these salinity maximum intrusions. This multi-year project studied this oceanographic phenomenon and its impact on commercial fisheries. It was a collaboration between CFRF, WHOI, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth School for Marine Science and Technology. The goal was to measure and understand the processes causing these warm, salty water intrusions and the nature of organisms associated with them. The project combined analyses of historical and near real-time oceanographic data, results from joint oceanographic and biological research surveys, and observations and oceanographic data collection from commercial fishermen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;The CFRF role in this project was to bridge the scientific work and the commercial fishermen impacted by these events by delivering outreach events and informative media products.&nbsp; To achieve this goal, CFRF produced public brochures distributed digitally and as hard copies through the CFRF distribution list and social media. In Year 1, the brochure introduced study goals and methods and let fishermen know how to participate and help with the project.&nbsp; A second brochure was shared at the end of the project to summarize the results and conclusions from the multi-year study.&nbsp; CFRF hosted eight workshops that discussed the project plans and results and provided a forum for fishermen to ask questions and provide feedback on what they were observing at sea.&nbsp; In addition, two special topic workshops were also held based on findings that squid and larval fish were using these intrusions to move onshore and that some of these oceanographic changes may have been associated with large numbers of scallops dying in the Mid-Atlantic between 2022 and 2023.</p>\r\n<p>Research cruises were conducted in 2021 and 2022.&nbsp; CFRF participated in the 2022 cruise, providing outreach to fishermen onshore.&nbsp; On the oceanographic vessel, daily updates on preliminary findings were emailed to an onshore contact and then distributed to commercial fishermen so they could see near real-time results from the research cruise. Oceanographers use highly specialized equipment to collect at-sea data.&nbsp; During the cruise, scientists were interviewed and videoed describing the equipment they use and the type of information they collect for the project. These videos are significant products that can be used in future public meetings describing oceanographic research. The different oceanographic equipment described in these videos are:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Conductivity,      temperature, depth (CTD) sampling array (rosette)</li>\r\n<li>Autonomous      underwater vehicles (AUV)</li>\r\n<li>Acoustic      modems (communicates with AUV)</li>\r\n<li>Vertical      microstructure profiler (VPM)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The project team presented the results at conferences, public meetings, and in scientific publications. One of the important conclusions from this project for fishermen was that salinity maximum intrusion may be significant in determining how larval fish and squid move onshore to contribute to commercial fisheries. This project demonstrates the strength of scientists and fishermen working together to answer important questions about changing ocean conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/29/2024<br>\nModified by: Naiff&nbsp;D&nbsp;Bethoney</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1851256/1851256_10626922_1732903896132_OutcomesReportPicture1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1851256/1851256_10626922_1732903896132_OutcomesReportPicture1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fishermen Observations\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1851256/1851256_10626922_1732903896132_OutcomesReportPicture1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fishermen Observations\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A Shelf Research Shelf Fleet fisherman securing a CTD for deployment.
