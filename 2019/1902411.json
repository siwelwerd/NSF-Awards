 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest in developing and maintaining a highly skilled technical workforce.  Success in math courses is a barrier for students pursuing degrees in engineering technology and environmental technology programs at Zane State College.  Thus, improving success in math gateway courses is essential to support student degree completion and employment in well-paid technician jobs that are in-demand in this region of Appalachian Ohio.  This project will research, design, and pilot best practices in math education, evaluate the results, and customize and cement successes into the foundation of gateway math courses.  Through continual assessment of progress, it will strive to implement a continuous improvement model.  The project team will share information about the structure and outcomes of the modified mathematics courses with high schools, colleges, and universities.  \r\n\r\nThe project will begin with an in-depth analysis of institutional success data and a literature review of best practices in math education.  This information will then be used to develop: (1) mathematics skills workshops for students held in term intercessions to prepare for the upcoming semester math course; (2) supplemental mathematics instruction including just-in-time co-requisite models designed with input from industry and business, as well as an embedded professional tutor in math courses; (3) professional development about active and contextualized learning for faculty teaching math courses or teaching math within technical courses; and (4) a math department assessment and review plan to help ensure future student success by building on the data collected and materials/curriculum designed during the project. In the curricular design process, the College will consider the needs of industry (through the technology program Advisory Committees), students (through the validated Math Belonging survey, satisfaction surveys, interviews, and course success data), and faculty (through professional development activities and feedback). It is anticipated that these math course improvements will improve student success in math gateway courses and result in an increase in completion rates of students in STEM technology programs. This project is funded by the NSF Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

However, institutional data has exposed a lack of success for stem students in college math courses. Therefore, exposing a challenge to completing an engineering technology degree. With the goal of closing educational gaps for these math courses, the PI Team explored several fixes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;First, the team created Math Pathway Interventions (MPIs) for the gateway math courses, which are completed by engineering technology students in their first year. Over the life of the grant, the MPIs were delivered on three occasions: &nbsp;July 2020, July 2021, and June 2022. The plan was to deliver more MPIs, however, enrollment became a challenge. A total of ten students participated in the MPIs over the life of the grant. Each year, a Pre-Test and Post-test were administered to the students during the MPIs that resulted in the students average score increasing overall by 35%. Three students went on to pass our algebra and trigonometry course, and two of those students continued on to pass our pre-calculus course. Our college algebra and statistics courses each had one student pass that attended the MPI. Four students that attended an MPI session completed at least 28 credits, including one student who went on to graduate. Six students have not registered for any math courses since attending the MPIs. We were not able to deliver the MPI in 2023 due to non-enrollment, which we have found to be the most challenging aspect of holding these MPIs. There were effective methods of building the MPIs figured out which will be beneficial to future projects. For example, it may be beneficial to hold MPIs during the semester to provide interventions while the students are currently attending the courses. This could be especially useful for courses that do not have a corresponding co-requisite course. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Secondly, the team designed and delivered effective supplemental instruction for our college algebra and algebra and trigonometry courses. The team utilized the Developing a Curriculum (DACUM) process to facilitate the achievement of this goal. Through this process the PI team was able to contextualize the course material, producing assignments and notes that are more relevant to job skills required by local employers. This DACUM process also provided collaboration among faculty and local employers. The team was able to develop new co-requisite courses (MATH 0340 and MATH 0250) for our college algebra and algebra and trigonometry courses that provided just-in-time content. At this time, Math 0250 has not been administered due to low enrollment, but Math 0340 is set to begin in Fall 2023. The process will be advantageous for development or redevelopment of future courses.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thirdly, embedded tutors were placed into our college algebra and algebra and trigonometry courses during the Fall and Spring semesters of the academic years 2021-2022 and 2022-2023. &nbsp;Students were surveyed regarding their experience with embedded tutoring. From these surveys, more than 70% of students stated that they felt more comfortable asking questions during the embedded tutoring hours and were glad to have the opportunity to have an embedded tutor while working on homework. Over 50% of the students stated that they used the embedded tutor some of the time. It is important to point out that over 25% of students stated that the embedded tutor made an impact on their success in the course, which increased in the third year to over 50% of students. These results indicated that the students had positive experiences with embedded tutoring. The success rates for college algebra and algebra and trigonometry courses have significantly increased over the last few years, and having the embedded tutor may have been a momentous contributor to the increase in success.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The data did show success rates of college algebra and algebra and trig overall. In the final year of the grant the percentage of students who passed either one of these courses was an 86.7% success rate. This was on par with the percentage of STEM students who passed either one of these courses, which was an 87% success rate. These success rates have been the highest in the last eight years.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lastly, dissemination of our project was accomplished through presentations at the 2022 Ohio Association of Two-Year Colleges (OATYC) Conference that was in Cleveland, Ohio, and the 2023 Achieving the Dream Conference held in Chicago, Illinois. More professional development could be beneficial as more data for these objectives is obtained.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/29/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Mysti&nbsp;Hobson</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1902411/1902411_10618959_1698354144873_Math1250andMath1340SuccessdataforSTEMMajorsandALLMajors--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1902411/1902411_10618959_1698354144873_Math1250andMath1340SuccessdataforSTEMMajorsandALLMajors--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Math 1250 and Math 1340 Success data for STEM Majors and ALL Majors\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1902411/1902411_10618959_1698354144873_Math1250andMath1340SuccessdataforSTEMMajorsandALLMajors--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Math 1250 and Math 1340 Success data for STEM Majors and ALL Majors\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The top graph is for success rates of STEM students in Math 1250 and Math 1340 combined over the last eight years.
