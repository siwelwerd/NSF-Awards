 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is demonstrate new lasers for advanced communication and sensing applications.  The proposed work includes the design, simulation, and testing of new lasers to meet rapidly-growing high-speed data center optical communication and emerging automotive laser range-finding requirements. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project activities will include the design, simulation, and experimental verification of hybrid, external-cavity silicon-based optical sources to meet rapidly-growing high-speed datacenter optical communication and emerging automotive laser range-finding requirements.  The project will demonstrate that a flexible electronic-photonic integration process can be created to enable dense integration of silicon-photonic and silicon-electronic circuits, independent of specific foundry or fabrication production limitations. This process can be used to develop arrays of high-performance, low-noise, and widely-tunable lasers for advanced optical communication and sensing applications. The proposed project will address existing laser mode-control issues and reduce back-reflection issues.  The result will be silicon-photonic lasers suitable for commercial production that will demonstrate industry-leading semiconductor laser capabilities including low-noise, narrow-linewidth, and wide tunability in single and multi-laser chipsets.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
