 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Phase 1 award supports the establishment of a new Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) site at the University of Georgia to the existing Center for Bioplastics and Biocomposites (CB2). CB2 currently includes Iowa State University, Washington State University, industry and government partners in the field. The University of Georgia site will provide additional capabilities for the center in the areas of new biodegradable polymers and additives, advanced fibers, and durable coatings and finishes based on biobased feedstocks.  Current members of CB2 will benefit from UGA faculty expertise and the research tools and infrastructure at UGA. Likewise, the Site at UGA will increase the opportunities to leverage research expertise and facilities at ISU and WSU, both of which have strong programs in sustainability, bioproducts, and bioplastics. Bringing a new synergistic industry sector to CB2 will benefit both incoming and current members by facilitating new industrial interactions spanning the bioproducts supply chain and enable CB2 members to lead their sectors in replacing existing plastic and packaging materials with biodegradable alternatives. Students will be educated and exposed to cutting edge research and outreach opportunities to enter the workforce immediately, with the ability to contribute and have positive impact. \r\n\r\nIn 2014, global plastic production reached 299 million metric tons (MMTs), with 5 to 12 MMTs estimated to reach our oceans annually due to mismanaged waste (waste that is littered or not handled in an organized system like a landfill). With increasing population, plastic consumption, and waste generation, a cumulative input of up to 250 MMTs into our oceans is predicted by 2025. Of all the plastics manufactured today, about 40% are used in packaging, material that will be immediately thrown away after use. The packaging industry employs over 5 million people worldwide and has estimated sales of $1 trillion in 2018. The opportunities to replace persistent plastic materials with those that are compostable and or biodegradable are gaining market share in a variety of industry sectors.  The UGA site addition to CB2 is centered around replacing existing plastic and packaging materials with alternative, biodegradable or compostable plastics used in the packaging industry, including coatings, foams, nonwoven fibers, and novel thermoplastics with excellent barrier properties for films, sheet goods, and filtration media. As a Site addition to CB2, UGA will promote the IUCRC Center goals, including innovation in academia that is driven by industrial need. Plastics in the ocean is now recognized as a global issue, and industry is extremely interested in making changes in the design and production level to address the unintended consequences of non-biodegradable plastic. The work in this IUCRC will allow industry to innovate and collaborate at a critical time when scaling technologies is crucial to their success. Students will be educated and exposed to cutting edge research and outreach opportunities to enter the workforce immediately ready to contribute and have positive impacts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
