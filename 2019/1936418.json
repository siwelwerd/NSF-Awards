The projects involved two major initiatives aimed at enhancing military capabilities through atmospheric modeling: (1) improving weather data for precise airdrop missions and (2) integrating high-resolution weather models in Army training simulations. The projects work aimed to provide advanced weather information for improved decision-making and realistic training for military personnel.\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\n\nOne primary goal was to develop the SondeTOSS (Dropsonde Targeted Observation Software Solution) for the Army, a system that identifies optimal locations for atmospheric measurements near cargo drop zones.
