 "awd_abstract_narration": "Guanidine is a potential nitrogen fertilizer and ethylene has been proposed as a potential alternative fuel source; thus, the biosynthetic reactions that form these compounds are commercially important as they have potential benefits for agriculture and the biofuels industries. With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Drs. Robert Hausinger and Jian Hu at Michigan State University, and Dr. Christo Christov at Michigan Technological Institute to investigate how ethylene-forming enzyme (EFE) from bacteria and fungi catalyzes dual reactions to form guanidine or ethylene. In the typical reaction of EFE, a carbon dioxide is removed from other molecules (2-oxoglutarate, or 2OG), while being added to the amino acid, L-arginine, to transform it into guanidine.  Alternatively, EFE catalyzes the transformation of 2OG into ethylene, with the release of carbon dioxide / bicarbonate. Research into the mechanisms of EFE catalysis provides specialized biochemical, structural, and computational training to postdoctoral fellows, and graduate and undergraduate students, including women and students from underrepresented minority groups. Incorporation of these studies into a university science festival engages families and lifelong learners through outreach programs about the potential use of ethylene as a biofuel.\r\n\r\nThe overarching goals of this research project are to elucidate the molecular determinants that distinguish the two distinct reactions catalyzed by EFE and to establish the catalytic mechanisms of the enzyme by a combination of experimental and computational studies. This work also investigates why other members of the iron(II)- and 2OG-dependent oxygenases fail to produce ethylene. To understand the basis of the two EFE-catalyzed reactions, the researchers are characterizing naturally occurring analogs, a reconstructed ancestor, and site-directed variants of the protein by using kinetic, structural, and computational methods. Using this information along with structure-guided protein engineering, the researchers are creating EFE variants optimized for the production of either the biofuel ethylene or the plant fertilizer guanidine while eliminating wasteful L-Arginine hydroxylation or 2OG-degrading reactions. In addition, the team is using biochemical, kinetic, spectroscopic, and computational methods to elucidate the chemical reaction mechanism of EFE. This work extends the structural/mechanistic information available on other important iron(II)- and 2OG-dependent oxygenases that are unable to catalyze these reactions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

EFE catalyzes two simultaneous reactions: (i) the conversion of 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) to ethylene and CO<sub>2</sub> and (ii) the oxidative decarboxylation of 2OG coupled with the C5 hydroxylation of the amino acid L-Arg to form guanidine and L-&Delta;1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C). Notably, both of these reactions are significant because ethylene has been promoted as a potential biofuel and guanidine can be utilized as a nitrogen-rich fertilizer.</p>\n<p>The overarching goals of this project were to elucidate the molecular determinants that distinguish the two distinct reactions, including why other members of the enzyme family fail to produce ethylene, and to establish the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme by a combination of experimental and computational studies. Most efforts utilized EFE from <em>Pseudomonas syringae</em> pv. <em>phaseolicola</em> strain PK2 (strain PK2 EFE), which the MSU investigators had previously structurally characterized. Additional studies were conducted using a fungal EFE from <em>Penicillium digitatum</em> Pd1 (i.e., strain Pd1 EFE), related proteins created by ancestral sequence reconstruction, and a protein relative from <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> PAO1 that was structurally characterized by others.</p>\n<p>Using an integrated molecular dynamics (MD) and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) approach that references previous experimental studies by Hausinger/Hu, Christov and colleagues tested the hypothesis that synergy between the conformation of L-Arg and the coordination mode of 2OG directs the reaction toward ethylene formation or L-Arg hydroxylation. The EFE/Fe(III)/superoxo/2OG/L-Arg dynamics show that L-Arg exists in conformation A (productive for hydroxylation) and conformation B (unproductive for hydroxylation). QM/MM calculations show that when 2OG is bound in an off-line mode and L-Arg is present in conformation A, the Fe(III)/superoxo intermediate undergoes the standard O<sub>2</sub> activation mechanism involving ferryl dependent hydroxylation. With the same off-line 2OG coordination, but with conformation B of L-Arg, a unique pathway produces a half-bond ferric-bicarbonate intermediate that decomposes to ethylene, two CO<sub>2</sub>, and a ferrous-bicarbonate species. The results demonstrate the L-Arg conformation acts as a switch, directing the reaction toward ethylene formation or hydroxylation. A change to in-line 2OG coordination reduces stabilization of the 2OG C1 carboxylate such that neither conformation of L-Arg produces the ethylene-forming half-bond ferric-bicarbonate intermediate. Thus, L-Arg conformation-dependent changes, together with the 2OG binding mode-associated stabilization of the C1-carboxylate, distinguish whether the EFE reaction proceeds via the ethylene-forming pathway or catalyzes a hydroxylation mechanism.</p>\n<p>The two L-Arg binding conformations also lead to differences in the intrinsic electric field (IntEF) of EFE. Importantly, the Christov group suggested that applying an external electric field (ExtEF) along the Fe?O bond in the EFE/Fe(III)/superoxol/2OG/L-Arg complex can switch the EFE reactivity between L-Arg hydroxylation and ethylene generation. The Hausinger/Hu group experimentally generated variant forms of EFE with alanine substituted for selected second coordination sphere residues responsible for stabilizing the key intermediates in the two reactions of EFE, leading to changes in enzyme activity, thus demonstrating the key role of these residues.</p>\n<p>The crystal structure was solved for the R171A variant of strain PK2 EFE at 1.6 ? resolution and revealed a shifting of residues at positions 172-180 accounting for its inactivity.</p>\n<p>The crystal structure was solved for the L37-start site version of strain Pd1 EFE, the only non-PK2 structure to be determined. The resolution of 3.5&#8239;? is poor and we were unable to place residues from 90 to 100, 187 to 199, and 225 to 245; however, we demonstrated that strain PK2 and strain Pd1 EFEs superimpose, especially near the Fe, 2OG and the L-Arg binding sites, and differ mainly at their surface exposed loops.</p>\n<p>Two approaches were used to perform ancestral sequence reconstructions (ASR) of EFE with the goal of identifying whether the primordial enzyme exhibited only ethylene formation or P5C generation. Three reconstructed sequences from one ASR approach were characterized and shown to glycosylated. Two of the proteins bound Fe and 2OG as demonstrated by observation of metal-to-ligand charge-transfer transitions during anaerobic spectroscopy. One protein was crystallized and diffracted to 2.15 ?. Each of these proteins was inactive, consistent with going too far into the past. The second ASR approach led to characterization of five variant samples that were characterized.
