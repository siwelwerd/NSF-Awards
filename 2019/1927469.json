 "awd_abstract_narration": "The US workforce is changing, while technology is evolving at a rapid pace. The US workforce is shifting to include greater minority diversity and older workers, consistent with the changing demographics of the country. More workers are engaging in work remotely and working in distributed groups, workplace tasks are changing, and there is increasing reliance on technology to support work efforts. As technology evolves, there are many under-explored opportunities for new technologies to restructure workplaces and work tasks to support an increasingly diverse population in developing new skills and accomplishing more complex tasks with greater ease and fulfillment than ever before. This AccelNet project has the goal of accelerating scientific discovery to benefit the US workforce. In creating the Human-Computer Relationships at Work (HCR@W) network-of-networks the PI team will bring together international member networks including networks advancing inclusive technologies designed to support people with diverse needs, advanced technologies designed for highly sophisticated tasks, and educational technologies designed to support the learning of new knowledge and skills. They will establish strong connections across disciplines through student and researcher Fellows and Scholar-in-Residence programs, the collective creation of target scenarios, and creating and testing prototypes of novel interactions and contexts for work and workforce preparation in which advanced human-computer relationships are central.\r\n\r\nIn this Catalytic Accelnet project, the PI-team engages in a facilitated process of reflection to identify common barriers and develop a set of community-wide target scenarios to create a shared strategic vision and define critical research priorities. The participants in this network-of-networks advance these research priorities through collaboration at a series of conference workshops and a Scholars-in-Residence program. At conference workshops, participants gather to collaboratively address key topics identified as necessary for advancements. Through the Scholars-in-Residence program, graduate students, postdocs, and early career researchers cross international and disciplinary borders on extended research visits to develop and test ideas that emerge from network-of-network collaborations. Additionally, a facilitated online peer mentoring program provides professional development opportunities for Fellows, supporting the development of a strong social network and advancing knowledge of convergence research and network leadership. Utilizing evidence-based practices of network leadership and fair collaboration coupled with social network analysis methods, the PI team tracks the growing network-of-networks, identify further opportunities for alignment, and address network gaps and challenges. Outcomes will include new international collaborations advancing research for the future workforce, and novel technologies and human-computer interfaces that are inclusive to the full spectrum of human diversity and capable of supporting humans in learning and conducting complex work. Additionally, this project advances the community's knowledge of effective network-of-network leadership practices and professional development of network leadership and convergence research for students, postdocs, and early-career researchers.\r\n\r\nThe Accelerating Research through International Network-to-Network Collaborations (AccelNet) program is designed to accelerate the process of scientific discovery and prepare the next generation of U.S. researchers for multiteam international collaborations.  The AccelNet program supports strategic linkages among U.S. research networks and complementary networks abroad that will leverage research and educational resources to tackle grand scientific challenges that require significant coordinated international efforts. This project was co-funded by the Dynamics, Control and Systems Diagnostics program (ENG/CMMI).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
