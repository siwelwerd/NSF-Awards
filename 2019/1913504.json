 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to holistically examine how complex mixtures of gases react with sulfuric acid to form new particles and to develop a simple framework and model for predicting this process. The new model will particle formation on the basis of characteristics of the gaseous mixture, rather than a complete set of chemical reactions. A complementary instrument will be developed measure the potential of a mixture to form new particles as well. The combination of this model and measurement suite will simplify representation of particle formation in large scale atmospheric models in an affordable and robust method. This will provide insights into particle formation - one of the greatest uncertainties in existing atmospheric models. Particles formation impacts other important processes including the transmission and absorption of light and cloud formation and properties.\r\n\r\nThe project will directly support a female junior faculty member, one graduate student, and the incorporation of particle formation concepts into a series of atmospheric chemistry workshops for elementary school students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
