 "awd_abstract_narration": "Implementation Projects provide support to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to design, implement, study, and assess comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthen education and research. The project at Clark Atlanta University seeks to build on previous successful efforts to increase participation of African-American students in STEM disciplines.  The goal of the project is to provide students with cognitive and non-cognitive skills development and early undergraduate research immersion, while offering professional development opportunities to the faculty. The project will impact all STEM majors at the institution.\r\n\r\nThe project will redesign and implement foundational STEM courses with adaptive learning courseware and supplemental instruction; conduct workshops for students on self-efficacy and growth mindset pedagogy; conduct faculty development workshops on mentoring undergraduate students, new teaching pedagogies, self-efficacy and growth mindset pedagogy; and provide STEM students with early research experiences. Faculty from the School of Education will assess which of these interventions or combination thereof are most effective. A research study will be conducted to investigate the effect of these interventions on student outcomes in STEM courses, as well as retention, persistence, and graduation rates. The project will be guided and evaluated by advisory boards and evaluators.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
