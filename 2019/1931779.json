 "awd_abstract_narration": "The APQC workshop will help define Quantum Performance Assessment, an emerging research field that seeks answers to the overarching question \"How do we assess, probe, measure, quantify, and report the quality or performance of quantum computational devices?\". Experts from diverse subfields of physics, computer science, and quantum information will discuss aspects of quantum tomography, benchmarking, algorithms, compilation, hardware design, computational complexity, error correction, and experimental physics. The APQC scientific program will include talks in four areas of interest to quantum performance assessment: (i) Quantum characterization, verification, and validation, (ii) Quantum algorithms, (iii) Quantum error correction, (iv) Quantum \"supremacy\". Participants will share best practices, identify gaps in knowledge, and nucleate interdisciplinary collaborations to address challenge problems in quantum performance assessment.\r\n\r\nThis project advances the objectives of two of 10 Big Ideas for Future NSF Investments: \"Quantum Leap\" and \"Growing Convergent Research at NSF\". The 10 big ideas will push forward the frontiers of U.S. research, provide innovative approaches to solve some of the most pressing problems the world faces, as well as lead to discoveries not yet known. This project also advances objectives of the National Quantum Initiative (NQI), a coordinated multiagency program to support research and training in Quantum Information Science (QIS).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
