 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides support for graduate students to participate in the IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering in Vancouver, Canada, in August 2019. Students from the operations engineering community will be able to present papers and participate in many sessions highly relevant to their research areas, including data science, fault detection, diagnosis and prognostics, modeling and simulation of automated systems, smart factories, logistics and supply chains.  Attending this conference will give students the chance to present their work and interact with other scholars to strengthen the academic community and industrial base in addressing critical needs in automation science.  By providing travel and subsistence funds, this award will help remove barriers to attendance and broaden participation among underrepresented communities in engineering, thus developing a diverse set of future researchers.\r\n\r\nThe IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering is the premier international conference for academics and practitioners who are addressing challenges and opportunities in the field of automation science and engineering.  The conference attracts many academic engineering researchers, especially those addressing critical societal needs in data science to support automated manufacturing and logistics systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
