The project at Jarvis Christian College will promote and expose the interface between computational and applied mathematics and Life STEM and build capacities in the learning, teaching, and research of under-represented minority students in cutting edge computational and applied mathematics tools, techniques and concepts applicable for biology. The project activities will provide professional development for faculty, increase recruitment, student retention and graduation rates and provide pathways for minority students to pursue graduate study and careers in computation and mathematical biology. \r\n\r\nThe project objectives of the I-JUMP project are 1) to enrich the mathematics curriculum by embedding cutting edge computational and mathematical biology tools, techniques, and concepts into the mathematics courses; 2) to improve teaching strategy through converging differentiated instruction with cutting edge technology to engage the students in learning new concepts; 3) to expand students? visibilities and competencies in computational and mathematical biology research via infusion of computational and mathematical biology research into the existing undergraduate research curricula,  research internships, and peer-mentored research and 4) to update teaching and research infrastructure to support the new teaching strategies and the inquiry, project and research-based courses in computational and mathematical biology and mathematics general education courses. The outcomes of the project will embed the concepts of mathematical biology into every student's education at Jarvis Christian College. The training and knowledge in mathematical biology will provide graduates with the critical thinking, collaboration, creativity, and communication skills that will benefit them in their selected career pathways. Moreover, the project will create opportunities for minority and underrepresented students to participate in undergraduate research, pursue graduate study, and provide a pathway to careers in computational biology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
