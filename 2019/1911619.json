 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evolution depends on the possible outcomes of developmental processes, yet scientists lack a formal mathematical structure to incorporate developmental biases into evolutionary theory. One challenge in developing a general modeling framework is that developmental biases are unique to the structure and species in question. This research will incorporate models of cartilage and bone growth into an evolutionary framework. The researchers will build on recent comparisons of ear structures among toads; many toad species have impaired ear development and lack structures commonly important for hearing. The project will bring together researchers and students with mechanical engineers to create a mathematical model that predicts ear structures based on developmental parameters. The model will examine evolutionary changes that can switch whether or not toad species develop ears. This framework will form a general foundation that can be applied to other structures to understand how developmental processes limit possible outcomes of mutations. The increased collaboration between engineers and biologists will provide key educational opportunities for all participants. The project includes developing courses and activities that will help undergraduates, graduate students, and professors learn evolutionary modeling methods.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish these goals, the PI has recruited three mentors to model the effects of developmental biases on morphological diversity: an engineer who models biological processes, a leading evolutionary developmental biologist who studies neural crest and cartilage development in amphibians, and an expert in phylogenetically based models of evolution. The scientist and the engineer will work together in cross-disciplinary courses to gain complementary expertise and train CSU students. They will adapt models of cartilage growth to explore the extent to which cell size, density, and local chemical environments influence ear development and also which cell-cell or cell-environment interactions could alter morphology. These models will generate testable predictions that will guide experiments in collaboration with the evolutionary developmental biologist and will be incorporated into an explicit evolutionary framework under the guidance of the phylogenetic modeler. In addition to the educational opportunities for the PI and graduate students, another outcome of this work will be a publicly available module to better teach evolutionary biology in large introductory biology classes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Project participants have examined ear development to characterize cell-cell interactions as middle ear structures are just starting to form in several species of toads. For some of those species, middle ears are visible as small clusters of cells as tadpoles begin metamorphosis into juvenile frogs, but then those clusters do not extend and the adult frogs of some species entirely lack middle ear structures. Frogs that lack middle ears have reduced hearing ability, yet this loss of structures has occurred many separate times in the history of frogs and toads. This project analyzed the mechanical forces experienced by cells and how those mechanics differ at these critical early stages to determine which properties of developing cartilage might be necessary for complete middle ear development.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The project also evaluated how middle ears in adult frogs and toads function. Newly available CT scans provide remarkable insights into the structures of the small bones and cartilage that make up the middle ear. We can use mechanical modeling to understand how sound vibrations from outside the head are transmmitted through the middle ear into motion of the inner ear hair cells responsible for hearing. Middle ear structures vary broadly across animals, and this modeling allows us to identify how specific differences in shape or composition of these middle ear compoents impact hearing. We found in frogs and toads that overall size has a large impact on inner ear hair cell movement, and that flexibility of cartilaginous structures determines properties of sound transmission. We also showed that sound at different frequencies (high pitch vs. low pitch) result in very different patterns of movement, such that the middle ear can act as either a lever or a piston.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Two graduate students, one postdoctoral fellow, and four undergraduates received rigorous scientific training as a consequence of this project. The participants knew little about hearing when they started, and they have become expert in microscopy, morphological studies, and biomechanical modeling. The team has also actively worked to expand access of people to science by leading programs that help community college students transfer to Colorado State University and piloting new intiatives to help young people with disabilities thrive in internships in the lab. Finally, the team has shared their new knowledge about ear structure and function with the general public using models and games, and also has integrated this work into university classes.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/04/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kim&nbsp;L&nbsp;Hoke</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1911619/1911619_10596616_1683238770462_Nubbins--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1911619/1911619_10596616_1683238770462_Nubbins--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Species differences in early structures in middle ear\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1911619/1911619_10596616_1683238770462_Nubbins--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Species differences in early structures in middle ear\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">We compared the earliest groupings of cells that initiate middle ear development in three species, one that forms a full middle ear (left) and two in which the middle ear does not fully form (middle and right).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dylan Curry</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kim&nbsp;L&nbsp;Hoke</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Species differences in early structures in middle ear</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1911619/1911619_10596616_1683238146633_EarMorphologyComparison--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1911619/1911619_10596616_1683238146633_EarMorphologyComparison--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Species differences in middle ear components in adulthood\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1911619/1911619_10596616_1683238146633_EarMorphologyComparison--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Species differences in middle ear components in adulthood\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Species differ broadly in the size and shape of the structures that make up the middle ear.
