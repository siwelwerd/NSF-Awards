This research project aims to advance the framework of algebraic dynamical systems in approximation theory, develop new methods, and obtain far-reaching generalizations of results in the field. Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the project and introduced to new methods and techniques in number theory and dynamics. These students will also supervise research projects within the framework of the PRIMES program, an after-school research program for high school students. \r\n\r\nDuring recent years there has been an influx of new ideas concerning connections between Diophantine approximation and dynamical systems. This research project continues the study of phenomena in both homogeneous dynamics and number theory in two directions: related to so-called asymptotic and uniform approximation. Among mathematical tools to be employed are: quantitative non-divergence on the space of lattices, Schmidt games and their modifications, integral inequalities of Eskin-Margulis-Mozes, exponential mixing, equidistribution properties, and geometry of numbers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
