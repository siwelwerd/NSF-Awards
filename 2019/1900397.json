 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Second Northeast Conference on Dynamical Systems will be held in the third weekend of September 2019. The conference is a part of a biennial conference series that periodically provides a forum for the dynamical systems community in the northeast area. The goal of this conference is to promote progress in dynamical systems by bringing together researchers in dynamical systems, presenting latest research progress, exchanging ideas, encouraging collaborations, and fostering young researchers and students. \r\n\r\nInvited speakers and participants come from many areas of dynamical systems with an emphasis of connections between dynamical systems and statistical physics. The conference will also arrange many short talks for young researchers to announce their recent results. More information can been found at: http://people.math.umass.edu/~yaoli/UmassConference-Overview.html.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
