 "awd_abstract_narration": "Global surface warming markedly slowed between 2000 and 2014 despite a continued increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Both climate models and observations suggest that this slowdown or \"hiatus\" in warming may be attributed (at least in part) to strong trade-winds in the tropical Pacific. These strong winds transport heat into the subsurface ocean, leaving less heat to warm the atmosphere. Because wind strength changes on a decade-to-decade timescale (associated with natural variability in the Pacific), other periods of both accelerated and reduced warming over the last 100 years are likely tied to these changes in tropical trade-winds. Thus, warming will likely accelerate in the coming decade(s) when the cycle reverses and trade-winds weaken once again. However, our understanding of the link between global air temperatures and tropical Pacific wind strength to date has been limited by the scarcity of historical wind observations. This project will utilize the chemical fingerprints of changes in tropical Pacific winds captured in the skeleton of living and fossil corals to investigate past wind variability - and its link to global air temperatures - across the past century and preindustrial era. The research will also extend the application of this novel wind archive, providing key groundwork for such records to be extended to additional sites and time periods.  These natural archives of tropical Pacific wind strength over the recent past have the potential to dramatically improve our understanding of the impact of wind variability on the rate of global climate change. This project will also contribute to broadening participation and diversity in science by supporting two early career female scientists, a minority postdoctoral researcher and two undergraduates, who will together develop programs to promote race, gender, and LGBTQ diversity, equity and inclusion at Boston University. \r\n\r\nTropical Pacific coral records have dramatically improved our understanding of the oceanic response to changes in climate forcing over the past millennium, but our understanding of the associated atmospheric response remains limited by uncertainties in the interpretation of (often indirect and/or remote) hydrological proxies. This project leverages existing modern and fossil coral cores and a promising new coral proxy to investigate tropical Pacific trade wind variability across changes in natural and anthropogenic forcing. Building off pioneering studies linking westerly wind anomalies and coral skeletal Mn/Ca at Tarawa Atoll, the project will calibrate and extend this new proxy across sites (Tarawa, Kiritimati, Butaritari, and Palmyra) and time periods (20th century and Little Ice Age/preindustrial). Initial results demonstrate that coral Mn/Ca from Kiritimati and Butaritari capture the westerly winds observed at these sites during the 1997/98 El Ni\u00f1o event, supporting the causal link between wind variability and coral Mn/Ca at atolls with west-facing lagoons, and thus the potential for extending Mn/Ca-based trade-wind reconstructions across space and time. This project will produce the first robust, well-replicated, and quantitative reconstructions of Pacific trade wind strength spanning the 20th century and Little Ice Age (LIA) to preindustrial period (1400-1850CE) using overlapping modern and fossil corals from the western and central equatorial Pacific. This project also lays the foundation for coral Mn/Ca-based trade-wind reconstructions to be expanded to other sites and time periods by exploring the strengths and limitations of this novel proxy. Such trade-wind reconstructions have the potential to dramatically improve our understanding of trade-wind variability and its impact on global climate change in response to both natural and anthropogenic forcings.",

First, we ground-truthed and confirmed the proposed mechanism of a novel coral geochemical tracer of trade-wind variability (coral Mn/Ca) by quantifying and tracking the movement of Mn between reservoirs in an example island system (Fig. 2). Second, we sampled and analyzed the geochemistry of five modern coral cores and six sub-fossil coral cores, effectively increasing the number of coral Mn/Ca-based wind reconstructions that exist by nine fold (Fig. 1). Advances in high-resolution coral geochemical analysis techniques accomplished during this project made it possible to capture the short-lived spikes of Mn/Ca in the coral skeleton. Third, we demonstrated that each coral Mn/Ca record reflects not only its sampling resolution, but also the unique fingerprint of the lagoon of the island site from which it was collected. Next, we developed a method to address non-wind-related influences on coral Mn/Ca and produce a composite containing the ten unique coral Mn/Ca records that exist from across the equatorial Pacific (Fig. 3). This composite record extends the observational record of westerly winds by almost a century, and the western and central equatorial Pacific counterparts of the composite provide insight into the unique signature of westerly winds associated with different flavors of El Nino events. Furthermore, the western equatorial Pacific composite record captures the timescales of variability evident in modern westerly-wind activity. Finally, we demonstrated that coral Mn/Ca can uncover westerly-wind activity in sub-fossil corals that have been subjected to diagenetic alteration. Through this project, we have demonstrated the utility of the coral Mn/Ca-based trade-wind proxy in supplementing the sparse observational record of wind in the tropical Pacific to provide crucial information about timescales of trade-wind variability and El Nino event diversity. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project contributed to broadening participation in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) in several ways.&nbsp; First, the project directly supported personnel and students from backgrounds that have been historically excluded in STEM.
