 "awd_abstract_narration": "A century ago, there was a movement to put mathematics on a rigorous, unified foundation. Because the notion of a set is among the most primitive in mathematics, it was used as the basic fabric with which to build the more complicated objects of mathematics. Since that time, it has been realized that the properties of infinite sets are themselves quite subtle and defy a complete axiomatization. Moreover, these set-theoretic complexities sometimes manifest themselves in more complex mathematical structures, such as those studied in algebra, analysis, and geometry. The aim of this project is to further develop both our understanding of set-theoretic methods and also how they can be applied to problems arising in fields of mathematics such as algebra, analysis, and topology. While the project involves several lines of investigation, a central theme will be to develop a deeper understanding of the structure of the algebra of all piece-wise linear functions from the unit interval to itself using the lens of transfinite ordinal numbers.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the research project involves attempting to prove the following conjecture of Matthew Brin and Mark Sapir: if G is a group of piece-wise linear homeomorphims of the unit interval, then either G is elementary amenable or else G contains an isomorphic copy of Richard Thompson's group F. It is the PI's thesis that not only is this conjecture true, but that it will be a consequence of a much finer analysis of subgroup structure of PLoI, the group of piece-wise linear homeomophisms of the unit interval. This analysis is expected to have a number of other consequences: that the finitely generated subgroups of F are well quasi-ordered by embeddability; that any finitely presented subgroup of PLoI is either abelian or contains a copy of F; that Peano Arithmetic does not prove that F is amenable. Central to the analysis will be the countable transfinite ordinals. The second part of the research project concerns further developing techniques in pure set theory: \r\nmethods for studying the combinatorics of the second uncountable cardinal via forcing axioms; the role that Jensen's diamond principle plays in the theory of the sets of hereditary cardinality at most aleph1.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSeveral applications of set theory to other subjects were made over the course of this grant.\n\n\nIt was demonstrated that it is consistent with the standard axioms of mathematics (ZFC) that strong homology is additive within the class of locally compact separable metric spaces.  Homology theories are frameworks in classical algebraic topology which are used to quantify the presence of holes in various dimensions in a topological space.  The results obtained give the first (consistent) example of a homology theory which is additive and strong shape invariant.  The project also isolated the set theoretic hypothesis which was at the core of the argument, allowing previous work of Bergfalk and Lambie-Hanson on the vanishing of higher derived limits to be decoupled into a set theoretic argument and a separate algebraic argument.  This will facilitate a better understanding of the underlying phenomena by both the set theoretic and algebraic research communities.  The decoupling also suggests modifications to the definition of strong homology and related (co)chain complex constructions which would make them less sensitive to set-theoretic considerations and therefore more amenable to analysis by algebraists.\n\nA new method was isolated for demonstrating that groups of piecewise linear homeomorphisms do not embed into Richard Thompson's group F, an important object of study in abstract algebra.  This method is based on Poincare's rotation number and is sufficiently general to establish all know nonembedding results of groups of piecewise linear homeomorphisms of the interval into the group F.  This method also led to the discovery of new examples of piecewise linear homeomorphisms of the circle which preserve rational points and have irrational rotation number.  These are the first such examples for which the rotation number is algebraic (e.g. &radic;2-1) and the first such examples where the slopes of the homeomorphism are powers of a single rational (e.g. 2/3). \n\nIt was demonstrated that, for each 0 &lt; p &lt; 1, there is a set of (possibly infinite) rooted ordered binary trees which is measure one with respect to the Galton-Watson measure associated to p and which is closed under the operation of joining two trees under a common caret and which admits a continuous evaluation homomorphism into each of the Laver tables (the finite, cyclic, left self distributive binary systems).  This evaluation map connects two seemingly unrelated parts of mathematics (probability and set theory) and may yield new insight into the amenability problem for Thompson's group F.\n\nThe first consistent examples of minimal non-sigma-scattered linear orders were constructed which have cardinality greater than the first uncountable cardinal.  These examples are constructed using mild set-theoretic assumptions and give new insight into combinatorial basis problems at higher cardinals.\n\nThis grant supported the research of four graduate students and the PI engaged in mentoring and professional development activities both with these graduate students and those visiting the Fields Institute.  The grant provided support for speakers to attend the Cornell logic seminar.  Finally, the grant supported revisions of papers disseminating results from a previous grant, of which this grant was a renewal. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/23/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Justin T Moore"
