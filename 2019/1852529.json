 "awd_abstract_narration": "Demand for high-performance permanent magnets is increasing rapidly for applications such as wind turbine generators and motors in both electric and hybrid cars. This market is served by rare earth (RE) magnets based on neodymium-iron-boron and samarium-cobalt. RE magnets are not without issues; they can chip, suffer thermal shock, and can suffer grain boundary corrosion. However, their biggest problems are: price volatility; that China largely controls the RE metals market; and that the extraction of RE metals creates severe environmental degradation. The compound MnAl has been of interest as a permanent magnet since the early 1960s. It has a  theoretical energy product (a measure of its magnetic strength) between that of traditional AlNiCo magnets and RE magnets with a value comparable to that of bonded neodymium-iron-boron magnets. Further, it does  not suffer from the issues associated with RE magnets, and potentially has the lowest cost per unit energy product of any permanent magnet. The magnetic properties of MnAl are affected by the numerous types of defects present, but how these defects affect the magnetic properties and under what conditions these defects occur is unknown. In this project, we will determine both the conditions under which defects and second phases form during processing of MnAl and how these control the magnetic properties. The expectation is that superior magnetic properties can be obtained by carefully manipulating the defect structure. While the work focuses on MnAl, understanding the relationship between the occurrence of defects, their production and their relationship to the magnetic properties in MnAl will be useful for understanding similar behavior in the related compounds MnBi, MnGa, NiFe, PtFe and CoPt, all of which are of interest as hard magnets. The project includes the training of both a Ph.D. student and several undergraduates in state-of-the-art techniques.\r\n\r\nTau-MnAl is a metastable phase that transforms from the high temperature epsilon phase, during which anti-phase boundaries (APBs), twins, stacking faults and dislocations are created. Depending on the processing conditions, the equilibrium beta and gamma 2 phases can also form. The fundamental difficulty with improving the magnetic properties of tau-MnAl is that there is no clear understanding on how they depend on the defect structure. The grain size can also influence the magnetic properties either directly or by affecting the beta and gamma 2 phases arrangement and defect formation. Our aim is to understand both the conditions under which APBs, twins, stacking faults, dislocations and second phases form during processing of tau-MnAl and how these control the magnetic properties. The local chemistry will also be explored at high resolution using atom probe tomography via collaboration with Dr. Baptiste Gault, Max-Planck-Institut fur Eisenforschung, Germany. Our working hypothesis is that we need a strong, c-axis alignment and a low density of APBs, twins and stacking faults (which locally disorder the material) for a high saturation magnetization, while a low density of APBs, twins and stacking faults but a  high dislocation density are required for a high coercivity. It is thought that a fine distribution of beta and gamma 2 phases will also contribute to a high coercivity through magnetic domain wall pinning. While the work focuses on MnAl, understanding the relationship between the occurrence of defects, their production and their relationship to the magnetic properties in MnAl will be useful for understanding similar behavior in the related compounds MnBi, MnGa, NiFe, PtFe and CoPt, all of which are of interest as hard magnets. The project will include training of both a Ph.D. student and several undergraduates in state-of-the-art techniques.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

As the world moves away from internal combustion and towards electrification, the demand for permanent magnet (PM) materials has increased. The two highest performance PMs are alloys of neodymium, iron, and boron and alloys of samarium and cobalt, collectively known as rare-earth (RE) PMs. Due to their scarcity and high demand, the price of their raw materials is high and subject to market volatility. Ferrite PMs, based on strontium, iron, and oxygen are abundant and inexpensive, but do not have sufficiently high performance for many applications, such as electric vehicle motors. Therefore, there is an opportunity to fill the performance gap between RE PMs and ferrite PMs with middle performance magnetic materials.</p>\n<p>The manganese-aluminum (Mn-Al) ferromagnetic (FM) t phase is an excellent candidate to fit the middle performance criteria. It has magnetic performance between ferrites and RE PMs and has much lower raw material cost than RE PMs. Therefore, the goal of this project was to identify pathways to maximize the performance of Mn-Al t phase PMs. Three project paths were chosen. First, the t-phase transformation process was studied to understand why it proceeds differently depending on the temperature. Second, the addition of a ternary element to Mn-Al was investigated to determine if such an addition would improve the magnetic properties. Third, the manufacturing of the t phase was studied using three techniques: equal-channel angular extrusion (ECAE), high-pressure torsion (HPT), and laser powder-bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing. In each case, the microstructure of the material was characterized to understand the magnetic properties.</p>\n<p>The FM arrangement of the t phase is a result of atomic rearrangement by a combination of mechanical shearing and thermal motion. The mechanical shearing is a two-step process, whereas the thermal motion mode is a one-step process. The shearing mode was observed to dominate at low temperatures. The required energies for the two shearing steps were measured to be lower than the required energy of the one thermal motion step. Therefore, this study found a kinetic advantage to the two-step process at low temperatures, where there is less thermal energy, because two smaller energy barriers were easier to overcome than one large energy barrier. This is an important insight into why the phase transformation to t proceeds differently depending on the temperature, a key advancement in controlling the magnetic properties.</p>\n<p>The addition of a third element to the Mn-Al system was investigated by a combination of modeling and experiment. Density functional theory (DFT) was used to investigate the effect of a ternary element on antiphase boundary (APB) defects, which are common in the t phase and negatively affect the magnetic properties. Titanium (Ti) was modeled to segregate to APBs and to counteract their negative behavior, improving the magnetic properties. In the experiment, adding Ti was shown to significantly lower the density of APBs within the material and improved overall magnetic performance by 33%. In addition to improving the magnetic energy product &nbsp;(&Beta;&Eta;<sub>max</sub>), the addition of Ti improved the thermal stability of the magnet. This means that Mn-Al with Ti added can better withstand elevated temperatures, such as those used in conventional magnet processing.</p>\n<p>The t phase was processed using ECAE, HPT, and LPBF. ECAE involved squeezing the magnet through an angled tunnel at high temperatures and pressures. The squeezing puts desirable crystal defects into the material. The magnet cracked during this process, but it resulted in an increase in magnetic performance of 220%. The issue of material fracture can be mitigated in the future by performing ECAE at higher temperatures (above 400?C) to improve the ductility.</p>\n<p>HPT involved squeezing the magnet between two rotating parallel plates at high temperatures and pressures. In contrast to ECAE, the t phase behaved more malleably during HPT and did not fracture. Despite this, the magnetic properties were not improved by this technique.</p>\n<p>LPBF was used to 3D print 1 cm cubes at different laser scanning speeds. The best result was achieved for the fastest speed (240 mm/s). This sample showed a 94% density compared to a solid metal reference. The magnetic axis was aligned along the print direction, meaning that the best magnetic properties were measured along this dimension. Cycling between being melted by the laser and solidifying during printing caused a high density of desirable crystal defects. This, combined with the magnetic axis along the print direction, improved magnetic performance by 70%. Therefore, ECAE and LPBF were demonstrated as viable ways to manufacture Mn-Al PMs.</p>\n<p>The results of this project have been published in peer-reviewed journals, disseminated in conference presentations, and have resulted in a provisional patent.
