 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many extra-solar planets (\"exoplanets\") are discovered today by tracking precisely the light from the star they orbit. When the planet transits, or passes in front of, the star, a tiny bit of the star's light is blocked. This allows astronomers to determine many properties of the planet. The PI's team are pioneers in using an optical device called an Engineered Diffuser. This device significantly reduces sources of uncertainty in the light output of the star, especially the effect known as scintillation (\"twinkling,\" in a layperson's term). They will use this technique to identify, confirm, and study planets down to Earth's size around bright stars. They will also use the technique to study the stars' magnetic fields by detecting spots analogous to sunspots on the surface of the stars. Undergraduate and graduate students, and a postdoctoral associate, will take part in the observations and data analysis. The collaborators will also incorporate the results into their teaching and public outreach at their institutions.\r\n\r\nGround-based observations are subject to a number of limitations in their precision due to the day-night cycle, atmospheric effects, scintillation, transparency variations, differential extinction, seeing, and telescope-guiding effects which typically prevents them from achieving the photometric precision of space-based missions. The larger field of view offered by small aperture telescopes enables bright comparison stars to be more readily found, however, the aforementioned challenges often prevent small telescopes from matching space-based photometric precision. Larger telescopes offer better averaging of scintillation. The group's implementation of diffuser-aided photometry from the ground provides an improvement in performance compared to de-focused small telescopes and they have demonstrated on-sky photometric performance that rivals that of space telescopes at a fraction of the cost.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nIn 2017, our team developed a new technology called an engineered diffuser for astronomical applications. The goal of this preliminary project was to achieve space-based quality photometric precision in the data collected from ground-based telescopes at a fraction of the cost by placing an inexpensive optical device in light path of a telescope. The ultra-precise photometry would allow us to detect and characterize small, rocky Earth-like planets from the ground and characterize the magnetic activity on stars other than the Sun by mapping the individual starspots on their surfaces. These science goals were previously out of reach from ground-based telescope facilities, but the engineered diffuser technology was extremely successful.\n\n\nThis NSF project, which ran from 2019-2023, was then designed to use the new techology to obtain diffuser-assisted data from the ground based ARC 3.5m Apache Point Observatory to detect new transiting planets and characterize their starspots. This project was extremely successful. It resulted in 14 different publications directly linked to this project and its funding. We discovered 11 new planets around low-mass stars, including but not limited to: TOI 3785b a low-density Neptune-mass planet, which belongs to a rare population of Neptunes orbiting cooler, smaller M-dwarf host stars. Only ten such planets are known; TOI 4201b, a 2.7 Jupiter  mass planet orbiting a low mass star. This planet is  difficult to form through the favored planet formation theory of core  accretion due to its relatively large mass compared to the host stars  mass and requires modifications to our understanding of planet formatio; and TOI 3884b, a Neptune-mass planet orbiting a low-mass that has a giant polar starspot on its southern pole. The unique and important planets that we discovered with this project are all orbiting low-mass stars that are cooler, smaller and less massive than the Sun and are prime targets for followup observations that can be used to measure the molecules in their atmospheres using NASA's James Webb Space Telescope. \n\n\n\nWith this project, we also mapped the starspot distribution on the slightly evolved solar-type star, KOI-340, finding that the starspots were more numerous and much larger than starspots on the Sun, and we developed a new technique for measuring temperatures of starspots on other starsusing ultra-precise photometry. \n\n\n\nThis project resulted in over 14 publications, trained one PhD student, and multiple undergraduate students in problem solving, data analysis and research skills. \n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/23/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: LeslieHebb\n"
