 "awd_abstract_narration": "Heme is the iron-containing molecule that allows hemoglobin to carry oxygen in blood.  Heme also plays many other important biochemical functions in cells. With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Elizabeth Stroupe at Florida State University to study a special form of heme (called siroheme).  Siroheme helps chemically transform environmental sulfur or nitrogen compounds to biologically usable forms using microbes. This research topic is of particular importance because environmental pollution in the form of toxic sulfur byproducts from commercial pig farms has become problematic due to recent flooding in the southern United States.  Dr. Stroupe is studying a key enzyme (CysG) made from two bacteria in order to determine the basic science of siroheme formation.  By knowing how siroheme is formed, scientists may improve upon the bio-remediation of toxic sulfur compounds. The project trains diverse groups of undergraduate and graduate students in molecular structure determinations and follows the biochemical activity of enzymes at various stages of reaction. Dr. Stroupe and her students impart an appreciation for the role that organic chemistry plays in biology to middle and high school students through the SCIGirls and Florida's Next Generation Science Standards outreach programs.\r\n\r\nProteobacteria use a single gene product (CysG) to synthesize siroheme. CsyG is the product of a gene fusion event between a methyltransferase (CysG-A) and a bifunctional dehydrogenase/ferrochelatase (CysG-B). The mechanisms for CysG-B's bifunctionality and its alternative function as a cobaltchelatase are unknown. Other organisms use three distinct enzymes for siroheme synthesis, including the CysG-B homolog SirC, which is a monofunctional dehydrogenase. X-ray crystallography, biochemical analysis, and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) are applied to dissect the underlying mechanisms for the last two steps of siroheme synthesis. The questions addressed by this project include how bifunctional active sites in CysG-B catalyze dehydrogenation and metal chelation and how chelatase discriminates between iron and cobalt to make siroheme.  Researchers also ask how CysG-B functions as a bifunctional dehydogenase/ferrochelatase when SirC, a homologous enzyme, only functions as a dehydrogenase.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Sulfur metabolism, in particular its reduction to its bioavailable form (sulfide) is essential for making the building blocks of the molecules that make up all of life. The enzyme&nbsp;that synthesizes siroheme in bacteria like&nbsp;<em>Salmonella</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Escherichia coli</em>&nbsp;is called siroheme sythase or abbreviated by its gene name CysG. Siroheme, in turn, is used as a cofactor by another enzyme called sulfite reductase to perform the reduction of sulfite to sufide. CysG is unique because it performs each of the chemical steps in siroheme synthesis - two methylations, a dehydrogenation, and a metal insertion (Fig. 1).</p>\n<p>Our first major result was to determine the structure of CysG when it is bound to two intermediates and the product of siroheme synthesis (Pennington, et al, 2020). The first structure is of CysG bound to the two-methyl intermediate, precorrin 2. The second is of CysG bound to the oxidized intermediate, sirohydroclorin. The final is of CysG bound to a metylated product, cobalt-sirohydrochlorin. (Fig. 2).

Ultimately, we used a computational approach because structural approaches were not successful. The computational results explain the limitations of the structural approaches in SirC. Sirohydrochlorin is SirC's final product, but a metallation substrate in CysG. In CysG, as described above, sirohydrochlorin binds tightly. According to our docking results, sirohydrochlorin binds much more flexibly, in multiple poses (Fig. 3). This suggests that the difference between the bifunctional CysG and the monofunctional SirC might lie not in a single protein chemical difference but rather in the way in which sirohydrochlorin is released from the active site.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 10/16/2024<br>\nModified by: Elizabeth&nbsp;Stroupe</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1904612/1904612_10617739_1729079591973_Fig.2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1904612/1904612_10617739_1729079591973_Fig.2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Fig. 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1904612/1904612_10617739_1729079591973_Fig.2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Fig. 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">CysG bound to precorrin-2, sirohydrochlorin, and cobalt-sirohydrochlorin.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Pennington, et al, Nat.
