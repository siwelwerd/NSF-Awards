The summit will bring together people with expertise not only in brain-computer interfaces (BCI's) and cerebral palsy, but also in neuroscience, language development and related fields to promote a comprehensive understanding of the challenges involved in creating BCI's for this purpose. \r\n\r\nA \"thought-to-speech\" BCI would provide an opportunity for people born without the ability to speak as well as relieve the burden of acquired speech impairments from those who acquire such a condition later in life. The intelligence of people with motor and communication impairments is routinely underestimated. A thought-to-speech or rapid-text BCI would circumvent this fallacious assumption.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
