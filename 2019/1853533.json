 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to support Native-serving institutions of higher education in building their science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities. The Pukoa Kani Aina project, housed at the University of Hawai'i-West O'ahu, aligns with TCUP goals through the enlistment of a series of activities designed to strengthen the STEM instructional capacity at UHWO and improve student outcomes in STEM. Using a pipeline approach, the project enrolls high school students in summer bridge programs that enhance their readiness for college and continues working with them through the use of a student cohort model as they move through college. UHWO faculty across disciplines collaborate in developing innovative STEM courses designed to more fully engage students and foster knowledge and skills required in today's STEM workforce. Additionally, these cross-disciplinary groups are formulating a five-year plan for developing new STEM programs to be offered at UHWO.\r\n\r\nThis institutional capacity building project at the University of Hawai'i-West O'ahu is designed to establish an institution-level change that positively impacts Native Hawaiian students' success in STEM degrees and careers. Pukoa Kani Aina project goals are to 1) build a transdisciplinary, sustainable STEM ecosystem within the university; 2) streamline pipelines from K-12 schools and community colleges into UHWO STEM programs, graduate studies, and STEM careers; and 3) map a five-year plan for the development of STEM degrees, concentrations, and certificates to be offered at UHWO. The project convenes partners from K-12, University of Hawai'i colleges, and industry in the development of STEM pathways into UHWO and beyond by establishing a summer bridge program with innovative math and science courses and fostering a student cohort in the freshman through senior year that supports students' retention and success in STEM. Additionally, faculty members are working in transdisciplinary professional learning communities to revise curriculum to incorporate innovations in pedagogy and content believed to better engage and support students in STEM degrees.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
