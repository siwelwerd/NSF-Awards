 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will use experimental methods to study the effects of information on parental involvement in their adolescent child's education and how this in turn affects the child's education and social outcomes. The intervention uses weekly text messages to provide low-income parents information and activities that will help them support their middle school children's socio-emotional and academic skills. The text messages include tips on how: (i) to support and guide children's academic trajectory as they transition from middle to high school; (ii) to support children's social and emotional learning (SEL) skills; and (ii) knowledge, skills, and abilities of children are grow-able. Educational and social outcomes of children whose parents receive text messages will be compared to those of children whose parents do not receive text messages. The goal of the text messaging is to narrow income-achievement gap of students before middle school students enter high school. Parental involvement during middle school years is positively associated with a range of behavioral and academic outcomes; yet parental involvement declines during the formative middle school years. This project is intended to demonstrate the value of a parental texting programs for the middle school years and provide a replication roadmap for school districts. The results of this research will provide important inputs into the design and implementation of policies to improve school outcomes, increase skills, and ultimately increase economic growth in the U.S. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis research project uses a randomized control trial (RCT) method to study the effects of information on parental involvement in their child's life and the effect of this involvement on the child's educational and social outcomes. It involves sending three weekly text messages to parents of middle school students in the treatment group. Each text message focuses on an academic topic, skill, or activity for their child. The text messages include tips on: supporting and guiding children's academic trajectory as they move from middle school to high school; supporting children's social and emotional learning (SEL) skills; and how to grow knowledge, skills, and abilities of children. Texts4Teens is intended to narrow income-achievement gaps before children enter high school. The results of this research will provide parents, schools, and school districts with details on how information on parent-child engagement affects students' academic and social-emotional outcomes and on how to support parents in their child's educational trajectory from middle to high school. The results will also establish the U.S. as the global leader in the use of information to improve education and social outcomes of teenagers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Through a randomized controlled trial in multiple Texas school districts, this study aims to test whether Texts4Teens impacts student outcomes. Although we are still acquiring data from our partner school districts, we can summarize preliminary findings based on District B below. Our findings are divided into two sections. First, we examine same-year effects: the effect of assignment to Texts4Teens during a given school year on end-of-year outcomes. Second, we also report long-run effects. In many school districts, parents signed up for the intervention for multiple years, enabling us to examine aggregate and dosage effects (i.e., receiving Texts4Teens texts for 0, 1, 2, and 3 years).</p>\n<p><strong>Same-Year Effects</strong></p>\n<p>For this analysis, we examined the effect of Texts4Teens on outcomes like attendance, grades, and discipline events by cycle (i.e., the 4- or 6-week grading periods school districts in Texas use). We estimate linear regression models that control for treatment condition and the school-by-grade-by-language blocking variable used for randomization. Standard errors are clustered by the blocking variable and separate models are estimated by school district. Covariates measuring student background (e.g., gender, free or reduced-price lunch status) and lagged dependent variables (e.g., attendance from cycle 1, before the intervention launched) are included in subsequent models.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The results from our same-year effects analysis are null or economically small. Sometimes there are random statistically significant coefficients, but, overall, there is nothing persistent. (Figures 1-3 show estimates from models without control variables.)</p>\n<p><strong>Long-Run Effects</strong></p>\n<p>For this analysis, we examined the effect of Texts4Teens on outcomes measured one to three years after initial treatment assignment. For example, an analysis of outcomes from the 2022-2023 school year would include students who participated in the intervention in the 2020-2021, 2021-2022, or 2022-2023 school years. We estimate long-run effects in two ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Aggregate Effects: We model each outcome controlling for an any treatment variable (i.e., parents received the treatment texts in any of the years they participated in the intervention)</li>\n<li>Dosage Effects: We model each outcome controlling for a categorical treatment variable (i.e., number of years parents received the treatment texts; 0 years (ref.), 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Like the same-year effects models, we use linear regression controlling for treatment condition and the school-by-grade-by-language blocking variable, cluster standard errors, and estimate separate models by school district. We include covariates in subsequent models.</p>\n<p>Overall, we tend to see more positive effects for students whose parents remained in the treatment condition for longer periods of time. For example, we found that Texts4Teens increased attendance rates and standardized math test scores among students whose parents participated in the program for two or three years (Figure 4). The math results highlight the importance of examining long-run effects and disaggregating to determine dosage. In the aggregate model (i.e., treatment in any year), we found that Texts4Teens raised math grades by 0.06 standard deviations (SD). However, in the dosage model, we found that participating in Texts4Teens for three years raised math grades by 0.12 SD (Figure 5).</p>\n<p>We also tested for heterogeneous treatment effects.

Preliminary results show that while there are no effects on same-year outcomes, there are some effects on long-run outcomes, particularly when disaggregating treatment effects by dosage. In terms of heterogeneity, the effects appear concentrated among female students, White students, and students whose parents had a bachelor&rsquo;s degree. It is unclear why this is the case. There may be several explanations for this finding, including the complexity of the messages, their cultural relevance, or the fact that more privileged parents may have more time to implement the facts and tips learned from the messages into their parenting practices.
