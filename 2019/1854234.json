 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide support for US participants, especially women, graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, to attend the thirty-first and thirty-second international conferences in Formal Power Series and Algebraic Combinatorics (FPSAC), held at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia on July 1-5, 2019 and Bar-Ilan University in Ramat-Gan, Israel on July 13-17, 2020.  The most important annual conference series in algebraic combinatorics in the world, FPSAC offers young American researchers a unique opportunity to interact closely with top mathematicians from many countries. Each conference, which includes nine one-hour plenary lectures, thirty half-hour contributed talks, and forty posters, will attract over 200 participants from all over the world.\r\n\r\nA distinguishing characteristic of FPSAC conferences is the concerted effort to recognize and encourage outstanding young scientists. At least one plenary speaker is an \"emerging star,\" and talented young researchers are well represented among the speakers selected for contributed talks. Another special feature of the FPSAC conferences is a continued tradition of inclusiveness. The conference seeks to draw substantial participation from underrepresented groups. Furthermore, English and French have been designated as official languages for FPSAC 2019 and 2020 to promote a diverse pool of participants. Attendance at this conference will be exceptionally valuable for graduate students and junior researchers. Somewhat interdisciplinary, the conferences link research in combinatorics to other topics in pure mathematics such as algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, representation theory, K-theory and symplectic geometry, and to topics in other sciences such as computer science, physics, and biology.  More information can be found at http://fpsac2019.fmf.uni-lj.si/ and http://fpsac.org/confs/fpsac-2020/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis grant provided travel funding for students and early career researchers to participate in the Formal Power Series and Algebraic Combinatorics (FPSAC) Conference in 2019 through 2023. The FPSAC conference series is a one-week annual international meeting focusing on algebraic and enumerative combinatorics as well as connections between these topics and other areas of mathematics, computer science, bioinformatics, and physics. The FPSAC meetings are one of the most important platforms in the world for the presentation of advances in algebraic and enumerative combinatorics. They attract top mathematicians from all over the world and offer young mathematicians a unique opportunity to interact closely with them. Plenary lectures are given by prominent researchers and contributed talks and posters are carefully selected by a program committee based on extended abstract submissions of twelve pages in length. The National Science Foundation is acknowledged on the website as well as during remarks by conference organizers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe broader impact of this project is evident in the conferences commitment to vertical integration, diversity and inclusion, and interdisciplinarity. The National Science Foundation award served this mission by providing the funds for young researchers to attend this prestigious conference. This afforded them the opportunity to develop their professional preparation, exchange scientific ideas, and broaden their knowledge base. The extended abstracts selected for talks and posters will appear in a proceedings volume of the journal Seminaire Lotharingien de Combinatoire.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn July 1-15 of 2019, the thirty-first International Conference on Formal Power Series and Algebraic Combinatorics was held in Ljubljana, Slovenia.
