 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ocean biology plays an important role in the Earth's carbon cycle. While most of the organic material produced by phytoplankton in the sunlit surface waters of the oceans is eaten and recycled in the surface waters, a small amount sinks to the deep ocean in what is called the \"biological carbon pump.\" The biological pump is particularly hard to study in high latitude regions, which can be difficult to get to and challenging to work in. It is also particularly important to understand the biological pump in these parts of the ocean, where much of the world's deep ocean waters are formed. The export of carbon to deep waters can be estimated by carefully measuring the amount of excess oxygen left behind in surface waters. Oxygen in seawater can be measured very precisely using sensors deployed on moorings, floats, and gliders. These sensors can be deployed for years at a time, but their measurements must be carefully calibrated. In this project, investigators would use carefully calibrated oxygen sensors on gliders to, in turn, calibrate the oxygen sensors on a set of moorings in the high latitude North Atlantic Ocean, to study the biological carbon pump over a period of two years. The project would train several undergraduate students and a graduate student, and result in the development of educational laboratory materials that incorporate glider and mooring data from the project.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this proposal is to observationally constrain the annual magnitude and seasonal timing of the biological carbon pump (determined as annual net community production; ANCP) and its influence on air-sea carbon dioxide flux by using biogeochemical sensor measurements from the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) Irminger Sea Array. However, existing OOI oxygen sensor calibration suffers from both pre- and post-deployment drift, currently precluding the ability to calculate ANCP by oxygen mass balance. The investigators therefore propose to improve the accuracy and utility of OOI Irminger Sea oxygen measurements by deploying two gliders configured for air calibration of their oxygen sensors when surfacing between profiles. These air-calibrated gliders will be used to intercalibrate all 12 existing oxygen sensors on the Irminger Sea Array and produce a calibrated oxygen product incorporating data from all sensors, which will ensure sufficient accuracy to calculate ANCP. Both the annual magnitude and seasonal timing of ANCP, including upper ocean biological productivity and thermocline respiration, will be determined using an oxygen mass balance approach within a data- constrained 1D physical model. A suite of 1D model simulations including the inorganic carbon system, gas exchange, and ANCP determined from oxygen mass balance will be used, together with OOI carbon dioxide measurements, to diagnose influences of physical and biological drivers of air-sea carbon dioxide flux, improving both quantitative and mechanistic understanding of how the biological pump influences the carbon cycle.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
