Topics will include research addressing operational imperatives, challenges in observing and forecasting during the 2018 hurricane season, Joint Hurricane Testbed activities, and the Hurricane Forecast Improvement Program. A meeting of the Working Group for Hurricane and Winter Storms Operation and Research, which supports the annual update of the National Hurricane Operations Plan, will be a part of the forum. The forum is sponsored by the National Science Foundation, NOAA National Weather Service, and the Office of Naval Research.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nAt the TCORF/73rd IHC, representatives from Federal agencies and the academic research community will have the opportunity to discuss the latest research into tropical cyclone observing, forecasting, and warning such as:\r\n1. 2018 hurricane/typhoon season challenges and the opportunities for research that they offer.\r\n2. Research priorities of the operational centers.\r\n3. Observations and observing strategies.\r\n4. Tropical cyclone model development.\r\n5. Transitioning research to operations.\r\n6. Advances in tropical cyclone forecast and warning products and services.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThe workshop is important to the United States because it brings the academic research community together with Federal agencies, to prepare for the upcoming hurricane season and make improvements to the US's hurricane forecasting and warning program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
