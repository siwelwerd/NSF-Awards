 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop and investigate a model to support P-5 teachers in implementing interdisciplinary, computational thinking-integrated lessons. The strategy is to employ a model of professional development that was previously developed to support elementary teachers to integrate computational thinking into their teaching of school subjects. This study turns attention to the systemic support for broadening and sustaining this integration of computational thinking through development of a research practice partnership between the Citadel and Charleston Progressive Academy, an elementary school serving a historically marginalized urban community. The study analyzes how teachers develop expertise in integrating computational thinking activities and how the broader school system provides supports for realizing and sustaining this development. Ultimately, the findings serve as a foundation for design of scalable elementary teacher professional development and ongoing support for computational thinking integration.\r\n\r\nOver the two years of the project, at least 10 teachers will engage in reflective PD sessions held throughout the academic year and summer. In these, teachers will explore, co-design, and implement activities that integrate computational thinking into their existing content area standards and curricula. The computational thinking activities, which will include standards-based lesson plans and resources, offer both plugged and unplugged components, so that students and teachers have opportunities to understand the conceptual underpinnings of computational thinking with and without computers. Surrounding this effort is support from a broader set of stakeholders, including researchers and school administrators, that facilitate the project's efforts and provide formative feedback. Over the two years of this study, cycles of design and analysis are used to refine conjectures for the design of computational thinking lessons and related teacher professional development from this broader community's perspective. The study provides a set of empirically-tested design conjectures from which others can develop computational thinking lessons and professional development specifically tailored to other state, district, or school contexts. Research on this project is studying the trajectories of teacher learning, as they increase their ability to integrate computational thinking into their teaching of school subjects. In addition, analyses include investigations of the research-practice partnership itself, focusing on how this partnership works with school-based stakeholders to best support teachers toward its goals. This project is funded by the CS for All program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Specifically, we investigated how teachers&rsquo; learning about CT transformed over time and what CT infusion looks like across multiple content areas (ELA, math, science, social studies, and related arts). In this study, we built on the literature on learning trajectories (LTs) to propose a new construct, pedagogical content knowledge learning trajectories, in which the developmental progression describes shifts in teachers&rsquo; conceptualizations of a new practice. We identified two distinct and interrelated LTs as a mechanism for designing, investigating, and refining teacher CT learning experiences. In addition, we identify specific features of PD that support teachers&rsquo; abilities to integrate CT into their disciplinary teaching, as well as their abilities to unpack and support students&rsquo; development of CT. Findings from our study suggest that using LTs to guide the design of collaborative PD sessions can effectively shift teachers&rsquo; understandings of CT, as well as their abilities to understand and support students CT and content learning. For example, most of our teachers began the PD defining CT as the use of digital tools or coding, rather than underlying concepts that support problem-solving and sense-making. This is characteristic of Level 1, in which teachers hold misconceptions about CT and don&rsquo;t yet have the self-efficacy to teach CT-infused lessons. By the end of the project, many teachers had reached Level 4 (of 5) and were infusing CT into multiple aspects of teaching. This includes characteristics such as defining CT as problem-solving practices that connect to multiple disciplines and everyday life, connecting CT to disciplinary practice, infusion of CT into multiple areas of teaching, such as read-alouds and warm-ups, and long-range planning for CT infusion. Our work also provides insight into building researcher-practitioner partnerships that allow educators to co-develop new understandings of educational practices over time.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<span><span> </span></span><span>Over three years of teacher PD, this project directly impacted over 18 teachers and over 1,000 of students in their classrooms, resulting in 20 CT-integrated lessons. These collaboratively-designed CT kits and PD allowed teachers to effectively integrate computing into their classrooms and the synergistic elements of this PD model built a community necessary to make the integration successful, sustainable, and scalable. Teachers have continued to use the lessons after the conclusion of the grant and several teachers will continue as teacher leaders in a new CT-infusion NSF grant.
