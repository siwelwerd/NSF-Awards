 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will combine high-resolution experiments with recent advances in mathematical information theory to describe the propagation of shear waves in human tissue and simulants, laying the foundation for development of novel medical diagnostic equipment and a better understanding of injuries such as concussion. Wave propagation through biological tissue is a fundamental physical process upon which numerous diagnostic and therapeutic techniques are based. Well-established diagnostic techniques include ultrasound imaging based upon high-frequency sound waves or magnetic resonance imaging based upon radio waves. A new window to investigate biological tissue is the use of mechanical shear waves that travel faster through stiff tissue and slower through soft tissue. By use of shear waves it is possible to effectively carry out palpation of internal organs otherwise accessible only by surgery. However, the propagation of shear waves in biological tissue is not well understood due to the large variability in wave velocity through different tissue types, much larger than that of sound waves. This can lead to counterintuitive effects such as formation of a concussion far from the immediate area of a head blow due to focusing of shear waves reflected by the cranium. Conversely, the large variability in shear wave velocity can be leveraged to carry out detailed investigations of biological tissue outside the capabilities of other diagnostic techniques. To enable such diagnostics there is a need to obtain a fundamental understanding of the relationship between tissue structure and shear wave propagation, as investigated in this project. Project activities include mentoring of graduate student and postdoctoral participants, integration of research results into data-driven modeling courses for undergraduates, as well as presentation of information theory to the general public through outreach activities at the Morehead Planetarium and University of North Carolina Science Days.\r\n\r\nStrain-stiffening, probably due to microscopic reorganization of filamentary structures in cells and the extracellular matrix, leads to the formation of shear shock waves induced by excitation amplitudes as low as 1% strain. The subsequent wavefront steepening can readily surpass 7% strain leading to tissue injury. The shear modulus can vary by five orders of magnitude in different tissue types and is close to zero in liquid-filled interstitia that exhibit random placement in organs such as the brain. Bulk-homogenized viscoelastic models with a discrete spectrum are inapplicable outside their calibration domain and are not linked by physical principles to the specific tissue.  This study pursues a combined experimental-theoretical approach to development of scale-dependent homogenized models of shear wave propagation in highly heterogeneous biological tissue. High-resolution, 1024 channel measurements at 10 kHz and 1 micrometer resolution are used to construct detailed images of shear wave propagation through biological tissue and phantoms. A multiple-scale computational model is constructed that uses information-theoretic concepts such as mutual information to link the different simulation levels, offering a new perspective on and development of traditional adaptive mesh and model refinement. Results from this investigation will be generally applicable to nonlinear, multiscale stochastic systems that do not exhibit scale separation. Both experimental results and computational code will be available through literate programming and reproducible research practices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Joint experimental and theoretical work combined ultrasound imaging with computational simulation of shear wave propagation in biological tissue. While the biomechanics of compressional wave propagation is well understood and the basis of widely applied imaging and diagnostic techniques, the physics of shear wave propagation are remarkably different. The wave velocity is much lower, roughly 2 meters per second (m/s) for shear waves versus 1500 m/s for compressional waves. Local tissue displacement velocities produced by a concussion can readily exceed the shear wave speed and this leads to the formation of shocks, analogous to supersonic booms. Dissipation within biological tissue rapidly attenuates the shocks, but strong local increases in stress can occur and are hypothesized to be the cause of tissue damage, as in the case of mild traumatic brain injury. Project outcome highlights follow.</p>\n<p><strong>Increased accuracy of ultrasound imaging of shear waves</strong>. Experimental investigation was carried out by development of custom ultrasound imaging sequences and custom ultrasound tracking methods to measure the high strain rate deformation associated with shear shocks. This allowed tracking of displacements with a spatial accuracy of 0.05 &mu;m in the wave propagation direction and 0.15 &mu;m in the perpendicular directions, both with a temporal accuracy of 1 ms (Image 3).</p>\n<p><strong>Shock-capturing computational model for heterogeneous media</strong>. For theoretical understanding of shear wave propagation in tissue, a novel shock-capturing computational method was developed for general hyperelastic models of the tissue mechanics and combined with linear viscous dissipation. Such hyperelastic models can describe the nonlinear relation between tissue deformation and ensuing stress, while accounting for tissue heterogeneity as encountered in the brain (Image 2). Experimental calibration was carried out on homogeneous biomimetic gels to extract linear and elastic moduli at both high strains and high strain rates for a number of hyperelastic models. The capability of each hyperelastic model to describe wave propagation through heterogeneous gels was subsequently tested. Experimental measurements from layered gels and gels with random inclusions were compared to computational simulation.</p>\n<p><strong>Three-dimensional aspect of shear waves</strong>. While published results had assumed that polar shear waves remain polarized during propagation, this project found that they develop into non-polarized shear shocks, demonstrated both experimentally and theoretically (Figure 5). If shear waves remain polarized, two-dimensional propagation models would be sufficient. A significant outcome of this project is the necessity of a three-dimensional approach for accurate tissue damage prediction.</p>\n<p><strong>Calibrated hyperviscoelastic model for homogeneous brain tissue</strong>. A third-order hyperelastic model was found to provide sufficient accuracy for assessment of local stress, and then subsequently applied to the study of shear wave propagation in the heterogeneous brain, with region-specific hyperelastic models. highlighting the role of material heterogeneity in focusing shear strain (Image 4).</p>\n<p><strong>Fiber-reinforced model of brain tissue</strong>. The low wave speed and ensuing larger wavelength implies that ultrasound imaging of shear wave propagation is determined by structure at the scale of 0.1 to 10 centimeters, and thus characterizes the fiber networks that determine tissue mechanics. The project found that experimentally identified tissue damage location correlates better with computational models that include models of the extracellular and neuronal fibers rather than with homogenized models.</p>\n<p><strong>Diffuse axonal injury computational prediction correlates with experimental data.</strong> In addition to obvious hemorrhaging due to trauma, mild trauma is thought to cause degradation of brain function associated with neuron damage, a condition known as diffuse axonal injury. The possibility of predicting such injury was investigated in an ancillary project by experimental excitation of the porcine brain followed by excision and histology analysis (Image 1, Left). A 3D computational model combined homogenized tissue models at the macro-scales with a fiber reinforced model at the meso-scale and microscopic models of axon fracture. Communication between the levels was carried out by mesh refinement and information transfer to account for random medium properties. Computational modeling of the mechanical degradation of neuron axons induced by local shear wave focusing was found to correlate with experimental tissue excitation and subsequent histology in the porcine brain (Image 1. Right, white region at one time which changes position at subsequent times).</p>\n<p><strong>Broader impacts</strong>. The experimental techniques developed in this project have been extended to ancillary work, and the computational models have been incorporated into public domain code to benefit the larger research community. Four graduate students and one post-doctoral researcher received specialized training during the project.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/02/2023<br>\nModified by: Sorin&nbsp;Mitran</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1903174/1903174_10603529_1701464391766_Fig2_brain_segmentation_image--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1903174/1903174_10603529_1701464391766_Fig2_brain_segmentation_image--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Brain segmentation\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1903174/1903174_10603529_1701464391766_Fig2_brain_segmentation_image--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Brain segmentation\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(Left) MRI tomography of human brain cross section.
