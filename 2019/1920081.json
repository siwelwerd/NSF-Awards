 "awd_abstract_narration": "The process by which trauma experienced by one generation impacts the environment and biology of subsequent generations is referred to as \"transgenerational transmission.\" This doctoral research project will examine how maternal and grandmaternal experiences of trauma impact the epigenetic DNA methylation profile of grandchildren, within a population that has experienced highly adverse social and environmental conditions. The project will advance knowledge about human biology and interactions between biology, culture and environment. Project outcomes may inform public health research and interventions for at-risk communities. The project will also support student training in a STEM field, and the research will be shared with local partners in education and health, as well as research and practice communities in early childhood development nationally and internationally. Resulting data will allow other researchers to validate or replicate findings in the growing research area of biological embedding and toxic stress. \r\n\r\nIn recent decades, researchers have begun to investigate mechanisms that may help to explain the greater rates of psychological distress and chronic disease seen in children within populations that have experienced extreme stress and adversity. The present research will use questionnaire, hormone, and DNA methylation data to examine how maternal and grandmaternal experiences of trauma - especially those that occurred while the mother or child was in utero - impact child genetic expression and regulation of the stress response. Community-engaged research in this context provides a unique opportunity to study the transgenerational epigenetic transmission of trauma-related changes to the stress response and to learn about the risk and resilience factors that shape child development in the wake of war.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

I used a biocultural anthropological lens to analyze the different ways trauma is experienced, its impacts on the body, and ways it can affect future generations. I focused especially on the emergent science of social epigenetics: the study of how environmental changes related to psychosocial stress can molecularly alter the ways our genes are expressed. The dissertation contains three separate studies or papers.&nbsp; In the first paper, I created a biocultural conceptual model for understanding how trauma experienced by a parent (or grandparent) prior to conception can result in epigenetic changes in subsequent generations (see Figure 1). I then conducted a systematic review of the published literature examining pre-conception trauma and offspring epigenetic changes; I found little consistent evidence for an epigenetic signature of trauma experienced prior to conception. I conclude with suggestions for attention to the inheritance of social adversity in epigenetic studies of intergenerational trauma.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the second paper, I conducted 12 months of tri-generational (child-mother-grandmother) ethnographic research in a population highly affected by intergenerational trauma&mdash; a community of former refugees of the Guatemalan Civil War who repatriated to northwestern Guatemala in 1994. I lived in the community, conducted focus groups (4), key informant interviews (13), and semi-structured tri-generational interviews with grandmother-daughter-grandchild triads (28).&nbsp; I found high rates of trauma exposure and depression and anxiety symptoms in both grandmothers who survived the conflict and their daughters growing up in the wake of trauma (see Table 1). Qualitative analysis revealed key themes of war and trauma-related disruptions to family formation, women&rsquo;s tactics to bargain for more equal power relations with their partners, and the importance of nurturing care, empathy, and mutual understanding between parents and children.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the third paper, I analyzed existing data from the CANDLE study, a population-representative birth cohort from Shelby County, TN, one of the most racially segregated and socioeconomically unequal counties in the United States. I investigated the relationship between racial residential segregation, racial income inequality, maternal life course trauma, and placental epigenetic aging with the goal of integrating social and structural factors (rather than just individual experiences) in a study of intergenerational trauma and epigenetic changes. I found no relationships between either racial segregation, racial income inequality or life course stress and placental epigenetic aging. However, the relationship between residential segregation and racial income inequality and risk of trauma exposure differed between Black and white women. Whereas increased residential segregation, income, and racial income inequality are associated with less trauma exposure in white women, none of these predictors are associated with trauma exposure in Black women (See Figure 2). I discussed different interpretations of this finding, suggesting that studies that control for socioeconomic status and &lsquo;race&rsquo; may unintentionally mask the ways that the social advantages experienced by white families with greater income, education, and residence in white neighborhoods may not equally benefit Black families. In studies examining epigenetic risk, I argued that controlling for race and socio-economic status may result in the appearance of Black biological differences that are in fact due to unmeasured psychosocial and structural stressors. I concluded the dissertation with a chapter critically evaluating the logics that biosocial scientists and social epigeneticists like myself use to rationalize our work and suggested pathways for a more equitable anthropological epigenetics of the future.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This dissertation has resulted in broader impacts for the scientific community and for the public. I have given four peer-reviewed conference presentations on the findings from my dissertation as well two invited workshop presentations. In addition to these scholarly activities, I have also given three public presentations on how researchers can integrate community engaged research practices in health equity research with marginalized populations. The studies in my dissertation are currently being prepared as separate manuscripts for publication in peer-reviewed journals, and my completed dissertation is publicly available in the Emory Theses and Dissertations Repository. At Emory, I trained and mentored an undergraduate research assistant who assisted with the systematic review. My research also contributed broader impacts to the communities I worked with. I trained and mentored a community liaison/research coordinator during my fieldwork in Guatemala as well as provided research methods training to local healthcare workers and other community members. During fieldwork, I gave multiple presentations and training about the impact of trauma on mental health and child development to community midwives, nurses, health promoters, and interested community&nbsp; members. Finally, following the completion of my dissertation, I returned to the community to disseminate findings and receive feedback. I am currently working with a local NGO to help translate findings into growing local capacity to support families vulnerable to structural and interpersonal violence.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/29/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Luisa&nbsp;Rivera</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1920081/1920081_10639664_1675021861880_Figure1fromPaper1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1920081/1920081_10639664_1675021861880_Figure1fromPaper1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1920081/1920081_10639664_1675021861880_Figure1fromPaper1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Conceptual model of biological pathways by which preconception trauma may be transmitted</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Luisa Rivera</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Luisa&nbsp;Rivera</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1920081/1920081_10639664_1675022221623_Table1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1920081/1920081_10639664_1675022221623_Table1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Table 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1920081/1920081_10639664_1675022221623_Table1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Table 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Descriptive statistics of demographics, mental health symptoms, and trauma exposure in survivors and descendants of the Guatemalan Civil War</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Luisa Rivera</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Luisa&nbsp;Rivera</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Table 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1920081/1920081_10639664_1675022335923_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1920081/1920081_10639664_1675022335923_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1920081/1920081_10639664_1675022335923_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Correlations between demographics, structural racism, life-course stressors, and placental epigenetic aging in the CANDLE cohort</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Luisa Rivera</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Luisa&nbsp;Rivera</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
