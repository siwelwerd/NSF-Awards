 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded from the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites program in the SBE Directorate. The content and structure of this particular REU provides both scientific and societal benefits in addition to integrating education and research. Specifically, our society can benefit from a better understanding of PTSD since the lifetime prevalence of PTSD among adult Americans is relatively high, estimated at 6.8%. Our program's focus is on training undergraduates to conduct trauma-related research to improve our understanding of PTSD. This REU site broadens the participation of under-represented groups by recruiting veterans (particularly minorities and women, when possible) as participants. This inclusion of veterans provides an opportunity for them to integrate to an undergraduate research culture in a safe environment with appropriate supports. Moreover, veteran participation in the design and implementation of trauma-related research with fellow veterans constitutes a novel application of \"participatory research\". Beyond the direct benefit to veteran participants, non-veteran participants appreciate the value of conducting trauma-related research with direct input from members of the defined population.\r\n\r\nThis REU site is a joint effort between Syracuse University, SUNY Oswego, and SUNY Upstate Medical University and constitutes a well-structured program for a cohort of 8-10 students each year. The site offers an online 2-week orientation as well as research mentoring and coursework during a 6-week summer institute by highly qualified and productive faculty members that have a track record of involving undergraduates in their research. In addition to these faculty mentors, several consultants from various military and non-military backgrounds provide a novel combination of perspectives to address multidisciplinary research questions as part of a speaker series. The program draws on resources including seminar rooms, laboratories, and housing through Syracuse University, SUNY Upstate Medical Center, and SUNY Oswego. With respect to impact on program participants, we expect to increase students' ability to conduct trauma research and increase their chances of admission into graduate school. With respect to scientific merit, multiple projects involve students and address important research questions. Current interests include research designed to gain a better understanding of the chemical, clinical, cognitive, and family factors associated with various trauma outcomes. Being able to better predict the development of PTSD following trauma can support efforts at prevention and treatment of PTSD.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

To offer historical context for this REU site, our original intent was to provide training and mentoring on trauma-related research exclusively to student military Veterans. However, with NSF approval and support, we chose to admit non-Veterans in Year 01 out of a need to fill open student slots in our program (i.e., 3 of 10 slots were filled with non-Veteran applicants). A serendipitous finding emerged from this first year in that we discovered that a mix of Veterans and non-Veterans became a clear strength of the program. We found that Veterans were able to develop a sense of belonging to a ?traditional? college group and were appreciated for their unique expertise on a research topic for which they had first-hand knowledge. In addition, non- Veteran undergraduates developed a sense of appreciation for the need to develop applied research in collaboration with those who were ?on the ground?. Thus, for 10 years, our program recruited and engaged a purposeful mix of 100+ student Veterans and non-Veterans. The REU included a 2-week online virtual preparatory phase and 6-week immersive summer program held on Syracuse University?s main campus, followed by continued mentorship and support on student research projects. Our REU used a biopsychosocial framework for understanding trauma and PTSD as both a psychological condition that alters cognitions, emotions, and behaviors and also a condition that alters neurobiology and physiology. This REU also explored the impact of intersectionality on PTSD (i.e., the effects of gender, ability/disability, ethnicity, and racial identity on coping, resiliency and PTSD symptoms) in Veterans. In addition to providing an interdisciplinary overview on trauma and PTSD, the intensive summer experience also covered basic and advanced training in ethics and the responsible conduct of research, research methods and statistical analyses, laboratory demonstrations, an invited speaker series, discussions on diversity, equity and inclusion in STEM, community outreach and education, workshops for graduate school admission preparation and professional development, and team-building activities (e.g., a tour of the National Veterans Resource Center housed at SU, baseball games, ropes course). Each student also developed a focal research project through mentorship from REU faculty. Following the summer program, mentors and students would continue to work on projects together which culminated with presentations at regional and national conferences and publication of findings.
