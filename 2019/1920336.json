 "awd_abstract_narration": "An Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer and UV Excimer Laser for Geology at Boise State University\r\n\r\nThe Department of Geosciences at Boise State University will acquire a state-of-the-art ultraviolet laser probe and an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. This acquisition will enable new and innovative methodologies of trace element and isotopic analysis of Earth materials. The requested instrumentation is an integral component of the Boise State University Isotope Geology Laboratory for research projects in Earth Sciences. The new lab will work with partners including the Boise State University Office of STEM and Diversity Initiatives, and hundreds of collaborators to broaden the participation of women and minorities and persons with disabilities in science.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Geosciences at Boise State University will acquire a state-of-the-art ultraviolet (UV) excimer laser probe with a high-sensitivity, fast-washout, two-volume ablation cell, fully integrated with a turn-key, fast-scanning, high-sensitivity, large dynamic range, quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (LA-ICPMS). This acquisition will leverage an existing laboratory infrastructure, human resources, and a decade of LA-ICPMS experience by the PIs into new and innovative methodologies of trace element and isotopic analysis of Earth materials, including applications to magmatic systems, metamorphism and tectonics, and paleoclimatic, paleobiological, and sediment provenance proxy records of Earth systems dynamics. The requested instrumentation is an integral component of innovative tandem in situ and isotope dilution analytical workflows that the Boise State University Isotope Geology Laboratory applies to the full spectrum of geochronological and petrochronological problems in Earth sciences. The new facility will:  Foster the next generation of geochronology-expert Earth systems scientists by mentoring visiting scientists and students who will receive knowledge and training in analytical techniques that are exported to other labs and institutions over time;  Promote cross-disciplinary training for non-specialists on the role of laser ablation geochronology through the week-long IsoAstro summer workshop;  Engage a network of partners including on-campus NSF S-STEM scholarship programs, the Boise State University Office of STEM and Diversity Initiatives, and a broad base of hundreds of previous and current collaborators including the NSF AGeS2 graduate research award program, to broaden the participation of women and traditionally underrepresented minorities and persons with disabilities in the LA-ICPMS laboratory.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
