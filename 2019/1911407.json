Preference will be given to supporting students and postdoc participants. The symposium will feature invited talks from 20 leading scientists. The aim of the symposium will be to discuss recent progress in superconductivity, discuss new ideas, determine future research directions, and enable future collaborations among the participants. As a product of the symposium, the organizers will produce a report on the current status and future prospects for the field, summarizing key points of the presentations and the relation to NSF big ideas, such as Harnessing the Data Revolution and Quantum Leap.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
