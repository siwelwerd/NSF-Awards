 "awd_abstract_narration": "All modern nations are completely dependent upon the special mechanical and electrical properties of metals. Iron and aluminum are abundant and widely distributed, but major deposits of many other critically important metals are scarce, so these must be obtained by international trade. The southern third of the African continent is unusually rich in the rarer metals. It has the world's largest reserves of platinum, cobalt, copper and manganese, and has historically produced more gold than any other region.  Mining and metallurgy now account for a major proportion of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of most nations in central and southern Africa, but few know that mining in this region began long ago.  Iron and copper have been mined and smelted here since at least 200 AD, and gold since at least 1200 AD.  Copper objects are often found in archaeological sites far from any potential source of copper. Few citizens of southern and central African are aware of the extent of precolonial mining, or of trade in copper in this region.  The anticipated results of this project on ancient copper mining and trade will likely be widely covered in African print and electronic news media, and will be incorporated into educational materials for African schools and universities. \r\n\r\nThe research funded by this award will study the circulation of copper within southern Africa between 200 CE to about 1700 CE. Dr. David Killick and graduate student Jay Stephens will collaborate with archaeologists in southern Africa, and with geochemists at the University of Arizona, to reconstruct long-distance movements of copper in prehistoric times by matching the lead isotope ratios of copper objects to those from ore deposits throughout the region.  This research will provide a novel way to study some key issues in the archaeology of southern Africa.  These include: tracing the routes taken by the earliest metal-using peoples (the Bantu migration) into South Africa; establishing when mining of specific copper deposits began; documenting trade links between the major prehistoric states in the region; and providing a new way to look at the changes that occurred in these trading systems after Europeans settled in the region, from the early sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Iron and copper were mined and smelted in southern Africa from around 300 AD, and tin and gold from around 1200 AD. This research project focused on the precolonial exploitation of copper and tin. Figure 1 shows locations of major precolonial copper mines (those dug before 1900). Most of these old mines were destroyed by modern open-pit mining over the last century, but we are able to&nbsp;indirectly&nbsp;reconstruct their histories of use. Copper was widely valued in southern Africa for jewelry, and copper ingots (Figure 2) were widely traded.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We used the ratios of lead isotopes in copper artefacts from dated archaeological sites to infer the geological source of the copper. We did this by measuring the isotopic ratios of 336 copper artefacts, using mass spectrometry, and comparing them to a datebase of 761 isotopic ratios of copper minerals from ore deposits throughout southern Africa. We also measured the chemical composition of all copper artifacts; variation in the ratios of certain trace elements may provide supporting evidence for the geological source of the copper.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One portion of our study was to analyse 27 of the 76 X-shaped (croisette) ingots (e.g. Figure 2) found throughout present Zimbabwe, and now stored in the Museum of Human Sciences (Harare). We found that 26 of 27 derive from ore deposits in the Central African Copperbelt (Figure 3), with 15 of these deriving from a single deposit (Kipushi mine). These ingots had been transported between 650 and 1200 km to their find spots in Zimbabwe.</p>\n<p>Other copper ore deposits that have distinctive isotopic signatures include the Magondi Belt of northern Zimbabwe, the Limpopo Belt along the border of Zimbabwe, South Africa and Botswana, and the Phalaborwa mine near the border of South Africa and Mozambique. All are shown in Figure 3.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Although southern Africa has many sources of tin, there is currently no archaeological evidence for this metal, or for bronze (the alloy of tin and copper) before about 1200 AD. Gold also first appears in archaeological sites around this time, and was adopted by the royalty of the Mapungubwe state (1220-1300 AD) and after 1300 by the states of the Zimbabwean plateau (Great Zimbabwe, Butua, Torwa, Mutapa). &nbsp;Bronzes with 5-10% tin have a golden color, so we think that the rapid adoption of bronze was because of its resemblance to gold.</p>\n<p>We were suprised to find that 152 of the 336 \"copper\" objects that we analyzed are bronzes. Only one precolonial tin-mining district is known from southern Africa; this is the Rooiberg mining district 120 km NW of Pretoria, South Africa. The bronzes discovered to date are widely distribured in northern South Africa, eastern Botswana and throughout Zimbabwe. There are no tin sources in Botswana, but there are several pegmatite tin deposits in Zimbabwe (Figure 4).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We investigated whether the Zimbabwean tin deposits were exploited by combining lead isotope analyses and tin isotope analyses. Southern African tin sources are very old (Figure 4), and the tin produced from them may contain more lead than the copper with which it was mixed. In these cases lead isotope ratios point to the tin source. &nbsp;In cases where the lead isotope data was equivocal, we turned to tin isotopes. Tin isotope ratios of the tin mineral cassiterite from Zimbabwean pegmatites are quite distinct from those of cassiterite from Rooiberg. &nbsp;On present evidence all sampled bronzes seem to have used Rooiberg tin.</p>\n<p>We are most grateful to the Museum of Human Sciences in Zimbabwe, the National Museum of Botswana, the Livingstone Museum (Zambia) and the South African Heritage Resources Authority for permission to sample archaeological materials. Dr. Ryan Mathur (Juniata College) and Dr. Wayne Powell (Brooklyn College) provided the tin isotope analyses. Lead isotopic and chemical analyses were carried out by Jay Stephens, who was award his PhD degree by the University of Arizona in 2022 for part of his work on this project.
