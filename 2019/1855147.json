 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the RET site in the College of Technology at University of Houston (UH), a Hispanic Serving Institution, is to provide opportunities for high school STEM teachers to engage in innovative engineering design and manufacturing research, as well as develop advanced high school STEM curriculum modules. The 83rd Texas Legislature established the new Foundation High School Program, House Bill 5, as the default high school graduation program for all students entering high school beginning in 2014-2015. House Bill 5 requires enhanced STEM contents in high school curriculum as part of the graduate requirement. However, many high school teachers have not received sufficient training to prepare the new STEM modules. Texas Region IV covers the Houston Metropolitan area. It serves 48 school districts with 1.2 million students (23% of all Texas students) and 97,000 teachers. The RET site will be a timely opportunity to recruit high school teachers to gain experience in design and manufacturing and develop course modules.\r\n\r\nThe RET site will form a strong partnership between UH, Education Service Center for Region IV (ESC4), school districts, and local industries on advanced high school engineering education. The RET site program consists of professional development activities in a six weeks summer program on campus and extensive follow-up plans in the following academic year. The site will 1) recruit a total of 36 (12 per year) high school teachers with diverse backgrounds for three years to engage in advanced engineering design and manufacturing research; 2) develop and implement an innovative curriculum by translating cutting-edge research in advanced design and manufacturing from UH into high school classrooms, and meeting Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) standards and NGSS standards; and 3) provide interdisciplinary and hands-on experience to stimulate the interest of teachers and students in STEM. In Houston Independent School District (HISD), the minority population is 85.86%, and 74.93% of students are economically disadvantaged. This RET Site will place emphasis on recruitment from underrepresented groups including women, minorities, and persons with disabilities. Academic-year follow-up includes course module discussion and feedback, school visits, and conferences. The research experience by the participants will be disseminated to fellow teachers through conferences, teachengineering.org, RET website, and other channels.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We also share the activities through social media including Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/groups/786253845422707) and LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12540469/).</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit.</strong> Three cohorts of 39 teachers participated in lab research in advanced design and manufacturing research and translated the experience into high school curriculum. Each teacher assembled one 3D printer and incorporated it into their course module (if applicable) or shared it with colleagues. All teachers attended research workshops to get more exposure to engineering fundamentals and state-of-the-art research. One teacher was selected to participate in NSF EEC Grantee Conference 2022 and presented a poster. Another teacher has been nominated to participate in NSF EEC Grantee Conference 2024. Mentors visited participants&rsquo; high schools and strengthened the collaboration which in turn will help future RET site. Based on the literature review and experience from RET site, a novel survey tool was developed to assess the impact of the RET site on teachers&rsquo; efficacy. This survey is shared through a paper published in ASEE 2023 conference. To improve the course module quality, our team collaborated with the TeachEngineering.org staff to provide strengthened support to teachers and improved the success rate. About 12 teachers&rsquo; course modules have been accepted by TeachEngineering.org. This result is shared through a paper published in ASEE 2024 conference.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts.</strong> These teachers represent 30 high schools in 11 ISDs in the Houston area. 38.5% of them are female and 34.5% are racial and ethnic minorities. On average, 85.7% of their students are racial and ethnic minorities and 73.7% are on free lunch program. The site achieved the goal of having a balance of participants who teach various STEM subjects, including: biology, chemistry, math, physics, and CTE. The teachers visited 10 local companies to observe real world engineering. Later, some teachers took their own students to visit these companies. These teachers help send their students to UH open house for university student recruitment. 12+ graduate students, 6 REU students with supplemental funding, and 6+ other undergraduate assistants were involved in the summer activities. Three papers have been published at ASEE annual conferences.
