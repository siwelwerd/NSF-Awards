 "awd_abstract_narration": "One goal drives everything we do at Ursinus College--to change lives and foster growth in a way that our students never thought possible.  To accomplish this goal for our REU scholars, the Ursinus REU site features three key components: i) important and accessible math and computer science research problems, ii) an Individual Development Plan (IDP), and iii) our commitment to serving underrepresented students. Participants will be a member of one of three research teams each consisting of three members and each led by a senior faculty.  Each team works on an original research project, chosen both for its importance and for its accessibility to undergraduate students.  Some projects continue for two years, while others are done in a single year to allow for more diverse topics and to expose REU scholars to new faculty. In addition to working on projects, we are intentional about fostering students' growth in their mathematical maturity and in their professionalism.  We will track student progress though the IDP. This plan assesses over the eight-week REU both the hard and soft skills needed for success in careers in the mathematical sciences. From \"ability to work in a team\" to \"mathematical knowledge,\" the IDP will help students to improve in their weak areas and challenge students to develop their strengths further. The IDP sets measurable goals and monitors progress before, during, and after the eight-week program on campus.  Finally, we commit in the REU program to including and giving opportunities to underrepresented students. The PI team will advertise to and recruit from schools local to the area, such as Community College of Philadelphia, with large populations of underrepresented students.  We will also advertise through professional organizations, such as NAM and Math Alliance. All Senior Personnel have a history of working with and mentoring underrepresented students, and they desire to continue to do so during the REU.\r\n\r\nThe REU research projects cover a diverse range of topics reflecting the expertise of the Senior Personnel. The REU will feature topology projects in both discrete Morse theory and computational topology with applications to music analysis, video analysis, and computer graphics. Our algebra projects explore partition identities, tame filling functions, and rainbow colorings. Another set of projects involves machine learning, with a focus on incremental language processing. Students of linear algebra have the opportunity to study everywhere surjective functions. In addition to their core research projects, students will be trained in mathematical writing and in presentation techniques through a series of weekly workshops designed to foster these essential communication skills.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The program supported 30 students from various colleges and universities across the United States, many of which having little to no research opportunities for undergraduates. Students were grouped into three teams of three REU students in summer 2021, 2022, and four teams of three students in summer 2023 working on 10 separate projects in total. Each summer the REU followed a structured schedule, with more structure and improvements made each year based on learnings from the previous year. The program ran each year concurrently with Summer Fellows, an Ursinus in-house REU-like program with around 80 students for summer research on Ursinus&rsquo;s campus. Students were fully integrated into the Ursinus Summer Fellows program. This included presenting to the Ursinus community at the beginning and end of the program, providing lunch, and participating in the Ursinus speaker series. In addition to being part of the larger Ursinus community, students were part of a variety of REU-specific activities. The entire group met every Monday morning to discuss the plans for the week and share any announcements. The program featured several workshops each week aimed at professional development. Students were given opportunities to develop their presentation skills by giving a short presentation on their week's research to the REU group every other Friday.
