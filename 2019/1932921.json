 "awd_abstract_narration": "Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) technologies have garnered huge interest across private industry, academia, government, and the public. A wide range of benefits are predicted when these ground-breaking technologies become mature, including higher road efficiency, improved safety, and better energy consumption and emissions. However, these benefits will be open to question until the technologies sufficiently mature. Specifically, a major uncertainty in benefits lies in mixed traffic of CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), where interactions between them remain largely unknown. Therefore, in the foreseeable future, traffic will likely be mixed with multiple classes of CAVs and HDVs. This project will aim to better understand the anticipated behavior of this mixed traffic system, and its impact on traffic in order to help fully utilize the potentials of the CAV technology. The results will guide the development of traffic management strategies, policies, and long-term planning for the future transportation system. This project will also engage in a range of integrated research, educational and outreach activities that will extend the knowledge obtained from this research to a broader audience, including developing simulation-based educational modules, organizing workshops, sharing simulation platform for mixed traffic, and engaging undergraduate and graduate students, particularly underrepresented groups, in the research and education.\r\n\r\nThis research aims to understand how HDVs and different classes of CAVs will interact under traffic disturbances that cause (momentary) reductions in speed and affect traffic flow performance. Specifically, this project will aim to (1) characterize discernable differences in the car-following behavior of HDVs and CAVs of different classes under disturbances; and (2) elucidate their effects on traffic flow throughput and traffic flow stability. To this end, this research will develop a systematic method to bring together different control modeling paradigms for CAVs into a unifying framework to unveil their individual and collective impacts on traffic flow throughput and stability. Three CAV control paradigms will be considered in this study: linear control, model predictive control (MPC), and artificial-intelligence-based control. The vehicle-level investigation of complex interactions among CAVs and HDVs will unveil the interaction mechanisms and elucidate how they scale up to the collective behavior of traffic stream, which will inspire new modeling paradigms to describe mixed traffic flow dynamics and control CAVs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

A wide range of benefits are predicted when these ground-breaking technologies become mature.  Today, more and more Automated Vehicles (AVs) at lower automation levels have entered the road.  Additionally, development of higher automation level AVs, like self-driving cars, has made significant progress.  As the technology evolves, it\u2019s very likely that in the near to mid-term, the road will have mixed traffic, consisting of different classes of CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs).  Given that, the benefits of CAVs will remain uncertain until we carefully study the mixed traffic and provide solid evidence.  This project aims to better understand the mixed traffic and develop strategies to improve the stability and system throughput. \n\nIn the project, we have examined the car-following (CF) behaviors of CAV behaviors resulting from three control paradigms, (1) linear controller, (2) model predictive control, and (3) reinforcement learning.  We have developed a general framework to unify these various control paradigms by focusing on the tactical level behaviors, i.e., the CF behaviors.   The proposed framework is able to reveal the control mechanisms and their manifestation in the physical CF behavior, particularly their response to traffic disturbances. We also developed a model to predict the CF behaviors out of the controller.  We have also investigated AVs that are controlled by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms.  We focused on a popular method, reinforcement learning, to understand what factors may affect the CF behaviors.  It was found that there exist many influential elements, including algorithm design, training method, and randomness.  It\u2019s not simply an exercise of parameter tunning, but that seems to be the misperception of many people.\n\nIn addition to the theoretical formulation, this project has studied the behaviors of Automated Vehicles (AVs) based on empirical data to understand their impacts on the traffic flow.  We have studied different types of AVs, including the commonly available Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) vehicles, which are at Level 1 and/or 2, and the Level 4 self-driving cars that are in the testing stage. We found that AVs, regardless of the automation level, show some similarities with HVs in showing a linear speed-spacing relationship.  But there is distinction.  Specifically, L4 AVs are more conservative than the human counter part (i.e., HDVs), which will result in reduction of roadway capacity by up to 20%.  While some ACC systems can have very high road capacity, much higher than HDVs.  We also found that existing car-following models developed for HDVs can well capture the AVs, though there are differences in the model parameters. \n\nThis project has studied the impacts of different types of CAVs on traffic disturbance.  We found that heterogeneous acceleration and CF behavior may create persistent voids and diminish traffic throughput.  CAVs can exacerbate the disturbances in the traffic. \n\nIf CAVs are properly used, they can help to improve traffic.  In this project, we have proposed three complementary strategies that leverage CAVs to mitigate the disturbances at merge bottleneck thus improve bottleneck throughput and traffic stability.  Strategy 1 is \"gap closure control\" at the individual vehicle level.  Strategy2, \"batch LC\", manages a platoon of vehicles, and Strategy 3, \"gap redistribution\", redistributes vehicles in a traffic stream.   We showed that, certain combinations, such as Strategy 2 and 3, can be very effective for improving bottleneck throughput. The analysis reveals insights on leveraging CAVs to develop traffic management strategies and/or policies and therefore improve system performance.\n\nThe results from the project provide important guidance on the development of traffic management strategies, policies, and long-term planning for the future transportation system.  It\u2019s important that the transportation community adopts the latest CAV models that are grounded on solid evidence to avoid misleading results.   Our results also provide important insight for the industry sector on the future CAV design. \n\nThis project resulted in 9 papers in the top journal in transportation, including one being nominated by a prestigious award.  7 of the papers were presented in global and national conferences, including the prestigious International Symposium on Transportation and Traffic Theory.  The project also has delivered three webinars. \n\nThis project has sponsored 3 PhD students and one master student, and three of them have graduated, with two graduates being female. \n\nLast but not the least, the results from this project have been incorporated into two graduate level courses and one undergraduate course. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/06/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Danjue Chen"
