 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve building energy efficiency. This technology enables conventional building enclosures to integrate biological techniques to promote building sustainability and improve air quality. The project is configured to maximize daylighting penetration, thereby reducing the artificial lighting load. The technology provides natural ventilation and removal of carbon dioxide from the air, which can reduce the operation of active ventilation equipment, improving air quality in the building. The project can provide effective insulation and the dynamic shading efficacy can minimize year-round energy transfer between outdoor and indoor spaces, thus reducing energy consumption by heating and air conditioning equipment. This technology can be applied and transferred to different building sectors in various building locations, such as commercial buildings, residential buildings, and industry facilities.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project integrates a photobioreactor within a building enclosure system that utilizes microalgae to use light energy to convert water and carbon dioxide into biomass by photosynthesis. The outcomes of this technology include production of both biomass and heat. The renewable fuel stocks (biomass or biofuel) generated by the system can offset building energy consumption, and the heat energy from the photobioreactor could be used to cover the heat demand of the building for space heating and hot water. The project could also be utilized as a cost effective on-site wastewater treatment system. The current prototype has two major components: 1) a photobioreactor integrated with a vision-glazed panel attached to metal frames, and 2) a microalgae-growing apparatus and mechanical system housed in metal frames. The photobioreactor is configured to encourage microalgae growth in a nutrient-rich liquid, while the vision-glazed panel allows daylighting.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
