 "awd_abstract_narration": "Today's fast-growing mobile device and online social media infrastructure is producing an unprecedented volume of data on \r\ncommunication, system and device-level interaction, and user behavior. Examples include cellphone data (including voice \r\ncalls, SMS and Internet data, cellular signal strength) and activity on online social media (itself often sent from mobile \r\ndevices). This presents both opportunities and challenges. On one hand, the increasing availability, high quality, and \r\nrelatively easy collection of such data provides a way to better understand online human activity, infer activity patterns, \r\nand design new services. On the other hand, the combination of big data and powerful inferential\r\n techniques pose both computational challenges and privacy concerns. In both cases, there is a need for efficient \r\nalgorithmic techniques that can support learning from mobile and social data sets, and that enable principled creation \r\nof synthetic data at similar scale for modeling, testing and anonymization purposes.  This project aims to address problems in the above space by framing them in terms that are traditionally the domain of the physical sciences.\r\n\r\nThis project is based on the core insight that many problems in the above space can be framed in terms of pairwise \r\ninteractions among spatially embedded entities,  traditionally the domain of N-body problems in the physical sciences. \r\nAs a consequence, revisiting and adapting N-body algorithms specifically to mobile and social data analysis and \r\nlearning  can increase our capacity to (i) work with such data at scale and (ii) do so in a privacy-preserving way.  \r\nThe methodological contributions will include novel N-body and parallel algorithms, specifically designed for \r\nprocessing hierarchical, and geospatially embedded, mobile and social data, where the size or access to datasets \r\nis prohibitive. In addition to the algorithmic design, this project will develop software modules (e.g.,  special purpose \r\ncompilers, crowdsourcing tools and generators of synthetic datasets) that implement these methods. The design will\r\nbe primarily applied to improve cellular network monitoring and control, mobile data privacy, and smart city applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAn important theme of this project was the leveraging of efficient multi-body algorithms to improve our ability to model spatial processes at scale.  Such processes include the networks of contacts through which information, culture, and diseases spread through human populations.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we employed our techniques to develop realistic models of SARS-CoV-2 diffusion at urban and regional scales, allowing us to directly account for the factors such as household structure, housing, and community layout in a detailed way.  Early in the pandemic, our models were the first to explain why even nearby communities could experience very different infection trajectories, and to show that large and persistent differences could emerge even without differences in individual behavior.  In subsequent work, we also showed that social cohesion acted as an accelerant for diffusion in the early pandemic, and that small differences in levels of cohesion between communities could help explain disparities in infection risk.  Our methodology allowed us to develop risk maps (see image), showing areas at higher or lower risk to an emerging infection due to factors such as housing density and household size.  This work not only provided insights into otherwise puzzling aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also led to strategies that can be used to help identify those likely to be at high risk for future disease outbreaks.  This work demonstrates the power of algorithmic research to impact real-world problems, by enabling modeling efforts that otherwise would not be possible.\n\nThe paper (L. J. Thomas, P. Huang, F.
