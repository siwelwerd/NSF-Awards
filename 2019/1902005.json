 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of the rational numbers and their generalizations (number fields) has occupied mathematicians for thousands of years, and today is the principal object of algebraic number theory.  In the past century, giant leaps of understanding have been made by exploring the deep analogy between number fields and and other number systems (called \"function fields in positive characteristic\") closely related to geometry.  The deep relationship between arithmetic and geometry allows the techniques, tools, and intuitions from one to be applied with great effect to the other, leading to new and important insights, results, and conjectures. The research of the PI will continue this tradition and push the analogy in new directions.\r\n\r\nThe project will develop a new analogue of Iwasawa theory for function fields by investigating the structure and growth of the p-divisible groups of the Jacobians associated to a pro-p branched Galois tower of curves over a finite field of characteristic p.  These p-divisible groups break up into three pieces: an etale part, a multiplicative part, and a local-local part. Using Dieudonne theory and its relation to p-adic cohomology, the PI expects to prove under very general hypotheses that the etale and multiplicative parts exhibit strikingly regular and predictable behavior in any such tower.  While the local-local piece can in many ways be as wild as the imagination allows, the PI nonetheless expects to uncover certain kinds of exceptionally regular behavior and to formulate new conjectures in the spirit of classical Iwasawa theory.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNumber theory&mdash;the oldest branch of mathematics&mdash;is rooted in the study of the whole numbers and their field of fractions, the rational numbers.  The ancient Greeks realized that many important problems lead to numbers which are not rational, like &radic;2.  Rather than studying these new numbers in isolation, mathematicians study the number fields they generate using the familiar laws of arithmetic. Modern number theory recognizes the rational numbers as the first of an infinitude of these number fields, whose systematic study began in earnest in the 19th century and is now the heart and soul of the subject.\n\nThe class group of a number field is a finite, abelian group encoding deep information about the arithmetic of the number field. For example, the fact that the class group of the rational numbers has order one is equivalent to the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (proved in Euclid\u2019s Elements) that every integer can be uniquely represented as a product of prime numbers. Since they were introduced by Gauss in his influential 1801 treatise, class groups have played a pivotal role in the development and trajectory of number theory. Their study dominated research in the 19th and early 20th centuries, reaching an apotheosis with the completion of Class Field Theory, widely held as one of the finest achievements of modern number theory. Yet class groups are notoriously elusive, with many fundamental questions and conjectures (even dating back to Gauss) still open.\n \nIn a landmark 1959 paper, Iwasawa studied the growth of class groups in certain infinite extensions of number fields.  Fixing a prime number p, Iwasawa studied p-adic extensions of number fields, and discovered an extraordinary formula for the exact power of p dividing the order of the class groups in these extensions.  Iwasawa\u2019s work spawned an entire subfield&mdash;called Iwasawa theory&mdash;which has become a central area of research, playing a pivotal role in the solutions of major problems in number theory, including the proof of Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem.\n \nIwasawa was inspired by a beautiful analogy between number fields and function fields over finite fields. Originating in the work of Gauss, Riemann, and Dedekind, this analogy has provided&mdash;in the words of Weil&mdash;a touchstone for\nnumber theorists over the centuries, underlying some of the most important work in the subject. In this analogy, a prime number p is fixed, and the ring of polynomials over a finite field of characteristic p plays the role of the integers,\nwith finite extensions of its quotient field&mdash;called function fields&mdash;replacing number fields.\n\n\nThe research supported by this grant pioneers an exciting new perspective in Iwasawa theory for function fields.  This perspective begins with an amazing geometric fact: each function field may be realized as the field of functions of a smooth projective curve, associated to which is an algebraic group&mdash;called the Jacobian&mdash;whose rational points recover the class group of the field!  This remarkable fact underlies the Geometric Class Field Theory for function fields pioneered by Rosenlicht and Serre in the 1950\u2019s.  It yields an identification of the p-primary component of the class group with the rational points of the p-divisible group of the Jacobian, which is an incredibly rich mathematical object of arithmetic and geometric significance.  The new perspective introduced and explored in the supported research is that Iwasawa theory of function fields should encompass the study of these p-divisible groups in p-adic extensions of function fields. \n \nEvery p-divisible group is comprised of three pieces: the &eacute;tale, multiplicative, and local-local parts.  In the paper Iwasawa Dieudonn&eacute; theory of function fields, the PI used Dieudonn&eacute; theory to construct and study the Iwasawa modules associated to each of these three types of p-divisible groups in arbitrary pro-p extensions of function fields, and proved that the &eacute;tale and multiplicative modules are always finitely generated over the Iwasawa algebra.  An analogue of Iwasawa's famous exact formula follows from this, which had previously been known only for p-adic extensions by work of Mazur and Wiles.  The PI proved that the Iwasawa Dieudonn&eacute; module associated to local-local p-divisible groups in p-adic extensions of function fields is never finitely generated when there is ramification, so entirely new methods are needed to understand these groups.  In the paper Iwasawa theory for p-torsion class group schemes in characteristic p, the PI and J. Booher investigated the growth of local-local p-divisible groups in p-adic extensions of the rational function field ramified only over infinity, and through extensive numerical computation, uncovered striking regularity and patterns.  Based on these observations, they made a series of conjectures which predict exactly how the Frobenius torsion subgroup schemes grow.  In an ongoing collaboration, J. Booher, J. Kramer-Miller, J. Upton, and the PI have proved many of these conjectures using a mixture of Dieudonn&eacute; theory and Dwork theory. \n\n\nTogether, these papers and ongoing investigations are pioneering new directions of research in Iwasawa theory of function fields.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/31/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bryden Cais"
