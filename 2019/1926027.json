 "awd_abstract_narration": "Landslides, rock falls, volcanic eruptions, rapid flows of mud, rock, and debris, snow avalanches, and sediment-laden floods are all deadly and costly natural hazards. They all also exemplify what are called natural granular flows. These events are hazardous in part due to their rapid and powerful nature, but also because models used to predict and mitigate their impacts remain imperfect. Seemingly simple questions still pose major challenges to scientists and engineers such as: How large will these events be? How far will they travel? What infrastructure is at risk? This project will investigate how granular flows interact with the things they flow over, with a particular focus on impact forces. The results will aid formulation of more accurate models of granular flow mobility and hazards. Outreach activities will be developed to highlight the excitement and utility of controlled laboratory experiments to study natural hazards. The investigators will develop these in collaboration with pedagogy experts, implement them in 4th-8th grade classrooms, and incorporate them into annual workshops for teachers and as interactive exploration stations at two science museums.  \r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of this project is to improve our understanding of the forces imparted by granular flows on their beds. This work is motivated by the hypothesis that many geomorphic processes and associated hazards are driven by the largest bed forces, rather than the mean force. The study will build on advances in granular mechanics and apply a novel blend of discrete element modeling, laboratory experiments, and field measurements to improve our understanding of the full distribution of bed forces. The results will be used to test hypotheses about the sensitivity of bed force distributions to macroscopic flow properties and grain-scale interactions. The findings will be integrated into widely used continuum flow models, and thereby aid the formulation of more accurate models of granular flow hazards and landscape evolution. This award is cofunded by the Geomorphology and Land-use Dynamics (GLD) and Prediction of and Resilience against Extreme Events (PREEVENTS) programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe central goal of this project was to investigate the influence of granular flow characteristics (grain size and shear rate) on the forces imparted by granular flows on their beds. The importance of this topic is underscored by the role of granular flows in shaping topography and generating natural hazards, as well as by the influence of bed forces on channel incision and sediment entrainment, which determine how far granular flows run out and hence their hazards. This work is motivated by the longstanding hypothesis that many geomorphic processes and associated hazards (e.g., bedrock incision by debris flows, runout of pyroclastic density currents) are driven by the largest bed forces in the frequency-magnitude distribution, rather than the mean force. Although the mean bed force can generally be predicted, the distribution of bed forces exceeding the mean remains unknown under nearly all naturally occurring granular flow conditions. The two leading hypotheses for bed force distributions, for example, predict frequencies of the highest magnitude bed forces that differ by orders of magnitude. This has led to substantial uncertainty in predictions of granular flow dynamics and hazards.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo test these hypotheses, we conducted work on three fronts. First, we built a rotating cylindrical flume and instrumented it with an array of force sensors to measure bed forces generated by granular flows during rotation of the drum. This enabled simultaneous measurement of bed forces across the flow and along the flow. With this apparatus, we ran a series of experiments with granular flows spanning a range of grain size distributions and rotation rates, and measured bed forces generated by the flows in each experiment. This enabled us to determine the sensitivity of bed force distributions to grain size and shear rate, including the frequency of bed forces much larger than the mean force, which are disproportionately likely to erode bedrock and entrain sediment. A long-term benefit of this work was the construction of the experimental apparatus, which has the potential to be used in future studies.\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, we conducted numerical simulations of granular flows in a rotating cylindrical drum, and tracked the forces imparted by the simulated flows on the bed. These simulations were conducted with a discrete element model, which calculates the velocities of each particle in the granular flow and the forces imparted by each particle during collisions with the drum and other particles. The geometry of the simulated drum was chosen to mimic that of the drum in the experimental apparatus. This provided new estimates of the sensitivity of bed force distributions to grain size distribution and shear rate across a wide range of flow regimes, from the low energy elastic-quasi-static regime to the high energy inertial-collisional regime. These revealed systematic variations in the probability of the largest bed forces across regimes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThird, we analyzed bed forces generated under natural granular flows at Chalk Cliffs, Colorado. This enabled characterization of the dependence of bed force distributions on the macroscopic properties of natural flows and comparison to bed force distributions in the lab experiments and numerical simulations. Co-located seismic monitoring measurements enabled further exploration of the association between seismic signatures and bed force distributions under natural flows.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project supported the studies of one PhD student (Amelia Winner at the University of Oregon). In addition, this project supported the growth of the research programs for three faculty (Scott McCoy at the University of Nevada Reno, Ken Ferrier at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and Joe Dufek at the University of Oregon). By the time of the project end date, four student-led manuscripts are in preparation for publication. Through this work, this project built a foundation for further studies of granular flow dynamics. In addition, the measurements of bed forces in this work may be able to address societal needs in the mitigation of hazards (e.g., debris flows, pyroclastic density currents) and predictions of long-term topographic change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/14/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ScottWMccoy\n"
