 "awd_abstract_narration": "Communities along the east coast of the United States, primarily North Carolina to Maine, are in a time of rapid transition. First, like much of the rest of coastal United States, they are experiencing more pronounced coastal hazards, including sea level rise, increased storm rain events, and surging oceanic waters, resulting in flooding. These factors are complicated by climate change. In addition, as the US moves toward clean energy, wind turbines are beginning to be placed in the ocean off their coasts.  These two dynamics could result in new relationships between communities and their coasts.  This workshop will explore the implications of the changing nature of the human relationship between coastal communities, coastal processes, and electricity infrastructure in the ocean. The workshop will be oriented toward future research and opportunities to adapt, advance preparedness, and absorb and bounce back after storm events. The workshop will be held in Annapolis, Maryland in Spring 2020, and bring together scientists, planners, citizen groups, and business interests.\r\n\r\nThe transition of the US east coast is characterized by two dynamics: coastal hazards, including rising seas, storm surge and increased precipitation events leading to flooding and inundation, which often have more serious impacts in the most vulnerable coastal populations, and siting and installation of renewable energy infrastructure in the ocean. The workshop seeks a better understanding of these interrelated dynamics with a focus on resilience building efforts and consideration of the development of an offshore wind energy system. The workshop will draw on academia (e.g., social and physical scientists, disaster management specialists and Sea Grant engagement professionals); government (federal, tribal, and state and local planners); adaptation practitioners; coastal civil society; and industry/private sector (chamber of commerce, commercial fishers, offshore wind developers) and focus on the changing human relationship with the coast/sea in small coastal communities. The workshop will work to improve understanding of (a) the links between large-scale coastal changes from physical processes and industrialization of the ocean from offshore renewable energy, (b) how best to engage policymakers in viewing these two forces of change together to find common strategies, overcome institutional barriers, and innovative partnering opportunities with co-benefits, and (c) effective risk communication strategies that articulate tradeoffs and uncertainties related to rapid transitions and resilience building in coastal communities.  The workshop will generate an interdisciplinary research roadmap that address emerging coastal community transitions and identifies best practices and risk communication strategies to enhance adaptive capacity and resilience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The workshop was organized by Jeremy Firestone, University of Delaware (UD); Bonnie Ram, UD; Danielle Swallow, Delaware Sea Grant; and David Bidwell, University of Rhode Island (URI).

Workshop participants came from academia (including students), government, and nongovernmental organizations.\n\n \n\nThe workshop was structured around three questions, which we summarize here:\n\n \n\nHow should non-local natural resource managers and energy regulators balance critical social, economic, and cultural needs of coastal communities in an era marked by climate change, including sea level rise, and proposals to industrialize the ocean through offshore wind power?\n\n \n\nHow to improve collaborations between the research community and small coastal towns and rural communities so that scientific research and data can be more effectively leveraged (\"useable science\")?\n\n \n\nWhich risk communication strategies are likely to be most effective at reaching vulnerable coastal populations (including underserved communities) and how should tradeoffs, uncertainties or potential opportunities be communicated?\n\n \n\nThe Workshop generated suggested best practices and a research roadmap, which was built around outcomes, engagement, and capacity/funding.\n\n \n\nThe suggested best practices are to: build on successful, multidisciplinary institutional models such as NOAA\u2019s Sea Grant and Regional Integrated Science and Assessments programs; legitimize diverse knowledge sources; appreciate diversity among and within communities; incorporate flexibility into systems planning around coastal vulnerabilities and offshore wind infrastructure; institute meaningful engagement across networks and local communities; have offshore wind developers establish cultural liaisons; and form long-term relationships between researchers and towns, with a pipeline of funding and technical expertise.\n\n \n\nOutcomes related research recommendations focused on: how to facilitate identification of community needs and plan for risks and uncertainties with more effective communication; how to ensure that underserved communities are well-represented in community engagement and research efforts; which strategies to employ to gather better baseline data and better define community structures, perceptions, cultures, and demographics over time; how adaptive systems can better examine \u2018rates of change,\u2019 as communities may not be able to adapt as quickly as the physical system is changing; how can offshore wind risks and benefits be better defined; and what are the range of \"co-benefits\" that can be developed for local communities?\n\n \n\nEngagement recommendations were centered on: how (with an emphasis on co-creation of knowledge) to define and communicate about the uncertain futures of climate change vulnerabilities and offshore wind infrastructure across different spatial and temporal scales;  how to move forward with a process that emphasizes co-creation of knowledge between experts and small and/or rural towns; what are the barriers to broadening participation among underserved communities and aging populations and how to better support equitable partnerships and strategies; how to merge the co-creation of knowledge between experts and small and/or rural towns into decision making with short term funding mechanisms and public participation opportunities that are robust and two-way; the need to address multiple knowledge gaps to improve risk communication.\n\n \n\nFinally, findings regarding capacity and funding focused on the fact that research funding streams for this interdisciplinary work are uneven and typically short-term.
