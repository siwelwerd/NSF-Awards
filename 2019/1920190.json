 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Emory University to support the acquisition of a new advanced microscope that combines optical tweezers for high precision mechanical pulling and nm-resolution fluorescence detection for spectroscopic localization of single molecules in microfluidic cells that allow rapid and non-disruptive exchange of experimental conditions.  At Emory, the acquisition of this microscope will enhance and extend existing, and enable new, projects spanning from genome transcription and maintenance to the mechano-biochemistry of muscle protein function, shear sensing in blood, the design of molecular tension sensors and motors and materials nano-physics.   The system will directly impact research and training infrastructure, the quality of undergraduate and graduate education and, ultimately, STEM education.  The microscope will be part of the Core Research Facilities shared among the research Universities in the Atlanta area through the Georgia Research Alliance.\r\n\r\nThe research projects enabled by the acquisition of this system will allow i) the understanding of key processes at the level of the genome such as the effect of elongating RNA polymerase on regulatory proteins normally bound to DNA (and vice versa) and the repair and editing of the genome; ii) understanding of the mechanism of force sensing in living muscle and blood cells; iii) the design of molecular force sensors, probes and motors for biotechnological applications; and iv) extension of the length scale over which advanced fluorescent detection techniques are applicable. The spectrum of research areas that will be transformed by these investigations is broad, connects fundamental with applied research and the natural synergies among the users which will lead to a stronger and better integrated research environment at Emory.  Results from these studies will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific meetings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

One major class of tension probes consists in a DNA hairpin flanked by a fluorophore-quencher pair. Upon the application of an external pN force, these hairpins unfold, which leads to an increase in the fluorescence signal. <strong>Figure 1 A</strong> shows the general experimental approach to calibrate these DNA hairpin structures using the C-Trap. We developed molecular biology methods to ligate the DNA hairpins to micron-sized DNA handles. Preliminary data shown below confirms a successful force-ramp where the unfolding of the DNA hairpin was characterized as a minor inflection in the force-extension curve (<strong>Figure 1B</strong>). A second type of probe that is being calibrated using the C-Trap is comprised of a coiled-coil domain (antiparallel geometry). The group is working to calibrate this probe by linking recombinantly expressed peptides with DNA handles (See <strong>Figure 2</strong>).

Recombinant SpyCatcher protein with a free Cysteine residue was produced, and then conjugated to a meleimade-oligonucleotide. SpyTag-AIM-A1-SpyTag was then mixed with SpyCatcher-oligo to form an oligo-SpyCatcher-SpyTag-AIM-A1-SpyTag-SpyCatcher-oligo protein0-DNA chimera. The oligonucleotide sequence anneals to the 5-kb DNA handle that was attached to a streptavidin-bead that can be laser trapped in the C-Trap microscope.

They trapped two dielectric (polystyrene) microspheres present in one of the flow channels of the microscope microfluidic cell (Bead Channel, <strong>Figure 3A</strong>), and then attached those to opposite sides of a cell in a laterally separated channel (Cell Channel). They transferred the suspended cells into the Medium Channel and manipulated the trap positions to impose deformations on the cells (<strong>Figure 3 A, B</strong>). Trap distance was periodically changed with a triangular wave form, and the forcers exerted on the cells and indentation amplitudes were recorded by the instrument (<strong>Figure 3C</strong>). Experimental data was analyzed using&nbsp;lumicks.pylak<strong> </strong>software and showed that cells respond the more rigidly the faster the imposed deformations are (<strong>Figure 3D</strong>).

C-Trap data were obtained using a 1050bp DNA adduct chemically tethered (with digoxigenin and biotin, respectively) to two microbeads held in optical traps (<strong>Figure 4A</strong>). The resistance force needed to maintain the DNA in a completely extended conformation was recorded in Force (pN) <em>versus</em> Distance (nm) curves (<em>F-D curves</em>). By comparing <em>F-D curves</em> of DNA alone (blue lines) and complexed with full-length TR&alpha; (pink line) and truncated TR&alpha; (red line) we observe that full-length TR&alpha; (FLTR&alpha;) exerts significant strain on the extended DNA conformation (<strong>Figure 4B</strong>).
