 "awd_abstract_narration": "Metal additive manufacturing (AM) technologies rely on high-energy laser sintering of powder feedstock to fabricate high-strength, complex shaped, metal components for the aerospace, defense and medical industries. Laser enabled AM requires large amounts of energy to generate sufficiently high temperatures (500-1500 C) to sinter the feedstock, thus making it a notably slow process sometimes needing days to print 0.3 cubic meters of material. Recent studies on metal nanomaterials revealed they have unique properties that include reduced sintering temperatures (200-750 C), and enhanced heat generation resulting from laser light-matter interaction at the nano-scale. In this project, the laser interaction with a new class of AM-compatible nanostructured metal powder feedstock will be investigated. Attention will be given to tailoring the new feedstock so as to reduce the thermal energy and processing time requirements for sintering. If successful, this approach could eliminate the need for high-energy laser sources in additive metal processes, bringing capital and operational costs down, improving safety and expanding its industrial application. Further, realizing low-temperature sinterable metal feedstock is a step towards generating viable polymer-metal interfaces via additive processes; currently this is challenging as the polymer can undergo thermal degradation at current metal sintering temperatures (>500 C). Metal-polymer co-processing would allow academics and the medical industry to print bio-inspired knee-implants mimicking not only human hard tissues (e.g. bone) but also soft ones (e.g. ligaments). In addition to the technical aspects, this project supports a summer graduate student traineeship, and a high-school competition in additive manufacturing; both activities aim to attract and train the next-generation of manufacturing engineers and scientists required for future US workforce needs.\r\n\r\nNanoporous metal powders, e.g. with ligament size smaller than 50 nm, can be generated via dealloying methods. As their surface topography differs from solid particles generated via gas atomization they interact differently with incident laser beams. This project seeks to understand both the synthesis and laser sintering of nanoporous metal powder. Research focused on the synthesis of mesoporous metal powders will determine the physics and limitations of pore formation and control via chemical dealloying. The interaction of these novel particles with the laser source will be studied to elucidate how localized surface plasmon resonance within the ligaments of the pores can promote light-matter interaction during the sintering process, and how size-dependent melt-point suppression reduces the laser energy density and dwell requirements for processing. Research tasks include: 1) an investigation of the process-structure mapping of dealloying of metal alloys to quantify the role of adatom clustering in the pore formation theory, 2) experimental work to understand the scaling laws of mesoporous metal joining, 3) characterization of the stages of microstructural morphology evolution upon laser exposure such as pore coarsening, and 4) mechanical characterization of 3D printed specimens to elucidate the fundamental limit on the interfacial strength of low-temperature welded metal-metal and metal-polymer parts. If successful, this fundamental knowledge can be leveraged to improve the speed of metal AM and increase its combability with thermoplastics for simultaneous printing of polymers and metals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this Report are those of the PI and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation; NSF has not approved or endorsed its content.</p>\n<p>Metal 3D printing has been extensively studied in the past decade with clear contributions to both prototyping and production of high-quality, complex parts for the aerospace and biomedical industries. At the same time, the field of nanotechnology has discovered nanomaterials with unique thermal, electrical, chemical and optical properties relevant to the development of new biosensing technologies, catalysts for carbon capture and so much more. However, 3D printing of metallic nanomaterials has been plagued by a poor trade-off between resolution and throughput often attempting to use nanoparticles as feedstocks for printing which ultimately limits their applications to low-volume applications such as microelectronics.</p>\n<p>In this project, a new class of spherical nanoporous metal foams (SNMF) was designed to meet the requirements for large-scale powder-based metal additive manufacturing methods with superior dispersion, flowability and rheological properties that allow this feedstock to spread, fill and move like a paste or a liquid. SNMFs were designed by understanding process-structure relationships in bulk-scale dealloying of powders and the influence of electrochemical and processing parameters (e.g., temperature, chemical composition and concentration) on the resulting quality, purity and pore size. When combined with a welding agent, SNMF can be printed at sufficiently low temperatures (i.e., below one-third of its melting temperature) which allows its nanoscale pores to survive high-temperature post-processing requirements inherent to metal additive technologies overcoming thermodynamic limitations of nanoporous metals. Once proven to be flowable and low-temperature sinterable, SNMFs became compatible with several manufacturing processes for shaping nanoporous, metallic, three-dimensional objects and architectures such as powder casting and binder-based additive manufacturing.</p>\n<p>As a first demonstration, electrically conductive 3D copper nanofoams were powder casted and sintered with low oxygen content (&lt; 1 at.%), ligament size control (between 20-200 nm), high-surface area (12-100 m<sup>2</sup>/g) and yield strengths (as high as 18 MPa). Secondly, the team integrated SNMFs with photocurable resins to demonstrate binder-based microscale 3d printing of nanoporous copper via microscale micro-projection stereolithography. In the process, our team understood key parameters for its successful printing including the role of polymer imbibition onto SNMF&rsquo;s pores and its resulting rheological properties. Thus, this work was a step towards novel <em>nano-enabled 3D printing technologies</em> with an emphasis on the synthesis of nanoporous metal powders and the fundamentals of its welding characteristics. Further, this study now allows the broader community to use functional nanoporous metal powders in a diversity of fields such as energy &amp; catalysis, biomedicine and rocket fuels; effectively reducing the knowledge barrier to controllably synthesize and print SMNFs. This project enables compatible processing temperatures for metals and polymers for multi-material 3D printing to support bio-inspired design, architected structural batteries and biomedical bone-ligament implants. Our impact is amplified since metal-loaded filaments, resins and powders feedstock made of the nanostructured powders can be readily adopted by existing 3D printing technologies. Further, our impact in education is to foment a new generation of scientists the relevance of nanomaterials and its fundamentals on the future of 3D printing.</p>\n<p>This project partially supported graduate research studies of 2 MS and 7 PhD students in an area that bridges advanced manufacturing and nanotechnology. Also, 7 journal articles and 6 conference papers have been published on the results of this project. The project has also provided research and mentoring to 1 high-school, 1 undergraduate student and one research scientist. To-date, out of the 4 PhD and 2 MS students that graduated during this project, all have been placed in high-tech engineering industries such as semiconductor and battery manufacturing. The initial project results have also served as the basis for intellectual property development and potential commercialization.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified:
