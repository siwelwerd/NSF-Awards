 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is primarily a solution to recent concerns of the effects of nanoparticles on overall health. Based on scientific claims that nanoparticles are detrimental to an individuals health, regulatory agencies, companies, and the general public have become more vigilant in finding non-nano alternatives to materials and products that they have been using. In addition to providing a non-nano alternative to existing metal oxides used in many personal care products, this project also allows for more environmentally friendly manufacturing processes and end products. Cost-effective synthetic methods will allow for these alternatives to be feasible replacements to formulators, toxicologists, and other people involved in the manufacturing decision-making process.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project aims to focus on finding the best product market fit for the novel synthetic methodology of Zinc Oxide. This synthesis relies on milder temperatures with only water-based precursors that are utilized to yield surfactant-free, morphologically identical, and non-nano zinc oxide particles. The same methodology can be use to yield metal-doped zinc oxide constructs with enhanced properties depending on the metal used. The eclectic nature and environmentally friendly qualities of the reactants make this one-pot synthesis a perfect candidate for an ecologically conscious alternative to the state-of-the-art zinc oxide synthesis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
