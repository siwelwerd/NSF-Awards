The conference focuses on future directions in the innovative use of computing technology, data science, and internet-based communications infrastructure to enhance chemical engineering education. This conference immediately follows the CACHE (Computer Aids for Chemical Engineering Education) Corporation sponsored research conference, Foundations of Computer Aided Process Design in Copper Mountain, Colorado.\r\n\r\nThe conference program includes 12 plenary speakers who will offer their views of important directions in cyber-assisted education as well as highlights of the accomplishments and current thrusts of CACHE in molecular modeling, systems biology and process systems engineering. It will also involve 20 invited oral presentations as well as posters contributed by outstanding young faculty reporting innovations in the development of educational media, exploring novel ways of organizing student-instructor interactions to enhance learning and experimenting with alternative knowledge delivery modes. The presentations and discussion will serve to identify gaps across the curriculum and at all degree levels and to outline the content and identify the most effective vehicles to deliver the content that would fill the identified gaps.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
