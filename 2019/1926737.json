 "awd_abstract_narration": "Leadership is crucial for effective cooperation, especially in large and complex groups. Yet there is an empirical and theoretical gap in our understanding of the individual-level processes underpinning leadership and the group-level consequences of leadership. How does the cognition of individual leaders translate into coordinated group action in the real world?  This project proposes using chimpanzees as a new model of human-like leadership to better understand the evolutionary origins of our own leadership patterns. We will bridge the gap between individual- and group-level phenomena by conducting matched research with semi-free ranging chimpanzees living in a sanctuary where we can do detailed assessments of cognition, and with chimpanzees living in the wild where we can look at complex group behavior in a natural setting. By matching datasets across these two contexts, we will be able to see how individual cognitive process translate into group action. While humans are thought to be uniquely able to establish leadership through prestige and collaboration instead of just pure physical domination, chimpanzees are our closest living relative, also show variation in how individuals obtain and maintain status in their groups. This project will therefore illuminate the evolutionary origins of human leadership, and also set a new agenda in evolutionary cognitive science for studying cognition in the wild. Training, education, and outreach from elementary school through to graduate school will be integrated throughout the project both domestically and abroad. As part of this proposal, we will develop a leadership module for children, using animal models to demonstrate different forms of leadership. We will implement this module through outreach at local schools and museums in the US and in 16 primary schools in Uganda. Undergraduates and high school students in the US will gain hand-on research experience through internships and in coursework. Two postdoctoral researchers and a graduate student will further gain international research experiences in the course of the project. This integrated approach to research and education will train a new generation of evolutionary cognitive scientists and disseminate primate research to the public.\r\n\r\nThis project has three specific aims. The first aim is to identify individual leaders (those with outsized influence) in natural social groups across multiple contexts of behavior including dominance rank, initiation of group movements, resource acquisition, within-group mediation and inter-group aggression. The second aim is to create leadership profiles by characterizing individual variation in the cognitive, behavioral, and physiological mechanisms of leaders across these contexts. At the sanctuary, 100+ chimpanzees across 5 social groups will be assayed for cognition (including social cognition, cooperation, and executive function); temperament; behavior (aggression and affiliation), and physiology (hormones and body size) to predict leadership. At the field site, similar assessments will be made of temperament, behavior, and physiology, drawing on a longitudinal database with 30 years of data on 150 wild chimpanzees. These data will be used to test the hypothesis that there are distinct pathways to leadership in chimpanzees, with intimidation-based and cooperative strategies being the most important, but knowledge and motivation anchoring some forms of leadership. The final aim is to understand how variation in leadership styles shapes the outcomes of collective action by examining several short-and long-term metrics of leadership success, including group cohesion, rewards received, and biological outcomes like reproductive success that can only be studied in the wild. This project will bridge individual-level and group-level perspectives on cognition, behavior, and physiology by leveraging the strengths of two natural populations of chimpanzees. The project will match experimental and observational techniques across sites on a scale never previously done, and will develop chimpanzees as a new model for human leadership.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

While leadership in most nonhuman animals is strongly dependent on the ability to physically dominate others, humans are exceptional in the degree to which leadership may arise from other routes, involving diverse individual strategies and their associated neurocognitive mechanisms. Our research aimed to identify alternative strategies for social influence across the domains of chimpanzee social behavior. We used a novel design to connect lines of evidence from naturalistic observations of social behavior to minimally-invasive controlled cognitive experiments in both wild groups and semi-free-ranging groups housed in African sanctuaries. To achieve these aims, we collected over 13,000 hours of naturalistic field observations of social behavior of wild chimpanzees in the Kibale National Park, Uganda. We also designed and implemented 3 years of novel behavioral data collection at sanctuaries to create matched behavioral and cognitive data in all study sites. Additionally, we non-invasively collected more than 1700 urine samples and we analyzed over 7,000 existing biospecimens from wild and sanctuary-living chimpanzees to assess hormones that have been associated with temperament, social tolerance, and leadership styles in humans.</p>\n<p><strong>Outcomes:</strong> Whereas aggressive competition has been recognized as the primary determinant of social status in chimpanzees, our research revealed alternative forms of leadership in individuals who are not at the top of the dominance hierarchy. First, particular chimpanzees exhibited leadership in the context of high-risk cooperative behaviors, such as hunting. While these males were not necessarily more skilled than others, their participation enhanced group success by promoting the cooperation of others. Second, when past their physical prime, many male chimpanzees invested in strong political alliances that buffered them from the loss of social status with age. These prosocial strategies, which were associated with reduced aggression, allowed old males to sire offspring and maintain strong social integration compared to other primates, with the exception of humans. Our study also helped explain sexually-differentiated patterns of cooperation and identified social tolerance as a critical ingredient for cooperation in female chimpanzees. We developed novel approaches for characterizing individual variation in hormonal profiles and associated this variation with social behavioral styles exhibited by wild chimpanzees, as well as with performance of sanctuary chimpanzees on cognitive tasks measuring risk-taking and impulsive decision making. Hormonal studies also described chronic physiological costs associated with conventional aggression-based status competition, a factor which likely promotes alternative leadership pathways. We have been able to correlate variation in behaviors like social dominance, grooming, and tool use to variation in performance on cognitive tasks. While phenomena such as prestige-based leadership are not fully developed in apes, the advances from this study identify some shared features and mechanisms associated with leadership behavior in chimpanzees and humans and localize these features in the unusual degree of cooperation exhibited by both species.
