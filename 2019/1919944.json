 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to Tulane University from the Major Research Instrumentation program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences supports the design and building of an advanced scientific tool for studying how matter and materials behave when they are placed in very strong magnetic field. This instrument will consist of two main parts: a very strong superconducting magnet and a set of lasers. Laser light will be used to probe how materials react to the strong magnetic field and to very low temperatures. Upon completion of the instrument development, the instrument will be available to outside user. The major science drivers of this instrument is in quantum matter, the advancement of our understanding of how electrons behave inside a wide variety of materials and imbue them with their properties, such as magnetism or superconductivity. Such basic scientific understanding underpins many technological marvels such as in medical diagnostic devices, computing chips in our phones and tablets, magnetic data storage technology, cell phone cameras, new energy-efficient LED light bulbs, and more. Through basic physics research, the proposed instrument will promote the progress of physics and advance national prosperity. This instrument will also contribute to advanced education of graduate and undergraduate students, thus building an educated national workforce for the new century. As a priority, the team of researchers promotes the participation in science and engineering fields of women and underrepresented minorities from Xavier University of Louisiana, a local Historically Black College or University.\r\n\r\nThis award supports the development of a multi-user instrument for ultrafast terahertz (THz) spectroscopy in high magnetic fields of up to 17 T. The magnet cryostat provides the sample temperature control in the 2.5-300 K range and is cryogen-free. Four high-field experimental modalities will be available in both Faraday and Voigt optical configurations: i) THz time-domain spectroscopy based on photoconductive antennas with 0.2 - 3 THz spectral range; ii) time-resolved THz spectroscopy based on air-plasma THz generation and air-breakdown detection with 0.3 - 10 THz spectral range; iii) second harmonic generation with sample rotation about the surface normal; iv) optical pump-probe spectroscopy. The instrument will enable innovative research in magneto-electric excitations and optical nonreciprocity in multiferroics; search for the optical signatures of the chiral anomaly and the non-trivial band topology in Weyl semimetals;  second harmonic generation and optical pump-probe studies of topological and magnetic materials; time-resolved THz spectroscopy of high-temperature superconducting pnictides. The instrument will become a part of the nationwide advanced research infrastructure. The instrument is unique, as it far outperforms in its specifications and capabilities other similar university-based research tools in the United States. In addition to eleven identified outside groups who have expressed a strong interest in the instrument capabilities in the nearest term.The instrument attracts potential local users and from across the Nation. The project contributes to the training of next the generation instrument developers. In the long run it will contribute to the education of dozens of graduate and undergraduate students. The project explicitly promotes the participation of women and underrepresented minorities in sciences and engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merit: We began this project with the goal of creating a unique scientific instrument that allows us to optically study materials under extreme conditions of very low temperature and high magnetic field.  The lowest temperature the instrument achieves is 2 K and the highest magnetic field is 17 T.  There are two aspects that make this instrument unique among other, similar instruments in the world: one is versatility, because it allows the use of a variety of optical tools for the study of materials.  These tools are terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, broadband terahertz spectroscopy, nonlinear optical spectroscopy, and optical pump-probe spectroscopy.  The second unique aspect is the ease of use, high experimental throughput, and low cost of operation.  Unlike more specialized instruments, ours can easily and quickly switch between the above-listed experimental modalities, which helps achieve the high throughput in experiments.  Our instrument also relies on cryogen-free technology to cool and operate the superconducting magnet, which significantly lowers the operating cost, as we do not need to purchase the liquified helium gas to run this facility.  Our project has also produced other scientific outcomes besides the creation of this measurement tool.  We have investigated a special kind of a composite material, called metamaterial as an advanced photonic material at terahertz wavelengths.  Our metamaterials consist of a very thin patterned gold layers and a substrate made of semiconductor InSb.  We found a new kind of magneto-optical effect in one of the metamaterials, in which the polarization of the transmitted THz beam is rotated in the presence of magnetic field.  This kind of optical effect is called Faraday effect, and in our metamaterial the Faraday effect is activated by the presence of chirality in the patterned metal layers.  We will also use our new instrument to study superconductivity and special topological electronic states on crystal surfaces.\n\nBroader impact:  Our new instrument will be available to use by researchers and students from anywhere in the nation.  This means that it can help scientific discovery beyond those topics that are planned for research by its developers.  The instrument will also help educate the next generation of scientists in the US.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/10/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Diyar Talbayev"
