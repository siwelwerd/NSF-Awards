 "awd_abstract_narration": "The competitive strength of the nation in the technological arena depends on the success of the engineering workforce. It is therefore crucial that we develop better scientific understanding of how engineers work, as well as how their work is changing. Without well-researched and trustworthy representations of professional practice, it is questionable whether educators can adequately prepare future engineers for their careers. Yet there remains a persistent lack of research on what engineers do in the workplace. This exploratory project will help bridge these gaps by testing new research approaches to generate new knowledge about what engineers do at work. Traditionally, such research has been conducted through direct observations in a physical workplace. This approach needs to be modified since open workspaces, geographically distributed teams, and new digital tools make it increasingly infeasible to perform on-site research for long periods of time, both for researchers, funders, and study sites. Other approaches like surveys and interviews are often easier to carry out, but are limited in what kinds of insights they can provide. The novelty and exploratory aspect of the proposed study comes from taking new and different empirical approaches to study engineering workplace practices. Findings and resources developed through this project will support ongoing efforts to improve how current and future engineers are trained to succeed and excel in their job roles and careers. \r\n\r\nIn this exploratory project we will undertake innovative approaches to collecting, analyzing, and archiving empirical data related to engineering practice. This project will involve ethnographic research at multiple field sites representing multiple industry sectors using novel methods such as agile ethnography, trace ethnography, and network ethnography. These methods are new and evolving, and thus have scarcely been used to study engineering practice. Yet they appear highly promising for many reasons, including their potential to generate research findings more rapidly and with a greater focus on specific problems and questions. Such methods have started to gain traction in industry precisely due to such advantages, especially in software engineering and related fields where work is already very digital and distributed in character. The field studies proposed for this project are especially concerned with how work is coordinated and aligned within and across teams, including through the use of digital data and tools. This project will also investigate and respond to three specific research challenges: 1) aligning new data collection and analysis approaches with emerging research topics and site access constraints, 2) managing, archiving, and sharing multi-modal ethnographic data sets, and 3) exploring alternative approaches to communicating research findings, including formats and styles that are more accessible and appealing to different audiences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
