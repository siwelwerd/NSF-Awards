 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are requested to support the participation of graduate students and post-doctoral researchers in the Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and the Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on Spin Dynamics in Nanostructures. The GRC and the GRS will be held in Les Diablerets, Switzerland during July 7th-12th 2019 and July 6th-7th 2019, respectively. The GRS is primarily aimed at young researchers, such as graduate students and postdocs. It is immediately followed by, and hence merges into, the GRC, which features presentations by the leading scientists in the field thereby bringing together junior and senior scientists in the research community.\r\n \r\nThe GRS program will feature oral and poster presentations accompanied by informal discussions with a small number of attendees (around 50 participants). All the participants of the GRS generally attend the GRC, where the attendance is desired to be limited to approximately 100 researchers. The GRC program will include invited oral presentations by established leading researchers and poster presentations, focusing on developments at the cutting edge in the field. The conference chairs aim to actively encourage participation from a diverse group of researchers that represent a broad range of backgrounds, institutions, geographical regions, and research fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
