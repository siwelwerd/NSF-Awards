The theory of actions of groups generated by unipotent elements also known as Ratner theory is a cornerstone of modern ergodic theory. The goal of the conference is to review the recent developments in the field and to set up new directions. \r\n\r\nThe main topics of the conference will be unipotent flows and their applications to counting and equidistribution; diagonal flows on homogenous spaces, and their applications in arithmetic and beyond; measure and orbit classification results for dynamics on moduli spaces of abelian and quadratic differentials; stationary measures and associated random walks in the homogeneous and non-homogeneous spaces. The conference structure will include mini-courses, lectures, and times for discussion and collaboration. More details about the conference could be found at http://ias.huji.ac.il/22midrashamathematicae .\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
