 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to address a current void in medical and clinical practices across a broad scope of disciplines (e.g., dentofacial orthopedist, speech language pathologist, sleep medicine specialist, respiratory therapist, orofacial myofunctional therapist) specializing in Orofacial Myofunctional Disorders (OMD) (i.e., sleep apnea, dysphagia, malocclusions, tongue thrusts, articulation). Millions of people worldwide are impacted by some intricate and individualized form of OMD each year. Currently, there is a limited number of oral function diagnostic devices available. Providing a device, PARROT, that will capture real-time natural lingual behavior outside a controlled clinical setting may further one?s understanding of the obscure happenings within the oral cavity. Such information may further advance OMD diagnostic and rehabilitation practices as well as promote the engagement of new research across several medical and clinical fields. Recognizing the growing prevalence of OMD across multiple health related disciplines and the projected growth of a multibillion-dollar medical device manufacturing industry, PARROT may address such a need.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is purposed toward enhancing one's quality of life by establishing a robust method to view lingual behaviors potentially associated with OMD. The tongue's placement within the oral cavity obstructs and limits accessibility to observe and objectively record natural lingual behaviors (i.e., spatial positioning, placement, movement and performance). Such limitations may dilute biofeedback purposed toward identifying atypical patterns or mechanics potentially causing or promoting an OMD; thereby, impeding the appropriate application to effectively treat the OMD. PARROT is a wireless orofacial myofunctional imaging and pressure mapping appliance that introduces the potential for a systematic approach to objectively evaluate natural lingual behavior (e.g., region specific lingual movement, positional habits, and performance) while allowing an individual to continue routine daily activities and behaviors. To date, a particular proximity sensor has been identified for measuring tongue-palate distance along with contact and motion displacement across the stretch of the tongue in the oral cavity, while a specific pressure mapping matrix will measure intensity of pressure applied by the tongue across the palate and upper dentition. PARROT is currently in an Alpha Prototype state with configuration and optimization of biomaterials continuing prior to Beta Prototype validation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The tongue's placement within the oral cavity, however, obstructs and limits accessibility to observe and record objective lingual measures such as spatial positioning, placement (passive, active), movement and functional performance without altering or priming the natural behaviors of the tongue. PARROT is a wireless orofacial myofunctional imaging and pressure mapping appliance that introduces the potential for a systematic approach to objectively evaluate natural lingual behavior (e.g., region specific lingual movement, positional habits, and performance) while allowing an individual to continue routine activities and behaviors in and outside the clinical setting. The objective of the proposed research was to establish a robust understanding of current needs and limitations within potential medical and clinical fields to further develop the business model, thereby optimizing the function, configuration and output delivered by PARROT.</p>\n<p>The PARROT team conducted a total of 154 interviews; 117 in-person, 28 Zoom and 9 phone conversations. These conversations involved clinicians and staff that specialized in Orofacial Myofunctional Therapy, Speech Language Pathology, Sleep Medicine, ENT, Orthodontics, and Dentistry as well as speaking with patients and family members living with an OMD. Conversations further continued with product managers, chief technology officers and directors of sales from leading oral appliance companies.</p>\n<p>By week three of interviews we implemented our first pivot. Our potential target market was no longer Sleep Medicine, Dental, and Orthodontic specialist but instead a strong interest was expressed by specialists using Orofacial Myofunctional Therapy (OMT). Evidence-based support of OMT techniques is lacking and the availability of a clinical tool capable of recording a patient?s functional lingual measures and provide objective biofeedback is necessary. Additional needs included an oral device that was thin, easy to use and did not impede natural lingual behavior. A custom fit device was preferred to a one-size fits all and flexibility for clinical in-person settings as well as remote capabilities.</p>\n<p>A second pivot occurred at week 6. This was the result of a more thorough evaluation of the ecosystem and process necessary to provide OMT's with the desired clinical tool discussed. As shown in the PARROT Ecosystem (see Other Images), OMT?s and patients with OMD were the End Beneficiary and Influencer not the direct customer The OMT and patient benefit from the biofeedback provided by the oral device when evaluating and treating a patient?s lingual (dys)function; furthermore, providing OMT?s with objective data for pursuance of a credible evidence-based practice. The Orthodontist is the middleman (Buyer) responsible for measuring, ordering, and billing the patient for a custom fit oral device, while the Oral Appliance Manufacturer is PARROT?s direct customer and holds the licensing?s rights to manufacture the oral device. The introduction of PARROT is projected to increase revenue growth by approximately 15% in comparison to FY2021 as shown in Market Trend/Profit Margin (see Other Images). Interestingly, during our later interviews we identified a recent shift in current practice with approximately 3 out of every 10 dentists and orthodontists purchasing their own equipment to make custom fit oral molds. With a few additional modifications to PARROT, another pivot with dentists and orthodontists becoming a primary customer may be supported.</p>\n<p>During the height of COVID, we continued to interview and observe in-person clinic, telemedicine clinic, and surgical procedures to learn of any changes in practice that may encourage further modifications to the functionality of PARROT. Clinicians expressed a newly discovered <em>pain</em> when conducting telemedicine assessments and therapy sessions due to an absence of capabilities with current tools. Solutions for these <em>pains</em> will be incorporated into PARROT with a few additional modifications.</p>\n<p>At present, PARROT and its parent company, iNOv8v Health Technologies, LLC, have been accepted into the SharpHupb program and are pursuing a Phase I NIH SBIR grant (FOA PAR-20-232).

The intent is to incorporate the valuable insight gathered throughout this process and further develop and reconfigure PARROT to meet the needs of our Ecosystem.
