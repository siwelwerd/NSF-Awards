 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solar geoengineering discussions have largely focused on stratospheric sulfate aerosols and Marine Cloud Brightening (MCB). However, both of these methods of solar geoengineering necessarily have limits in terms of their ranges of achievable climates, their potential side effects, and their uncertainties. Studying other methods of solar geoengineering is essential for expanding the options available to society for addressing climate change. Studies of Marine Sky Brightening (MSB) have the potential to fundamentally alter discourse about solar geoengineering, as well as open up new avenues of research that have been heretofore under-studied. This project is focused on MSB.\r\n\r\nMarine Sky Brightening (MSB) is a proposed method of solar geoengineering whereby sea salt particles are injected into the marine boundary layer. Like Marine Cloud Brightening (MCB), a related geoengineering technique, MSB would brighten clouds, increasing albedo and cooling the planet. However, preliminary modeling studies of MSB have shown that radiative forcing from direct scattering by the sea salt aerosols can be of a similar magnitude to radiative forcing from cloud brightening. Moreover, although MSB may be less efficient than MCB at exerting radiative forcing, it may not be as dependent upon local meteorological conditions: not all clouds can be brightened, and some areas that may be desirable to cool don't have clouds. This project includes a systematic exploration of MSB in a hierarchy of models, including radiative transfer models to understand optimal particle size for scattering, regional models and large eddy simulators to understand boundary layer dynamics and local climate effects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMarine cloud brightening is a proposed geoengineering technique whereby sea salt aerosols are injected into low clouds over the ocean; under certain conditions, this causes the clouds to become brighter, reflecting more sunlight back to space and cooling the planet.  However, there may not always be clouds where one would want to brighten.  As it turns out, sea salt aerosols themselves are good at reflecting sunlight.  This idea of marine sky brightening has not been well quantified in the past.\n\nWe conducted simulations of marine sky brightening over the Gulf of Mexico to understand how effective it might be, the optimal particle size, and whether there are other effects that could be felt outside of the Gulf.  We found through simulations that, while less efficient than cloud brightening, marine sky brightening would reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the surface.  We also discovered that cumulus clouds, which are not commonly discussed in studies of marine cloud brightening but are common in the Gulf, were also brightened in our simulations.  Effects outside of the Gulf of Mexico appear to be limited in our simulations.  The cooling in the Gulf for even large amounts of sea salt injection would likely not be sufficient to significantly affect land-falling hurricanes in the Gulf.\n\nIf geoengineering is going to be pursued, we need to understand its benefits and risks, as well as the benefits and risks of not doing geoengineering (i.e., living with climate change).  Each method of geoengineering has different effects and different tradeoffs that we also need to understand.  Ultimately, understanding marine sky brightening will provide decision makers with more information about our options for addressing climate change and whether those options are a good or bad idea (or, more likely, somewhere in between).  Our studies will contribute to that discussion, hopefully leading to a more informed decision about whether we might want to do geoengineering in the future, and if so, what we want it to accomplish and how.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/25/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Benjamin Kravitz"
