 "awd_abstract_narration": "The capability to bring computer science and technology as well as large and complex data sets to bear on interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary science is emerging. It is therefore critically important to establish and enable transnational frameworks so that data-driven scientific knowledge can transcend disciplines and geographical borders, ultimately increasing the scientific underpinnings of policy and action. International collaboration within global environmental change research fields holds the potential to establish international foundations for federated data integration and analysis systems with shared services, bring together best practices from the public and private sectors, foster open data and open science stewardship among the science communities including related areas such as publishing, and encourage data and cloud providers and others to adopt common standards and practices for the benefit of all.\r\n\r\nThis award supports U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a coalition of 29 funding agencies from 23 countries through the Belmont Forum Call for proposals on Science-driven e-Infrastructure Innovation (SEI) for the Enhancement of Transnational, Interdisciplinary and Transdisciplinary Data Use in Environmental Change.  SEI is a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that bring together environmental, social and economic scientists with data scientists, computational scientists, and e-infrastructure and cyber-infrastructure developers and providers to solve one or more of the methodological, technological and/or procedural challenges currently facing inter-disciplinary and transdisciplinary environmental change research that involves working with large, diverse and multi-source transnational data. The SEI call will intimately link research thinking and technological innovation toward accelerating the full-path of discovery-driven data use and open science and enable a broader scientific community to benefit from the identified new and potentially disruptive demonstrators or pilots toward solutions.\r\n\r\nScientific research is generating an increasing number of digital images, from micrographs of cells to pictures of galaxies. Automated instruments can capture many images, which are then processed automatically to extract data from them. For this data to be useful to the scientific community and benefit the general public, it needs quickly generate output (even for millions of images), consistent, and easy to share. Digital imaging can help determine how many organisms are present in a given environment, how diverse the organisms are and whether these data change in time.  This technique is particularly useful underwater, where direct observation by humans is difficult. The main goal of this project is to build a World Wide Web of Plankton Image Curation applications that collect images of plankton (the organisms that drift with ocean currents), allow scientists to name them consistently, store associated ecological information (such as time, location, etc.), and make all data easily accessible to the community. It will leverage cutting edge advances in database design and machine learning to process billions of images, will be hosted on public web servers to be easily accessible, and will foster an atmosphere of collaboration and sharing that is essential for the progress of science. This network of applications will be used to tackle studies that have proved challenging, such as fast plankton monitoring to assess ecosystem health, or global estimations of the distribution of planktonic diversity and its contribution to carbon storage or ecosystem productivity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
