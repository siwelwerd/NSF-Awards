 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increases in the nation's population have created an unprecedented demand for electric motors in conventional and emerging technologies.  New uses of electricity, including electric vehicles, server farms to support the internet, and high-speed rail, have contributed additional demands for electric motors.  Furthermore, direct drive wind turbines and drones could benefit from reconfigurations of their drive trains. Conventional electromagnetic motors utilize rare earth elements such as dysprosium and neodymium whose future availabilities are uncertain. Electrostatic motors can be made sustainably, but improvements in torque output are required for many applications. Increased torque can be achieved by increasing the dielectric constant of the fluid within the motor.  Adding small particles can increase the fluid's dielectric constant, but the particle-fluid mixture can become too viscous for motor applications. In this project, mathematical models and computer simulations will be used to engineer particle-fluid mixtures that have high dielectric constants and low viscosities.  The research team will partner with the University of Wisconsin's Institute for Chemical Education to guide undergraduate students in constructing demonstrations of electrostatics intended for K-12 students.  The demonstrations will be used at various venues to engage the public in novel applications of electrostatics.\r\n\r\nThe large electric fields required for electrostatic motors can cause field-induced aggregation of the particles in the suspension within the motor.  Aggregation of the particles leads, in turn, to large increases in the suspension viscosity, which diminishes motor performance.  Particle aggregation can be avoided by employing Brownian nanoparticles in the suspension, such that thermal motion can overcome the field-induced forces. Aggregation of the particles due to van der Waals forces can be avoided by steric stabilization.  Particle-level simulations will be employed to determine the relationships between particle size and concentration, electric field strength and frequency, steric layer properties, and the macroscopic dielectric and rheological properties of the suspensions. The results of this work will enable practitioners to engineer effective nanoparticle suspensions for a variety of electrostatic motor applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Expanding technologies (electric vehicles, server farms to support the internet, high speed rail, etc.) have further increased the demand while technologies like direct drive wind turbines and drones need fundamental drive train reconfigurations.  Conventional electromagnetic motors utilize elements (e.g., dysprosium, neodymium) whose future availabilities are uncertain. Electrostatic motors can be made sustainably, but improvements in torque output are required, which can be achieved by increasing the dielectric constant of the fluid within the motor. Adding particles to the dielectric fluid can increase its dielectric constant, but the electrorheological effect must be avoided by using stabilized, Brownian nanoparticles. We propose to use particle-level simulations to determine the particle properties required to achieve high dielectric constant suspensions without significantly increasing the viscosity of the suspension.\n\nIntellectual Merits:  The project pursues an entirely new blend of chemical and electrical engineering modeling, namely the pursuit of dielectric liquids that possesses four unique qualities that do not naturally occur together. 1. High breakdown strength, 2. High dielectric constant, 3. Low conductivity, 4. Low viscosity.  Attributes 1 and 2 deliver high torque output while attributes 3 and 4 maintain high efficiency.  Can a modeling tool predict these attributes simultaneously and guide electrostatic motor designers?\n\nIntellectual Merit Outcomes: In a separate experimental effort, we have been trying to prepare stable, nonaqueous suspensions of nanoparticles.  The simulation results obtained from this project suggested that the steric stabilizer layer needed to larger than what we were trying and helped to produce the desired stable suspensions. The simulation tool demonstrated the ability to predict the experimental results observed in other work.  A manuscript is being prepared to be submitted for peer review soon.\n\nBroader Impacts Thesis:  Of the available means of producing and consuming electric power, 99% of the world's electricity is produced by electric generators and 46% of all electricity is consumed by electric motors constituting a worldwide electric machine market of ~$100 billion annually. As demand for natural resources increases, sustainable engineering practices must be employed to responsibly meet our energy needs while simultaneously adding performance value.  A direct drive E-field motor technology will facilitate the following broader impacts: 1) reduction of the consumption of metals, which must be mined with significant potential impacts on the environment, 2) provide higher electrical efficiencies than what is currently possible with direct drive, and 3) enable new manufacturing techniques.  Longer term, E-field machine infrastructure development would 4) decrease dependency on foreign supply chains (no rare earths, less fossil fuel consumption through efficiency) and 5) strengthen a domestic workforce. 6) During the course of the proposed work, we will train a female graduate student(s) in the fields of colloidal dispersions, complex fluids, rheology, transport phenomena, and numerical methods.\n\nBroader Impact Outcomes: An enabling simulation design tool was developed for electrostatic machinery, thereby assisting the likelihood of broader impacts 1 - 5 in becoming a reality in the future.  In a field where women are traditionally underrepresented, two women graduate students were trained during the project. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/02/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel C Ludois"
