 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditional adaptive optics are effective for small targets but tend not to work as well across the whole field of view of a telescope. This means that solar telescopes, which seek to resolve small features on the Sun that can fill the field of view, have not been able to take advantage of this technology. The innovation of multi-conjugate adaptive optics (MCAO) solves this problem. MCAO is to be part of the upcoming Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST). The work proposed here is to complete development of an MCAO system in the near-infrared for the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO) as a prototype for DKIST. The system will be tested by conducting observations of solar prominences in two different campaigns. Lessons learned from BBSO will provide a blueprint for development of the DKIST system.\r\n\r\nThe team will complete the development of a testbed NIR-MCAO system and connect it to BBSO?s Goode Solar Telescope (GST). They will use the MCAO apparatus to feel light to GST?s Near-Infrared Imaging Spectro-polarimeter (NIRIS). NIRIS operates at wavelengths between 1.0 and 1.7 microns. The team will conduct observations of the solar disk using this system. They will also conduct observations of prominences using a prototype wavefront sensor in an effort to better understand the particular issues that arise when one attempts to conduct adaptive optics observations of prominences (called ?prominence AO?). The objective of this work is to identify unique issues within various AO regimes that DKIST will be likely to encounter, and to innovate solutions for these issues.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAdaptive Optics (AO) is the enabling technology for modern, large aperture ground-based telescopes because it corrects the effects of atmospheric turbulence near the center of the field of view.  The backbone of AO is large format deformable mirrors than can rapidly change shape to compensate in real time for the comparably rapidly changing effects of atmospheric turbulence.  The turbulence is measured by a wavefront sensing camera and its output is used to guide the shape changes in the deformable mirror.   However, some of the most interesting dynamical effects on the Sun cover a wider field than a single DM can correct.   Sometimes flaring seems to occur everywhere in the field of view all at once, which necessitates multi-conjugate AO (MCAO).  In Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO), the heart of our MCAO system consists of three deformable mirrors conjugated to three different altitudes covering the ground to about 11 km above, and operating under a complex control system. The MCAO system in Big Bear is a pathbreaker for the MCAO system to come on DKIST (Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope).

Our primary goal here was to extendClear into the near IR, which entailed new optical elements for MCAO and design/construction of an optical setup feeding MCAO corrected light to Focal Plane Instrumentation.  In Figure 1, we show the first ever vector magnetogram resulting from MCAO corrected solar light was fed to BBSO's Near IR Imaging Spectropolarimeter (NIRIS).
