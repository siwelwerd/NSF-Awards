 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this study, supported by the Chemical Structure Dynamics and Mechanism (CSDM-A), Chemical Catalysis (CAT) and Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Randall Goldsmith and his research team at the University of Wisconsin Madison seek to better understand how chemical catalysts perform their important functions.  Catalysts allow difficult chemical reactions to be proceed, but how they do this may involve many individual steps that are difficult to follow.  Professor Goldsmith is using a new approach that combines optical microscopy, the light-emitting behaviors of certain molecules (in this case, a property called \"fluorescence\"), and nanotechnology to to allow observation of single catalyst molecules.  The Goldsmith team is essentially developing \"molecular movies\" of an individual operational catalysts. This research project is not only providing new insights into catalytic chemical reactions, but also developing a laboratory technique that may be useful in many other chemistry, biology and materials science investigations.  The students involved in this research are gaining a wide range of skills, from chemical synthesis, optical microscopy, and nano-fabrication.\r\n \r\nIn particular, the project focuses on palladium cross-coupling reactions, which are widely employed in the pharmaceutical industry. A critical element is the use of nanophotonic devices that sculpt light to make it substantially smaller than the diffraction-limit, allowing observation of single-molecule dynamics at chemically relevant concentrations.  Individual catalyst molecules are immobilized in these devices and studied via single-molecule fluorescence microscopy.  A major readout is the time-varying rate constant of a single catalyst molecule and the timescale of transient intermediates.  The broader impacts of this work include the societal benefits of a mechanistic tool that can inform the design of the next generation of catalyst molecules, the training of students in interdisciplinary chemical sciences, and the development of single-molecule visualization demos that can be deployed in schools to broaden participation of STEM minorities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The specific bond formation and dissociation details are important to understanding the mechanism of product formation as well as where opportunities exist for designing better catalysts and catalytic systems. In bulk catalysis systems, molecule-to-molecule variability or rare events are hidden within the averaged behavior of the system.

ZMWs are nanophotonic devices consisting of 50-200 nm cylindrical holes in 100nm of aluminum on glass. In a review paper in ACS Measurement Science, &ldquo;Strategies for Overcoming the Single-Molecule Concentration Barrier&rdquo; we argued that ZMWs can be used to observe rare events that cannot be observed in bulk or in traditional low-concentration single-molecule experiments.

After initiation to dissociate the fluorescent &ldquo;throw away&rdquo; ligand to yield an active catalyst and then photobleaching any remaining intact catalysis molecules, a micromolar solution of fluorescently-labeled &ldquo;throw away&rdquo; ligand is introduced to the now mostly dark ZMW.

This story, &ldquo;The Role of Experimental Noise in a Hybrid Classical-Molecular Computer to Solve Combinatorial Optimization Problems&rdquo; was published in ACS Central Science. In another effort, supported students used their fluorescent microscopy setup to monitor the release of lithium ions from cathode microparticles by using a proxy fluorophore that only becomes fluorescent in the presence of lithium ions.
