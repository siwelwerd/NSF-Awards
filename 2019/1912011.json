This project at Cheyney University of Pennsylvania provides a strategic approach to recruiting and retaining computer science undergraduates by involving them in research projects that lead to curriculum enhancements in undergraduate courses. \r\n\r\nThis one-year pilot project seeks to create a set of research tools and projects to involve undergraduate students in computer science related research, expose them to learning activities outside of the classroom, and subsequently capture learning objectives and develop learning modules to be incorporated into undergraduate computer science courses.  The students will conduct research at the home campus, as well as on the campus of Drexel University. The project is guided by formative and summative evaluation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOver the life of the project, opportunities have been provided for 13 Drexel University students and 12 Cheyney Universitystudents to participate in research projects.  This has increased their breadth of understanding and has led to their additional commitments to seek careers in STEM disciplines.\n\nAnother significant result of this project was that it has positively impacted students to understand both the theoretical and practical application of digital research in our everyday lives.  Whether it be through the application of character recognition technology to enhance security systems or the use of 3-D imaging to remotely measure and assess the status of crops, the students have seen and embodied the concepts and are looking towards additional applications for these technologies.  This experience should both lead to better understanding as well as more rapid innovation by these students. \n\nThe project has also allowed for the investigators and other collaborators to expand their exposure to these digital applications.  This additional experience will be brought back into the classroom so that the education of students who were not part of this project will also be impacted.  The laboratory space that was set up for this project will continue to show educational and experimental benefits for years to come.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/28/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steve Hughes"
