 "awd_abstract_narration": "This goal of this project is to improve aerosol-based drug delivery systems for people with obstructive lung disease.  The distribution of aerosol-based drugs is strongly affected by airflows in the lung.  Controlling the size and density of drug-containing aerosol droplets can ensure drugs penetrate deep and distribute uniformly throughout the lungs.  However, airflow patterns are altered when lungs are obstructed by excess mucus deposits or airway constrictions, and aerosol droplets deposit on or upstream of obstructions. This project will investigate an alternative strategy that maximizes dispersal of drugs after the aerosol droplets have landed on the lung airway surface.  Surfactant molecules will be incorporated into the aerosol droplets so that the surface tension near droplets after they land will vary along the lung surface.  The gradient in surface tension will induce a flow in the thin airway surface liquid (ASL) films that line the airways. Flow in the ASL will carry drugs past obstructions.  However, if the surface tension gradient exceeds a critical value, the ASL film may rupture, leaving a dry patch on underlying tissue that would diminish drug dispersal. This project will assess phenomena that influence film rupture and address its effects on drug transport. The results of this research will provide the fundamental knowledge needed to design aerosols that will enhance distribution of drugs for many obstructive lung diseases, including cystic fibrosis, pneumonia, and acute or chronic pulmonary infections.  Undergraduates and graduate students will join a multidisciplinary team to carry out the research and to mentor middle school students who will perform experiments exploring physical processes in medicine, under the Carnegie Mellon/Colfax Physics Concepts Outreach Program.\r\n\r\nThis project will address two unstudied phenomena in model systems that represent the crucial Marangoni flow hydrodynamics for aerosol-based drug delivery.  The first is prompted by a recent discovery of the detailed structure of the two-layer ASL.  Consisting of densely tethered mucin chains, the bottom layer of the ASL resembles a fluid-saturated porous medium.   Slip at the interface between the upper fluid layer and the porous medium is hypothesized to retard dewetting, and fluid flow out of the porous medium may promote rewetting.  Experiments and modeling will quantify how the lower layer porosity affects dewetting and rewetting transitions for films of varying thickness and varying surface tension gradients.  The second phenomenon addresses the coupled roles of geometry and gravity.  In a planar geometry, the dewetting transition is dictated by a balance of Marangoni, or surface tension gradient, stresses and gravitational stresses.  The effect of gravitational orientation on Marangoni forced dewetting has not been considered previously even though multiple orientations are present for Marangoni flows on the inner wall of a cylindrical conduit.  Experiments and modeling will quantify how dewetting transitions vary with deposition locus, cylinder radius and cylinder orientation in Marangoni flows inside a film-coated cylindrical tube that mimics a lung airway.  An optical technique will be used to track quantitatively the evolution of film height profiles and reveal occurrences of dewetting or rewetting.  This will be coupled with separate measures of soluble dye (a drug mimic) advection by the Marangoni flow.  Models developed for the project will be tested in experimentally accessible conditions and then used to predict behaviors in the conditions more typical of the lung.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nOverview: The research supported by this grant was initially motivated by an opportunity to improve aerosol drug delivery systems by increasing the depth and uniformity of drug distribution in lungs of patients with obstructive lung diseases. While deep lung penetration in unobstructed lungs may be enhanced by engineering the aerosol aerodynamic size, aerosol deposition on airway constrictions and mucus accumulations severely limits drug access to diseased sites via gas-phase aerosol transport in obstructed lungs. This group has been pursuing an alternative approach, based on maximizing post-deposition drug dispersal, to reach diseased sites downstream of obstructions. By formulating aerosol drug carriers with not only the soluble drugs but also surfactants that locally decrease surface tension after aerosol deposition, drugs are dispersed past obstructions along the airway surface liquid via surface tension gradient-driven Marangoni flows. In addition to this motivation, this research was also motivated by the many coating technologies where fluids are spray coated or dip coated onto solid surfaces. Such coatings are highly susceptible to defects caused by Marangoni flows. To address the essential issues presented by these motivations, the research had to reach beyond the rather simplistic regimes previously treated in examination of Marangoni driven spreading.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntellectual Merit: In this research project, we have reached beyond the traditionally treated regimes to examine Marangoni spreading on vertical surfaces, on the inside of tubes, on surfaces with physical texture, on thicker films of less viscous fluids, when surfactant already exists on the surface, and when multiple deposited drops spread into each other. We have found that spreading on vertical surfaces is dramatically different from spreading on horizontal surfaces in ways that could dramatically impact applications, essentially all of which involve surfaces tilted compared to gravity. Spreading on textured surfaces has shown rich, new spreading behavior as the surfactants spread across the various thickness fluid layers imposed by the surface texture. As we have moved to thicker, less viscous films, we leave the safe haven of the lubrication approximation and move to spreading where capillary waves, which occur on surfaces when no surfactant is present, and Marangoni driven waves mix and produce new spreading patterns. While inhibited, we have shown that Marangoni spreading will still occur even in the presence of surfactant preabsorbed to the surface. The Marangoni spreading in many applications, including the aerosol drug delivery, are applied as sprays where multiple drops containing surfactant are deposited and spread into each other. Our work has shown distinct patterns of droplet avoidance as they try to spread into each other.\n\n\n\n\n\nBroader Impacts: This research contributes to the determination of the fundamental mechanisms of surfactant-driven flows that dictate the performance of surfactant-enabled, self-dispersing aerosol formulations for pulmonary drug delivery. It will enable mechanism-based aerosol formulation designs to enhance distribution of therapeutics throughout the lungs for many obstructive lung diseases, including cystic fibrosis, pneumonia, and other acute or chronic pulmonary infections. Besides their fundamental importance to aerosol drug delivery, the hydrodynamics of surfactant-driven flows are also crucial to understanding defects and controlling film uniformity in coating technologies. The team focused its research on fundamental hydrodynamics motivated by drug delivery and coating technologies. We have collaborated with pulmonary medicine specialists in the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine where new fundamental findings have guided in vivo and ex vivo aerosol delivery studies. This grant has provided the opportunity for the investigators to mentor two undergraduates (both female), eight M.S. students (four female) and three Ph.D. students (one female) and two postdoctoral fellows.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/15/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: StephenGaroff\n"
