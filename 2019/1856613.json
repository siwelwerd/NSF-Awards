 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this Award, the Chemical Synthesis Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry supports the research of Professor Daniel Seidel of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Florida.  The ability to prepare complex molecules in the most cost-effective way possible is directly dependent on the availability of sustainable synthetic methodologies.  The new synthetic methods that emerge from this work may provide novel ways to make biologically important compounds such as polycyclic ethers, amines, and indole containing substances, which should, in turn, help advance the chemical industry, which itself is linked to the US economy.  The research provides training for graduate and undergraduate student, preparing them for future careers in industry and academia. Underrepresented minority students are actively recruited to participate. Students working on this project gain expertise in modern synthetic methods and laboratory techniques while being exposed to an intellectually stimulating and challenging environment.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to advance the field of asymmetric catalysis on a fundamental level through exploration of conceptually new and underdeveloped methods of substrate activation.  A major goal is the development of reactions that produce enantiomerically enriched products through intervention of chiral ion pairs.  Novel Bronsted acids and hydrogen bond donor catalysts are explored to facilitate enantioselective processes and address challenging synthetic problems.  A focus is on reactions that proceed via the intermediacy of highly reactive oxocarbenium ions and related species.  Multifunctional catalysts are being developed with the goal of achieving enzyme-like catalysis under mild reaction conditions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award resulted in the further development of chiral conjugate-base-stabilized Bronsted acids, effective catalysts for several challenging asymmetric transformations.  The conjugate-base-stabilized Bronsted acids developed in our lab contain a chiral backbone and both a thiourea and carboxylic acid functionality which are connected via an amide linkage.  These highly acidic catalysts, rivaling the acidity of common BINOL-derived phosphoric acids, were shown to facilitate asymmetric cyclizations of acyclic ketone-derived trisubstituted oxocarbenium ions, providing access to highly enantioenriched dihydropyran products containing a tetrasubstituted stereogenic center.  Catalysts were also found to enable highly enantioselective Pictet-Spengler reactions of N-9-fluorenyltryptamines with a range of aldehydes.  Reactions perform particularly well with aromatic aldehydes, tolerating electronically diverse substituents in all ring positions.  Electron-deficient tryptamines are viable substrates.  Importantly, removal of the fluorenyl protecting group is readily accomplished without deterioration of product ee.  While our initial design of chiral carboxylic acids was based on a chiral 1,2-diamine backbone, our second-generation design utilizes more readily available 1,2-amino alcohols (change of amide-linkage to ester linkage).  This change resulted in significantly more active and stereoselective catalysts, enabling challenging [4 + 2] cycloadditions of salicylaldehyde-derived acetals with homoallylic and bishomoallylic alcohols to provide polycyclic chromanes in a highly enantioselective fashion.\n\nAn enantioselective oxa-Pictet-Spengler reaction of tryptophol with aldehydes was developed that proceeds under weakly acidic conditions.  Our approach utilizes a combination of two catalysts, an indoline HCl salt and a bisthiourea compound.  Mechanistic investigations revealed the roles of both catalysts and confirmed the involvement of oxocarbenium ion intermediates, ruling out alternative scenarios.  A stereochemical model was derived from density functional theory calculations.  This provided the basis for the development of a highly enantioselective stereodivergent variant with racemic tryptophol derivatives, enabling rapid access to stereochemically rich tetrahydropyrano[3,4-b]indoles in highly enantioenriched form.\n\nAnother achievement resulting from this project is the development of a catalytic enantioselective conjugate addition of cyclic amines to unactivated alpha,beta-unsaturated esters, providing beta-amino esters with high levels of enantioselectivity.  This method is also applicable to the kinetic resolution of racemic cyclic 2-arylamines, using benzyl acrylate as the resolving agent.  Reactions are facilitated by an unprecedented selenourea-thiourea organocatalyst.  As elucidated by DFT calculations and 13C kinetic isotope effect studies, the rate-limiting and enantiodetermining step of the reaction is the protonation of a zwitterionic intermediate by the catalyst.  This represents a rare case in which a thiourea compound functions as an asymmetric Bronsted acid catalyst.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/31/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel Seidel"
