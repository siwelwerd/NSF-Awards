 "awd_abstract_narration": "The international workshop \"Australian-German Workshop on Differential Geometry in the Large\" will take place from February 4-15, 2019, at the MATRIX institute of the University of Melbourne in Creswick, Australia. This workshop has two parts. The first week (February 4-8) will involve an international conference with high-profile speakers who are prominent researchers, mentors, and leaders of professional organizations in Australia, Germany, the U.S., and elsewhere. A research symposium will take place in the second week. Participants will meet in research groups close to their primary research interests. Three goals of this two-part workshop are to highlight recent advances in the geometry, foster communication between experts and early-career researchers, and identify avenues for future work. All three goals will benefit graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and other early-career mathematicians. The award supports participation of US researchers in this event.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\nThe academic focus of the meeting is on recent developments in differential geometry, geometric analysis, and associated topics in differential topology. The plenary speakers were chosen in part with these topics in mind. In addition, the four subjects according to which the participants will be grouped in the second week are as follows:\r\n         - Geometric evolution equations and curvature flow\r\n         - Structures on manifolds and mathematical physics\r\n         - Higher invariants and positive scalar curvature\r\n         - Recent developments in non-negative sectional curvature\r\n        The results presented in this workshop, as well as a summary of the problem session, is tentatively planned to be published in the London Mathematical Society's Lecture Note Series, as well as in the 2019 MATRIX Annals volume of the MATRIX Book Series. In addition, this information will be made freely available through the arXiv. The webpage for the workshop is below.\r\n        \r\n        https://www.matrix-inst.org.au/events/australian-german-workshop-on-differential-geometry-in-the-large-conference/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
