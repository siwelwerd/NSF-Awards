 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plasma is a gas-like state of matter with properties determined by collective interactions between free-roaming electrons and ions. In this project, ultra-intense lasers will be used to create, control and study plasmas.  Pulses of laser light from modern lasers can be made so focused as to allow the laser fields to push on electrons like a snowplow. In this project, the laser pulses are shaped so that they travel with a tilt, much as a tilted snowplow blade scoops up the snow and pushes it to the side.  With careful laser control, the electrons can be separated from the ions and be formed by such a tilted snowplow into a beam. If the range of electron beam angles and energies can be made as small as the calculations predict, and the beam energy as high as the calculations predict, the electron beam can be used to study materials, or be boosted to even higher energies with additional particle acceleration techniques.  The project will support and train one PhD student and two undergraduate students at the Colorado School of Mines.\r\n \r\nThis project exploits the structuring of the spatial and temporal shape of intense, ultrafast laser pulses to control electron dynamics in plasmas. One type of structuring that will be used is where the spectral components of the laser pulse are overlapped at the focus with an incident angle that is linearly dependent on the frequency. This results in a pulse that sweeps across the focal plane with a speed that can be much lower than the speed of light. This reduced speed allows the light pressure on the electrons to capture and accelerate them to the side. With careful shaping of the transverse intensity profile, theory predicts electrons can be accelerated with a narrow energy and angular spread, making them useful for ultrafast electron diffraction and injection into other laser-based electron accelerators. In this project, the physics of this acceleration mechanism will be experimentally and computationally explored. At higher density, the fast current pulse created by this mechanism is predicted to produce terahertz radiation that will be characterized with novel single pixel imaging techniques. Another method of structuring the laser light involves converting the polarization state of the laser beam to transverse electric. When this azimuthally polarized beam is focused tightly, the magnetic field develops a longitudinal component on axis that can be over 10 kTesla, orders of magnitude higher than the strongest magnets. A short wavelength probe beam propagating along this field will be used to probe how waves are altered by this strong magnetic field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

As conventional particle accelerators begin to reach their limits, more research is being directed to using lasers rather than radio-frequency electromagnetic waves. Substantial progress has already been made in using lasers to create a charge-separation wave that trails the laser pulse. This laser wakefield approach can accelerate electrons to over a thousand times the rest-mass energy of electrons. However, an outstanding problem remains in being able to accelerate large numbers of electrons from zero velocity to close to the speed of light, so that they can ride the plasma wakefield. Our approach to electron acceleration is to use the pressure of the laser beam directly, without relying on the charge separation between electrons and ions. For electrons to be captured by this moving laser pulse, we must slow the speed of the pulse. This is illustrated in one dimension by Figure 1, where in Fig. 1a, the potential hill moves too quickly to capture the particle, and Fig. 1b the slower speed allows the wave to capture and accelerate the electron.</p>\n<p>To control the effective speed of the interaction of the laser pulse with the electrons, we tilt the pulse front so that one side of the beam crosses the focal plane earliest. The pulse then moves across the focal plane from one side to the other. Tilting the pulse is possible by crossing the different wavelength components of the pulse with an anglular sweep, as illustrated in the dark box in Figure 2. The light-pressure then pushes on the electrons in the direction perpendicular to the pulse front.</p>\n<p>In the first part of this project we further developed our theory for this process and implemented these sculpted pulses into a sophisticated open-source code that calculates particle trajectories accounting for forces from the laser and other particles. We also worked on how to experimentally realize these tilted pulses at a high-intensity laser facility. Figure 2 shows our design for replacing a conventional diffraction-grating based pulse compressor with one where there is an asymmetric distance between the first two gratings (G1-G2) and the second two (G3-G4). This design produces the wavelength sweep required for making the tilted pulses at the focal plane. To ensure good alignment of such a complicated optical system, we improved our techniques for aligning the diffraction gratings and developed a new algorithm for measuring the pulses at the focus.</p>\n<p>The project culminated in the planning and execution of an experiment at the Advanced Beam Facility, located at Colorado State University. With a thousand times more pulse energy than is available at our university lab, our collaborators there worked with us to implement our pulse compressor design. After constructing the pulse compressor and aligning the optics, we were able to demonstrate for the first time that spatio-temporally structured light pulses can be used to harness light-pressure (the &lsquo;ponderomotive force&rsquo;). These pulses structured with the tilt capture the nearly stationary electrons and accelerate them to close to the speed of light. Figure 3a shows an overhead view of the target chamber for our experiment. The spatially-chirped beam was focused by a parabolic mirror onto a gas jet placed in vacuum. The leading edge of the pulse was intense enough to fully ionize the gas, producing electrons to be accelerated. To see the electron beam, we placed a scintillating screen to the side of the focus to convert the energetic electrons to light that could be viewed by a camera placed outside vacuum. Figure 3b shows a representative signal for the electron beam emerging from the interaction region. The beam is concentrated in a direction close to the angle predicted by our theory. The vertical spread is consistent with the fact that the intensity profile has a convex shape. Figure 3c shows a measurement of the electron energy distribution obtained with a magnetic electron spectrometer. The output energy spread is ~2x lower than what is predicted, but the discrepancy is within the margin of error.</p>\n<p>The experiment, which was just completed at the end of the project period, shows that this acceleration mechanism behaves reasonably well according to the predictions of our theory. Our theory also shows that the energy and angular distributions can be narrowed substantially by shaping the intensity profile of the laser focal spot so that the tilted pulse has a flatter intensity profile. This technique for acceleration could find uses as a first stage of laser-based acceleration as well as an electron source for for ultrafast electron diffraction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/21/2023<br>\nModified by: Charles&nbsp;G&nbsp;Durfee</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1903709/1903709_10605428_1703182537357_Durfee_outcomes_fig3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1903709/1903709_10605428_1703182537357_Durfee_outcomes_fig3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1903709/1903709_10605428_1703182537357_Durfee_outcomes_fig3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(a) Target chamber overhead view.
