 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Antonio Simonetti, of the University of Notre Dame, along with Dr. Michele Buzon, of Purdue University, will investigate the impact of climate change on the isotopic signature of bioavailable strontium during the last ~4,000 years within the Nile River Valley. This project builds on previous research collaborations by both principal investigators that have established immigration patterns and cultural interactions in ancient civilizations for Egyptian and Nubian sites within the Nile River Valley based primarily on strontium isotope signatures of archaeological faunal (soil, animal, plant) and human samples. The results from this first time, detailed investigation will accurately trace any temporal change in the regional distribution of bioavailable strontium driven by a drying climate within the Nile River Valley. This approach will prove extremely useful for other regions around the globe where recent climatic conditions have changed significantly during the archaeological period of interest. Strontium isotopes in soil and living and fossil materials vary on a regional basis and using isotope ratios scientists can trace how individual during their lifetimes moved between regions. This project will provide insight into whether environmental factors can change ratios in a single area. This project will include training of graduate students in state-of-the-art isotope techniques, and they will also be directly involved in analyzing and interpreting results. This study will include participation of the American Sudanese Archaeological Research Center (AmSARC), which has a mission to encourage American and Sudanese archaeological research and collaboration in Sudan.\r\n\r\nDrs. Simonetti and Buzon will expand coverage of samples investigated by determining the strontium, lead, and neodymium isotope signatures of faunal, soil, plant and human samples from combined 20 sites along the Nile River occupied over various time periods, and compare these results to those from their present-day counterparts. Samples will also be obtained from collections of pertinent museums worldwide. Assessing the bioavailable strontium for the Nile River Valley will also rely on synthesizing existing strontium isotope data obtained by both PIs from ~250 specimens, which consist of both archaeological human and faunal samples investigated from Egyptian (Memphis, Qurneh) and Nubian (Shellal, C-Group, Pharaonic, Amara West, Tombos, Kerma) sites. These combined results will help to characterize the isotope variability and better understand human mobility in this region, which is rich with sociopolitical transitions and contact between groups. The results obtained from this project will help elucidate any input or influence of Holocene climate change within the Nile River Valley for the past ~4,000 years. By comparing archaeological or paleo-strontium isotope signatures of faunal samples to their present-day counterparts, our study will provide a better understanding of aeolian (wind-driven) contribution, if any, within the Nile River Valley. The proposed research will have major implications for archaeologists conducting isotope-based investigations of ancient migrations around the globe since climate change is a phenomenon that has occurred throughout Earth's history. For the Nile River Valley, this has involved a drying of the African Humid Period, which have taken place in other regions of our planet.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It is argued that the increased contribution of aeolian material from the neighboring Sahara Desert during the last ~7,000 years has changed the isotope compositions of bioavailable Sr relative to the geological background and thus hinders provenance investigations of human remains within the NRVS.</p>\n<p>Our recently published paper (Simonetti et al., 2023; <em>Bioarchaeology International;</em>&nbsp;DOI: 10.5744/bi.2022.0024) reports new trace element and strontium (Sr), neodymium (Nd), and lead (Pb) isotope compositions for a combined total of 125 samples consisting of human tooth enamel and various faunal samples from different time periods, and present-day botanical samples from 11 archaeological sites along the NRVS. The new isotope data combined with published data do not support a time-dependent increase in a Saharan aeolian bioavailable Sr component during the Holocene within the NRVS (please see accompanying figure of Time vs. 87Sr/86Sr ratios); in general, Sr isotope compositions for human enamel samples match those of their corresponding faunal matrices, and these define a similar range of isotope compositions over the various time periods. The Nd and Pb isotope compositions for human tooth enamel reported here also support the limited contribution of Saharan aeolian dust within the NVRS.</p>\n<p>Our research also focused on carefully evaluating post-mortem diagenetic alteration of tooth enamel since if it has occurred, combined post-burial physical, chemical, and biological processes may lead to alteration of original isotopic signatures. Hence, Simonetti et al. (2021, <em>Applied Geochemistry</em>; DOI:10.1016/j.apgeochem.2021.105068) reports&nbsp;new trace element and Pb and Sr isotope compositions of tooth enamel from archaeological remains at a Medieval (Christian) cemetery located adjacent to the Kushite royal cemetery of El-Kurru, Sudan. The archaeological site of El-Kurru is located along the Nile River on the southern edge of the Nubian Plateau; the bedrock geology consists of Neoproterozoic crystalline basement and is overlain by fluvial sandstones and mudstones of Cretaceous age. El-Kurru is situated between two well-developed drainage basins, and in the past has been subjected to periodic (wadi-related) flooding as a result of intense local precipitation events. Enamel samples were taken from 18 individuals of varying ages and both sexes. Trace element abundances for a significant number of samples record elevated concentrations relative to modern (?in-vivo?) enamel, including Pb and U; however, the abundances for both elements do not correlate significantly with the contents of the remaining trace elements (Ba, Fe, Mg, Mn, Nd, Sr) investigated here. The calculated enrichment factors for all trace elements studied here relative to average crustal values are not consistent with exposure to Pb ores for human purposes, which is corroborated by the Pb isotope results. The Sr isotope compositions define 2 main groups that yield 87Sr/86Sr ratios that are either higher or lower than 0.7072 with similar Sr abundances (range between ~100 and ~400 ppm). The Pb isotope compositions are extremely variable and correlate well with their corresponding U/Pb ratios; the former overlap Pb isotope ratios for proximal Neoproterozoic rocks belonging to the Saharan Metacraton and Arabian Nubian Shield tectonic provinces. The combined trace element abundances and Sr and Pb isotope compositions for the enamel samples located within the Christian cemetery at El-Kurru are best interpreted to record interaction with groundwater that occurred post-mortem during flooding events. As reported in previous anthropological studies of a similar nature, the Pb isotope results reported here are particularly sensitive to monitoring post mortem diagenetic alteration given their extremely low abundances in non-altered tooth enamel. In contrast, the 87Sr/86Sr ratios have been minimally perturbed by post mortem alteration, and therefore most likely represent individuals with distinct Sr isotopic signatures inherited from different geographic regions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/27/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Antonio&nbsp;Simonetti</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1916718/1916718_10610133_1690464552179_Figure_7_Simonettietal_Rev_12052022--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1916718/1916718_10610133_1690464552179_Figure_7_Simonettietal_Rev_12052022--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Sr isotope compositions of tooth enamel and faunal samples within the Nile River Valley System during the past ~7000 years.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1916718/1916718_10610133_1690464552179_Figure_7_Simonettietal_Rev_12052022--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Sr isotope compositions of tooth enamel and faunal samples within the Nile River Valley System during the past ~7000 years.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Time (years before present) versus 87Sr/86Sr ratios for samples investigated here and those from literature data for samples located within the NVRS.
