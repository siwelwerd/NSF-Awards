 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is funding to support participation by approximately 7 graduate students and 3 postdocs in the 28th International Meshing Roundtable (IMR) and to cover some of the expenses associated with the IMR short courses which are specifically targeted to this cohort.  The IMR conference was created in 1992 to serve as a focal point for an international community of researchers from academia, national labs and industry to discuss the latest work in mesh and grid generation along with allied topics such as meshing for high-performance and distributed computing, parallel meshing, high-order meshing, mesh adaptivity, mesh warping, computational geometry, computer-aided design issues, visualization of meshes, and applications of meshes in finite element analysis.  Organized by Sandia National Laboratories, these events are the premier conference in this field.  IMR 2019 will be held October 14-17, 2019, in Buffalo NY, and will include, in addition to the short courses, plenary talks, presentation of scientific papers, a poster session, a meshing contest, an open spaces session, and a user forum.  This award will be used for student/postdoc conference registration, short course registration, and travel and living expenses for the students and the short course instructors (about 4).  Increased student and postdoc attendance at the 2019 IMR will be beneficial to the meshing research community, in that the community's newest members will be given the opportunity to participate in the premier meshing conference and to further their knowledge and training in the field. Accordingly, this opportunity will increase the number of young people prepared for meshing careers in the United States.  \r\n\r\nAttendance at the 2019 IMR will be beneficial to students and postdocs.  They will be exposed to a large number of topics in meshing and related areas through presentations and short courses, which is important given that very few U.S. universities offer specialized training on mesh generation.  In addition, students and postdocs will be able to present their research and gain valuable feedback on it from the international research community.  Furthermore, they will be able to meet and network with meshing professionals from academia, industry, and government laboratories.  This will boost their academic career and network of contacts, fostering development in mesh generation and its applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
