 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Early Bronze Age (EBA) in the Near East is characterized by marked sociopolitical and economic changes.  In particular, social stratification, urbanization, extensive intra- and interregional trade networks, and population movement and densification are notable features of this period.  While archaeological investigations have bolstered understanding of each of these aspects, bioarchaeological investigations are in a unique position through the use of human remains to address questions of population interaction, social organization, and community formation.  This research will investigate the complex interaction between population density, population diversity, and culture contact in the development of incipient urbanization, migration, and the production of community identities.  Such research has modern-day implications regarding the human response to population density and diversity, urban and neighborhood development, migration, and inter-population interaction.  International collaboration will be fostered between several institutions in both the United States and Turkey.  This project will also contribute to the training of an undergraduate student in bioarchaeological and statistical skills and encourage the participation of underrepresented groups in biological anthropology.  Results from this research will be shared through publication in several academic journals, international and domestic lectures, and data will be shared in the digital data repository, ScholarWorks.\r\n\r\nThis research will examine the community formation practices and demographic processes of EBA Anatolia using the site Karata-Semay (c. 2800-2300 BCE) in southwestern Anatolia.  This settlement exhibits evidence of emerging hierarchy, neighborhood formation, homogenous architectural and burial practices, and involvement in the interregional trade networks of the Eastern Mediterranean.  Utilizing dental metric and morphological data collected on both permanent and deciduous dentitions, this research will conduct intra- and inter-site analyses to investigate biological relatedness between individuals and sites, respectively.  Such analyses contribute to understanding of the social organization of individuals within a single community; postmarital residence practices; kinship construction; extent of biological and, by proxy, cultural diversity; and region of origin.  This information, in conjunction with archaeological and mortuary data, will be used to identify how early settlements developed and how individuals negotiated common community identities and formed social units.  This research will further anthropological understanding of early urban development, population movement, social organization, and human reaction to diversity during the EBA.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In addition to increasing settlement number, there was also a simultaneous increase in settlement size and inter-cultural contact. Considering these factors, the funded research sought to examine how <strong>population density, diversity, </strong>and <strong>culture contact</strong> biologically and socially affected the population of ancient Anatolia. In particular, the project investigated how these factors may have facilitated the construction of community identities in early EBA society. A small EBA settlement located in southwestern Anatolia, Karata&#351;-Semay&uuml;k (i.e., Karata&#351;) was the primary settlement examined to address this research objective. This site serves as an excellent sample for understanding the <em>process </em>of urbanization as it: contains monumental architecture, indications of emerging social stratification (e.g., specialized mortuary treatment of a single individual), period of quickly increasing population size during its occupation, and a large skeletal collection. As such, four objectives were specifically examined as a part of this project: 1) to evaluate the biological diversity of the Eastern Mediterranean, 2) to analyze the biological relationships of Karata&#351; inhabitants to other Eastern Mediterranean settlements, 3) to assess the possibility of biological kinship expressed through mortuary treatment, and 4) to evaluate the postmarital residence pattern practiced by Karata&#351; inhabitants. These objectives serve to illustrate the biological diversity, relationships, and movement across the region and to assess how individuals interacted with people of diverse backgrounds and how the basic social unit of a community was constructed. These objectives were addressed using dental morphological and metric variables of the permanent and deciduous (primary) teeth of Karata&#351;, as well as comparative raw data from &Ccedil;ine-Tepecik and Laodikeia from EBA southwest Anatolia and Neolithic &Ccedil;atalh&ouml;y&uuml;k from central Anatolia, and data from the literature on other sites in the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;There were several major results: 1) EBA Anatolia was a phenotypically diverse period, particularly in comparison to surrounding areas of the Eastern Mediterranean; 2) the Karata&#351; settlement was composed of a predominantly local population, with evidence of limited external migration to the area; 3) southwestern Anatolian EBA populations were descended from Neolithic Anatolian populations, with some evidence of possible gene flow from places like Cyprus; 4) decision-making processes regarding burial location were not strictly based on biological ties, but involved a negotiation of biological and social identities; and 5) Karata&#351; inhabitants practiced a patrilocal residence pattern. These results suggest that, in addition to uniform architectural and mortuary practices and material culture, the practice of communal burial of non-biologically related individuals and potential migrants served to create cohesive social bonds. Although results indicate significant biological continuity from the Neolithic to the EBA in Anatolia, southwest Anatolia shows similarity in dental size and shape to roughly contemporary Cypriot populations, supporting the possibility that Anatolian migrants to Cyprus in the EBA may have come from the southwest portion of the peninsula.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The outcomes of this study also contribute to several areas of theoretical and methodological development. The addition of both deciduous and permanent dental data for the EBA Near East is critical for holistically understanding demographic and social changes in the period. Furthermore, the study contributes to ongoing research comparing deciduous and permanent results of similar populations. This study has also illustrated the potential of fuzzy logic techniques in bioarchaeological contexts for understanding human variation.
