 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Korteweg-de Vries equation was originally introduced (in the 1890s) to give a simple effective explanation of the observation of solitary waves on the surface of shallow channels of water.  Solitary waves travel large distances while maintaining their original shape.  This is exceptional and represents a subtle interaction between two phenomena: (1) Dispersion, which results in longer waves traveling faster (e.g. tsunami travel much faster than the wind waves seen at the beach). (2) Nonlinearity, which makes large amplitude waves travel faster than shorter waves (this effect also manifests in waves traveling faster in deeper water).  These two effects are important in many wave systems and controlling their interactions plays an important role also in technology, such as fibre-optic communication.  The Korteweg--de Vries equation and its close relations provide a simple elegant framework both for deepening our understanding of these effects and also for educating future scientists, at all levels of preparation, about these important topics.\r\n\r\nThe study of both invariant measures for dispersive PDE and stochastic forcing raise challenging questions in the low-regularity theory of dispersive PDE.  A major theme of this project is to tackle such problems in the setting of the Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV) by employing new techniques developed recently by M. Visan and the PI.  In their current form, these methods exploit the complete integrability of KdV in a significant way.  A key goal in selecting the progression of problems to be studied is to investigate how robust these methods are against perturbations that destroy this complete integrability.  A second major component of the project is the adaptation of the new methods to other completely integrable systems, most notably the nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLS) and the modified KdV equation (mKdV).  The third facet of the project is the study of threshold solutions, namely, those that lie at the boundary between scattering and more complicated behaviour.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe central goal of this project was to advance our understanding of a special class of models in mathematical physics, known as completely integrable systems.  These are important effective models which have been found to describe the evolution of a wide array of physical systems, including plasmas, light, and condensed matter.  The property that sets them apart is the existence of infinitely many conserved quantities.\n\nAccompanying this multitude of conserved quantities, completely integrable systems invariably have a rich algebraic structure and correspondingly have been studied from many points of view and by many different techniques.  Nevertheless, despite receiving wide and enduring attention, the classes in which one has well-posedness had not previously been settled.  A major theme in this project was to settle this matter by adapting and advancing the method of commuting flows, which was recently introduced by the PI and his collaborator M. Visan.  The successes achieved in this direction include the modified Korteweg--de Vries equation (both Miura and Hirota variants), the cubic nonlinear Schrodinger equation, the derivative nonlinear Schrodinger equation, and the Benjamin--Ono equation.\n\nOther outcomes of this project that are independent of the well-posedness question include (i) new stability results for an important class of special solutions to the Korteweg--de Vries equation, known as multisolitons, (ii) showing that a well-known discrete analogue of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation is well-approximated by the continuum version, and (iii) the development of a new method for recovering the nonlinearity of a general nonlinear evolution from its scattering behavior.\n\nOver the course of the project, four postdoctoral researchers and four graduate students were mentored and incorporated into some of the project's most promising research directions.  In addition to stipends for their research activities, the project also aided these graduate students in attending conferences and workshops and so allowed them not only to present the results of their work on the project, but also to broaden their perspectives and develop as independent scientists.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/03/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rowan B Killip"
