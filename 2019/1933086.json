This summer school provides an important and valuable educational opportunity for students to study foundational topics related to programming languages and verification. The topics of this year's school are related to the foundations of probabilistic programming and security. The exploration of these topics is of extreme importance: probabilistic programs are now widely used in different areas of computing science including machine learning and statistical data analysis, while tools that guarantee the security of software are fundamental for building applications that are reliable and robust. \r\n\r\nThe significance and importance of the summer school include building international community and cooperation in foundational research areas, and enhancing education of US students, including underrepresented minorities, by exposure to and interaction with leading-edge research and researchers. By supporting US-based students, the school will thus train the next generation of programming languages and security researchers and practitioners in both industry and academia. Around 20 students will be supported as part of this award.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
