 "awd_abstract_narration": "The challenge to educators is to find avenues to the audience that are effective at transforming their minds and thinking mechanisms so that the learner can confidentaly go forward to embrace the next frontier. The STEM+C (STEM + Computing Partnerships) program has as its goal the integration of computation and science. This project seeks new and innovative avenues to empower the learners with science and computation as one integral unit. Prior work on Culturally Situated Design Tools (CSDTs) showed statistically significant improvement for under-represented students. The original focus was on simulations of cultural arts and helping students discover \"heritage algorithms\" for new virtual designs. Now, the investigators wish to expand CSDTs to include computational activities into Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and other social motivations such as civic engagement and environmental concepts. CSDTs has now been simplified which allows students use of a programming platform to explore culturally-based STEM topics and share their code through an online user community. The students will learn how to program and apply their ideas to computational aspects of culturally relevant science tasks.\r\n\r\nThe primary activities will be carried out at Albany high school in New York with 2,214 students, 70% of whom are Black and Latino. Twenty undergraduates from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's Engineering and Science Ambassadors program will be paired with 10 teachers who teach two sections of the same STEM+C course each day. This creates a comparison research study wherein the experimental and control groups are reasonably well-matched and can be evaluated with confidence. Thus, a total of about 500 students will be engaged annually. Secondary activities will use after school and summer learning programs for broader dissemination through the 4th Family that is a nonprofit organization reaching students at Schenectady High, Troy High, and Green Tech Charter High. Further, it engages these high school students in peer to peer outreach to middle and elementary schools as well as community accessible events such as the New York State Black and Latino Youth Summit. In the last 3 years, this group has reached a total of about 2,000 students. If the culturally sensitive hypothesis is supported by this research study, learning modules that are \"networked\" across other disciplines to enhance social relevance will show higher rates of propagation, more sophisticated computational thinking, and better correlation with independent measures of STEM engagement and performance among underrepresented students than learning modules that lack relevant attributes.",

These materials allow students to simulate traditional designs (weaving, braiding, sculpting, architecture, etc.), and discover the \"heritage algorithms\" that already exist in the heads, hands and hearts of the practitioners.

We carried out our evaluations in classrooms as well as out of school workshops and summer camps. In some cases we used controlled studies: one section of the class receives CSDTs, the other section a similar lesson but without any cultural content. In other cases we used a baseline contrast, comparing the attitudes and understandings before and after the intervention. Both showed statistically significant improvement when class size was sufficient. In addition to these quantitative metrics we also asked students to write about the topic. It was striking to see narratives where students explained that for the first time they could see how STEM was helping them connect to heritage knowledge, atheletic skills, a future for their local community and so on. Details are available in our publications at&nbsp;https://csdt.org/publications.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We also found similar improvement in classrooms that included students from other ethnic backgrounds. One reason for the broader effects may be due to the inclusion of materials that included multiple ethnicities, such as Applachian quilting, Hmong embroidery, Henna, etc. Another may be the use of design activities and discovery learning that had real-world implications.&nbsp; Students writing about their experiences often mentioned the importance of CSDTs that involved community-based activities such as pollution detection, digital soil sensing for gardens, pH measurement in cosmetology, the use of AI to authenticate hand-made vs factory-made fakes, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The above evaluations of culture-based and community-based CSDTs were reported in a wide range of academic conferences such as CHI and IEEE, as well as keynotes to CSTA, the National Science Policy Network, etc. There were also 20 publications from this grant, mainly in peer-reviewed education journals, but they included other intellectual contributions as well. For example, our paper at the International Communication Association conference detailed how CSDTs helped to illuminate the ways in which platforms using the open/closed source distinction can be designed as a spectrum of practices, with layers regulating access according to the preferences of the contributors. Our paper in AI &amp; Society described our development of machine learning that can distinguish between hand-made and factory-fake textiles, and its potential application in both community development and education. Because of the rising interest in urban farming, especially in the communities near us in Detroit, our paper on the design of an online marketing system for urban farms was similarly crafted to address both community development and education applications.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These community development applications culminated in a new NSF grant,&nbsp;<em>Race, Gender and Class Equity in the Future of Work: Automation for the Artisanal Economy</em>. Because introducing digital fabrication, sensors, AI and other tools were of interest to both local artisans and K-12 students, an additional internal grant from UM has funded a new program in which high school students learn from and with these artisans, bridging the research full circle, and ensuring continuation of K-12 applications beyond the end of this grant.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a public teaching resource, we saw a strong positive rise in the use of CSDTs.
