 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project responds to calls to increase children's exposure and engagement in STEM at an early age. With the rise of the maker-movement, the informal and formal education sectors have witnessed a dramatic expansion of maker and tinkering spaces, programs, and curricula. This has happened in part because of the potential benefits of tinkering experiences to promote access and equity in engineering education. To realize these benefits, it is necessary to continue to make and iterate design and facilitation approaches that can deepen early engagement in disciplinary practices of engineering and other STEM-relevant skills. This project will investigate how stories can be integrated into informal STEM learning experiences for young children and their families. Stories can be especially effective because they bridge the knowledge and experiences young children and their caregivers bring to tinkering as well as the conversations and hands-on activities that can extend that knowledge. In addition, a unique contribution of the project is to test the hypothesis that stories can also facilitate spatial reasoning, by encouraging children to think about the spatial properties of their emerging structures.\r\n \r\nThis project uses design-based research methods to advance knowledge and the evidence base for practices that engender story-based tinkering. Using conjecture mapping, the team will specify their initial ideas and how it will be evident that design/practices impact caregivers-child behaviors and learning outcomes. The team will consider the demographic characteristics, linguistic practices, and funds of knowledge of the participants to understand the design practices (resources, activities) being implemented and how they potentially facilitate learning. The outcome of each study/DBR cycle serves as inputs for questions and hypotheses in the next. A culturally diverse group of 300+ children ages 5 to 8 years old and their parents at Chicago Children's Museum's Tinkering Lab will participate in the study to examine the following key questions: (1) What design and facilitation approaches engage young children and their caregivers in creating their own engineering-rich tinkering stories? (2) How can museum exhibit design (e.g., models, interactive displays) and tinkering stories together engender spatial thinking, to further enrich early STEM learning opportunities? and (3) Do the tinkering stories children and their families tell support lasting STEM learning? As part of the overall iterative, design-based approach, the team will also field test the story-based tinkering approaches identified in the first cycles of DBR to be most promising.\r\n \r\nThis project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. It will result in activities, exhibit components, and training resources that invite visitors' stories into open-ended problem-solving activities. It will advance understanding of mechanisms for encouraging engineering learning and spatial thinking through direct experience interacting with objects, and playful, scaffolded (guided) problem-solving activities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The TALES (Tinkering and Learning Engineering Stories) Project, a collaboration of Chicago Children's Museum, Loyola University Chicago, Northwestern University and Roosevelt University, employed design-based research methods to develop and study a variety of approaches to story-based tinkering during both home-based and exhibit-based programs for children ages 5 to 8 and their families. Outcomes of this research-in-the-service of-practice project include strategies to support children's original storytelling during tinkering, insights into design-based research methods, and promising findings about story-based tinkering on young children's engineering learning and spatial reasoning.</p>\n<p>Stories do not have to come from books, or experts; with appropriate support, young children and their families can tell their own tales that will facilitate STEM learning during tinkering. Moreover, the ways in which the structure of a story and the engineering process are alike can provide important supports for families to create their own stories about testing problem solutions, learning what does and doesn't work, redesigning and trying again. Our project aimed to leverage the ubiquity of stories in the lives of children by developing museum practices to engage children and their caregivers in telling stories that can scaffold STEM learning during engineering-rich tinkering.</p>\n<p>Due to the pandemic, early programming and research took place via Zoom connections in children's homes. Following a videotaped introduction, a child and one parent were observed while engaging in a story-based tinkering project using objects, toys, and materials already at hand. The three programs piloted and studied during that year became the basis for our initial work once Chicago Children's Museum reopened, since in both settings the goal was to spark children's story telling in ways that supported their engagement in an empirically-based engineering process (including testing and revision) during tinkering. What changed were our methods of introducing and supporting story-based tinkering in a well-equipped workshop setting serving a large number of diverse families.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the project, we successfully developed programs in which children and caregivers collaboratively told unique fanciful and real-life stories to accompany and explain their problem solving. Across iterations of programming (and across home and museum settings), we varied the challenges and story elements, but each program centered on an engineering-rich tinkering task that involved designing something that could do something (i.e. move, fly, fit, etc), along with opportunities for iterative testing. Most programs suggested at least one central character--often a toy, sometimes the child--while the reason behind the challenge (aka the story) was up to the child to invent along with other details about the setting and plot. &nbsp;For example, in the \"Here to There\" program, children could choose which of several items they wanted to relocate and an \"important reason\" to move the item(s) from the surface of a table (here) to the floor (there). Other challenges involved developing an aircraft for a toy monster pilot (who is delivering what to whom), developing a playground ride that would work for three physically different toys, designing a hat that will stay on the child during a set of activities, and safely moving a toy driver through a perilous landscape of light and shadows (with both the nature of the environment and the perils left to the imagination of the child). These and other design-based programs were tested and refined through multiple iterations as we sought the right combination of facilitation, materials, testing opportunities, and open-endedness to enable children and their families to tell their own stories while engaging in the cyclical engineering process of making, testing and revising.&nbsp; Enhancements have included showcasing stories by previous visiting families; offering a story wheel that combines characters, settings and situations; and providing a set of just-in-time caregivers tips.</p>\n<p>The Design Based Research tracked success and impact of each program.<span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"> </span>Tinkering Lab is equipped with multiple cameras allowing families who consent to be recorded and interviewed, and we were able to collect further evidence from a nearby exhibit, Story Hub, that invites families to reflect on their museum experiences. A close working relationship between practitioners and researchers provided quickly coded data to inform iterations in program design. Generally, the more families talked about their stories while tinkering, the more they also talked about engineering and used spatial language. This work has implications for how to encourage engineering-rich tinkering through storytelling, leveraging everyday practices of many families to support children&rsquo;s learning. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Through our collaboration, the TALES project has been able to advance knowledge and the evidence base for practices that engender story-based tinkering.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/20/2023<br>\nModified by: Tsivia&nbsp;Cohen</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1906839/1906839_10625587_1703008923346_Here_to_There--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1906839/1906839_10625587_1703008923346_Here_to_There--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Here to There Program\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1906839/1906839_10625587_1703008923346_Here_to_There--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Here to There Program\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">One family's solution to moving something between two locations for an \"important reason.\"</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">CCM</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Tsivia&nbsp;Cohen\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Here to There Program</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1906839/1906839_10625587_1703011958761_Safe_Travels--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1906839/1906839_10625587_1703011958761_Safe_Travels--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Tunnel of Safety\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1906839/1906839_10625587_1703011958761_Safe_Travels--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Tunnel of Safety\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Collaborating on a strategy to drive a toy monster through a perilous landscape.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">CCM</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Tsivia&nbsp;Cohen\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Tunnel of Safety</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1906839/1906839_10625587_1703018057646_Caregiver_Tips__English_--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1906839/1906839_10625587_1703018057646_Caregiver_Tips__English_--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Caregiver Tips\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1906839/1906839_10625587_1703018057646_Caregiver_Tips__English_--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Caregiver Tips\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Resource to support caregivers during a program to design an aircraft to enable a toy monster to deliver a package.
