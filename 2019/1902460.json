 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project examines the ways in which everyday citizen scientists might be able to effectively collect perishable research-grade damage data following a hurricane that affects rural locales. This research uses Hurricane Florence in 2018 as a test case. The project uniquely leverages networks of journalists in rural areas to actively recruit local citizen scientists to document damage using multiple channels. This project directly enhances the understanding of rural damage from Florence and will impact the immediate recovery of these often marginalized and neglected communities. Furthermore, this research measures and tests the efficacy of citizen-produced versus engineer-collected damage data in rural contexts, validated by ground truth reconnaissance data. This scientific research contribution thus supports NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and to advance our national welfare with benefits that will inform planning to improve the resilience of United States communities, in particular to hurricanes and flooding. \r\n\r\nIf harnessing the untapped potential of citizen scientists to collect large volumes of real-world visual and textual data regarding all levels of hurricane damage in poorer rural agricultural areas affected by Florence proves to be a successful method of collecting damage data, this can transform the ways in which engineers can predict effects from and study these events. Moreover, the new methodologies for rapid activation of journalist and citizen scientist networks developed in this project can be applied to other natural hazards (e.g., tsunamis, earthquakes, wind storms, etc.) engineering efforts beyond the scope of the proposed work that might involve similar remote and rural communities. By engaging the public in participatory science, this work empowers rural citizens to learn about the effects of hurricanes and take ownership of their contributions to this field of research. Findings and data obtained from this study will be rapidly disseminated to the public and research community through interactive and accessible tools available via the DesignSafe cyberinfrastructure..\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The process of scanning social media to identify areas of likely damage was primarily done manually, and follow-up in-person reconnaissance teams were often deployed to the sites of interest to further document the observations recorded on Twitter. With the temporal nature of many hazards, reconnaissance teams often arrived only to see the aftermath of the damage, for example, after flood waters subsided or after homeowners began to clean up the damage. For natural hazards engineering reconnaissance, this research project provided two primary advancements: (1) it provided an automated process to extra image data from Twitter and classify the type of infrastructure damage in the photo using machine vision tools developed by Google, (2) it provided documentation of perishable image data collected by citizens that may not be present when on-the-ground reconnaissance teams arrive, and (3) it provided a methodology to identify journalists reporting on natural hazard damage through Twitter, such that they could be leveraged in the future to help solicit additional damage data in future events.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit&nbsp; <br /></strong></p>\n<p>This project confirmed the utility of using journalists to engage citizen scientists to elicit images documenting damage during Hurricane Florence using public social media platforms. We successfully identified a journalist network, which included journalists in rural hurricane-affected areas. Journalists have been underutilized as agents to help elicit reports of damage, particularly from hard-to-reach, inaccessible rural areas affected by hurricanes. Furthermore, using computer vision and context clues in social media posts, we developed image classification algorithms trained on Hurricane Florence-related images posted on social media. This opens up new intellectual directions in terms of using social media data from citizen scientists with machine learning during hurricanes as well as other natural disasters. This project provides a foundation for future teams to develop more diverse datasets of images from a wide range of natural hazards (e.g. earthquakes, landslides, etc.) as well as studying a wider range of construction types that would extend the robustness of our classification tools. The advances in computer vision and data analytics validated by ground truth reconnaissance data can be used to update existing regional damage and loss models to be more inclusive of remote, rural areas.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p>\n<p>By supplementing on-the-ground reconnaissance reports with citizen-contributed damage images from social media, natural hazards engineering research will have more robust datasets to estimate regional infrastructure damage and losses. This technique of harvesting infrastructure damage data from citizen scientists via social media can also be employed during times of a pandemic, when reconnaissance teams are prohibited from travelling to the region.&nbsp;&nbsp;The photos and documentation of damage gathered by past post-hurricane reconnaissance efforts have made valuable efforts to help fill this gap, but do not provide even close to the quantity or breadth of unbiased data required to develop fragility models for rural locales. This project helps improve the overall loss prediction models for Hurricane Florence by harnessing the untapped potential of citizen scientists to collect large volumes of real-world visual and textual data regarding all levels of hurricane damage in poorer rural agricultural areas affected by Florence.
