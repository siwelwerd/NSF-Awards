 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental question in decision-making of autonomous robotic systems is how these systems make decisions such that these are similar to a decision a human would make in a similar situation. This aspect of decision making is important in order for the robotic agent to generate predictable behaviors which are necessary in order to establish trust in human-machine teams. Traditional approaches to solve this problem assume that humans are well-informed, perfectly rational agents that always reach the optimal (e.g., the best decision). Several empirical studies, however, suggest that most humans do not act as perfectly rational agents when making decisions but rather as bounded-rational ones. In other words, they do not try to get the best possible outcome unconditionally, but rather they tend to weight the benefits of reaching the best outcome subject to constraints (time, cognitive effort, energy, money, or just laziness). Using this key idea, this research will investigate decision-making for autonomous systems subject to resource constraints. Similar to how humans make decisions, instead of trying to get the optimal decision no matter what, the decision-making process will have to factor in the computational, information, or energy constraints available to the agent. \r\n\r\nThis project investigates the interaction between autonomous robotic agents and other agents either human or robotic, while considering the decision-making constraints of the agents. Instead of focusing on maximizing expected utility (as in standard formulations) this research will address the maximization of expected free utility (or free energy), a quantity that encapsulates in a precise manner the effect of information and computational constraints of the decision-making process. The results of this research will be applied to the case of multiple agents having perhaps conflicting objectives.  As a test case this framework is applied to the problem of autonomous vehicles in traffic including both human drivers and other self-driving vehicles. By adapting the agent's decision-making process to the available resources, this framework can be used to generate a hierarchy of abstractions for decision-making brought about by the severity of information-processing costs. Each abstraction is tailored to the \"right\" level of granularity of the problem. That is, coarser abstraction levels are preferred when the computational resources are scarce and finer (more accurate) levels of abstraction when the computational resources are plentiful. Finally, \"theory of mind\" principles will be utilized to design bounded-rational decision-making algorithms that avoid the infinite regress between conflicting agents. This infinite regress hinders the computation of purely rational equilibria and will be avoided by adopting a framework that restricts each player's depth of recursive inference.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Most current algorithms for decision-making are rather data-intensive and may not be capable of fast, close-to-real-time, human-like behavior. Extracting actionable information from data &ndash; and, similarly, how to best represent this information&ndash; under limited time and computational resources, remains a main challenge. It is thus of great interest to develop decision-making algorithms for IPS that account for the cost of processing and communicating the collected data, leading to interpretable, legible actions.</p>\n<p>In this research we have used ideas from information theory to generate hierarchical representations of the collected data so that planning and sensing can be achieved more efficiently, by throwing away information that is not &ldquo;relevant&rdquo; to the problem. The approach is very closely related to the bounded rational paradigm, originally introduced in the economics literature, to explain decisions taken by humans. According to this bounded rationality paradigm, human beings tend to weight the benefits of reaching the &ldquo;best&rdquo; or &ldquo;most informed&rdquo; decision, versus the pitfalls associated with the time, energy and effort needed to collect all the information to reach that decision. By constructing looking at the problem at the &ldquo;right&rdquo; level of detail, the decision-making agent (e.g., autonomous agent, human) can shortcut exact computation of complex quantities.</p>\n<p>We have developed a framework to obtain graph abstractions for decision-making by an agent where the abstractions emerge as a function of the agent&rsquo;s limited computational resources. We have highlighted the connections of the approach with information-theoretic signal compression, and have introduced novel optimization algorithms to find abstractions as a function of the agent&rsquo;s computational resources. We have implemented our algorithms on joint perception/planning problems of autonomous ground vehicles operating outdoors using semantic information.</p>\n<p>We have also utilized similar ideas to solve computationally challenging problems in stochastic games between several agents. In a game setting, agents need to strategically interact with both the environment and other agents to obtain an optimal performance. However, finding optimal solutions (equilibrium) quickly becomes intractable for standard solvers. Hierarchical decision-making addresses the scalability by dividing games into a set of smaller games that can be solved individually. By decomposing a game using a hierarchical representation, an aggregated (coarsened) game can be generated over the aggregated state-space, where the agents make decisions based on the observed aggregate state. One of the significant challenges we had to address is determining how information is passed between and within abstraction hierarchies. Our results showed that we can solve challenging games in a matter of minutes, whereas standard solvers may take several hours.</p>\n<p>Finally, we explored the use of policy approximations to reduce the computational cost of learning Nash equilibria in zero-sum stochastic games. We proposed a new Q-learning type algorithm that uses a sequence of entropy-regularized soft policies to approximate the Nash policy during the Q-function updates. We proved that under certain conditions, by updating the regularized Q-function, the algorithm converges to a Nash equilibrium. We also demonstrated the proposed algorithm&rsquo;s ability to transfer previous training experiences, enabling an agent to adapt quickly to new environments. The proposed SNQ2L (Soft Nash Q2 Learning) algorithm learns two different Q-values: a standard Q-value and an entropy-regularized soft Q-value. The two values are used asynchronously in a &ldquo;feedback&rdquo; learning mechanism: the soft policies act as an efficient approximation of the Nash policies to update the standard Q-value; the Nash policies from the standard Q-function are computed periodically to update the priors that guide the soft policies, therefore reducing &nbsp;the frequency of using the expensive Minimax operator, and thus expediting convergence to the Nash Equilibrium.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The educational activities of this research include the involvement of graduate and undergraduate students in research. In addition to the graduate students directly involved with the research activities, a team of 25+ undergraduate students from four different departments (AE, ME, ECE, CS) have worked on building an autonomous ground robot as part of a VIP (vertically integrated project) team (<a href=\"http://www.vip.gatech.edu/teams/active-safety-autonomous-and-semi-autonomous-vehicles\">www.vip.gatech.edu/teams/active-safety-autonomous-and-semi-autonomous-vehicles</a>).The VIP program is an undergraduate education program by which undergraduate students joining VIP teams earn academic credit for their participation in design/discovery efforts that assist faculty and graduate students with research issues in their areas of expertise (for more details, see <a href=\"http://www.vip.gatech.edu\">www.vip.gatech.edu</a>).
