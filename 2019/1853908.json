 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Clifford Kubiak of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of California San Diego is developing new assemblies of metal complexes that undergo fast electron electron transfer (ET) reactions.  These reactions are monitored by infrared spectroscopy which has picosecond (1 trillionth of a second) time resolution to follow such ultrafast reaction. The goal of these studies is to develop a fundamental understanding of the chemical factors that determine the rate, distance, and direction of ET reactions.  This work may ultimately pave the way towards the design of molecular electronic devices such as switches and memory that function far faster than the current generation of computers and sensors.  This project lies at the intersection between synthetic chemistry and physical characterization, providing a rich opportunity for the training of graduate and undergraduate students in cutting-edge research.  Controlling the rates, distance, and direction of electron transfer broadly impacts the life sciences, technology, and energy sectors. This project represents  basic research but, if successful, could ultimately benefit society in important areas including treatments for genetic disorders caused by damage to DNA; a new generation of faster, smaller, and less expensive integrated circuits; advances in artificial and natural photosynthesis and improvements in agricultural food production. Professor Kubiak involves undergraduate students in research and engages K-14 students. The group has established a new undergraduate exchange program with Cal State University Monterey Bay (CSUMB) for students to pursue research projects that can be performed partly at CSUMB and partly at UCSD during summers and school breaks.  The research team also develops visualizations of complex scientific ideas and their videos are also being shared broadly with both researchers, educators and the general public. \r\n\r\nMixed-valence dimers of triruthenium acetate clusters display rich spectroscopic evidence of ultrafast ET over long distances.  They have proven to be fruitful systems in illustrating how different bridging moieties, electronic structures, and chemical environments and dynamics can impact the kinetic barriers of ET. Professor Clifford Kubiak and his group plan to develop a more complete physical chemical description of how electron transfer occurs across hydrogen bonds.  They will expand the synthesis of new complexes to better understand the interplay between electron delocalization and hydrogen bonding.  Additionally, they will conduct the first two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (2D-IR) studies of intramolecular ET on the picosecond timescale.  They will use synthetic studies to probe bridging ligand dynamics and its relation to ET. This research will attempt to demonstrate vibrational control of the ET coordinate to change its rate and direction.  Finally, the team will design and synthesize new supramolecular assemblies that exhibit mixed valency between pendant tri-ruthenium redox centers through semiconducting metal oxide nanoparticles.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe NSF project \"Controlling the Rates, Distance, and Direction of Electron Transfer in Ultrafast Inorganic Ground States (CHE-1853908 for the period 8/01/197/30/23) developed new knowledge of how some of the fastest processes in chemistry can be understood and controlled. These processes occur on the picosecond (ps, 10-12 s) time scale, and consist of either rearrangementa of molecular structure or electron transfera. Figure 1 shows the energy landscape for the rearrangement of a highly unusual ruthenium dithiolenee complex that was investigated. It was possible to identify that at room temperature three different structural isomers (labelled 1, 0, and 2 in Figure 1) exist in dynamic equilibrium. The three structures have energies that are only different by 1  3 kcal/mol, so all three species exist together at room temperature, and exhibit spectroscopic signatures that make them easily distinguishable. The feature that makes this particular system interesting for study is that the kinetic barriers separating the three isomers are so low that interconversion of one to the other occurs at extremely fast (4.3 or 6.3 ps) rates. This has the effect of blurring the spectroscopic signatures that are observed in the infrared region of the isomers because the exchange rate is approaching the frequency of infrared light. The significance of this outcome is that the ruthenium dithiolene complex represents a 3-state system (1, 0, and 2 in Figure 1) capable of switching from one state to the other on the picosecond time scale. This has important implications for high speed computing. Typical switching times in modern computers are on the gigahertz (10-9 s) time scale, 1000 times slower. Future work will investigate how such switching can be accomplished with optical or electric field inputs.\n\n\n\n\n\nA second type of molecular dynamics and mechanisms that could be relevant for information storage and processing is electron transfer. One of critical goals of the field of molecular electronics research is to be able to make a molecule that is both electronically bistable and capable of picosecond switching times. Our research has involved studies of electron transfer in mixed-valent transition metal clusters. In a mixed valence cluster, the metals have different oxidation states and electrons can exchanged from one metal site to another to give an equivalent, but physically distinguishable state. One of the most realistic means of achieving switchable bistability is by applying an electric field to an oriented set of mixed-valent clusters. A significant outcome of this project is our study of single molecule-thin layers of metal clusters that have mixed oxidation states such as RuIIIRuIIIRuII. A distinguishing infrared spectral feature is the nu(CO) stretching mode for the CO ligands of the cluster that appears in the infrared spectrum. Its frequency is sensitive to the oxidation state of the metal to which it is attached. When we change the voltage of the metal surface to which the ruthenium clusters are attached, we see meaningful changes in the nu(CO) frequencies. The specific ruthenium clusters used in this study, the strategy employed to put them on to metal surfaces where electric fields can be applied to them, and how the nu(CO) frequencies change as a function of voltage are shown in Figure 2. The nu(CO) band shows a shift of ~3.6 cm-1/V which is consistent with a substantial spacing between the CO ligand and the charged metal surface. It is also clear that there are two bands separated by ~21 cm&#8209;1 indicating two surface bound species. The populations of the two species also change quite substantially as a function of electrode voltage. The response of the system is reversible as the potential is swung between upper and lower limits. This system does exhibit switching as a function of applied electric field, but the precise nature of the chemical response requires further study and is being pursued actively in our current NSF project.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are two of the most significant outcomes of CHE-1853908. Other notable work performed under support from this grant includes ultrafast electron transfer in new mixed valent iron and cobalt clusters, electronic structure and photophysical properties of mixed valent Ru3 clusters, controlled deposition of thin films of coordination polymers of rhodium di-isocyanides, and Hydrogen exchange in Sn-H capped trinuclear mixed valent nickel complexes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/01/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: CliffordPKubiak\n"
