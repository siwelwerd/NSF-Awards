 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2019 Gordon Research Conference and associated Gordon Research Seminar on the topic of Micro and Nanoscale Phase Change Heat Transfer is the third such Gordon Conference and is held in Renaissance Tuscany Il Ciocco, Lucca Italy. The conference brings together leading experts in the field of micro and nanoscale phase change heat transfer as well as experts outside the field whose work is of great relevance to the overall heat transfer community. The goal of the conference is to present the latest in fundamental research, and to highlight the most promising future research directions. The meeting also provides a unique forum where graduate students, postdoctoral associates and other young researchers can interact informally with established members of the field. This year, for the first time, a separate Gordon Research Seminar is included, organized and run entirely by young researchers, for young researchers, offering them an opportunity to present their work, interact with one another, and participate in mentoring activities to help them advance their careers.\r\n\r\nThe overall field associated with the conference is of critical importance to a number of areas including the HVAC, power generation, and chemical process industries, electronics cooling and process intensification efforts, space exploration, the development of extraterrestrial habitats, the generation of pure water in inhospitable areas and climate change. This Gordon Research Conference also hosts a Power Hour, a mentoring experience specifically targeted to women. All women from the GRS or GRC are invited to attend, share their experiences, and interact with senior women mentors in the field. Here they can discuss issues of unique importance to women, helping to train the next generation of female leaders in the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
