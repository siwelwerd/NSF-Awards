 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lightweight structures are highly desirable for improving fuel economy and reducing carbon emissions. As key lightweight enablers, successful utilizations of advanced lightweight materials and multi-material structures rely on economical and reliable joining processes. Resistance spot welding (RSW), as one of the most extensively used technologies in the automotive industry, is not suitable for joining dissimilar materials due to their different physical properties and metallurgical differences. In addition, RSW faces challenges in joining the newest generation of advanced high strength steel and aluminum alloys. In comparison, ultrasonic spot welding (USW) shows several advantages, but its applications are limited by the output power of generally available ultrasonic transducers. This award focuses on an innovative hybrid ultrasonic resistance welding (URW) process, which effectively integrates ultrasonic and resistance welding, maximizing the advantages of each process. Preliminary results show promising enhancements of joint mechanical performance with URW. The research will deeply advance the scientific understanding of the complex coupling mechanisms between electrical and acoustic fields. Since this technology has wide applicability to the automotive, aerospace and defense industries, the project directly impacts the economic welfare and national security of the United States. The successfully-developed URW process will significantly benefit manufacturing and assembly of lightweight, and especially multi-material structures. The inherent similarities of ultrasonic and RSW system make it naturally convenient to adapt existing RSW robots and equipment, facilitating widespread industrial applications of URW. The obtained knowledge on ultrasonically induced physical phenomena will deeply contribute to developing and improving various advanced manufacturing processes. One specific example is ultrasonic resistance additive manufacturing. The URW process and microstructural evolution model enhances applications of integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) in the field of solid-state manufacturing. Finally, the multidisciplinary educational program as a result of the award will empower next-generation engineers and researchers in the fields of mechanical, material, metallurgy, control, and data processing. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of this research are to advance the knowledge of multiphysical thermo-mechanical-electrical-acoustic coupling mechanisms involved with the novel hybrid URW process, to reveal the fundamental physics of weld structure evolution and to optimize URW for joining advanced lightweight and dissimilar materials. Ultrasonic vibration is hypothesized to affect RSW in three stages: modifying contact resistance through removal of surface coatings and contaminations, influencing thermodynamic and kinetic conditions during melting through acoustic streaming and cavitation effects, and refining microstructure during solidification. The scope of this research includes: (1) A comprehensive experimental study of URW at various conditions, followed by mechanical testing and multi-scale characterizations of the welds. Process-structure-properties relationships will be established; (2) In situ analysis of the URW process through high speed and thermal imaging, as well as multiphysical modeling to determine the thermo-mechanical field during the process. Al-Fe interfacial reaction model will also be developed, which will be verified through physical simulations of the inter-metallic compounds (IMC) formation and growth under a controlled thermo-mechanical testing environment. (3) Optimization of the URW process in terms of process parameters, electrode geometry along with the synchronization between acoustic and electrical fields for desirable joint performance with the minimum amount of input process energy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

By effectively integrating ultrasonic energy, the URW shows advantages over RSW in multiple perspectives.</p>\n<p>The material systems studied in this project include transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) steel, various series of similar and dissimilar aluminum alloys with different thickness combinations, and TRIP steel to aluminum alloy AA6061. Among all these materials, the URW consistently shows enhanced mechanical properties and improved microstructure. <strong>For TRIP steel,</strong> the URW welds contain higher ductility and nugget pullout failure mode during lap shear tensile tests. Refined microstructure in the fusion zone and heat affected zone is achieved with possible tempered martensite and feathery bainite replacing the coalesced bainite in the RSW welds. <strong>For aluminum alloys,</strong><strong> </strong>including similar and dissimilar AA6061, AA5182, AA7075, AA6111, both the strength and ductility of URW welds are higher than the corresponding RSW conditions. Weld microstructure is improved in URW with larger nugget size, promoted formation of the equiaxed crystal zone at the center and narrower coarse columnar zone and partially melted zone at the nugget periphery. Specifically for dissimilar Al welds, the assisted ultrasonic vibration moves the unsymmetric nugget more balanced towards the weld interface. The enhanced URW mechanical properties are attributed to the improved microstructure features in addition to the enlarged nugget size. For dissimilar Al welds, the narrower coarse columnar zone and balanced nugget position is more dominating in strength improvement. In the non-heat treatable AA5182 welds, as the nugget hardness is approximately the same in RSW and URW welds, the enlarged nugget size is a more dominating strength contributor. <strong>For TRIP steel to aluminum alloy AA6061,</strong> URW achieves up to 300% increase in strength and more than 150% increase in displacement to failure than RSW. Cracks and interfacial debonded regions in conventional RSW welds are effectively removed in URW, and a thin Al-Fe intermetallic layer (IMC) of around 3 um thickness is formed instead.</p>\n<p>Fundamental mechanisms of the ultrasonic benefits on RSW vary at different stages of the weld. <strong>Before melt occurs</strong>, the ultrasonic vibration facilitates the removal of surface oxides, coatings, and contaminations. This is directly observed with in situ high speed imaging of the process. The acoustic softening effect, which describes the reduction of metal plastic flow stress under superimposed ultrasonic vibration, also takes place and is reflected in the measured dynamic welding force curve. Accordingly, the dynamic contact resistance is reduced in URW than RSW, which is validated by experimental measurement. <strong>During melting,</strong> the acoustic streaming and cavitation effects enhance the convection in the melt pool, which homogenize the temperature and element distribution. In situ thermal imaging of URW reveals a lower temperature distribution, smaller heating and cooling rates than RSW. <strong>During solidification</strong>, the modified local temperature gradient and solidification rate affect the thermodynamic and kinetic conditions, as indicated by the weld microstructure. Computational simulations show the enlarged nugget size in URW is a combination of multiple ultrasonic factors in solid and liquid state. Reduction of contact resistance, decrease of material deformation stress and increase of molten metal thermal conductivity numerically leads to a smaller nugget, whereas reduction of latent heat and increase of molten metal electrical conductivity increases the calculated nugget size. Decrease in latent heat, which serves as a numerical representation of promoted melting and indirectly captures the additional ultrasonic energy, can be the dominating factor in increasing the modeled nugget size.</p>\n<p>The project provided multidisciplinary training to 2 Ph.D. students, one of whom has successfully graduated. 1 undergraduate student participated in the project as a research internship and 1 senior capstone project was designed based on the study of URW of aluminum alloy. Due to the COVID pandemic, several of the outreach activities were converted to virtual mode, where the URW system was introduced to a wide audience and under-represented groups. The results have been disseminated through 5 journal publications, different conferences in the fields of manufacturing, welding and materials engineering, such as ASME MSEC, AWS Fabtech and MST conferences. 1 patent on the URW system was published. The aluminum study attracted in-kind support from the Novelis company. The promising results of URW on multilayers thin foils initiated collaborations with General Motors company.
