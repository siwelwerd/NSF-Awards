 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mission of the NSF Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to support the strengthening of STEM education and research capacity at Native-serving institutions. The project titled \"Enhancing Discovery-Based Learning in STEM Education by Integrating Augmented Technology and Culture-Based Pedagogy\" and administered by the University of Hawaii-West Oahu, closely aligns with this mission. The project focuses on improving curriculum and instruction in Anatomy, Physiology, and Biology courses through the integration of locally relevant content and the use of student-centered teaching methods and virtual reality technology. Faculty involved in the project engage in professional development to strengthen their teaching skills and cultural competence in preparation for the changes in curriculum and instruction.\r\n \r\nThe project focuses on framing the curriculum in place-based content and contexts and infusing the latest technology into an inclusive, interdisciplinary learning environment. Courses in Anatomy & Physiology and Human Skeletal Biology will be restructured to employ research-based pedagogy and augmented reality tools that enhance student engagement and learning. Unique learning experiences such as field trips, guest speakers, and interactions with local STEM professionals will be incorporated into curricula, aimed at introducing students to exciting STEM research studies and career opportunities. Virtual reality tools create engaging dynamic learning environments, providing students opportunities for realistic interactions with 3D representations of anatomy. Eventual outcomes of the project include a strengthening of STEM instruction at UHWO and an increase in student retention and success in STEM degrees and careers, particularly for students from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The primary goals of the grant project were to create a culture-based pedagogical approach, enhance learning with innovative technology, and engage faculty in indigenous learning activities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A primary outcome of the grant was cultural education and relationship building which, anticipated to occur during Year 1 of the project, continued throughout the duration of the project. Funding included travel for guest speakers to come to O&#699;ahu, visits to culturally relevant sites on Hawai&#699;i Island, support of indigenous workshops and seminars at UH West O&#699;ahu and attendance at STEM- and indigenous-based educational symposia and conventions &ndash; all activities that introduced faculty to Native Hawaiian pedagogical approaches and placed-based learning. Guest speakers supported by this grant educated the UH West O&#699;ahu community on such topics as &#699;Ai H&#333;nua, &#699;ike mo&#699;olelo, the Hawaiian practice of Kilohana, Pilina &#699;&#256;ina, and lauhala demonstrations.&nbsp; Both faculty and students were offered opportunities to practice and partake in cultural protocol while engaging with local cultural practitioners to learn both discipline specific and cultural knowledge.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A second outcome was curriculum transformation through the purchase of zSpace All-in-One Augmented Reality software to present Problem Based Learning (PBL) case studies via XRcore technology. The PBL case studies used real-life patient reports and MRIs obtained from UH John A Burnes School of Medicine&rsquo;s (JABSOM) willed body program that only accepts from those that live within Hawai&#699;i. Images and MRIs were uploaded into the XRCore website and utilized for the case studies which consisted of learning objectives, clinical, radiological, and pathologic reports along with the 3D artificial and segmented models, and 3D donor MRIs. All content was aligned with course learning outcomes and performance on case studies and related assessments were quantitatively evaluated.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Another outcome was the revision of course content to include culture- and place-based learning. UH West O&#699;ahu&rsquo;s konohiki reviewed components of the redesigned curriculum and contributed to guest lectures within the courses that instilled indigenous knowledge related to human organs, the mind/heart connection, and &#699;ike na&#699;au learning.&nbsp; The Hawaiian concept of kilo was added to the laboratory courses to contribute to a holistic, discovery-based learning experience.&nbsp; Finally, a new OER Anatomy &amp; Physiology textbook written via a collaborative effort of UH A&amp;P faculty was introduced in AY 2021-22. The text includes Hawaiian cultural aspects in every chapter and highlights illness, disease and physiological issues associated with the community in Hawai&#699;i. The courses were intentionally redesigned to scaffold learning from the introductory A&amp;P courses to the upper division STEM and Health Science courses, of which 10+ were developed during the project timeline.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A total of 967 were enrolled in the Anatomy and Physiology courses covered by this grant. Of those students, 620 were enrolled in A&amp;P I and 347 were enrolled in A&amp;P II. The benchmark of success was a grade of C- or better, as this was the grade needed to move to the next level course.&nbsp; Of the students who consented to have data included in analysis, 258 were enrolled in A&amp;P courses prior to programmatic changes. Of these students, 176 were enrolled in A&amp;P I/lab, and 82 in A&amp;P II/lab, of which 39 (22%) and 26 (31%) received an A in the respective A&amp;P course.&nbsp; Roughly 22% of students failed to meet the C- grade requirement in A&amp;P I to progress to A&amp;P II and lab.&nbsp; After programmatic and curriculum updates, 377 students were enrolled in the A&amp;P courses.&nbsp; The project successfully impacted student success in A&amp;P as after implementation of grant activities, 69 students (31%) and 77 (50%) of students in A&amp;P I/lab and A&amp;P II/lab, respectively, received an A.&nbsp; Only 45 (20%) and 12 (7%) of students failed to meet the C- requirement in A&amp;P I and A&amp;P II, respectively. The combination of augmented reality PBL case studies and place-based learning infused with indigenous content created various platforms for successful learning.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Learning indigenous and culture-based practices has gone beyond the confines of this grant project&rsquo;s timeline.&nbsp; It was written that successful completion of the grant would be measured by the number of collaborations and partnerships developed and maintained within the community.&nbsp; While a formal evaluation related to the outcome was completed, it is important to note that dozens of collaborations have occurred and multiple partnerships developed, both temporary and permanent, spontaneous and intentional, short lived and long lasting, simple and complex.
