 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central theme in this project is Langlands program, which is a surprising mixture of analysis on groups and number theory. A basic example is the Fourier expansion of a function on the circle as a sum of trigonometric functions. The circle is a very symmetric object. We can rotate it for any angle without changing its shape. Rotations of a circle form what is called in mathematics a group of transformations, or simply a group. Every function on the circle has a Fourier expansion in which it is written as a sum of trigonometric functions. Trigonometric functions are the simplest functions on the circle, and so the analysis of functions on the circle, or periodic functions, is reduced to trigonometric functions. It has been known for over a century that Fourier expansions and their generalizations carry significant number theoretic information. Motivated by this example, over the past fifty years a large class of problems has been unified in a scheme known as the Langlands program. Roughly speaking, the goal is to decompose any function on a group as a sum of the simplest possible functions. This decomposition problem is the main theme of this project. This project will include training of graduate students.\r\n\r\nMore specifically the main goal of this project is to complete the Langlands classification for the group G2. This group was discovered by Eugene Dickson and it has been found to play an important role in physics and string theory. The principal tool employed in this research is the theory of exceptional theta correspondences that was developed by the PI in previous work. Applications of the exceptional theta correspondence to dual pairs of real groups and to supercuspidal representations of p-adic groups will developed as well. This project will include training of graduate students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The simplest example of a reciprocity involves the question when an odd prime is a sum of two squares. For example, 5 can be written as 1 squared plus 2 squared, 13 can be written as 2 squared plus 3 squared. On the other hand 3, 7 and 11 are three primes that cannot be written as a sum of two squares. Now observe that 5 and 13, when divided by 4, give a reminder 1, while 3, 7 and 11, when divided by 4, give a reminder 3. So this reminder, whether it is 1 or 3, is what distinguishes primes that can and cannot be written as sums of two squares. This non-obvious result has a vast generalization that involves mathemematical objects called groups, or groups of transformations. Perhaps the simplest example of a group is the group of permutaions of three letters, ABC, that is, all rearrangemets such as BCA, BAC etc. The other example is the group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle. A symmetry is a plane transformation which preserves the shape of the triangle. Thus here we have six symmetries, &nbsp;three rotations and three reflections that preserve the triangle. If we label the vertices of the triangle using letters A, B and C, any symmetry of the triangle permutes A, B and C, thus the group of symmetries of the triangle can be identified with the group of permuations of three letters. In mathematical terminology, we have a representation of the group of permutations of three letters on the equilateral triangle. Classifying representations of a group is a fundamental mathematical problem in mathematics. A more formidable example is the group of rotations of a circle. This is a continuous group, and analysis of its representations is known as Fourier analysis. For a certain class of continuos groups that are of ultimate importance in mathematics and physics, there are fascinanting conjectures, due to Robert Langlands, that describe representations via some reciprocity laws that are a vast generalization of the above mentioned problem on the sum of two squares. In the past 25 years we have seen significant progress in the theory of Shimura varieties and the trace formula that culminated in a proof of this conjecture for general linear and classical groups by Harris-Taylor and Arthur, respectively.
