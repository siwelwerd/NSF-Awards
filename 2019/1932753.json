 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mid-infrared spectrum represents a fingerprint of a material with absorption peaks corresponding to the frequencies of vibrations between the bonds of the atoms making up the material, and thus can identify and quantify all kinds of materials. Mid-infrared spectroscopy has a vast range of applications including pharmacy, biotechnology, industrial chemistry, food safety, and environmental monitoring. The preferred infrared spectroscopy method is Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. However, conventional FTIR systems with moving components are bulky, heavy, and sensitive to environment fluctuations (vibration, etc). These disadvantages make it mainly a laboratory-only tool requiring extensive human involvement and therefore unsuitable for field applications. In this project, the team at the University of Texas at Austin proposes to use integrated photonics technology to build the FTIR on a chip. The weight of the FTIR can be amazingly reduced to a few grams and the size to less than 1 cm2. Moving parts are no longer needed. With these revolutionary improvements, FTIR can be used in many unprecedented areas such as toxic gas detection in battle fields, greenhouse gas monitoring on airborne platform, and standalone environment monitoring. \r\n\r\nIntegrated photonics has been experiencing explosive growth in the past few years. While many components and systems have been demonstrated with impressive performance, the development of on-chip spectroscopy is slow due to the limited absorption length and strength on a chip, and the lack of high resolution, wide wavelength range spectrometers. To address these issues, the proposed on-chip FTIR involves two major innovations. First, subwavelength grating metamaterial waveguide is used as an absorption enhancement medium for the first time. It solves the dilemma between guiding (which requires the optical field to be constrained inside the high index dielectric region) and absorption (which prefers that the optical field propagates outside of the waveguide). The absorption of light by the analyte can be enhanced over 400 times compared to a conventional strip waveguide. Second, on-chip FTIRs formed by an array of asymmetric MZIs with increasing path differences between the two arms suffers from the extremely limited wavelength bandwidth. In this project, a thermo-optic phase shifter is added to each MZI. The combination of thermal phase shifters and incremental waveguide length differences makes it possible to achieve high resolution and large spectral range simultaneously, which has never been demonstrated before. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, this project will design, fabricate and experimentally demonstrate a subwavelength grating metamaterial waveguide enhanced, on-chip FTIR centered at 3.4 microns on the silicon-on-sapphire platform for Methane detection. The concept can also be readily extended to cover other wavelength ranges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This ambitious task was undertaken in multiple chapters, which collectively contributed to the realization of a highly integrated and efficient FTS system. The key components of these chapters encompassed Spatial Heterodyne Fourier Transform Spectrometry (SHFTS) and Thermal Tuning Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) based FTS technologies. This work delves into the comprehensive exploration of creating a silicon photonic-based FTS that operates seamlessly within the visible to mid-infrared (MIR) spectral range. Our theoretical proof-of-concept design outlines the core principles of an on-chip spectrometer that harnesses the power of photonic integrated circuits (PICs).</p>\n<p>The first chapter focuses on developing a Dual-Polarization Bandwidth-Bridged Bandpass Sampling Fourier Transform Spectrometer. The impetus for this endeavor arises from the pressing need for on-chip, high-resolution optical spectrometers spanning the visible to near-infrared spectrum (&lambda;=650-1050 nm) to cater to miniaturized bio-sensing and bio-imaging applications. The conventional spatial heterodyne Fourier transform spectrometer (SHFTS) is constrained by the inherent trade-off between spectral bandwidth and resolution, necessitating a large number of Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) arrays. To address this limitation, the research team introduces an innovative approach by integrating a sub-wavelength grating coupler (SWGC) onto a silicon nitride (Si3N4) platform. Employing the bandpass sampling theorem, this configuration effectively divides the continuous broadband input spectrum into multiple narrow-band channels, facilitating the reconstruction of individual spectral bands beyond the Nyquist criterion, devoid of aliasing errors or resolution degradation. The experimental outcomes substantiate the feasibility of this approach, with broadband spectrum retrieval spanning 400 nm (650 nm to 1050 nm) and resolutions within the range of 2-5 nm.</p>\n<p>The second chapter explores the development of on-chip spectrometers using microring and microdisk resonators for the O-Band and C-Band regions. These on-chip spectrometers offer compact, lightweight, and cost-effective alternatives to traditional benchtop spectrometers. The researchers present two single-channel devices, one using a cascaded microring-MZI configuration for Fourier transform spectroscopy in the O-Band and another employing finely tunable cascaded microdisks for on-chip spectroscopy in the C-Band.</p>\n<p>The third chapter focuses on the integration of micro-ring-resonator (MRR) optical biosensors with on-chip spectrometry for lab-on-a-chip applications. The goal is to create a highly sensitive and compact biosensor platform that eliminates the need for external optical spectrum analyzers. This lab-on-a-chip system combines a symmetric add-drop MRR biosensor with a spatial-heterodyne Fourier transform spectrometer (SHFTS) on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer. The integrated device achieves a limit of detection of 0.042 RIU and can accurately measure wavelength shifts in the MRR output spectrum, making it a valuable tool for biosensing applications.</p>\n<p>The fourth chapter discusses the use of MIR absorption spectroscopy in integrated photonic circuits for trace-gas sensing. Specifically, it focuses on designing and creating suspended InGaAs waveguide devices with holey photonic crystal waveguides (HPCWs) and subwavelength grating cladding waveguides (SWWs) for mid-infrared sensing at a wavelength of 6.15 &mu;m. These devices are intended for use in monolithic integrated circuits with Quantum Cascade Lasers (QCLs) and Quantum Cascade Detectors (QCDs). The experiments successfully detected 5 ppm of ammonia using a 1 mm long suspended HPCW and a 3 mm long suspended SWW, with varying propagation losses. Using the Beer-Lambert infrared absorption law and experimental data, the study estimates a minimum detectable gas concentration of 84 ppb from a QCL/QCD integrated SWW sensor. Importantly, this research marks the first demonstration of suspended InGaAs membrane waveguides in the InGaAs-InP platform at such a long wavelength for gas sensing. It also highlights the advantages of SWWs, including reduced transmission loss and a smaller device footprint, due to their low propagation loss and compatibility with TM mode when compared to HPCWs. This work opens up possibilities for the monolithic integration of quantum cascade devices with TM polarized characteristics and passive waveguide sensing devices, enabling on-chip mid-IR absorption spectroscopy.</p>\n<p>In the fifth chapter, we discuss the development and&nbsp;<span>potential of optical neural networks for neurocomputing due to their efficiency. We propose an optical subspace neural network with fewer optical components, lower costs, and energy consumption compared to classical ONNs. It can play a significant role in the communication and sensing applications. Finally, in the last chapter, we have shown development of am MRR based optical sensing device and demonstrated identifcation and differentiation between the Covid and influenza virus on the sillicon based platform.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>In summary, this research project achieved significant milestones in the field of silicon photonic-based FTS and on-chip spectrometry. The team successfully developed innovative solutions to address limitations in spectral bandwidth, resolution, biosensing, and gas detection, contributing to the advancement of compact and highly efficient spectrometry technologies. These outcomes hold promise for a wide range of applications, including environmental monitoring, healthcare, and laboratory research, where compact and integrated spectrometers can offer significant advantages in terms of portability, cost-effectiveness, and sensitivity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/30/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ray&nbsp;T&nbsp;Chen</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1932753/1932753_10628224_1695321131171_Schematicillustrationoftheoperationprincipleoftheon-chipspectrometerintegratedopticalbiosensorplatform--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1932753/1932753_10628224_1695321131171_Schematicillustrationoftheoperationprincipleoftheon-chipspectrometerintegratedopticalbiosensorplatform--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"On-chip Fourier transform spectrometer integrated optical biosensor platform\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1932753/1932753_10628224_1695321131171_Schematicillustrationoftheoperationprincipleoftheon-chipspectrometerintegratedopticalbiosensorplatform--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"On-chip Fourier transform spectrometer integrated optical biosensor platform\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Schematic illustration of the operation principle of the on-chip spectrometer integrated optical biosensor platform</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kyoung Min Yoo</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ray&nbsp;T&nbsp;Chen</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">On-chip Fourier transform spectrometer integrated optical biosensor platform</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1932753/1932753_10628224_1695320912951_OpticalMicrographsoftheFTSdevice--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1932753/1932753_10628224_1695320912951_OpticalMicrographsoftheFTSdevice--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Thermal Tuning Fourier Transform Spectroscopy Device\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1932753/1932753_10628224_1695320912951_OpticalMicrographsoftheFTSdevice--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Thermal Tuning Fourier Transform Spectroscopy Device\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Optical Micrographs of the FTS device after depositing the top oxide cladding</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ali Rostamian</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ray&nbsp;T&nbsp;Chen</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Thermal Tuning Fourier Transform Spectroscopy Device</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1932753/1932753_10628224_1695320728256_BandpasssamplingSHFTSdevicefootprintandopticalimages.(a)Thedevicefootprintincludingcharacterizationpatterns.(b)ThepictureoffabricatedSi3N4chip--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1932753/1932753_10628224_1695320728256_BandpasssamplingSHFTSdevicefootprintandopticalimages.(a)Thedevicefootprintincludingcharacterizationpatterns.(b)ThepictureoffabricatedSi3N4chip--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SHFTS device\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1932753/1932753_10628224_1695320728256_BandpasssamplingSHFTSdevicefootprintandopticalimages.(a)Thedevicefootprintincludingcharacterizationpatterns.(b)ThepictureoffabricatedSi3N4chip--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SHFTS device\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Bandpass sampling SHFTS device footprint and optical images.
