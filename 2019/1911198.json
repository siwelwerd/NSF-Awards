 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over cosmic time, galaxies grow by acquiring gas and turning it into stars. Models of the growth of galaxies need to deal with the influence of star formation and evolution on the rate at which gas is then cooled and turned into more stars, in a process known as 'feedback'. This project will develop better models on the role that high-energy particles known as cosmic rays play in feedback. These models will then be made available to astrophysicists to better model galaxy growth.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will develop 'small-scale physics' models of how cosmic rays interact with cold and warm gas in the circumgalactic medium. They will look at a number of interactions involving cosmic rays, including turbulence, thermal instabilities, and cloud entrainment. This physics will then be incorporated in MHD codes for modeling feedback in galaxies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
