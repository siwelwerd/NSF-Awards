 "awd_abstract_narration": "The manufacturing industry in the United States has an increasing need for well-qualified workers. In the western region of Pennsylvania, there are growing needs for skilled technicians in advanced manufacturing and energy companies. To help address this situation, the Community College of Allegheny County will work with industry partners and community organizations to develop courses in new technology areas and expand the college's associate degree program in mechatronics (a blend of mechanical, electrical, and computerized technologies). These new courses will address areas such as robotics, plastics technology, and process technology. Faculty will also be able to obtain certifications in these new areas. This expansion of the program into areas of industrial growth will serve as a model for the benefits of integrating industry certification with academic coursework. The mechatronics program will be designed to offer a variety of options that allow more students to participate and obtain degrees. The project team will also work with secondary school teachers to increase the interest of high school students in career pathways in advanced manufacturing fields. The project will help increase the number of technicians with skills needed for the workforce in the western Pennsylvania region and the nation. \r\n\r\nThree goals will guide the project. First, to expand the existing mechatronics degree program to include specialization courses in Robotics, Plastics and Process Technology, and Green Manufacturing. Second, to provide professional development and certifications for faculty in these new technology areas. Three, to develop strategies to increase the exposure and retention along career pathways for secondary school and community college students. The new courses will cover concepts and skills based on industry-relevant topics such as programming portable and customizable robots, injection molding, plastic material selection, instrumentation and operations, quality control, and equipment troubleshooting. These courses will have an overarching theme of green manufacturing. The new curriculum will incorporate capstone projects that include project-based learning activities and student internships. The mechatronics program will also be enhanced to provide flexible evening and weekend scheduling as well as self-paced, online courses to facilitate more participation from a diverse population of students and students in rural areas. Mechatronics faculty at the college will use transportable trainers to provide hands-on guest lectures for secondary school students to showcase career pathways or instruct course modules at high schools. The college will also host Mechatronics Problem Solving Competitions for secondary school students to encourage their engagement in, and awareness of, technician pathways for advanced manufacturing fields. The curriculum materials and project results will be shared regionally and nationally. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Community College of Allegheny County (CCAC) has offered a Mechatronics program since 2006 based on the four-level Advanced Manufacturing/Integrated Systems Technology (AM/IST) curriculum. CCAC first acquired Level 1 of this curriculum and corresponding equipment through a National Center for Integrated Systems Technology (NCIST) grant in 2005. Through support from National Science Foundation (NSF) Advanced Technological Education (ATE) for the Technicians in Energy, Advanced Manufacturing, and Supply Chain Technology (TEAMS) Project (Award No. 1400575, 2014 - 2018, PI Ronald Logreco and Gretchen Mullin-Sawicki) CCAC was able to develop AM/IST Level 4 curriculum and provide professional development for college faculty to facilitate building an Associate of Science in Mechatronics. This was followed with the Advancing Mechatronics Technician Education (2019) grant provided NSF/ATE funding for Program Expansion and Professional Development in the areas of Robotics, Plastics and Process Technology, and Green Manufacturing.  This also allowed for outreach to high school students by supporting the creation of a Mechatronics College-in-the High School tract at West Allegheny High School. Further outreach was impacted due to the implementation of COVID-19 restrictions. Through the second round of funding, CCAC developed two courses for the plastics focus; Introduction to Polymers and Advanced Materials and Process. These two new courses, combined with three establishedcourses, form the requirements for the Polymer Technology Certificate. During the 2019-2020 academic year, three students successfully completed the requirement. In 2020-2021, six students received the certificate.   \n\n\nfor the robotics focus, a new course, Robotics and Artificial Intelligence was designed to utilize the two Temi robots purchased with the project funds. A course in microcontrollers was modified to utilize the Farmbots purchased. The course introduces the basics of Process Control to students. These new courses and certificate were incorporated into CCAC\u2019s Mechatronics programs as restricted electives. This was then expanded to be technical electives for the six Engineering Technology programs at CCAC as well. Thirteen students completed the revised course in the 2022-2023 year. The New Robotics Course launch was delayed due to COVID-19 concerns but will be launched Spring, 2024. \n\n\n  \n\n\nProfessional Development funded by the grant included two high school faculty members at West Allegheny High School certified as MSSC instructors. Two CCAC faculty received certifications in fanuc robotics, Mike Rowe Works and one additional faculty in MSSC and one in Green Manufacturing. The high school outreach and competition could not be accomplished through this funding period due to the restrictions instated by the area high schools as a result of COVID-19. \n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/29/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Patricia Thompson"
