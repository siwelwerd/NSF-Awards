 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM). Advances in computing technology have ushered in an era of big data in science. As scientists increasingly rely on large, professionally collected data sets for scientific discovery, there is a critical need to build a scientific workforce with robust skills in making sense of multivariate data. The project will develop and research four model curriculum units and an interactive experience with weather scientists to promote important scientific data practices and interest in big data science careers among middle-school students in underserved New England rural areas. Designed as 2-week data investigations, the units will provide students with hands-on opportunities to analyze and model large-scale weather data collected from the summit and lower elevations of Mt. Washington, NH (the highest mountain in the eastern United States), as well as data collected from students' local weather stations. Students will learn to describe, explain, model, and predict extreme weather events both in their local settings as well as at Mount Washington Observatory, a site that has recorded some of the most extreme weather conditions in the world. Students will conduct these activities using the Common Online Data Analysis Platform (CODAP) and SageModeler, two online resources developed with NSF funding to support students in middle school and beyond with visualizing, modeling, and analyzing large-scale scientific data. They will also learn from and interact with weather scientists through a virtual Chat with a scientist to deepen their understandings of their own data investigations and to gain insights into scientific careers that use big data. The project will disseminate research findings and educational resources through a variety of channels to reach a diverse and cross-disciplinary group of researchers, educators, and members of the general public. Project findings and resources will be made available through public education websites, conference presentations, peer-reviewed and practitioner publications, social media, and further dissemination through conventional media including print, radio, and television. \r\n\r\nThe project will develop a new multi-faceted set of science learning resources targeted to rural, underserved middle-school students and research the potential of these experiences to promote these students' interests and competence in scientific data analysis and modeling. The project team will collect a variety of qualitative and quantitative data during each phase to inform unit development and to address the project?s research questions. During the early feedback phase, the team will explore the feasibility of using WeatherX units by sharing initial unit ideas and activities with teachers and soliciting their feedback through written surveys and focus-groups During the alpha testing phases, the team will continue to explore the feasibility of using WeatherX units as teachers implement the units with students. The team will attend to any variations in how teachers enact the units and the ways in which the units may support student interest and engagement in data analysis, modeling, and scientific careers. To address these questions, the project team will collect survey and focus-group data from teachers and additional data through teacher implementation logs, teacher individual interviews, classroom observations, student surveys, student focus-groups and student work samples. During the later testing phases, the project team will focus less on feasibility of unit use and more on unit enactment, mechanisms by which the units may support student learning, and quantitative measures of improvement in student learning and interest in data analysis, modeling, and scientific careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The WeatherX units provide students with hands-on opportunities to analyze large-scale weather data to build understandings of typical and extreme weather in their local settings and on the summit of Mount Washington, NH - a site that has recorded some of the most extreme weather conditions in the world. Spanning from August 2019 - July 2024, the project was led by education researchers, developers, and scientists at Education Development Center (EDC), the Mount Washington Observatory (MWOBS) in New Hampshire, the University of Maine at Orono, the University of Washington at Seattle, and the Concord Consortium.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Curriculum components</strong></p>\r\n<p>Each curriculum unit, available at <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/edcweatherx/home\">go.edc.org/weatherx</a>, includes 10 lessons and involves up to 15 hours of teacher-facilitated classroom-based learning.</p>\r\n<p>Unit 1, <em>Exploring Our Local Weather</em> (the \"Local Unit\"), uses data to build understandings of major weather components and how data are collected and used to determine typical weather in students&rsquo; local areas. &nbsp;Students collect and maintain their own weather data journal, analyze large-scale data from a local weather station, and interview a local community member to learn how major weather events have affected their life and the community.</p>\r\n<p>Unit 2, <em>Investigating Extreme Weather </em>(i.e., the \"Extreme Weather Unit\"),<em> </em>focuses on extreme weather in students' local area and on Mount Washington. Students learn about the mechanics and characteristics of hurricanes, and they examine community resources focused on emergency response and preparedness and extreme weather mitigation efforts. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In WeatherX, classrooms also had opportunities to conduct a <em>Chat with a Scientist</em> stationed on the summit of Mount Washington. Weather observers from MWOBS spoke to classrooms of students through a live video link in 30- to 45-minute sessions to address students' questions about life and work on the summit.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Learning tools </strong></p>\r\n<p>In WeatherX, students analyze large-scale weather datasets from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) using CODAP, a free browser-based data analysis and visualization tool that was developed by The Concord Consortium. The WeatherX project built a NOAA Weather portal - a permanent plug-in within CODAP - which provides access to current and historic weather measurements from NOAA for 1,783 weather stations across the U.S. (Figure 1). Using data drawn from the NOAA Weather portal, students build understandings of typical and extreme weather by generating and investigating graphs of weather variables and comparing data findings with 30-year climate normals (Figures 2 and 3).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Intellectual merit: Research findings</strong></p>\r\n<p>During the 2021/2022 school year, the WeatherX project conducted a pilot test of both units with six middle-school science teachers and their students in six rural communities in New Hampshire and Maine. Based on student responses to an assessment of statistical thinking administered at the start of Unit 1 and the completion of Unit 2, students' abilities to translate information between tables and graphs increased significantly (<em>p</em>&lt;.05, <em>n</em>=49), with an effect size of <em>d=</em>0.38. However, student understandings of other statistical practices, such as locating the average or determining levels of variability in graphical displays of data, did not increase significantly. In post-unit surveys, a plurality of students rated the WeatherX units more highly than other lessons in their science classes, but data from pre- and post-unit interest scales did not show growth in students' interests in working with data. Data from student focus groups and open-ended survey responses suggest that many students found it interesting and valuable to learn to analyze large-scale weather data in CODAP, but other students found data analysis work less \"hands-on\" and enjoyable than active science experiments, and some students found it challenging to write scientific claims using data. These challenges suggest the need for more research on strategies that can engage students in developing strong data practices in science classroom contexts.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Broader impacts: Project reach</strong></p>\r\n<p>Iterative development and testing of WeatherX units involved collaboration with 17 middle-school teachers and over 470 students in rural parts of NH and ME. The project has shared findings through regional and national conferences and is publishing results in peer-reviewed journals and newsletters of partner organizations. The project has also shared its work through a 3-minute video that was published in 2022 through NSF's STEM for All Video Showcase and won a Facilitator's Choice award. Since late 2022, educators from 13 states around the U.S. and two countries outside the U.S. have registered through the project's website to download and use WeatherX curriculum materials. Project resources and tools continue to be used by other NSF-funded projects and by the MWOBS in its educational programming with formal and informal educators across the U.S.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/29/2024<br>\nModified by: Josephine&nbsp;K&nbsp;Louie</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1850447/1850447_10622017_1732864899034_WX_Figure_2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1850447/1850447_10622017_1732864899034_WX_Figure_2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 2.
