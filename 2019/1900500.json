 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, Dr. Guoqi Zhang of John Jay College of the City University of New York is developing new catalysts for the synthesis of silicones.  Silicones are important to society as they are typically heat-resistant polymers used in sealants, adhesives, lubricants, medicine, cooking utensils, and thermal and electrical insulation.  Silicones are currently industrially made using platinum which is expensive, rare and environmentally-damaging to mine.  This research is focusing on replacing platinum with other more Earth-abundant and sustainable metals.  Dr. Zhang has designed new families of catalysts using metals such as manganese, vanadium, and aluminum. Catalysts based on these inexpensive metals have traditionally been ignored because they are usually unreactive and unstable. Dr. Zhang is addressing these gaps using group attached to the metal that enhance the reactivity of these metals. This project also provides hands-on training for undergraduate students in both organic chemistry and inorganic chemistry.  Experience with modern instrumentation is gained by these students.  John Jay College, which has a large Hispanic student population, is an ideal setting to train students who are underrepresented in scientific fields. \r\n\r\nDr. Zhang aims to investigate the synthesis, structures and catalytic properties of base metal complexes supported by redox active terpyridine ligands, as well as their catalytic properties relevant to silicone preparation. Novel catalysts composed of Earth-abundant metals including manganese, vanadium and aluminum and terpyridine-type ligands are being explored for their unique structures and catalytic reactivity in reduction processes. Their applications in catalytic hydrofunctionalization reactions are sought to develop effective catalysts to replace platinum-based catalysts that are widely used in industrial silicone production. Mechanistic studies are being carried out based on a combined experimental and theoretical effort, in order to understand the importance of ligand compartment and to establish the structure-activity relationships. Dr. Zhang's active involvement in recruiting and retaining minority students into scientific fields is helping to cultivate the next generation workforce. This project is being done in collaboration with John Jay's Program for Research Initiatives for Science Majors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
