 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference will bring together researchers and students, observers and theorists representing a variety of surveys and missions for the presentation and discussion of the latest discoveries and on-going work with RR Lyrae and Cepheid type pulsating variable stars.  During the meeting, participants will discuss and share the latest results from a variety of datasets (ground-based surveys and space-based missions), the latest theoretical models (from hydrodynamical codes describing stellar interiors, stellar evolution of pulsating stars, and pulsation theory), and topics on the small (binary systems) and large (near-field cosmology) scale.   The conference is scheduled for October 13-18, 2019 in Cloudcroft, New Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe conference is well situated to bring astronomy to the local communities in southeastern New Mexico. One aim to broaden the impact of the meeting is to engage with the local Native Americans to share their understanding of the night sky with our group of scientists. This cultural exchange is expected to be illuminating and inspirational, and educational for everyone. The second aim is to reach out to the amateur astronomy community to encourage joint research projects with professional astronomers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
