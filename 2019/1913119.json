 "awd_abstract_narration": "Certified algorithms are computations that are guaranteed to never produce a wrong answer when implemented on a real-world computer. These algorithms are important in any setting where the correctness of a computation is critical and errors cannot be tolerated.  Such algorithms have potential applications in many fields, including optimization, automation, and graphics.  For example, with self-driving cars, it is vital that the decision-making algorithms do not make errors.  For instance, if a non-certified algorithm were to miss a small, but important detail, a car might not fit through a gap or cause an accident. As this type of automation becomes more common, the need for corresponding certified computation will increase.  The work in this particular project involves the design, development, and implementation of efficient certified methods for finding common solutions to systems of polynomials.  The development of the algorithms described in this project fills a current gap in the field of numerical algebraic geometry since previous approaches are either non-certified, i.e., may make mistakes in some cases, or impractical certified methods, i.e., take too long to produce an answer in practical situations.  The work in this project is intended to solve these problems, i.e., to be practical and certified. \r\n\r\nFor many computations, algorithms can only produce an approximation to the true answer.  Certified algorithms not only produce a final result from a computation, but they also provide estimates on the error between the final answer and the true answer.  Developing certified algorithms is a (new) challenge for computational mathematics and computer science. A certified algorithm must, first, be proved to be correct when assuming that a computer can represent all real numbers. Second, the correctness of the algorithm must be justified when the allowed numbers are approximated by the much smaller set of numbers that can be represented on a computer.  Therefore, two of the main challenges in certified methods can be summarized as (1) Since many problems involve discretizing a continuous variable, the theory must be developed to ensure that the choice of discretization does not miss any interesting behaviors between discrete steps and (2) Since not all real numbers can be represented on a computer, all tests and computations must be developed to work with approximations, but still produce meaningful data about the underlying real number.  The project involves the design, implementation, and development of an efficient and certified homotopy continuation algorithm in dimensions greater than one.  The work generalizes the preliminary exploration and implementation developed by the PI in the univariate case.  This prototype is very efficient because of its use of new subroutines, based on interval methods, which have more flexibility than previous approaches.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nDuring this grant, the PI published 9 journal publications, 2 conference proceedings, and produced 2 softare packages. One of these papers was coauthored by one of the PI's students.\n\n\nThe PI published a series of papers focused on certified computation while solving polynomial systems. Certified computations are algorithms that come with a correctness guarantee, i.e., that they can never produce an incorrect answer. With our world becomming more automated, there are instances where correct computations are critically important. These published algorithms are numerical in nature, which means that they are also efficient, and there is the potential for these types of algorithms to be developed into applications where there is no margin for error.\n\n\nThe PI developed two new homotopy continuation methods. Homotopy continuation methods are often used to solve systems of polynomials, which may come from applications in engineering and the sciences. The first new method is guaranteed to be optimal in that it only does as much computation as necessary. The second homotopy continuation method is the first practical certified homotopy continuation method. In addition, this method provides explicit descriptions of the properties needed of ingredients that can be used by others to develop other certified homotopy computations. This successfully completes one of the major goals of this project.\n\n\nThe PI published a series of papers on certified computation and singularities. In general, singularities are challenging for numerical algorithms to process. The PI produced methods to identify and isolate clusters of zeros for polynomial systems. By isolating these near-singularities, these algorithms can be used to keep numerical algorithms away from difficult-to-process regions (which be processed in some other way).\n\n\nThe PI published a series of papers on computability in dynamical systems including a survey paper on this topic. In dynamical systems and its applications, it is common for researchers to use numerical experiments to study the behavior of their systems. In many cases, the resuts of these numerical experiments cannot be relied upon. The PI's work identified when invariants such as the entropy can be reliability computed. This research included new results about coded shifts, which had not been studied in this way before, but have many applications in science.\n\n\nThe PI supported four graduate students over the lifetime of the award, three PhD students and one masters student. The masters student graduated during the award period. In addition, the PI published papers with four graduate students (three of which were not his student) over the lifetime of the award.\n\n\nThe PI has published papers in academic journals and conference proceedings in order to disseminate the results to the community. In addition, versions of the submitted papers have been placed on the arXiv, in order to freely disseminate the results to the community. The PI has also given talks at academic institutions and conferences to present the results to the community. The software packages produced by the PI are freely available as part of the Macaulay2 software package available on GitHub.\n\n\nThe PI has organized a conference on discrete mathematics and algorithms (primarily funded by the NSA). The PI also served on the program committee for ISSAC 2023.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/11/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MichaelBurr\n"
