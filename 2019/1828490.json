 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the acquisition of a Magnetic Properties Measurement System (MPMS), a high-magnetic-field, measurement system for measuring the magnetic properties of various material, geological, and chemical specimens at Johns Hopkins University.  This MPMS is a versatile instrument that can measure a wide range of material systems with a high sample throughput rate.  This instrument will support a large and active research effort in condensed matter physics, materials science, geophysics, and magnetism of chemical species at Johns Hopkins University.  Acquisition of the MPMS system will significantly enhance current research programs and enable new research directions at Johns Hopkins.  The proposed instrument will enhance the research training of the approximately twelve postdoctoral fellows and twenty graduate students directly involved in the proposed research. As the instrument will be made available to the broader Johns Hopkins research community, its impact on research training will grow with time. The instrument will also benefit undergraduate and graduate laboratory courses, and the extensive education outreach programs focusing on materials research that are already in place at Johns Hopkins for high school students, high school teachers, and undergraduates.  The MPMS will also support work going on in the NSF funded PARADIM program.   \r\n\r\n\r\nThis award is for the acquisition of a Magnetic Properties Measurement System (MPMS) for measuring the magnetic properties of various material, geological, and chemical specimens at Johns Hopkins University.   The instrument is based on a low-temperature cryostat, an integrated superconducting magnet and a superconducting quantum interference device (a \"SQUID\").  The proposed system has a magnet that can apply magnetic fields up to 7 Tesla to a variable temperature sample chamber.  Temperature capabilities beyond the standard T = 1.8 to 400 K, necessary for much of the proposed science, will be provided by a sample space oven, allowing up to T = 800 K, and a helium three insert option, allowing low temperature measurements down to T = 0.3 K.  The work will include experiments that spans a wide range of scientific areas, including probing correlated electron systems, nanomagnets and superconducting nanostructures, new superconductors, magnetism in quasi-two-dimensional organic conductors, synthesis and assembly of magnetic nanomaterials, and investigations of analogs of heme- and non-heme metalloenzymes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUsing NSF funds we were able to install in a Magnetic Property Measurement System (MPMS)  in Johns Hopkins University's Dept. of Physics and Astronomy.   This instrument allows the measurement of magnetic properties of materials to high accuracy.  As compared to previous generations of instruments from Quantum Design, this Quantum Design MPMS incorporates major advances in data acquisition, temperature control and magnetic field control with &le;10-8 emu sensitivity.  This instrument is being used for research in condensed matter physics, material science, chemistry, and chemical engineering.   Systems of interest include superconductors and unconventional magnets.   Recent experiments include ones on quantum spin liquid candidates such a family of materials that include honeycomb lattice systems that include cobalt like Li3Co2SbO6.  Quantum spin liquids are macroscopic states of matter that are believed to be described by a macroscopic quantum mechanical superposition of different spin states.   These materials have been proposed to be examples of Kitaev spin liquids.  The Kitaev model is a rare example of an analytically solvable and physically instantiable Hamiltonian yielding a topological quantum spin liquid ground state.  Such material systems may be useful for quantum computation.   It is being also used for routine measurements to find material parameters.   For instance, another spin liquid candidate which is in the pyrochlore structure Pr2Zr2O7 was recently measured to find the Curie constant, which was useful in understanding the temperature scale below which magnetic correlations were significant.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/03/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Norman P Armitage"
