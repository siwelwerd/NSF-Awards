 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics and it addresses the priority areas of NSF's \"Windows on the Universe\" Big Idea. LIGO (the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory) has made history by detecting several binary black hole mergers and a binary neutron star merger.  The latter was especially exciting because it was also detected by optical and other electromagnetic telescopes and because it provided new insights into the behavior of matter at its greatest extremes since the Big Bang.  Detection of continuous gravitational waves from a single neutron star, a faint signal lasting many years, could tell us even more about such matter - how solid it is, how well it conducts heat and electricity, maybe even the existence of exotic states predicted by particle physics.  This award supports searches of Advanced LIGO data for continuous gravitational waves from the youngest neutron stars in our galaxy, using existing telescope observations to point toward likely targets.  It also supports the training of graduate and undergraduate students who will constitute the next generation of scientists.\r\n\r\nSpecific science goals are (1) directed searches for young non-pulsing neutron stars such as Cas A, (2) narrow band searches for r-mode oscillations in pulsars such as the Crab, and (3) theoretical guidance and interpretation of searches for continuous gravitational waves, particularly from neutron-star r-modes.  Searches will be performed with the Texas Tech group's longstanding code pipeline based on matched filtering, which will be upgraded as the award progresses.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis award contributed to some of the most sensitive searches yet for novel sources of gravitational waves - spinning neutron stars emitting long lived continuous wave signals. When they are detected, they will reveal information about the microphysics of matter under the most extreme conditions in the modern universe. Young neutron stars might be the best emitters of these novel signals, and this award supported the first physically consistent search for the youngest neutron star known, formed in a nearby supernova in 1987. It also supported the first search with a interesting sensitivity for long-lived r-mode oscillations from a pulsing neutron star. The Drill search code has been made public. As well as similar searches for other nearby young neutron stars, this award supported the most sensitive high freqency search for older, less visible neutron stars in binary systems all across the sky. This award also supported estimates of the sensitivity of Cosmic Explorer, a next generation improvement on the LIGO detectors, to continuous waves and bursts associated with neutron starquakes. This work set the stage for the impending searches for novel signals in data from Advanced LIGO's 2023 run at full design sensitivity.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis award contributed to the training of four young scientists (one a minority) in undergraduate, graduate student, and postdoctoral roles. Afterward they have applied their skills in teaching positions, academic research, and industrial data analysis. Students were trained in big data and supercomputing as well as small scale analytical and numerical methods.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/27/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: BenjaminJOwen\n"
