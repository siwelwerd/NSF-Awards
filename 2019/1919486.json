 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since their discovery in 1895, x-rays have found numerous applications in medical technologies and in the elemental and structural analysis of materials and proteins. With the advent of new laser technologies, it has become possible to produce x-ray bursts of duration less than a millionth of a trillionth of a second (an attosecond). These novel ultrashort x-rays pulses can provide a window into the inner workings of complex molecules relevant to light harvesting and catalysis and guide the development of novel materials for quantum information processing. Researchers working on this project will create new x-ray research opportunities by developing an instrumental platform that integrates the x-ray pulses with state-of-the-art detectors, such as transient x-ray spectrometer and electron imaging. The goal of this effort will be direct observation, manipulation, and real-time control of quantum processes in molecules and materials, the pursuit of which is vital to energy, information, and security interests of our nation. The project will thus enhance US scientific competitiveness and train the next generation workforce in new x-ray technologies.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the project aims to develop a tabletop instrument for time-resolved multifunctional attosecond x-ray spectroscopy, which will realize the ultimate time-resolution to probe the dynamics of charge redistribution in molecules and materials with chemical sensitivity, atomic resolution, and orbital selectivity. The instrument will cover the soft x-ray range from 100 to 1000 electron volts using a high-power mid-infrared laser for harmonic generation. The combination of attosecond resolution, high flux, and elemental specificity will extend the x-ray spectroscopic capabilities into a new regime, leading to a unique multiuser instrument for novel insights into fundamental electronic processes, especially those involving correlated electron dynamics. The instrument will offer easy access and research training opportunities for students and early career researchers. The development project integrates transient x-ray absorption spectroscopy, photoelectron spectroscopy, streaking capabilities, and coincident charge particle imaging to serve a broad user base at the University of Arizona, as well as other scientists at the national level.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
