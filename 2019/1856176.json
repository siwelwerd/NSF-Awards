 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the Midwest Dynamical Systems Workshops in Fall 2019 and Fall 2020. The 2019 Workshop will be held at the University of Illinois, Chicago from October 25-27, 2019. The 2020 workshop will be hosted by another regional academic institution with an active program in dynamical systems research; the 2020 host institution will be selected by the conference's Scientific Advisory Board in 2019.  The Midwest Dynamical Systems Workshop is an ongoing educational experience for graduate students and a vehicle for supporting the research careers of new researchers.  This award gives early-career researchers, researchers who are members of underrepresented groups, and researchers without other sources of support the opportunity to participate in the conferences. \r\n\r\nThe workshops focus on recent developments in the field of dynamical systems. Several important topics will be covered in the 2019 meeting, including but not restricted to arithmetic dynamics, holomorphic dynamics, parabolic dynamics, thermodynamic formalism, symbolic dynamics, ergodic Ramsey theory, and rigidity phenomena.  Connections between dynamical systems and other areas of science will also be covered, potentially including theoretical physics, statistical mechanics, electrical engineering, information theory, economics, game theory, voting theory, and epidemiology.  More information can be found on the workshop web site http://sites.math.northwestern.edu/mwds/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nThis grant provided financial support for three mathematical conferences from the long-running and influential Midwest Dynamical Systems conference series. Dynamical Systems is one of the most active areas of mathematical research and has interactions with almost every other area of mathematics, as well as with physics, biology, chemistry, astronomy, meteorology, medicine, and other sciences. \nEach meeting was held at a different location: University of Illinois Chicago in 2019, Northwestern University in 2021, and Notre Dame University in 2022.  By hosting the Midwest Dynamical Systems conferences at many different universities this grant brought the conferences close to a wide audience, including students and early career researchers who may otherwise not be able to attend.\nIn response to the COVID 19 pandemic, a special additional conference was held on zoom during 2020, which was aimed at early career mathematicians.\nEach of the conferences brought together researchers from all areas of dynamical systems and emphasized the importance of interactions between these areas and with other areas of mathematics and science.  Moreover they provided opportunities for PhD students and recent PhD's to present their work, both by giving hour-long talks and by presenting at poster sessions.  This provided a mechanism for attracting students to the field, thus helping to ensure its vibrancy in the future.\n Participation of women and minorities was encouraged in each of the conferences.  Between all three conferences, there were approximately 190 participants, with more than 70% of them early-career mathematicians (graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and untenured professors).  Each conference had participants from 15-30 different universities.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Roland K Roeder"
