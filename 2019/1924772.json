 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to potentially provide a solution that will enable the furniture industry to address the issue of blood flow associated with prolonged sitting. The commercialization of the technology will potentially impact the lives of individuals who sit for prolonged periods of time, especially in the office work environment. This technology will steer the industry in a new direction using science and technology to address an important issue -- venous blood flow issue resulting from prolonged sitting.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project further develops a seating solution to address the issue of blood flow associated with prolonged sitting. Millions of individuals work in office and administrative support occupations. Most of these individuals spend majority of their working time sitting. With prolonged sitting there is immobility in the lower extremities which could result in venous blood flow issues and in some cases pulmonary embolism.  The innovation is a seating solution with a seat that is split so there are two parts on the bottom that could move separately by pushing down on a lever and individuals could move their legs up and down. This proposed technology is valuable to any organization where individuals sit and work because of improved blood flow and perceived comfort which lead to greater satisfaction and increased productivity in work.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
