 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Distributed Arrays of Small Instruments (DASI) project will support the development of a network of Personal Space Weather Stations (PSWS).  The PSWS is a ground-based, modular, multi-instrument system capable of remote sensing the geospace system. This project is to develop a protoype of an integrated PSWSS which will initially consist of a radio receiver instrument, a ground magnetometer, and a central computer. The modular nature of the system will allow for the later addition of new instruments. This prototype is being developed in collaboration between multiple universities and the ham radio community through the Ham Radio Science Citizen Investigation (HamSCI) collective and the TAPR amateur radio engineering organization, who would eventually host instruments at their local sites. A primary goal of the PSWS project is to make it affordable to individuals. In this way, the PSWS network of instruments is easily expandable and can grow organically by engaging the general public. At the same time, stations can also be sited and managed by professional institutions, guaranteeing required coverage. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the PSWS is to collect data on variety of phenomena - Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances and ionospheric absorption events, geomagnetic storms and substorms, magnetospheric ultra low frequency (ULF) pulsations, and geomagnetically-induced currents (GICs). TIDs exist over such large spatial scales that it is currently impossible to track them from source to dissipation. There is a significant lack of data on local effects of geomagnetic storms as well. The PSWS addresses this through the development of instrumentation that can easily be deployed internationally.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The principal focus of this grant was to address the engineering challenges associated with the design, construction, computerization, and distribution of the receivers.

The signals from WWV, WWVH, and CHU are in the frequency band between AM broadcast and FM broadcast (3-30 MHz). Those radio frequencies can be received over the horizon from the transmitter because they are refracted by the ionosphere. Since the transmitted signals are constant, the qualities of those signals as received far away provide an indirect measurement of the ionosphere. By monitoring the geophysically induced Doppler shift of these precisely controlled carrier frequencies, PSWS nodes obtain a proxy measurement of ionospheric variability along the propagation path from beacon to receiver, picking up disturbances from space weather in the magnetosphere above and terrestrial weather in the neutral atmosphere below. This technique is enhanced by comparatively recent advancements in GPS-disciplined oscillators, data storage and inexpensive single-board computers. Multiple networked receivers are considered as a single meta-instrument, yielding insights about the behavior of the ionospheric system which would not be possible to obtain with data from only a single instrument. The scope of the network is flexible by design, allowing for new instruments to be added over time. The resulting living dataset is FAIR-compliant, documented, and accessible via the open-source Python package hamsci-psws. <br /><br />Over 100 PSWS receivers have been distributed to a network of operators that constitute the HamSCI PSWS Network.

The majority of these citizen scientists are amateur radio operators, a community with great interest in geospace and a history of participation in radio science campaigns extending back to the inception of ionospheric science. A distinct advantage to collaborating with the amateur community is the ability to leverage their expertise, resources, culture, and large numbers. <br /><br />The HamSCI PSWS network currently supports both short-term event-based analyses and long-term analyses of seasonal climatology from 2020 onward, capturing the peak years of solar cycle 25. In particular, the data have proven useful in characterizing flare-driven changes in ionospheric properties, particularly focusing on the phenomenon known as Doppler flash. Unlike the SuperDARN international scientific radar network, HamSCI PSWS offers a wider dynamic range, making it less susceptible to shortwave fadeout (SWF) impacts and enabling the recording of the full phase of the Doppler flash. Analyses have revealed several key findings: First, there is a strong functional trend between Doppler flash and solar flare strength, as well as the location on Earth. Also, it was observed that the Doppler flash occurs before the solar flare peak, specifically during the peak of the time rate of change in solar extreme ultraviolet irradiance. This suggests that while the instantaneous Doppler observed by the HF signal is proportional to the rate of change in solar irradiance, the total Doppler reflects the total flare-deposited energy in the ionosphere. Furthermore, while SWF serves as a good proxy for D-region electron density enhancement in the ionosphere during solar flares, Doppler flash acts as a proxy for the total energy deposition on the ionosphere. In comparison to SuperDARN, the PSWS has superior dynamic range since it has the topology of a bistatic radar. It also has a one-second cadence, which allows for the observation of faster events. Both of these advantages come into play for Doppler flash observations, making the PSWS network a useful complement to SuperDARN. Overall, these findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics of ionospheric response to solar flares and highlight the utility of HamSCI PSWS data in advancing knowledge in this field.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 05/14/2024<br>\nModified by: Christian&nbsp;A&nbsp;Zorman</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1932997/1932997_10638698_1715706988330_G2SystemLeft--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1932997/1932997_10638698_1715706988330_G2SystemLeft--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Grape Version-2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1932997/1932997_10638698_1715706988330_G2SystemLeft--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Grape Version-2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Photograph of a fully assembled Grape Version-2 Personal Space Weather Station (PSWS) ready for deployment.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">John Gibbons, Case Western Reserve University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christian&nbsp;A&nbsp;Zorman\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Grape Version-2</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1932997/1932997_10638698_1715708032771_GrapeV112Running--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1932997/1932997_10638698_1715708032771_GrapeV112Running--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Grape Version-1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1932997/1932997_10638698_1715708032771_GrapeV112Running--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Grape Version-1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Photograph of a Grape Version-1 Personal Space Weather Station (PSWS) receiver under operation.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">John Gibbons, Case Western Reserve University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christian&nbsp;A&nbsp;Zorman\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Grape Version-1</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
