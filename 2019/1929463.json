 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of U.S. based early career scientists in the biennial Gordon Research Conference on Coastal Ocean Dynamics and its associated Gordon Research Seminar. This conference brings together a diverse group of academic, federal, and international researchers to share the latest advances and identify new challenges in coastal ocean dynamics. The conference focuses on novel and recent developments in the application of theory, observations, and numerical modeling to further understanding coastal ocean processes and improving our predictive capabilities. It is at the coast that human activities are most connected with ocean circulation, and ocean modeling offers great promise for connecting scientific research to societal needs through such efforts as forecasting for marine operations and maritime safety, monitoring and prediction of water quality, the transport and dispersal of water borne pathogens, mapping and characterizing the habitats of marine life, and downscaling global models of climate variability and climatic change to infer their impacts in the coastal zone. An important broader impact of the conference is the establishment and nurturing of relationships between senior researchers, junior researchers and students for a variety of institutions. Nearly half of the conference time is allocated to informal interactions among participants, to provide numerous opportunities to build these relationships and exchange ideas among people in different age groups, different sub-disciplines of the field, or from different geographic regions. Funds will be used to expand the demographic, professional and geographic diversity of participants by supporting attendance by under-represented and under-resourced groups who stand to benefit from the intellectual environment and networking opportunities of the Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar formats.\r\n\r\nThis award provides funding for travel and registration support to U.S. based early-career professionals and students to attend the Gordon Research Conference on Coastal Ocean Dynamics which will be held at Southern New Hampshire University in Manchester, New Hampshire, from June 16-21, 2019. This conference, convened every two years, brings together a diverse group of academic, federal, and international researchers to share the latest advances and identify new challenges in coastal ocean dynamics. Here the term \"coastal\" refers to estuarine, littoral zone, continental shelf, and shelf-break regions, including mesoscale exchange processes with the adjacent deep-ocean or marginal seas.  The topics covered will include: 1) Shelf and Nearshore Sediment Transport Dynamics; 2) Novel Coastal Oceanographic Measurements and Analysis Techniques; 3) Links Between Biogeochemical Dynamics and Coastal Ocean Physics;  4) Coastal Ocean Observation and Modelling; 5) Advances in Understanding the Physics of Shallow and Nearshore Coastal Waters; 6) Progress in Estuarine Physics; 7)  Physical Oceanography and Ocean Derived Energy; 8) Sub-mesoscale Processes and Non-Linear Internal Waves; and 9) Discussion of Late-Breaking Topics in Coastal Dynamics. The Coastal Ocean Dynamics GRC will be accompanied by a Gordon Research Seminar that specifically targets professional development of students and early career scientists, thereby greatly expanding the broader impact of the GRC itself. Building on GRC's history of inclusion, the conference will include a special session (GRC Power Hour) dedicated to supporting the professional growth of women in our scientific communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
