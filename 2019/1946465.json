 "awd_abstract_narration": "The United States faces significant and growing strategic and competitiveness concerns stemming from the scientific and engineering progress around the world coupled with more open and connected markets that affect nearly every aspect of modern life. Responding to the opportunities presented by this change, countries--not only allies but also adversaries--are making significant investments in policies, institutions, and infrastructure with the goal of gaining technological competence and superiority in areas of strategic \r\nnational economic and security interest. Technological sophistication in both allies and adversary nations around the world have important consequences for the continued economic competitiveness and security of the United States: For the nation to adapt to new competitive realities, it must develop a broad awareness of current exigencies as well as emerging opportunities and challenges. To address these issues, the Board on Science, Technology, and Economic Policy (STEP), in cooperation  with the Committee on Science, Technology, and Law (CSTL), both part of the Policy and Global Affairs  Division's theme on U.S. Science and Innovation Policy, proposes to convene an ad hoc study committee  that will examine the current competitive position of the United States in emerging technologies; identify  challenges to its continued leadership in science, technology, and innovation; and identify the strategic  implications of the loss of scientific and innovation leadership in key areas. \r\n\r\nThe committee will organize a series of four workshops that will serve to gather data and informed  perspectives for the committee. Following each workshop, a proceedings in brief of the presentations and  discussions will be prepared by a designated rapporteur in accordance with institutional guidelines.  Finally, the evidence gathered at these workshops will inform the deliberations of the study committee, which will issue a consensus report with findings and recommendations. The study will draw attention to institutional and policy challenges, if any, facing the United States in maintaining technological superiority in key areas identified by the committee. The study will highlight  recent research on U.S. competitiveness and trade, technology, and innovation policies; and highlight how  existing policies and institutions may interact. In particular, the committee will discuss potential costs and  benefits associated with open science; discuss current market or institutional failures to accelerating  research advances that have the potential for game-changing economic, human health, and national  security leadership efforts; and consider how practices by other countries, including recruitment of top  talent, large resource investments, and novel use of information technologies to advance their  competitiveness and governance systems can, in a globalized world, affect U.S. institutions and  capabilities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
