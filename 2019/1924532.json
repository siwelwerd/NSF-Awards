 "awd_abstract_narration": "Due to climate change, sea level rise and anthropogenic development, coastal communities have been facing increasing threats from flooding, land loss, water quality, and other ecosystem challenges such as harmful algal blooms. Most of these pressing problems are directly or indirectly associated with sediment transport, some related to sands, but many are due to fine-grained sediments. Fine-grained sediments are cohesive and hence they transport as porous aggregates of particles, called flocs. Through their complex structures, flocs are vehicles of organic carbon, nutrients, contaminants and sometimes they can contain sand grains. Consequently, their settling velocities are very difficult to quantify. To date, most coastal/estuarine models neglect the flocculation process and adopt a constant settling velocity to estimate deposition of fine-grained sediments, which poses a considerable limitation of their predictive capability for the various challenges addressed above. In order to understand the fundamental dynamics of flocculation and their impact on fine-grained sediment resuspension and deposition, several integrated numerical simulations and optical-based laboratory observations across different scales will be carried out, including those associated with the particle size, water turbulence motions, and bottom boundary layer. Outcomes from the proposed research will be used to better equip coastal models with sediment transport capability to tackle challenges facing the coastal communities. The research findings will be widely disseminated to the coastal modeling community through participation in conferences and collaboration with the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System (CSDMS). The open-source code to be developed and the data from the laboratory experiments will be disseminated through CSDMS and the flocculation formulation codes to be developed will be integrated into the CSDMS modeling framework via the recently released Python Modeling Toolkit (PyMT). In addition, a clinic on flocculation modeling is planned for the CSDMS annual meeting. This project supports 2 PhD students who will receive balanced training in coastal processes, fluid dynamics, high performance computing and laboratory techniques. The project also provides partial support for an early career postdoc researcher. Two undergraduate students will benefit from this project for their research on cohesive sediments. The project also strengthens collaboration with the United Kingdom and Germany on novel observational and computational tools.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this collaborative study is to address key challenges of cohesive sediment transport in coastal/estuarine bottom boundary layers. The study utilizes a novel particle-resolved simulation model to investigate the physics of flocculation and floc structures for heterogeneous sediments. This effort is further augmented by laboratory experiments designed to better quantify stickiness and understand flocculation of sand-mud mixtures. Using a turbulence-resolving simulation model for fine sediment transport in a wave-current bottom boundary layer, coupled with enhanced flocculation formulations to model settling velocity, the investigators will study the interplay between flocculation, resuspension and deposition of cohesive sediments in coastal/estuarine bottom boundary layers. Five hypotheses are developed to guide the experimental and modeling work which will provide insight into key small-scale processes that are difficult to resolved in coastal models. Finally, by integrating and synthesizing these research outcomes, the study will evaluate a suite of closures for the settling velocity due to flocculation, from complex to simple, to inform coastal/estuarine modeling of cohesive sediment transport at regional scale.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The cohesion can also come from Transparent Exopolymer Particles (TEP) or more generally the Extracellular Polymeric Substance (EPS) due to high organic content. Since sediments, pollutants, carbon and nutrient are contained in the aggregates, flocculation is an important process in coastal and estuarine environments, influencing nutrient cycling, water quality, morphodynamics, and ecological stability. For example, flocculation causes fine sediments and dissolved organic matter to form larger flocs and promoting the removal of nutrients and pollutants from the water column through rapid sedimentation. As the flocculated particles settle quickly, it must be considered when predicting the deposition and erosion patterns of salt marshes and tidal flats.</p>\r\n<p>This is collaborative research between the University of Delaware and University of California Santa Barbara. The project has three main objectives to address the multi-scale challenges linking flocculation and cohesive sediment transport. We investigate the physics of flocculation using laboratory experiments and particle-scale simulations. Results are then used to inform size-class based flocculation model by solving the population balance equations to provide floc size distribution and settling velocity of cohesive sediment. Finally, a model framework is created to incorporate the size-class based flocculation model to simulate cohesive sediment transport in bottom boundary layer. Major findings resulted from this study are summarized as follows:</p>\r\n<p><strong>1. Bio-cohesion significantly reduces the variability of settling velocity of cohesive sediments (Fig. 2). </strong>Comprehensive laboratory experiments contrasting aggregates generated from pure minerals of different cohesion and minerals with artificial EPS (sticky material due to high organic content in water) reveal that field observed low variability of settling velocity of cohesive sediment in contrast to many laboratory experiments is due to the participation of EPS in the flocculation process. This finding provides important evidence for practical (or simple) modeling of fine sediment settling velocity in environments with high organic content.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2. A sand grain, non-cohesive by itself, can easily flocculate with cohesive sediment. </strong>The presence of only a small amount of cohesive sediment (as low as 10%) can significantly change the settling characteristics of fine sand and hence typical Stokes law used for non-cohesive sediment becomes inapplicable.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3. The cohesion properties of flocs play a significant role in determining the vertical profile of cohesive sediment in the current and wave bottom boundary layer (Fig. 3). </strong>Flocs with low cohesion or yield strength induce low settling velocity variability and cause a more well-mixed vertical profile of sediments. In the case of the current boundary layer, assuming a constant settling velocity is appropriate. However, in the case of wave bottom boundary, which is much thinner than the current counterpart, there is always large vertical variability of settling velocity. For flocs with higher cohesion/yields strength in higher concentrations, flocculation encourages the formation of lutocline.</p>\r\n<p><strong>4. The creation of a new model framework combining flocculation, flow and sediment transport. </strong>To facilitate the prediction of cohesive sediment transport on a regional scale (e.g., an estuary) that can efficiently include flocculation, we develop a new modeling framework assuming equilibrium and dilute sediment concentration. This is a critical steppingstone for the future development of a fully coupled framework.</p>\r\n<p>The project provides rigorous training experience for 2 PhD students, two undergraduate students, and an early career postdoc researcher at the University of Delaware. The project also provides valuable opportunities for international research collaboration among researchers from USA, United Kingdom, Germany, Taiwan, and China.
