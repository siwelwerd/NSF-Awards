 "awd_abstract_narration": "An extremely strong Hurricane Michael hit the Florida Panhandle in October 2018 and caused devastating destruction along the coastline.  Documenting damage by this record-breaking storm in various coastal environments, such as beaches; dunes; bays; barrier islands; and marshes, in a timely fashion, can inform the coastal community and resource managers about the dangers and frequency of energetic tropical storms. A better scientific understanding of these impacts and raising public awareness and knowledge of such storm impacts plays a crucial role in hazard preparation. This research involves collecting samples and making measurements along an area of the Florida coast subject normally to microtidal ranges. Sediment and macrofaunal samples will be collected via cores and grab sampling along two transects radiating out of Apalachicola Bay in southern Florida and ending in the sea offshore of the barrier islands. Other characterization of subaerial parts of the transects will be carried out to document morphological changes in dunes and changes in elevation of nominally subaerial and shallow subaqueous environments. To document the preservation potential of storm deposits in the stratigraphic record, transects will be sampled twice. Once as soon as possible after the storm and once six months later. Data and findings from this study, in combination with dissemination of the results of the project to the greater coastal community, will help the public and institutions that assess risk associated with coastal areas, understand the impacts of strong storms on a wide variety of coastal environments resulting in better preparation and knowledge of resiliency for this significant natural hazard.\r\n\r\nThis study takes advantage of the rare opportunity to systematically document the sedimentary record produced by Hurricane Michael along the Apalachicola Bay coast.  Surface sediment and sediment cores are collected along two transects extending from seaward of the barrier islands to the coastal marshes along the two rivers that discharge into Apalachicola Bay.  Sediment cores from the barrier islands, back-barrier, bay, and coastal marsh will be used to establish regional scale characteristics of storm deposits.  Two field sampling campaigns will be conducted, with the first one shortly after the storm impact and the second one roughly 6 months later with the goals of investigating the preservation of the storm deposits.  Storm deposits by extreme hurricanes in low-energy (i.e., microtidal) environments, e.g., coastal marsh and coastal lakes or sinkholes, have been broadly used to reconstruct paleo-hurricane records, thereby providing valuable insights to how climate and storm strength have changed with time. Furthermore, preservation of, often, very thin storm deposits in the face of processes that tend to erase these records (e.g., bioturbation and erosion) will be examined.  Because storm deposits of layers of sediment on top of existing geomorphic features constitutes a major mechanism for coastal marshes to gain elevation, strong storms, like Hurricane Michael, likely play an important role in combating the drowning of marshes and other coastal environments due to sea-level rise.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOn October 10th 2018, Category 5 Hurricane Michael made landfall at Mexico Beach, generating a nearly 5-m storm surge.  The greater landfall area to the right of the hurricane center is characteristic of a cuspate headland protruding into the Gulf of Mexico for up to 50 km.  The headland is composed of several barrier islands with different orientations fronting a large estuary (Apalachicola Bay).  A roughly 2.5 m storm surge was measured along the headland coast and in the estuary.  The hurricane impacted areas include densely developed small beach front communities, modestly to sparsely developed shoreline communities, mostly pristine State Parks and completely pristine National Wildlife Refuge.  Therefore, Hurricane Michael provided an excellent opportunity to study the impact of an extreme storm over a variety of coastal environments with different degrees of human developments.\n\nDue to the shoreline-orientation and bathymetry changes induced by the headland, the wave field associated with the hurricane is complicated with the highest wave occurring not at the landfall site where the surge and wind speed were the greatest.  Numerical wave modeling revealed two wave focusing points on the headland where barrier-island breach occurred.  Beach-dune erosion and impact to infrastructures were examined and compared among various natural-human coastal systems.\n\nShoreline position is not an accurate indicator of storm-induced beach changes due to the much gentler post-storm beach slope as compared to the steeper pre-storm slope.  The magnitude of dune erosion was controlled by nearshore wave height and pre-storm beach width, while the pre-storm dune height did not appear to be a determining factor.  The barrier-island chain was breached at three locations, all coincide with wave focusing areas.  Wave height and pre-storm barrier island width appear to be the controlling factors, while pre-storm dune height was not.  The high dunes at St. Joseph Island and St. George Island did not stop or constrain the breaching.\n\nSedimentological characteristics of storm deposits along the barrier islands, within Apalachicola Bay and the surrounding coastal marsh were examined with 116 sediment cores and 40 crab sediment samples.  Characteristics of storm deposits and their preservation are described for various sub-environments including, beaches, dunes, interior wetlands, back-barrier bay, and coastal marsh along the landward side of the estuary.\n\nStorm deposits can be identified based on planar bedding and a sharp basal contact.  Storm deposits over eroded beach can be difficult to identify due to similar sedimentary characteristics.  Storm layer over eroded dunes and marshes are easily identifiable.  Storm overwash into a barrier-island interior marsh extended over 100 m, while the landward extension into a protruding mainland marsh fronted by bayside beach was less than 30 m.  Storm deposits cannot be identified in the main part of the estuary and in the extensive marsh at the two river mouths.  Barrier-island interior marsh appears to be the most productive environment for paleo-storm study.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/03/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ping Wang"
