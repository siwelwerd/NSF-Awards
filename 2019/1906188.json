 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2019, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. Characterizing biodiversity (the diversity of life on the planet) is a central goal of evolutionary biology. This research aims to understand how changes in an organism's genome create new species. The Fellow will use data from natural history collections combined with genome data to understand how swallows may have formed new species. To increase broader participation in science, the Fellow will also mentor students from underrepresented groups at the host-lab institution, and organize outreach and entertainment events with local businesses to promote engagement between scientists and the broader community.\r\n\r\nThe accumulation of genomic resources has allowed for recent advances in our understanding of the genomic basis of reproductive isolation and has led to the hypothesis that non-random associations between loci that confer barriers to gene flow may be powerful drivers of speciation. However, further empirical demonstration of this 'coupling' of barrier loci is required to confirm its importance in speciation. This research will address this need through integrative analysis of phenotypic data collected from natural history specimens and newly-generated genomic data from representatives across the swallow genus Hirundo. Because Hirundo includes lineages at various stages of the speciation continuum and considerable phenotypic variation in mate choice traits, it is an ideal system to test for empirical evidence that the coupling of barrier loci underlying selected traits drives speciation. Further, this research will thoroughly examine the genomic architecture of speciation by quantifying genetic diversity, the recombination landscape, and genomic composition and structure in regions underlying mate-choice traits. Ultimately, this study will integrate analyses of phenotypic data and comparative population genomics to test the importance of coupling between divergent traits in the process of speciation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Indeed, traits linked to sexual signaling are often found to be distinct between closely related lineages, yet investigations of their role in speciation are often circumstantial. The goal of this project was to combine genomic data with information about sexually selected plumage traits to test predictions about the role of these traits in speciation, using barn swallows (<em>Hirundo rustica</em>) as a model system. To investigate how traits under sexual selection may promote reproductive isolation, this project also sought to reveal the genetic basis of these traits, providing a foundation for population genetic investigation of signatures of divergent sexual selection between populations and barriers to gene flow in naturally occurring hybrid zones. Further, this study presents an opportunity to test major predictions of the genetic coupling theory of speciation, where regions of the genome underlying traits under divergent selection become non-randomly associated due to selection for specific combinations of alleles and present an overall stronger barrier to gene flow.</p>\n<p class=\"MSBody\">To date, this project has supported the generation of whole genome data for a combined dataset of 336 barn swallows sampled from across the globe, along with matched phenotypic data for sexually selected plumage traits (ventral coloration and tail streamer length). Two peer-reviewed research papers have been published on this work and additional papers are forthcoming. The first of these papers involved the characterization of the genomic landscape of genetic diversity in global barn swallow populations and comparisons between autosomal and sex-linked (i.e., Z chromosome) genomic regions. These comparisons tested multiple predictions borne out of theoretical and empirical studies, including a marked reduction in sex-linked genetic diversity and high levels of divergence between populations due to sexual selection and reproductive skew. The results were consistent with extremely low sex-linked genetic diversity in barn swallows, aligning with the mating system of the species, which involves extra-pair matings that often exclude certain males in the population. These findings also support that the Z chromosome plays a prominent role in early divergence between barn swallow populations.</p>\n<p class=\"MSBody\">The second paper investigates a migratory divide between two barn swallow subspecies that form a hybrid zone in China. Populations on either side of the hybrid zone take dramatically divergent migratory routes to non-breeding locations, and the aim of this study was to investigate how this phenomenon may contribute to forms of pre- and postzygotic reproductive isolation. The findings of this study support that populations mate assortatively on the basis of their timing of arrival to the breeding grounds and that there may be selection against hybrids with intermediate migratory routes. Further, mate choice plumage traits correspond with genomic ancestry and divergent migratory routes, suggesting that these traits provide a basis for assortative mating.</p>\n<p class=\"MSBody\">In a forthcoming study that addresses the main goals of this project, analyses combining whole genome data with phenotypic variation have revealed the genetic architecture of barn swallow mate choice traits. The genomic regions associated with the traits show strong signatures of divergent selection between allopatric populations and barriers to gene flow in hybrid zones. The remaining regions of the genome do not show prominent signatures of divergent selection, highlighting the importance of mate choice traits in early divergence and reproductive isolation. This study further tests core predictions of genetic coupling theory ? namely that genomic regions underlying mate choice are strongly coupled in hybrid populations, specifically, where different combinations of alleles are tested by selection. Indeed, trait-associated genomic regions exhibit signatures of coupling, and the degree of apparent coupling scales with the overall degree of reproductive isolation in three hybrid zones between different combinations of parental populations. The findings of this study shed light on the role of sexual selection in speciation, indicating that prezygotic reproductive isolation at the early stages of speciation can be facilitated by genetic coupling of genomic regions associated with mate choice traits.</p>\n<p class=\"MSBody\">In addition to peer-reviewed publications that address the core goals of the project, this award has supported the PI in presenting this work at multiple international conferences and invited departmental seminars, in networking with colleagues and forming collaborative interactions that will extend beyond the lifespan of this grant, and in preparing for and securing a tenure-track faculty position at a US-based R1 institution. Further, the support from this grant has enabled the PI to contribute to an additional 11 peer-reviewed studies complementary to the goals of this project, ranging from investigations of the genomics of speciation to a new methodology for quantifying and enhancing individual sense of belonging in STEM research groups.
