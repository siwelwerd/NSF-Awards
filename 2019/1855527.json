 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will apply modern methods in probability theory to a range of problems arising in combinatorics, theoretical computer science, mathematical physics, statistics and other fields. A central focus will be understanding the problem of simultaneously satisfying many constraints each chosen randomly. We will determine when there are solutions, how many solutions and when it is possible to efficiently find them. A second direction involves models of shortest paths with random costs where we will study the geometry and chaotic nature of these paths. Finally we will consider a range of questions involving the statistical inference of combinatorial objects such as networks, trees and partitions which will be applicable to problems such as finding communities in networks and uncovering the genetic relationships between different species.\r\n\r\nThroughout this project we will work to make mathematically rigorous ideas and heuristics originating in statistical physics. In the case of random constraint satisfaction problems, we will establish a range of one-step replica symmetry breaking predictions for models such as colorings, satisfiability and large independent sets in random networks. In first and last passage percolation we will combine more classical methods of percolation with results from exactly solvable models to answer questions about the slow bond model, coalescence of geodesics and rotationally invariant first passage percolation. Many problems in statistical inference involve recovering combinatorial structures. For models of group synchronization and phylogenetic reconstruction we will give rigorous bounds on the sampling complexity and computational efficiency.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In these models a collection of variables is required to satisfy a series of constraints, chosen at random from some distributions. A series of striking predictions from statistical physics beginning with ideas from Mezard and Parisi and later extended by Krz&#807;aka&#322;a, Montanari, Ricci-Tersenghi, Semerjian, and Zdeborova&#769; have given precise estimates of the satisfiability thresholds in these models.

We have studyied several different models that represent the transmission of infection or information over networks. The contact process is a model where infected vertices on a network infect their neighbours at one rate and heal at another. The contact process has long been well understood on lattice models. With my student Danny Nam, former postoc Oanh Ngyuen and collaborator Shankar Bhameidi we investigated the contact process on random graphs. Answering an open problem of Durrett, we showed that for low infection rates, the process dies out almost surely on branching process trees with exponential degree distributions but survives with positive probability when the degree distribution has tails heavier than exponential.\n\nWith Dauvernge we studied a different model of infections, the SIR model, on a collection of moving particles in the plane.  Kesten and Sidoravicius were able to study the model without recoveries where the location of the particles is in equilibrium.  We developed a flexible new method for analyzing such processes to show that at low recovery rates, infections can continue indefinitely.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nOver the course of this grant 6 PhD students, 3 postdocs and 6 senior thesis students have been trained, working on topics related to the grant.  The PI gave a 12 hour mini-course on random constraint satisfaction problems along with an accompanying set of lecture notes.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/14/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Allan Sly"
