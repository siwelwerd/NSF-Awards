 "awd_abstract_narration": "This cooperative agreement with MetroLab Network aims to build capacity for the Civic Innovation Challenge (CIC), a research and action competition in the Smart & Connected Communities (S&CC) domain, as well as the broader S&CC research ecosystem. Building off of NSF's S&CC program, the CIC aims to flip the community-university dynamic, asking communities to identify civic priorities ripe for innovation and to partner with researchers to address those priorities. The CIC will help bridge the gap between research and deployment, ensuring that research is conducted in a context that allows for realistic testing and evaluation of impact. Features include engagement of other S&CC-focused funders as partners; shortening the typical timeline of civic research projects; and fostering cohorts organized around specific problem statements to encourage sharing of information across teams. MetroLab will work with Smart Cities Lab to support the CIC through outreach, capacity building, support and programming for finalists and winners, and joint-funder engagement.  \r\n\r\nThe CIC is an opportunity to transform civic research.  It will enable data-driven, research-informed communities, engage residents in the process, and build a more cohesive research-to-innovation pipeline by finding synergies between funders of use-inspired research and funders of civic innovation.  It will lay a foundation for a broader and more fluid exchange of research interests and civic priorities that will create new instances of collaboration and introduce new areas of technical and social scientific discovery. The CIC is designed to support transformative projects while fostering a collaborative spirit.  \r\n\r\nThe specific activities supporting the CIC include \"boot camps\" for teams of communities and universities to strengthen their partnerships and projects. It will also involve the cultivation of \"communities-of-practice\" oriented around specific domains, to facilitate knowledge-sharing and cross-site collaboration. The long-term impacts of this work will include deeper collaborations across sectors and regions; improved information sharing and best practices development; and greater impact from research outcomes in cities and communities around the United States.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This work generated a significant number of proposals by the submission deadline in August 2020. During this first grant year, MetroLab amplified the CIVIC program by developing promotional content including a video that reached more than 2,500 viewers and the facilitation of a guest column from NSF&rsquo;s program officers published on the National League of Cities &ldquo;CitiesSpeak&rdquo; platform. Additional efforts from MetroLab included a webinar series, four live Q&amp;A sessions that engaged federal partners and 600 participants, and the development of the &ldquo;communities of practice&rdquo; activities that took place during Stage 1 and Stage 2 of CIVIC.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>To further these efforts during the four-month community-of-practice period (Stage 1), MetroLab connected with over 500 members of CIVIC teams through events and toolkit deployment. We engaged 45 experts from the civic-research ecosystem in our Expert Network, who provided valuable insight to the Stage 1 Awardee teams. MetroLab&rsquo;s events and resources helped teams build deep relationships across disciplines, while also providing tools that teams could use to further root their efforts in prioritizing community impact.
