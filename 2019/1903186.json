 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide participant support to the conference \"Ideals, Varieties, and Applications\" (https://iva2019.wordpress.amherst.edu/) to be held June 10-14 in Amherst, MA.  The organizers will bring together graduate students and researchers at all levels to survey the state of the art in computational and combinatorial algebraic geometry. The conference will aim to provide mentorship and support for graduate students and early-career researchers and will stress the idea that mathematicians from a diverse range of institutions can make significant and lasting contributions to mathematics and its connections to other disciplines.  Many of the conference topics are motivated by applications outside of mathematics; further breakthroughs will result in fruitful interplay between disciplines, and a more prominent role for computational algebraic geometry in science and engineering, building on the role it is already establishing in fields such as computer vision, modeling, and computational biology. \r\n\r\nModern computational algebraic geometry began with the invention of Groebner bases in 1965, which form the backbone of many practical algorithms developed since then.  A special emphasis will be placed on illustrating how computation of Groebner bases drives both theory and applications. In particular, speakers will cover advances in algorithms, toric varieties, Cox rings, syzygies, tropical algebraic geometry, geometric modeling, and applications to computer-aided-design (CAD).  The organizers will emphasize  recent open problems ripe for work by early-career scholars with solid algebra training.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
