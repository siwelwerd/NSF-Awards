 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is to demonstrate feasibility and determine the capacity of an innovative advanced, high-rate wet weather treatment technology to cost-effectively protect environmental and public health during high-intensity rain events by eliminating sewer overflows and basement back-ups. The wastewater utility industry has demonstrated a great unmet need for reliable, cost-effective, end-of-pipe wet weather treatment as an alternative to expensive long-term plans that emphasize large capital projects. The innovative approach being scaled and optimized during this project seeks to achieve the same or higher level of treatment in 35 minutes as conventional wastewater treatment achieves in 10-14 hours. A lower treatment time means a smaller system footprint and, ultimately, cost savings for the utility and ratepayers. The technology will address customer needs by identifying potential sewer overflow \"hotspots\" that act as \"drains\" in the utility sewershed during storm events. Each drain solution would alleviate overburdened collection, conveyance, and treatment systems by treating wet weather flows and safely releasing them into waterways. This innovative technology can also be applied at a water reclamation facility to handle overburden or as a mobile unit during disaster relief efforts.  \r\n\r\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes the evaluation of novel concepts including the application of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for wet weather treatment, the combination of rapid solid removal technologies with AOPs, and the use of a sustainable waste material as a catalyst for enhanced hydroxyl radical production in catalytic ozonation. None of the above aspects have been commercially implemented. The work proposed will demonstrate the ability for advanced technologies to be cost-effectively applied for wet weather treatment, disrupting the standard of partial combined sewer overflow treatment by providing a viable option for rapid wet weather treatment that meets or exceeds Clean Water Act discharge standards. These concepts will be applied at a pilot scale treating real wastewater to determine the technical and chemical scaling factors for commercial feasibility. Metrics for success within the research plan include aggressive conventional contaminant removal goals, increased flowrate for overall decreased treatment time and footprint, and a targeted cost ($/gallon treated) analysis to ensure competitive edge in the market. It is expected that the results will further demonstrate the importance of solids removal ahead of AOPs, and the implementation of catalytic ozonation will demonstrate increased efficacy and flexibility as the technology scales.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
