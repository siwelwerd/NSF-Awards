 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer simulations based on partial differential equations (PDEs) are ubiquitous in science and engineering, underpinning weather forecasts, car and airplane design processes, and tsunami predictions, among other use cases. They are based on mathematical derivatives and thus only consider \"local\" descriptions of physical principles and interactions. Local models fail to capture certain natural processes (like anomalous diffusion), so computational scientists are increasingly considering \"nonlocal\" models. These include integral equation formulations and models involving more general interactions such as fractional derivatives. While effective numerical methods for nonlocal methods are known and the subject of ongoing active research, software support is far less mature than for local operators. Support for coupling these two approaches, while very important, is basically nonexistent. In this project, the researchers are combining expertise in numerical methods and software tools for both local and nonlocal operators to extend the Firedrake project (https://www.firedrakeproject.org), a high-level PDE tool set, to serve this important need. This extension spans all aspects of the corresponding software, ranging from the computer language used for problem description to algorithms and efficient implementation. These tools will provide an enabling technology for scientists and engineers to reliably and efficiently address a much broader range of models than currently available. All software being developed under this project will be freely distributed under open-source licenses, and knowledge gained will be disseminated through conference presentations, publications, and teaching. \r\n\r\nThis work will leverage and build upon the researchers' work on developing a suite of representations at each layer of abstraction (operators, algorithms, loop nests, etc.) and tools to transform these abstractions downward towards machine code. The investigators will map out and extend the landscape of finite element algorithms to include new nonlocal algorithm; provide a unifying framework for reasoning about these algorithms, design language and compiler foundations that allow the complete specification of matrix assembly and operator application tasks; and deploy automated non-local operators in a toolkit that already includes classical finite element methods and is capable of architecture-specific targeting.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Both volume and layer sources are of practical relevance but require drastically different computational approaches. Examples of nonlocal operators include the volume and layer potentials of classical physics as well as fractional derivatives, among others.\nThese operators usefully complement the 'local' differential operators typically used in scientific and engineering simulation. This project aims at making both 'nonlocal' and 'local' primitives available within the Firedrake project by extending the description language for the variational forms used in finite element simulation with nonlocal operators.\nTo make this happen, we have utilized Firedrake's new capacity for externally-defined operators. This amounts to a 'foreign function interface' that allows us to define new objects in the Unified Form Language. On one hand, we must specify how they compose symbolically with the overall system. On the other hand, we also specify how these new objects are evaluated, in our case through optimized external libraries for fast multipole methods.\nTo illustrate the combination of local and nonlocal operations in a given problem, we have considered a new suite of boundary conditions for scattering problems. Posing these problems on a computational (hence finite) domain can create significant errors unless special care is taken at the artificially-imposed boundary. We have demonstrated that special nonlocal boundary conditions based on layer potentials avoid this error and can lead to theoretically sound and effective simulations.\nThe intellectual merits of this project consist in i) mapping out and extending the landscape of finite element algorithms to include new nonlocal algorithms, ii) providing a unifying framework for reasoning about these algorithms iii) deployment of nonlocal operators in an effective high-level toolkit.\nMoreover, the project has produced concrete broader impacts. In addition to the dissemination of results through conference presentations and journal publications, open source software has been distributed for use by the broader scientific community. Additionally, we have supervised graduate student research and postdoctoral scholars through this project.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/29/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RobertKirby\n"
