 "awd_abstract_narration": "Trout fishing contributes billions of dollars annually to local and regional economies. In many cases, native trout are privileged even as wildlife managers release non-native fish into freshwater ecosystems. Questions about the value of native vs. non-native trout and where these belong are increasingly addressed at the molecular scale using environmental DNA. This project examines the intersection of science, values, and actions in native trout management in Colorado and Montana. It addresses three key questions: 1) How are conceptions of nativity constructed as related to trout management and policy? 2) How are scientific advances in genetics reshaping key assumptions about trout distribution, ecology, and ideas of nativity? 3) How are new forms of scientific knowledge impacting fisheries management practices, policies, funding priorities, and spatial claims to nature? The project advances understanding about how we value species and genetic purity, how these can change over time, and how scientific information is adopted as 'common sense' by institutions. It also addresses the broader impacts of these changes, considering how scientific and technological developments contribute to changing concentrations of power and expertise, geographies of \"healthy\" and \"impaired\" ecosystems, and shifting patterns of natural resource management. \r\n\r\nThis research project combines multiple social science methods to examine how new genetic methods for identifying native vs. invasive trout species matter for trout management and policy. These methods include semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders, angler creel surveys, content analyses of documents (including environmental assessments, management plans, technical reports, media accounts, and archives), and site visits to hatcheries and centers of fisheries science. In combination, these convergent indicators enable systematic examination of shifting understanding of what constitutes a native vs. non-native species, and of the financial, ecological, and natural resource management implications of this shift in perspective. Such understanding has significant practical implications for understanding and managing trout as wildlife officials, fishing guides, and anglers make decisions about what kinds of fisheries they promote or pursue. The project also has broader impacts on teaching and learning by supporting and the training of undergraduate and graduate students at an institution that serves significant populations of minority, first-generation, and Pell Grant-eligible students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\r\n\r\n\n\nThis project investigated how scientific and technological advancements, values, and policies interact to shape the management of native trout in Colorado and Montana. The research involved multiple social science methods: semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders; creel surveys of anglers; analyses of documents including environmental assessments, management plans, technical reports, media accounts, and archives; and site visits to hatcheries and centers of fisheries science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nMost broadly, this research found that advances in genetic and genomic science are profoundly reshaping trout conservation by emphasizing genetics (and particularly genetic purity) in management decisions. It documented how, for example, in the case of greenback cutthroat trout, DNA analysis indicated that decades of conservation efforts were based on misidentified populations. The advent of better, cheaper, and faster molecular techniques has not only altered how trout are identified and classified but has also led to the preservation or eradication of entire populations based on their genetics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nThe findings from this project demonstrate that a reliance on genetics to guide or dictate management decisions often prioritizes genetic purity over broader ecological, ethical, or cultural considerations. While genetic and genomic data can offer valuable insights that contribute to conservation outcomes, they are potentially problematic as definitions of purity are subject to change as genetic techniques evolve. In addition, emphasizing genetic purity in trout conservation can lead to unintended effects on ecosystems, for example by creating fragmented watersheds and undervaluing hybridized populations. These findings demonstrated that trout conservation and management would benefit from adopting broader, more holistic frameworks rather than fixating exclusively or primarily on genetic purity and hybridization threats. By illustrating holistic frameworks or concepts to guide conservation, this research integrated knowledge from multiple fields to catalyze broader, more inclusive conversations about trout management and aquatic restoration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nIn addition, this project investigated how ideas of wildness and nativity, and opinions about fish stocking, are constructed and how they relate to trout management and policy. The findings revealed that, in the state of Colorado, anglers considered catching a wild trout and a native trout both to be important, while catching a genetically pure fish was only marginally important. Additionally, the majority of anglers and fishing outfitters surveyed supported fish stocking in Colorado (though with caveats), but there was mixed understanding by anglers about which fish are native to Colorado and which have been introduced. Members of fly fishing organizations demonstrated more knowledge about fish provenance, while creel surveys of anglers on-site revealed relatively low knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nResults from this study were presented at professional conferences, including at the Wild Trout Symposium, the Annual Meeting of the Association of American Geographers, the World Biodiversity Forum, the International Congress for Conservation Biology, and the Society for Social Studies of Science conference. Public lectures about this research were given at the University of Michigan, Colorado State University, Regis University, University of Colorado Denver, and Dixie State University. In addition, this work was discussed on the public radio show The Academic Minute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nSix undergraduate students were trained in collecting and analyzing creel survey data, and two students completed undergraduate theses or research projects related to native trout management. One graduate student was trained in qualitative methods, including interview data analysis and document analysis. One undergraduate student presented this research at the Annual Meeting of the American Association of Geographers and the University of Colorado Colorado Springs Mountain Lion Research Day. In addition, the findings from this research were used to develop a new course, Techno-Natures, and new teaching modules used in multiple undergraduate geography and environmental studies courses at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DavidGHavlick\n"
