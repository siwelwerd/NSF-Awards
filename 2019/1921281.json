 "awd_abstract_narration": "Criminologists and police departments alike have long sought to understand and address the stark variation in crime across a given city. In recent years, this has given rise to an emerging law enforcement strategy that concentrates on \"problem properties\" that generate dramatically more crime and disorder than other properties on their street or in their neighborhood. Such efforts, however, have gone ahead of the science--at this time there is little foundational knowledge to guide their design and few evaluations of their effectiveness. This project will advance the science of problem properties and translate it into effective interventions by pursuing three questions. First, what are the microspatial dynamics of crime and disorder at addresses? Second, what are the implications of a law enforcement strategy that implicitly targets landowners and tenants for property management and use? Third, how do the answers to the first two questions interact with street and neighborhood factors?\r\n\r\nThe project will leverage an existing partnership between the Boston Area Research Initiative (BARI), an NSF Research Coordination Network, and the City of Boston's Problem Properties Task Force (PPTF). It will comprise three components. (1) The analysis of archival data provided by BARI's Boston Data Portal, including 911 and 311 reports of crime and disorder, ownership information, and other administrative records and social media posts, will offer insights into the different types of problem properties, as well as factors that predict their emergence and persistence. (2) Observation at and nearby problem properties and matched non-problem properties and surveys of landowners and tenants will provide a richer view of local conditions, patterns of property management, and interactions with the neighborhood. (3) BARI and the PPTF will design and conduct an experimental evaluation of problem property interventions through a randomized control trial. The evaluation will be interpreted via the data products, analytic techniques, and theoretical insights generated in Parts 1 and 2 of the project with a focus on questions of crime displacement and impacts on the behavior of property owners.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

There has been increasing evidence, however, that crime and disorder (i.e., sub-criminal issues like dilapidation and disturbances) concentrate at specific places within communities. In other words, even in high-crime communities, most places generate no crime or disorder, and a small handful are responsible for the vast majority of issues. These insights have inspired new policing approaches that focus on &ldquo;hotspot&rdquo; street segments and, more recently, &ldquo;problem properties,&rdquo; though the latter have been pursued with very little scientific evidence. The Boston Area Research Initiative at Northeastern University and the City of Boston&rsquo;s Problem Properties Task Force (PPTF) partnered to bridge this gap by advancing the science of problem properties, with the express goal of refining the practice of intervening at such places.</p>\n<p>The project advanced our understanding of three issues fundamental to the science and practice of problem properties. First, there are numerous models for understanding patterns of crime and disorder across neighborhoods and streets, but the field lacked a similar understanding for properties. Most notably, there was no data-driven approach to defining or classifying problem properties. We uncovered a typology of problem properties that revealed that nearly all troubled places generate a single type of issue&mdash;be it violence, social disturbances, dilapidation, or otherwise. This stood in stark contrast to assumptions that problematic places are microcosms of high-crime neighborhoods, acting as hubs for all types of issues. In fact, such hubs accounted for an extremely limited proportion of places (&lt;0.1%). Additionally, we found that troubled properties evolved independently of their neighborhoods. Whereas most properties maintained the same type or types of issues from one year to the next, some experienced &ldquo;aggravation&rdquo; to more serious issues. Whereas most theories of aggravation concentrate on neighborhood-level change, such as broken windows theory, we found these processes were far more prevalent at properties. Altogether these findings help us to understand which places need attention now or in the near future and the types of support that might be most helpful.</p>\n<p>A second major question was if and how problem properties interventions are effective. By considering crime and disorder in terms of both a place <em>and</em> its owner, such interventions directly target property management and use. Our evaluation found that the PPTF&rsquo;s interventions were successful in lowering crime and disorder not only at the target property (see Figure 1) but also at other properties along the street, demonstrating a diffusion of benefits from such programs. We also found that, following an investigation, property owners were more likely to improve the property through construction projects and even to sell the property (presumably to a potentially more capable owner), validating the PPTF&rsquo;s focus on place management. Further, it raises up problem properties interventions as an efficient and effective way of addressing public safety without overpolicing high-crime communities.</p>\n<p>Third, properties do not exist in isolation, and there is a need to understand how they interact with their broader community. Our research regularly found that the primary &ldquo;action&rdquo; driving crime and disorder occurred at properties while neighborhoods and streets provide the &ldquo;setting&rdquo; against which this action unfolds. For instance, violence persists throughout high-crime neighborhoods but does so through properties that have previously experienced crime or disorder (see Figure 2). As such, vulnerable places are most likely to generate violence, but more so if they are exposed to the neighborhood dynamics that might instigate such events.</p>\n<p>The interplay between properties and their communities revealed by the work holds value beyond the design of problem property interventions. It is a framework that is generally relevant to how we think about public safety in our communities. Further, it might be applied to any other phenomenon that plays out in communities, from public health to academic achievement to gentrification and more. PI Daniel T. O&rsquo;Brien has integrated the discoveries from the project into a single narrative in his forthcoming book <em>The Pointillistic City</em> (MIT Press; anticipated publication December 2024). The book extends the framework developed through this project to questions of environmental justice, demonstrating that a similar emphasis on the interplay between localized places and their communities can reveal <em>microspatial inequities</em> in our daily lives and inform a new generation of policies, programs, and services that can support each community according to its local geography.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/29/2023<br>\nModified by: Daniel&nbsp;O'brien</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1921281/1921281_10611798_1701290016455_Figure_5.1c--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1921281/1921281_10611798_1701290016455_Figure_5.1c--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1921281/1921281_10611798_1701290016455_Figure_5.1c--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Properties with predatory crimes in previous years (triangles) were more likely to experience violence in the following year, but this effect was exacerbated on streets that already had high levels of violence.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Daniel O'Brien</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Daniel&nbsp;O'brien\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1921281/1921281_10611798_1701289736147_Figure_9.2a_for_NSF--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1921281/1921281_10611798_1701289736147_Figure_9.2a_for_NSF--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1921281/1921281_10611798_1701289736147_Figure_9.2a_for_NSF--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Problem properties investigations led to strong, persistent drops in violent crime at properties.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Zoorob & O'Brien (2024)</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Daniel&nbsp;O'brien\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
