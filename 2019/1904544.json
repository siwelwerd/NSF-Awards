 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major obstacle on the horizon for sustainable solar technologies is life-cycle management of solar modules. As module deployment expands rapidly, so will module wastes. The International Renewable Energy Agency estimates that end-of-life modules will total 78 million metric tons by 2050. With a successful project, the proposed recycling technology will become technically scalable, financially profitable, and environmentally sustainable for terawatt-scale deployment of silicon modules. The project lays down the technical foundation for a new recycling industry projected to be worth billions of dollars by 2050. \r\n\r\nThe investigators have already  demonstrated a two-step recycling process to extract all the valuable, bulky, and toxic materials from silicon modules including solar-grade silicon, silver, aluminum, glass, lead, copper, and tin. In this project, the researchers will: 1) develop a more simplified recycling process than the one already demonstrated; 2) improve the silver recovery rate to over 95%; 3) identify a low-cost anode for metal recovery by electrowinning; 4) verify that the recovered silicon meets the specifications of solar-grade silicon; 5) modify the recycling process for new commercial silicon solar cells; 6) explore a solar module backsheet reclamation process, and 7) dissolve the ethylene vinyl acetate layer in sodium hydroxide. What differentiates the proposed recycling technology is that it maximizes the revenue from recycling by recovering all the valuable, bulky, and toxic materials in silicon modules. These materials are raw materials to the solar industry worth $12.43/module today. The current recycling process recovers only the bulky materials worth $3.42/module, which is far below the actual cost of recycling. The proposed technology is targeted to enable profitable recycling.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our technology extracts all the valuable, bulky, and toxic materials from silicon modules for reuse including solar-grade silicon, silver, aluminum, glass, lead, copper, and tin. In this project, we have demonstrated new chemistries to recover all the metals as pure metals (99.9% pure): silver, lead, copper, and tin. The silver recovery rate is over 99% and the lead recovery rate is over 90% now with the goal of 99% in one year. These are the most important metals to recover: silver generates a significant revenue and lead is a liability for recyclers. We have also demonstrated that the purity of the recovered silicon meets the specifications for solar-grade silicon. It has the potential to be reused in new modules if the logistic issues can be resolved. In addition, we have developed a circular chemistry for our recycling process, i.e., half of the chemicals in our process are regenerated later in the process. They can be reused many times in our process, reducing the chemical waste by 60% over competing technologies. Financially our technology enables a revenue of more than $10/module. This is more than 3 times the revenue by today&rsquo;s technologies, which recover only the bulky materials for about $3/module: aluminum and copper. This project lays down the technical foundation for a new solar recycling infrastructure which is required for a circular economy in the solar industry, making solar technologies truly green. It is also recognized that waste solar modules are a global challenge. This project enabled us to build an international team of experts from 6 countries. We developed a consensus about the challenges and opportunities in solar recycling and now we are working collaboratively on technology development.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/27/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Meng&nbsp;Tao</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1904544/1904544_10598363_1658944866562_Wastepanel1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1904544/1904544_10598363_1658944866562_Wastepanel1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"End-of-life solar panels\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1904544/1904544_10598363_1658944866562_Wastepanel1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"End-of-life solar panels\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">End-of-life silicon solar panels with all the dust and a broken glass cover</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">We Recycle Solar Inc</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Meng&nbsp;Tao</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">End-of-life solar panels</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
