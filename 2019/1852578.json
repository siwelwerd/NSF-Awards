 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Biomimetic and Soft Robotics (BioSoRo) REU Site at the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) will engage a diverse cohort of undergraduate students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2019-2021. Hosted by the departments of Mechanical Engineering, Electrical & Biomedical Engineering, and Biology at UNR, this program focuses on multidisciplinary collaborative projects related to BioSoRo research that span the fields of biomimetics, additive manufacturing, smart materials, solid mechanics, and robotics and control. Participants work closely with graduate student and faculty mentors on their respective research projects, gain the knowledge and tools for progression in STEM, build a community of professionals with peers, graduate students, and faculty, and grow in their perspective on the role of STEM in society. In addition to ten weeks of intensive research, students take part in educational, social, and professional development activities that support their sustained growth as engineers and scientists, including workshops on career development, scholarship community colloquiums, and tours to Tesla Gigafactory and Amazon Warehouse where industrial robots are massively adopted. \r\n\r\nResearch projects at this BioSoRo REU site entail crawling legless animals and soft crawling robots inspired by them, electroactive polymers and their applications in soft robots, supercoiled polymer actuators for soft robots, and smart materials enabled compliant biomedical devices, among others. These projects will offer an advanced and interdisciplinary platform for enhancing undergraduate research experience in the cutting-edge BioSoRo research area, which perfectly leverages fundamental science with state-of-the-art engineering. This REU Site will capitalize on the broad appeal of BioSoRo research to increase the diversity and broaden the horizons of students engaged in robotics research. Students with experience in BioSoRo are in great demand and this REU site will help train and diversify the next generation of roboticists in the 21st century.\r\n\r\nThis site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

First, we aim to train students in the development and evaluation of biomimetic and soft robots, utilizing innovative actuators and control mechanisms that enable navigation through natural environments with flexibility and a high degree of freedom. Second, we seek to leverage the broad appeal of BioSoRo research to enhance diversity and broaden the perspectives of students in robotics.

The interdisciplinary nature of this field allows students to gain knowledge across multiple domains, including solid mechanics, materials engineering, electrical engineering, biomedical engineering, biology, and neuroscience.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts and Significant Outcomes:</strong> To date, the REU site has trained 50 students from 15 universities nationwide, including 17 female and 33 male students, with 44% being underrepresented minorities and/or female. These students have presented their research at the UNR Undergraduate Research Symposium, Innovation Day, and various national and international conferences. Approximately 42% of participating REU students have applied or were applying to graduate schools. The project has resulted in 11 publications, including 6 journal articles and 5 conference papers; 1 patent application; over 20 research reports, abstracts, and slides; around 30 research posters; and numerous hands-on hardware and software prototypes in labs. Evaluations indicate that over 87.5% of REU students were highly satisfied with the program. The insights and outcomes from this site will inform and enhance the implementation of future REU activities, both within our program and in others.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 08/25/2024<br>\nModified by: Yantao&nbsp;Shen</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1852578/1852578_10595826_1724632555987_NSF_BioSoRo_REU_Sites_Working_in_Labs--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1852578/1852578_10595826_1724632555987_NSF_BioSoRo_REU_Sites_Working_in_Labs--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"NSF BioSoRo REU Sites_Working in Labs\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1852578/1852578_10595826_1724632555987_NSF_BioSoRo_REU_Sites_Working_in_Labs--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"NSF BioSoRo REU Sites_Working in Labs\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">NSF BioSoRo REU Sites_Working in Labs</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">NSF BioSoRo REU Site</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Yantao&nbsp;Shen\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">NSF BioSoRo REU Sites_Working in Labs</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1852578/1852578_10595826_1724632777443_NSF_BioSoRo_REU_Sites_Certificates_and_Honors--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1852578/1852578_10595826_1724632777443_NSF_BioSoRo_REU_Sites_Certificates_and_Honors--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"NSF BioSoRo REU Sites_Certificates and Honors\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1852578/1852578_10595826_1724632777443_NSF_BioSoRo_REU_Sites_Certificates_and_Honors--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"NSF BioSoRo REU Sites_Certificates and Honors\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">NSF BioSoRo REU Sites_Certificates and Honors</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">NSF BioSoRo REU Site</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Yantao&nbsp;Shen\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">NSF BioSoRo REU Sites_Certificates and Honors</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1852578/1852578_10595826_1724632718593_NSF_BioSoRo_REU_Sites_Poster_Presentations--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1852578/1852578_10595826_1724632718593_NSF_BioSoRo_REU_Sites_Poster_Presentations--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"NSF BioSoRo REU Sites_Poster Presentations\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1852578/1852578_10595826_1724632718593_NSF_BioSoRo_REU_Sites_Poster_Presentations--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"NSF BioSoRo REU Sites_Poster Presentations\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">NSF BioSoRo REU Sites_Poster Presentations</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">NSF BioSoRo REU Site</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Yantao&nbsp;Shen\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">NSF BioSoRo REU Sites_Poster Presentations</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1852578/1852578_10595826_1724632628931_NSF_BioSoRo_REU_Sites_Group_Photos--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1852578/1852578_10595826_1724632628931_NSF_BioSoRo_REU_Sites_Group_Photos--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"NSF BioSoRo REU Sites_Group Photos\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1852578/1852578_10595826_1724632628931_NSF_BioSoRo_REU_Sites_Group_Photos--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"NSF BioSoRo REU Sites_Group Photos\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">NSF BioSoRo REU Sites_Group Photos</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">NSF BioSoRo REU Site</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Yantao&nbsp;Shen\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">NSF BioSoRo REU Sites_Group Photos</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
