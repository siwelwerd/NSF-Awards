 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for a symposium to honor and celebrate the legacy of Dr. Vera Rubin, one of the most important astrophysicists of the 20th and 21st centuries.  The meeting will be held at the Georgetown University campus, June 24-26, 2019.\r\n\r\nDr. Vera Rubin, who passed away in December 2016, pioneered the study of galaxy rotation rates that provided definitive evidence for the existence of Dark Matter.  Dr. Rubin was also a fierce and effective advocate for women in science.  This symposium will bring together astrophysicists whose research was made possible by Dr. Rubin's discoveries, and will explore the current state of astrophysical topics associated with her discoveries.  Leaders at the cutting edge of the field will discuss her work and build connections for future projects.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there will be activities to honor Dr. Rubin's advocacy for women in science and her work to increase scientific literacy, including a keynote lecture for the general public and a workshop on current issues facing women in science that will include secondary school science teachers.  These events will inspire scientists working to improve the environment for women in Physics and Astronomy and to broaden participation.  They will equip teachers with powerful tools to motivate the next generation of girls to pursue STEM careers, and adjust their classes to make a real change for a large number of girls into the future.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
