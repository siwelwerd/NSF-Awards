In K12 education, the use of students as change partners is rare.  This project will use a Youth Participatory Action Research methodology to gather student voices around CS4All and equity. This project will leverage an existing research-practice partnership formed around student co-research, communities of practice, and network improvement communities to rectify the lack of student participatory-design shortcomings in student pathways.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
