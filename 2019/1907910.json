 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mass loss from stars in the late stages of evolution is a major avenue by which the interstellar medium gets enriched in gas, dust, and heavy elements.  This research project will investigate the nature of the material ejected by evolved stars and planetary nebulae.  Results from the study will allow astronomers to understand how the physical and chemical properties of stars in late stages of evolution influence the lifecycle of material in the interstellar medium.  This project will train graduate and undergraduate students, including ones from groups that are underrepresented in science, in advanced techniques of radio astronomy and laboratory astrophysics research. \r\n\r\nThe research team will undertake a combined program of astronomical observations, laboratory experiments, and chemical modeling to explore the nature of stellar ejecta in the gas phase and in dust grains, and its impact on the diffuse interstellar medium.  They will conduct molecular spectral line observations of circumstellar envelopes and planetary nebulae using ground-based single-aperture and interferometric radio telescopes.  To complement and guide the observations, they will measure laboratory rotational spectra of metal-bearing molecules postulated to be important in carbon-rich and oxygen-rich envelopes of evolved stars.  They will perform transmission electron microscopic imaging of carbon and silicate dust grains extracted from meteorites to investigate the relationship between metallic and non-metallic constituents of the grains, and they will perform quantum chemical calculations of dust destruction by ultraviolet radiation and shocks characteristic of planetary nebulae.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our observational studies have led to the detection of two new interstellar molecules, FeC and SiP, found in the envelope surrounding a carbon-rich&nbsp;dying star. This result is quite interesting because iron and phosphorus as elements are rare in interstellar molecules.&nbsp;FeC&nbsp;is only the second&nbsp;molecule detected in the interstellar medium&nbsp;(ISM) that contains&nbsp;iron, and SiP&nbsp;is the seventh with phosphorus.&nbsp;Iron and phosphorus are important&nbsp;elements&nbsp;for the evolution of stars and the formation of rocky planets like Earth, and knowledge of their carriers is essential. These new identifications were made possible by high resolution spectroscopy studies carried out in the Ziurys laboratory. Molecules such as SiP and FeC are highly reactive and have to be created under unusual laboratory conditions, which have been carefully developed in the Ziurys group over decades. Our observations have also explored the chemical and physical composition of very massive stars, in particular two objects, VY Canis Majoris (VY CMa) and NML Cygni (NML Cyg). Such massive stars are rare, but have unusual energetic and non-spherical mass loss, which may lead to a black hole. Our&nbsp;study of the composition of the envelope of NML Cyg has shown that this object is very similar to VY CMa with a rich chemistry and sporadic, episodic mass loss. Our imaging of VY CMa, conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), has produced&nbsp;the first complete picture of the circumstellar envelope, which is far larger and more massive than revealed by all previous observations, including those with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The comparative images are shown in the supporting figuree. Here&nbsp;&nbsp; the image in carbon monoxide emission from the ALMA observations is presented, and the image from HST, which displays starlight reflected by dust. Our studies of planetary nebulae (PNe) the final evolutionary stage for most stars, are also revealing. As PNe, stars end their energy productions and fade into white dwarf stars, emitting a large amount of ultraviolet radiation. Such an environment is harsh for molecular material, and astronomical theory had predicted that molecules should not be present under such conditions. Our observations have shown that at least 30 PNe are rather rich in molecular content &ndash; another example illustrating that interstellar chemistry is quite robust. &nbsp;As PNe fade, most of the material from the former star is ejected into the interstellar medium, which, as we are finding, is high in molecular content. Therefore the ISM is&nbsp; being popualted with molecules, not just atoms.&nbsp; Finally, our laboratory studies using transmission electron microscopy, or TEM, have found a new viable pathway to the synthesis of C<sub>60 </sub>and other fullerenes found in interstellar space. It is difficult to explain the presence of fullerenes in interstellar gas, as it is so rich in hydrogen. Our studies show that SiC grains, which are commonly produced by stars, could be a source of C<sub>60 </sub>and other carbon nanostructures. On rapid heating of SiC, graphitic layers form, which can distort to C<sub>60</sub> and even carbon nanotubes (CNTs). This result is shown in the supporting figure. The image on the left displays a TEM image of a shock-heated SiC sample grain with fullerene-sized hemispheres lining the surface (white arrows). The inset shows a typical TEM image of C<sub>60</sub> (black arrow) under laboratory conditions. On the right, a TEM image shows CNTs growing on the SiC grain surface. Theoretical calculations support these experiments. Therefore, a significant fraction of the carbon budget in interstellar gas &nbsp;may be sequestered in nanostructures.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/25/2024<br>\nModified by: Lucy&nbsp;M&nbsp;Ziurys</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1907910/1907910_10638950_1711424118806_Figure_4_FINAL--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1907910/1907910_10638950_1711424118806_Figure_4_FINAL--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Images of VYCMa: ALMA vs, HST\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1907910/1907910_10638950_1711424118806_Figure_4_FINAL--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Images of VYCMa: ALMA vs, HST\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Comparative images of the envelope of VY CMa:  emission of carbon monoxide from ALMA (left) and composite color HST image (right), displayed on the same scale.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Lucy Ziurys</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lucy&nbsp;M&nbsp;Ziurys\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Images of VYCMa: ALMA vs, HST</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1907910/1907910_10638950_1711423920024_C60_and_CNTs--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1907910/1907910_10638950_1711423920024_C60_and_CNTs--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Images of C60 and CNTs from SiC Grains\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1907910/1907910_10638950_1711423920024_C60_and_CNTs--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Images of C60 and CNTs from SiC Grains\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Transmission electron microscope images of a shock-heated SiC analog grain.
