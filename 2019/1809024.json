 "awd_abstract_narration": "NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis award supports research and education aimed to understand the influence of quantum mechanical interference effects and strong interactions between electrons on the thermoelectric effect in molecule-based materials. The thermoelectric effect reflects the coupling between heat and charge, which makes it possible to directly convert heat into electrical energy in a device which has no moving parts and no operational carbon footprint. In addition to energy harvesting applications, the thermoelectric effect is also of fundamental interest since it can be strongly influenced by molecular structure, the quantum mechanical nature of the electron, and interactions among electrons. The overarching goal of this project is to advance the understanding of how these aspects combine to influence the thermoelectric effect in molecule-based materials. \r\n\r\nThis award supports research focused on the exploration and design of novel molecule-based thermoelectric systems with applications in clean energy, spintronics, and the management of heat on the nanoscale, for example in nanoscale electronic devices. Because of the small size of a molecule, the charge, heat, and magnetic currents flowing through it are highly dependent on one another. The PI aims to advance understanding of the physics underlying the interrelationships among these currents and their macroscopic consequences, including the thermoelectric effect. On small length scales where quantum mechanics dominates, studies of thermoelectric effects on the local temperature will help to advance understanding of local thermodynamic properties in quantum mechanical systems far from the familiar balanced state of equilibrium. \r\n\r\nUndergraduate students at Illinois State University will be directly involved in all aspects of research and gain hands-on experience in modern electronic structure and transport theories as they apply to thermoelectricity, molecular materials, spintronics, and scanning probe experiments. As a result, this project will contribute to the preparation of the next generation of scientists required to maintain forward momentum in these fields and national competitiveness in materials research.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis award supports research and education aimed to advance understanding of how quantum interference effects and interactions influence the thermoelectric response of molecule-based materials. The interplay between heat, charge, and spin currents are manifest in the thermoelectric effect, where the spin-resolved thermopower is a macroscopic observable related to the coupling strength among the microscopic quantities. The PI aims to optimize molecular structure in conjunction with quantum mechanical effects to enhance and control the transport and conversion of energy. The PI will investigate nonequilibrium transport effects. The overarching goal of this project is to advance the understanding of how quantum mechanics, many-body correlations, and molecular structure influence the spin-resolved thermoelectric response in molecule-based materials. The ability to identify and harness novel aspects of heat, charge, and spin transport in materials may help to circumvent certain longstanding challenges in the energy conversion field as well as in the continued miniaturization of electronic devices. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research will focus on: (1) determining the molecular structure-function relationships of the thermoelectric response, including the use of thermoelectricity as a spectroscopic method; (2) the nature of spin-thermoelectric response and enhancement in molecule-based systems; and (3) temperature measurement at the nanoscale. This project involves the development of state-of-the-art theoretical and computational tools, including those based on non-equilibrium Green's functions, combined with electronic structure theories. With these techniques the PI aims to develop new insights into fundamental aspects of interacting nonequilibrium quantum systems and will work to develop a material design strategy rooted in quantum mechanical concepts. \r\n\r\nThis project is expected to contribute to the advance of the theory of molecular thermoelectricity and temperature measurement. The proposed research into the interplay between heat, charge, and spin in quantum-dominated molecular systems may have impact on how thermoelectric materials and thermal management devices are developed. The computational tools and theory developed in this proposal will be shared with other researchers, and will also be integrated directly into undergraduate classes. Undergraduate students will be involved in all aspects of this project, from initial theory and code development to the authoring of papers and presenting results at scientific conferences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
