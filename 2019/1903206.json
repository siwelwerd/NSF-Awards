 "awd_abstract_narration": "The international conference \"Effective Methods in Algebraic Geometry\" (MEGA) 2019 will be held at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain, during June 17-21 2019. It is a biennial international conference series focused on computational algebraic geometry.  The conference website is at https://eventos.ucm.es/12097/detail/mega-2019.html. MEGA 2019 is a registered satellite meeting of ICIAM 2019, The International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics, to be held at Valencia (Spain), during July 15?19, 2019. Moreover, directly after MEGA 2019, the workshop MEGAR (Effective Methods in Real Algebraic Geometry, June 21-22) will take place at the same venue.\r\n\r\nThe conference is focused on research, with the intent to bring the world experts on computational algebraic geometry together with students and researchers from related areas, including commutative algebra, differential algebra and algebraic differential equations, real algebraic geometry, algebraic number theory, differential geometry, group theory, Lie algebras, representation theory, differential topology and applications in these fields. Every two years, the community meets to outlay a comprehensive picture of the most recent developments in computational algebraic geometry, to foster interactions between algebraic geometry and other areas, and to provide ample mentoring opportunities for early career mathematicians interested in these topics.  Early career researchers can submit their work through the open submission process, for an opportunity for a presentation as a talk or a poster.  To disseminate the results presented in this meeting we plan to post all accepted submissions as well as slides from presentations on the conference's website. The website will also have a link to posters. Finally, and following the tradition of MEGA, we will publish conference proceedings as a special issue of the Journal of Symbolic Computation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
