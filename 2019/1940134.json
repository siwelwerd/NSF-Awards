 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to support the Workshop on Exuberance of Machine Learning in Transport Phenomena to be held on February 10-11, 2020 in Dallas, Texas. The workshop focuses on highlighting the current state-of-the-art and future directions on the application of Machine Learning on transport phenomena research. With the growth of Machine Learning in all areas of science and engineering, we have observed a rapid growth in the number of workshops, conferences, and summer schools all over the world. This workshop is unique in which it brings together national experts from all areas of transport phenomena research to exchange ideas, and to establish a better understanding on limitations and potentials of Machine Learning. \r\n\r\nThe workshop program includes invited speakers who will offer their expert views of important directions in Machine Learning, transport phenomena, and their intersection. It will also involve panel discussions on related topics, exploring novel ways to advance the field, and to identify gaps across the curriculum for effective training and education of the future generation of scientists and engineers capable of tackling important problems at the intersection of these two subjects. A Final Report will be prepared at the end of the workshop which will include a summary of the workshop and the major recommendations made by the experts in the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
