This proposal describes activities that are timely for the rapid acceleration of the commercialization of biotechnology. \r\n\r\nThe end result of the workshop should be a report summarizing the workshop proceedings along with a set of recommendations for future coordination and collaboration between investigators and public biofoundries.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
