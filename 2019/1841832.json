 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for support of student travel for the 2nd International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC) Conference on Cyber-Physical and Human Systems being held in Miami, Florida.   The conference is sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers.  The focus on integration of Human and Cyber-Physical Systems is an area of great importance and direct applicability to NSF's Cyber-Physical Systems and Smart and Connected Communities Programs.   The award will provide travel support for approximately 10 graduate students to attend, present papers, and participate in conference activities.\r\n  \r\nThis conference will provide the students with the opportunity to attend presentations of cutting-edge research results representing the state-of-the-art in cyber physical systems and their integration with humans.   The attendees are offered a diversity of interactive forums, technical sessions, targeted workshops, interesting poster sessions, and exciting demonstrations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
