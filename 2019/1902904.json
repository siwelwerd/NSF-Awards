 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators propose to take advantage of very recent developments in the field of optical microscopy and engineer a novel reflectance mode imaging instrument integrated with compressed sensing capability enabling the development of a system that can be used for super-resolved imaging of the eye and other biological targets. Scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) is a mainstay of diagnostic imaging of the retina. It is based on confocal laser scanning microscopy and has recently been combined with adaptive optics technology to provide sharper images of the retina.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project will 1) Develop the concepts and technology necessary to use optical reassignment reflectance confocal microscopy. This will lead to scanning laser ophthalmoscope (ORSLO) for super-resolved retinal reflectance imaging. 2) Enhance ORSLO by developing a novel optical architecture based on digital micro-mirror technology. This will permit the visualization of retinal photoreceptor cells and vasculature. 3) Implement reflectance image scanning microscopy (ISM) with a compressed sensing technique into an adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope (AOSLO). This will enable super-resolved adaptive optical imaging.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
