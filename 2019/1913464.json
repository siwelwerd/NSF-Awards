 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I project will develop a geometry-based mathematics application that allows students to experience the elegance and beauty of math while developing higher order numeracy and thinking skills. This project challenges the context of how students relate to mathematics in traditional rote fashions, and how many populations negatively self-identify with math. It proposes that a dynamic visual interface of design and game-based activities can transform the way math is perceived, making it more accessible, enjoyable, and impactful. This project has already shown the potential for making this impact, and teachers, parents, and students (ranging from Kindergarten to a project-centered college course) have all recognized the project's ability to engage users of all ages and catalyze this transformation. This project is aimed at proof-of-impact for early learners (Pre-K through 2nd grade) and helping students appreciate the elegance of math, especially for those with very little mathematical background. This will establish a foundation for expanded offerings for all ages and will pave clearer paths to STEAM careers through positive math identification and improved performance. This balance of engagement and transformational impact will establish a sustainable company able to compete in public and educational markets on an international scale. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis project is seeking to advance its innovative interface by developing adaptive software that can be customized to serve design, game, and explore modes essential for the project's standalone value. To ensure visibility, this project will require cross-platform development for Google, Android, and iOS devices. Design Mode will allow students to efficiently create beautiful and complex patterns and allow teachers to customize lectures that can be reinforced by game mode. Game Mode will allow students to solve puzzles that improve their spatial and numeracy skills through engaging mechanics and representations. It will focus on finding ways of assessing if students are improving their higher order thinking skills by measuring the efficiency of their paths to solving problems with multiple solutions. Explore Mode will require a simple artificial intelligence tool to help students discover interesting patterns and learn how to make new creations based on their own designs. This project will be devoted to ensuring all modes of play meet the core curriculum requirements and NCTM standards (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics) and will provide a foundation for the next wave of offerings, including an innovative 3-D interface and augmented reality functionality for middle and high school students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Tile Farm's specific focus is on developing young children's numeracy, spatial, and critical thinking skills through visual and artistic abstractions and representations.  Because these skill sets have been shown to be malleable traits that are indicative of mathematical and scientific success later in life, Tile Farm has the ability to alter young students' trajectory toward a level of greater achievement in math and science.  In addition, because Tile Farm has the ability to autonomously deliver high quality math education lessons with minimal teacher supervision, Tile Farm can have profound effects on mathematical achievement in low resource communities, which generally suffer from high student-to-teacher ratios. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/26/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Louis A Romero"
