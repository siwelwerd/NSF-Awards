 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is addressing issues - such as the environmentally-friendly manufacturing of economically-important chemicals - that are at the forefront of modern chemical synthesis, catalysis, and sustainability.  Photochemistry is the conversion of solar energy into chemical energy and is an important component of this goal. The application of photochemistry to organic synthesis has traditionally required hazardous reagents and/or high energy, ultraviolet light. In this project, Dr. Stephenson is studying the use of complexes that harvest sunlight to power chemical reactions. Importantly, this research project is being carried out in collaboration with pharmaceutical companies. This collaboration enables the rapid incorporation of the new methods into practical applications. Dr. Stephenson's research group participates in several outreach programs to engage grade school (3rd-12th grade) students, with the intention of inspiring the next generation of scientists and leaders. For example, the research team is contributing to the Females Excelling More in Mathematics, Engineering, and the Science (FEMMES) and the Michigan Math and Science Scholars (MMSS) programs at the University of Michigan. This outreach is directly engaging grade school students in a fun and supportive atmosphere, while also encouraging them to pursue a career in STEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith funding from the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Stephenson at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor is studying how transiently generated electron donor-acceptor (EDA) complexes can be leveraged for the development of new methods in chemical synthesis. The rational design of visible light-active EDA complexes is possible by applying basic principles of Mulliken theory.  Such complexes are characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy. EDA photocatalysis represents an exciting new frontier for the development of methods in organic synthesis. In this regard, methods for arene trifluoromethylation and radical aryl transpositions, for the rapid generation of molecular complexity, are being developed. Through a detailed understanding of each reaction mechanism, the developed methods are rapidly translated to industrial scale in collaboration with the AbbVie Process Research and Development team. Dr. Stephenson's research group is involved in several outreach programs that apply their expertise in synthetic chemistry to engage grade school (3rd-12th grade) students, with the intention of inspiring the next generation of scientific leaders. Dr. Stephenson's involvement in the Females Excelling More in Mathematics, Engineering, and the Science (FEMMES) and the Michigan Math and Science Scholars (MMSS) programs at the University of Michigan have allowed for the direct engagement of grade school students to teach synthetic chemistry in a fun and supportive atmosphere while also encouraging them to pursue a career in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
