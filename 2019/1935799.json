 "awd_abstract_narration": "Alkali-silica reaction (ASR) is a major deterioration mechanism causing significant expansion, cracking and damage to concrete material in service. Inspired by immunization and targeted therapy in cancer treatment, targeted suppression of ASR is the focus of this research. The existing mitigation methods are primarily targeted at single ASR prerequisites with limited efficiency and potential negative impacts on concrete performance. The primary objective of this project is to uncover the side-effect free mitigation of ASR, and then use the insights gained to guide the design of highly durable and sustainable infrastructure materials with unprecedented properties. A state-of-the-art methodology will be used by bridging the gaps between nanoengineering and cement chemistry to convert nanostructure of ASR gels to prevent volume expansion and cracking. This will lead to resilient and durable concrete thereby extending the lifetime of infrastructure and reducing the repair and maintenance costs. Overall, the acquired knowledge from this research effort will reduce the economic and societal impact of infrastructure deteriorations by providing insights for degradation preventions and service-life extension of new and existing concrete structures. The university's STEM program will be exploited to involve students in K-12 level as well as students at the undergraduate level.\r\n\r\nNanoengineered internal conditioning of concrete material triggered by multifunctional clay nanoparticles will be exploited based on a combined thermodynamic modeling and experimental approach. A fundamental understanding of the role of the nanoengineered internal conditioning in cement hydration that can suppress formation of ASR will be investigated. The research will focus on four research thrusts at: 1. Clay level: to functionalize clay nanoparticles to improve their dispersion, reactivity and tunable functions for internal conditioning; 2. Cement level: to tailor hydration behavior, pore network, and both solid and liquid compositions; 3. ASR level: to suppress ASR formation which prevents volume expansion and cracking; and 4. Concrete level: to improve durability-related mechanical and physical properties, and resistance to multiple aging mechanisms with a goal to design truly sustainable, resilient, and durable concrete material. The success of this project would be instrumental in advancing resilience-based and problem-oriented concrete material design through nanoengineering and thermodynamic means to stratify the quality requirement and performance expectation of future infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
