 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project funds a three day conference to be held in August, 2019 in Philadelphia, PA. The goal is to improve an understanding of the role of equity and well-being across the urban-rural gradient. The event will develop new models of knowledge development among researchers, communities, industry, practitioners, and government to understand interactions and feedback mechanisms between infrastructure and surrounding environmental, economic, and social systems. The conference focuses on the Philadelphia metropolitan region to ground the discussion because it provides a compelling site as one of the most populous, oldest, and poorest cities in the US. The conference also considers the scalability of the research frameworks and models to other cities and regions in the US and globally. This scientific research contribution thus supports NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and to advance our national welfare. In this case, the benefits will be insights to improve urban sustainability which will save lives and economic losses. \r\n\r\nThe conference assembles 40 individuals including academics (with interdisciplinary research expertise on sustainability in Philadelphia and beyond), representatives from local government, nonprofit and community  organizations (environment, regional planning, education). The results will be disseminated to a broad group of stakeholders through the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission, the Franklin Institute Science Museum, Planet Philadelphia radio show and podcast, and the publication of a special issue in the Current Opinions in Environmental Sustainability\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
