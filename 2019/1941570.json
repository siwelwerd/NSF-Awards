The meeting will be held on September 25, 2019 at The Optical Society's headquarters in Washington, DC and is being organized by the US Department of State.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the one-day meeting is to provide new opportunities for collaboration in high brightness science and engineering by facilitating dialogue, establishing new personal connections, and sharing technical grand challenges. This meeting will also showcase the state of the art, identify future needs in the field of high-intensity lasers, and discuss challenges to laser technology and engineering. The discussed topics will include but will not be limited to high-density laser-plasma interactions, astrophysics, secondary sources, particle acceleration, quantum vacuum interactions and non-perturbative quantum electrodynamics, and attosecond science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
