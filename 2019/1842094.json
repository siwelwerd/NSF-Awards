 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are responsible for a large portion of summertime precipitation in the Great Plains and Midwest of the United States and produce a large range of hazards, including strong winds, hail, flash flooding and occasional tornadoes. Thus, accurate understanding and forecasting of these systems is important for public safety. Processes responsible for the growth and evolution of a particular class of MCSs, occurring at night, are especially poorly understood. This project examines mechanisms responsible for the evolution of such nocturnal storms using a unique set of data obtained by an instrumented aircraft flying in clouds generated by and trailing behind nocturnal thunderstorms during the 2015 Plains Elevated Convection at Night (PECAN) field experiment. In particular, the project is assessing how small-scale processes occurring in clouds generate cold air which in turn generates features that act to force new air masses to rise, leading to the development of new thunderstorms that subsequently generate more trailing clouds and rain. The second component of the project examines the properties of clouds generated by thunderstorms occurring in the Tropics. This component was motivated by a problem faced by aviation, namely that aircraft flying at commercial flight altitudes can encounter conditions where there is no noticeable echo on their radar yet encounter large amounts of small ice crystals not detected by the radar; such conditions can be problematic for aircraft engines as evidenced by several engine events over the last 30 years. This project uses data collected by research aircraft flying in such conditions.  The research aircraft were instrumented with probes measuring cloud properties during the 2015 and 2016 High Ice Water Content (HIWC) projects conducted off the coast of Darwin, Australia and French Guiana. The project is examining processes that lead to the development of large numbers of small ice crystals by identifying the environmental conditions under which these small crystals form and grow. In both projects, model simulations are also being used to evaluate the role of specific processes in driving and maintaining thunderstorms (PECAN) and for generating small ice crystals (HIWC). Further, both projects acquired next generation polarimetric radar data coincident with the aircraft cloud observations so that cloud properties retrieved from polarimetric radar data can be validated, meaning that data from polarimetric radar in the future can ultimately be used to extend the limited range duration of the field experiment measurements. \r\n\r\nAt a more technical level, the PECAN data are being used to evaluate the hypothesis that microphysical cooling processes in developing and mature stratiform regions of MCSs force downdraft circulations that create mesoscale gravity wave features on the stable nocturnal boundary layer (SNBL) that in turn focus, organize and maintain future convective activity. In context of storm kinematics and dynamics as derived from multiple Doppler radar analyses and modeling investigations, the PECAN data are being used to (1) characterize the microphysical and thermodynamic structure of the transition zone, notch and rear anvil regions in formative, mature and dissipative stages of the PECAN elevated nocturnal MCSs; (2) quantify and understand how the horizontal and vertical distribution of latent cooling evolves across MCSs during their lifecycles and contributes to downdrafts and gravity wave features; and (3), determine how gravity wave features on the SNBL give rise to lifting that then drives convection and maintains the organization and long lifetime of nocturnal MCSs. The HIWC data are being used to (1) characterize the microphysical and thermodynamic properties of high IWC regions and contrasting them against properties derived from observations obtained in regions without high IWCs; (2) determine polarimetric radar signatures of high IWC regions and investigate how these signatures differ depending upon the relative prevalence of small ice crystals; (3) develop representations of size distributions and mass-dimensional relationships for high IWC regions as a volume or surface of equally realizable solutions in the appropriate coefficient phase space; and (4) conduct simulations to identify processes responsible for the numerous small ice crystals found above oceanic convective cores, and compare against HIWC observations. The broad impacts are (1) improved understanding so that operational forecasters and nowcasters can better anticipate the evolution of convective phenomena; (2) enhanced education and training opportunities (several graduate students are earning advanced degrees); (3) incorporation of PECAN and HAIC/HIWC data into courses taught and textbooks published by the PIs; (4) advanced scientific understanding of high IWC conditions that have led to about 150 power loss and/or pitot tube failures in commercial aircraft over the last several years.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

With collocated radar data providing context, we determined how cloud properties (total number concentration, median sizes, water content, temperature and humidity) varied in different cloud regions (transition zone TZ, enhanced stratiform rain region ESR and anvil region AR) and hypothesized processes responsible for the variations. Aggregation was ubiquitous in all regions, but sub-saturated conditions in the TZ and AR moderated its effectiveness. Extremely dry conditions in the rear inflow notch in the TZ showed ice particles could survive to temperatures of 16.9<sup>o</sup>C. The layer where ice melted was a prominent boundary with differing rates of change in relative humidity/temperature above and below. Collaborative modeling studies at Illinois used observed trends in cloud properties to evaluate simulations, which in turn determined how nocturnal thunderstorms maintain their structure and intensity in absence of surface-based potential energy and forcing (Figure 1)</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">Observations from aircraft during the HAIC/HIWC field campaigns in Darwin Australia and Cayenne French Guyana were used with models to determine circumstances leading to high <em>IWC</em>s in conditions of low radar reflectivity at commercial flight altitudes within deep tropical convection. To investigate processes producing high IWCs, aircraft observations were first used to determine how cloud properties (total number concentration, median sizes, mass content) varied with environmental conditions, temperature, vertical velocity, system age, distance away from convective peak and surface characteristics. The cloud properties were most dependent on vertical velocity, total mass content and temperature, with lower order dependence on other properties (Figure 2)</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">To compare against model simulations, we needed to know how the distribution of particle concentration with size varied with environmental parameters. Analysis of HAIC-HIWC data was complicated because many observed size distributions had multiple peaks at varying diameters rather than being unimodal. Thus, we developed a new mathematical technique that automatically determines how many modes are needed to characterize a size distribution and how to represent each mode as a mathematical gamma function inclusive of uncertainties. We applied this technique to size distributions measured near Cayenne and Darwin, and determined the dependence of the number of modes and representation of those modes on environmental parameters. The temperature, mass content and vertical velocity were again most important for characterizing the observed size distributions, and we represented the dependence in a stochastic manner that can be incorporated in numerical models (Figure 3)</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">To determine processes responsible for generating high IWCs in small crystals, we simulated a MCS observed off the coast of Cayenne, adjusting microphysical parameterization schemes in the commonly used Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model until we had good agreement with observations. All initial simulations overestimated the intensity and spatial extent of the observed radar signal by over 30% above the melting layer and did not adequately characterize observed particle size distributions, even though many parameterizations used have very different approaches to represent cloud processes. However, a series of subsequent simulations including the role of three different secondary ice production (SIP) processes better represented observed size distributions and radar signal. Sensitivity simulations showed all SIP processes must be included for agreement with observations as each process has an important role at some time and height in the simulations (Figure 4)</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">Another study examined the importance of gravity waves and turbulence in generating high IWCs. An adapted wavelet technique was applied to vertical velocities from all level flight legs from HAIC-HIWC Darwin that encountered high IWC conditions to determine the wave power spectrum. Both gravity wave activity (wavelengths 5 to 30 km) and turbulence (wavelengths less than 1 km) were present in 19 of 29 legs when high IWCs were sampled (Figure 5)</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">Broader impacts have focused on providing opportunities for the research of four graduate students (two at Oklahoma one at Illinois and Peking University who completed an extended visit at Oklahoma), a postdoctoral researcher and early career scientist at Oklahoma, as well as providing opportunities for them to travel to conferences to present their work. The PI has also presented at conferences, seminars at universities, and training workshops. Finally, a graduate student at the Oklahoma Advanced Radar Research Center used HAIC/HIWC data to improve modeling of dual-polarized radar variables to aid in the development of a new low-cost airborne polarimetric radar sensor.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 08/29/2024<br>\nModified by: Greg&nbsp;Mcfarquhar</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1842094/1842094_10603194_1724935039501_report2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1842094/1842094_10603194_1724935039501_report2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1842094/1842094_10603194_1724935039501_report2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Frequency of IWC for updrafts, downdrafts and stratiform regions for (a) -50 to -40C, (d) -35 to -25 C, and (g) -15 to -5C.
