 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award was provided as part of NSF's Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE) Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (SPRF) program and the Perception, Action, and Cognition program. The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, andgovernment. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Joseph Schmidt and Dr. Mark Neider at the University of Central Florida, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating subsequent search misses (SSMs). SSMs are a pitfall in visual search when observers look for multiple targets in their visual environment. Defined as a decrease in additional target accuracy after detecting a prior target in a visual search, SSMs underlie both real-world search errors (e.g., a radiologist is more likely to miss a smaller tumor if a larger tumor was previously detected) and more simplified, lab-based search errors (e.g., an observer is more likely to miss a target 'T' if a target 'L' was previously detected). Unfortunately, SSMs can account for one-third of radiological errors under certain conditions and little is known about its cognitive underpinnings. This project will investigate an expected cause of SSMs by using simplified and simulated radiological search displays in order to help translate the findings from basic research within visual cognition to cancer detection within radiology. Because SSMs are a real threat within radiology, a better understanding of their cause and ways to mitigate them can save lives.\r\n\r\nThis project will investigate if SSMs occur because a detected, first target is maintained as a target template-an active representation of what the observer is searching for. Within the visual cognition literature, a target template is known to bias observers to find targets that are similar, and consequently, miss targets that are dissimilar to the target template. If a detected target is maintained as a target template, SSMs may occur because critical cognitive processes, necessary for target detection, are processing the first target as a target template, resulting in a failure to detect additional targets. Furthermore, the target template may bias observers to search for targets similar to a first target, consequently making them more likely to miss targets that are dissimilar. Through the use of electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye tracking, the proposed projects will investigate the neural responses associated with detecting a first target, determine if maintenance of a first target as a template causes SSMs, and explore how eye movements towards perceptually similar- and dissimilar-second targets are affected. The proposed projects will then extend these findings back to radiological search displays to determine whether radiologists also show a similar pattern in search performance and eye movements when searching for similar and dissimilar signs of cancer in mammograms (x-ray images of breast tissue). Ultimately, the proposed projects will bridge visual cognition and radiology to elucidate the underlying neural mechanism(s) of SSMs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>The goals of this project center around Subsequent Search Misses (SSM): the increased likelihood that a second target is missed after a first target is detected in a visual search. While researchers have known about the SSM effect within radiology and medical image perception since the 1960s, there had yet to be an established mechanism to explain why SSM errors occur. In this project we published our Attentional Template theory (Adamo et al., 2021), which suggests that the attentional template is the mechanism responsible for SSM errors. According to the attentional template theory: 1) When a first target is found, it becomes an attentional template?a &nbsp;search goal held within visual working memory that biases search towards targets similar to the attentional template and consequently away from things dissimilar; 2) When more resources are allocated to maintaining a first target as an attentional template, there will be an increase in the SSM effect, and 3) a detected target can lose it?s prioritization over time, which results in a reduced SSM effect and coalescence of SSM errors for similar and dissimilar targets (See Attentional Templat Figure).</p>\n<p>The first major goal of this project was to provide behavioral, neural, and occulomotor evidence for the first two predictions of the Attentional Template theory. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person data was non-existant for the majority of the fellowship making it difficult to explicitly provide neural and occulomotor evidence for the first two predictions. While electrocenphalogram (EEG) recordings and oculomotor (eye tracking) data were collected, our analysis of event-related-potentials (i.e., neural markers calculated from electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings) and oculomotor data are ongoing. However, the behavioral data is promising and indicates that a second-target is more likely to be missed when it is dissimilar to a detected target in a simplified search display. This behavioral evidence suggests that a detected first target becomes and attentional template and biases observers to detect targets more similar to a first target (see EEG Behavioral Results).</p>\n<p>The second major goal was to determine if our theory predicted search behavior in breast cancer detection. We investigated whether observers were likely to succumb to the SSM effect and if they are more likely to make a SSM error for dissimilar abnormalities compared to similar abnormalities? More specifically, do experts (radiologists/fellows/residents with breast imaging experience) make the same type of search errors as novices (i.e., undergraduate participants) when looking for multiple cancers in a radiograph? We found that both experts and novices demonstrated a SSM effect for breast images providing the first evidence of the SSM effect in breast cancer detection. However, we found that experts did not show a similarity effect (i.e., not likely to hold a first target as a target template) while novices did. This finding suggests that experts are more likely to commit a detected first abnormality to long-term memory (and not as an attentional template) after detection, which is why there is no attentional template effect for second abnormalities for experts (Breast Cancer Detection Figure).</p>\n<p>Finally, we tested the third prediction from our Attentional Template theory?a detected target can lose its prioritization over time, which results in a reduced SSM effect and coalescence of SSM errors for similar and dissimilar targets. We found that with simplified, learned stimuli: 1) the SSM effect reduced the longer observers searched and 2) observers were prone to showing the similarity effect (i.e., were likely to hold a first target as attentional template) within the first 1000ms, but there was no similarity effect the longer observers searched. This is consistent with the literature in that learned attentional template can transfer to long-term memory as quickly as 1000ms (e.g., Carlisle et al., 2011; Gunseli et al., 2014; Schmidt et al., 2014) supporting one of the predictions of our Attentional Template theory (See SSM Effect Over Time Figure).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/01/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Stephen&nbsp;Adamo</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1911776/1911776_10630483_1654101903821_AttentionalTemplateFigure--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1911776/1911776_10630483_1654101903821_AttentionalTemplateFigure--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Attentional Template Figure\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1911776/1911776_10630483_1654101903821_AttentionalTemplateFigure--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Attentional Template Figure\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Illustration of how a first target is maintained as an attentional in visual working memory when detected (leaving less attentional resources to search).
