 "awd_abstract_narration": "Next generation electronics require materials that can transport electricity like metals but also offer new properties such as being flexible, light weight, low-cost, and recyclable.  In this regard, all-carbon materials such as plastics are attractive, but they lack the electrical transport ability of traditional metals.  Unlike metals, carbon-based plastics are rarely perfectly structured (crystalline). Their disorder makes it difficult to determine how electricity flows through them, a necessary first step in improving their electrical performance. In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms (CSDM-A) program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Aaron Massari of the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities is using sophisticated laser techniques to study the movement of electrical charges through complex molecular materials that could act as future electrical conductors.  The interdisciplinary nature of the project supports a training environment for undergraduate and graduate students that produces next-generation scientists who are skilled in benchtop chemistry, but also electrical, microscopic, and spectroscopic techniques. Ultimately, the research may not only lead to new perspectives on existing problems, but also inform the rational design of electrical materials  leading to devices that are less toxic and require less energy to produce. Professor Massari serves as the Director of the Energy and U Show, which brings science to over 10,000 3rd-6th graders each year. The show is filled with vibrant scientific demonstrations and the First Law of Thermodynamics.  For many, the event introduces the idea of attending college for the first time as more than half of the attendees are members of underrepresented groups.  Professor Massari also directs the chemistry portion of the University on the Prairie program, where he and his research group travel to work with 60 students in grades 7-12 and their teachers from rural, geographically isolated portions of the state.  These outreach and educational activities encourage STEM careers. \r\n\r\nThe project focuses on the roles of structural parameters, such as polymorphism, donor-acceptor spacing, partial charge transfer, and covalent attachment of molecular dopants, in the transport of charge through ground-state doped molecular thin films.  The measurements leverage the ability of two-dimensional infrared (2D-IR) spectroscopy to isolate the rates of charge transfer within specific molecular geometries from highly heterogeneous chemical environments. Short pulses of infrared light excite molecular vibrations on neutral and charge (doped) molecules in a film and then a second pair of pulses probe the evolution of that excitation as a marker for the location of the charge as a function of time.  Resolving the vibrational spectrum into a second dimension allows one to monitor the kinetics of charge transfer for specific molecular configurations independent of the others so that the transport kinetics can themselves be resolved.  The work systematically tests the impact of microscopic molecular spacing and order on macroscopic electrical transport by using molecules with particular structural modifications that affect their packing in known ways. Electrical transport is also driven in-situ in samples while they are characterized by 2D-IR spectroscopy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

One of the looming challenges in this area is the fact that the most promising thin film systems are highly heterogeneous, with transport characteristics that vary wildly with position and length. In this project, we sought to use two-dimensional IR (2D-IR) spectroscopy to monitor charge and energy exchange in heterogeneous systems. The knowledge gained through these studies will enable research groups around the world to build new and modify existing theoretical descriptions of charge motion between organic and organometallic molecules.</p>\n<p class=\"TAMainText\">An organometallic catalyst entrapped in an alumina sol-gel glass was investigated by FTIR and 2D-IR spectroscopy. This work allowed us to investigate (and explain) how this catalyst achieves enhanced performance in the alumina matrix. Upon entrapment in alumina, the spectral changes indicated that the catalyst underwent conversion to a metal hydride anion. We confirmed unambiguously the identity of this heterogeneous hydride catalyst by synthesizing the triruthenium hydride and measuring its vibrational and x-ray photoemission spectra. The results were further supported with DFT calculations to model the molecular structure and spectroscopy. This work provided the first conclusive experimental evidence that the ruthenium carbonyl is spontaneously converted to a hydride in an alumina sol-gel.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"TAMainText\">We then measured the time resolved 2D-IR spectra of this triruthenium catalyst in solution and encapsulated in the sol-gel glass (as a ruthenium hydride), and compared it to model hydride complexes in solution. Surprisingly, the vibrational dynamics measured from the carbonyl ligands were very similar for the two hydrides, regardless of whether it was encapsulated in a solid matrix. Deeper analysis of the 2D-IR spectra showed that the solvent motions experienced inside the alumina matrix were remarkably similar to those of the hydride in solution. This gives some insight as to how the complex is interacting with the walls of the glass pores, with the carbonyl vibrations mostly pointing away from the pore walls. This can be seen by comparing the differences between the top and middle 2D-IR spectra, and the similarity between the middle and bottom spectra in Figure 1. We concluded that the catalyst activity was not the result of the solvent environment in the nanoscopic alumina pores, but rather a chemical conversion to a hydride in that matrix.</p>\n<p class=\"TAMainText\">2D-IR data were collected for a dye molecule, N3, that is commonly studied for electron transfer in dye-sensitized solar cells. The N3 dye was combined with molecular iodine with which it formed a bimolecular complex. This complex formation is important for systems where the rate of charge transfer to N3 is affected by the presence of iodine species. Figure 2 shows the 2D-IR spectra at short (1 ps) and long (25 ps) waiting times. The spectra clearly show evidence of exchange by the growth of off-diagonal peaks with increasing waiting time.&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that the N3/iodine complex is breaking and reforming on this time scale. The precise kinetics of this process turned out to be challenging to determine due to unexpected complications that arose with sample degradation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"TAMainText\">We collected 2D-IR data on the charge separated states in a sample of an electron donating polymer, P3HT, and a small molecule electron acceptor, F4-TCNQ. The FTIR spectrum for this polymer / small molecule system is shown in Figure 3. A high frequency peak is present due to CN vibrations on neutral F4-TCNQ molecules that have not undergone charge transfer from P3HT. A low frequency peak is attributed to CN stretches on the fully reduced F4-TCNQ molecules. There are also peaks in the region between these extremes that would normally be assigned to charge transfer complexes with charge shared between the donor and acceptor.&nbsp;&nbsp;2D-IR spectra were collected on this heterogeneous charge transfer complex (Figure 4) but showed no off-diagonal peaks due to charge transfer. Application of an electrical bias should enable one to use this approach to determine the rates of charge transfer between adjacent charge transfer complexes. This could then be compared directly to the rates of charge transfer that are measured using macroscopic mobility measurements to determine the potential bottlenecks for efficient charge conduction in organic materials.</p>\n<p>This project also supported broader impacts in the form of community outreach and education. The PI serves as the Director of the Energy and U show at the University of Minnesota, an outreach event that teaches the First Law of Thermodynamics with exciting onstage demonstrations.&nbsp;Despite a hiatus due to the global pandemic, this outreach program served nearly 19,000 elementary school aged kids during this award. In addition, several shows were performed in Spanish for approximately 800 kids from Twin Cities Spanish Immersion schools.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 02/21/2024<br>\nModified by: Aaron&nbsp;M&nbsp;Massari</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1856589/1856589_10600219_1708572630135_Picture2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1856589/1856589_10600219_1708572630135_Picture2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1856589/1856589_10600219_1708572630135_Picture2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 2. 2D-IR spectra at Tw = 1 ps (left) and 25 ps (right) showing the breaking and reforming of N3/iodine complex in solution.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">AMM</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Aaron&nbsp;M&nbsp;Massari\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1856589/1856589_10600219_1708572508646_Picture1--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1856589/1856589_10600219_1708572508646_Picture1--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1856589/1856589_10600219_1708572508646_Picture1--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1. 2D-IR spectra of triruthenium carbonyl in THF (top row), alumina sol-gel matrix (middle row), and the ruthenium hydride salt in THF (bottom row) at 0.5 ps (left) and 10 ps (right).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">AMM</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Aaron&nbsp;M&nbsp;Massari\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1856589/1856589_10600219_1708572731676_Picture3--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1856589/1856589_10600219_1708572731676_Picture3--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1856589/1856589_10600219_1708572731676_Picture3--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 3.
