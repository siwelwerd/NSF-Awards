 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Networking Technology and Systems Early-Career Investigators (NeTS-ECI) Workshop is aimed at developing the early-career NeTS research community to address emerging challenges and pursue promising research opportunities in the domain of computer and information networking. NeTS-ECI provides an opportunity for early-career researchers to engage in discussions with peers to share perspectives and explore new research frontiers. Each workshop participant will also have an opportunity to showcase his/her research interests, build a collaborator network, kick-start collaborations, and benefit from professional development activities such as presentations on the National Science Foundation (NSF) merit review process and elements of successful NSF proposals, talks from leaders in networking on how to build successful large research programs and how to identify and work on strong research collaborations. The output of the workshop will be a detailed reporting outlining the various presentations and breakout discussions. Thus, this workshop will thus play an important role in fostering a strong community of early career researchers in NeTS.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
