 "awd_abstract_narration": "Meeting the mathematics requirements for obtaining Career and Technical Education (CTE) credentials is a common barrier for students who are pursuing certificates and/or associated degrees needed for careers in STEM-oriented technician fields.  Based on current and prior work, an extensive review of the literature, and examination of projects funded by the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program, a collaboration of eight rural Arizona community colleges and the Science Foundation Arizona Center for STEM at Arizona State University (SFAz) will continue on-going efforts to address this problem.  As contextualized mathematics modules are developed, adapted, and implemented, these instructional materials will be shared through the STEM Network, a common resource and repository. The goal of the project is to improve student completion in Career and Technical (CTE) programs across rural institutions in Arizona.  Project deliverables include contextualized mathematics instructional modules for use in either mathematics or technician courses. The project will support students in overcoming barriers to earning the required credits in mathematics that lead to successfully completing certificates and degrees in STEM-oriented technician programs.  The project has the potential to provide Hispanic, Native American, and other students in rural areas with the opportunity and credentials to join the STEM technical workforce in Arizona, in welding, automotive, electronics, and construction technician fields. Moreover, the team will examine the outcomes of students who participate in the treatment (instruction using the modules) and those students who are in courses in which faculty do not use the contextualized mathematics modules.\r\n\r\nTo examine and estimate the size of impact of the use of contextualized mathematics modules in mathematics and technician courses, a matched comparison group design will be implemented.  This design will allow the project to measure impact on student learning and retention as a result of the intervention.  Propensity score matching will be used to create a comparable, matched pair of treatment and control students to examine and compare student outcomes.\r\n\r\nThe project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
