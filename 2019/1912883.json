 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics and it addresses the priority areas of NSF's \"Windows on the Universe\" Big Idea. The LIGO and VIRGO gravitational wave detectors are beginning to make new discoveries on a weekly basis. The gravitational waves that they detect are generated in the mergers of two compact objects, such as black holes or neutron stars. Gravitational waves carry important information about their origin that can extracted through careful comparisons to theoretical calculations, such as full-scale computer simulations of binary mergers. This project will study mergers of binary neutron stars and black holes using computer simulations created by Dendro-GR, a new computer code that runs very efficiently on the largest supercomputers.  This work will also help push forward current computational capabilities to permit better and faster waveform calculations to be made. These efforts will aid in expanding the use of gravitational wave detections from confirming general relativity to providing additional, even more stringent tests of both the theory and other possible competing theories.  Combining data from computer simulations with both gravitational and electromagnetic observations will allow us to probe, in a manner heretofore impossible, the physics of black holes and neutron stars, of gamma-ray bursts, of kilonovae and supernovae, and of even the formation of the heaviest elements on the periodic table. Work done for this project will promote the progress of science and contribute to undergraduate and graduate training in multiple STEM fields including computer science, mathematics, and physics. Finally, Dendro-GR is an open source project.\r\n\r\nThe overarching purpose of this project is to study the dynamics of merging binary compact objects at the frontier of current computational capabilities.  The wavelet-based refinement and computational efficiency of Dendro-GR allows the modeling of a wider variety of possible merger scenarios, enhancing the ability to both detect and understand these high-energy events, as well as search for possible new physics beyond our current gravitational models.  The efforts will be directed primarily at the following goals:  (1) Deploying new computational algorithms and abilities to determine gravitational waveforms for binary neutron star inspirals and mergers of sufficient accuracy that they are usable in improved waveform catalogs.  (2)  Investigating binary black hole inspirals and mergers with large mass ratios both to understand this class of largely unexplored binaries and to expand the range of current waveform catalogs.  (3)  Calculating waveforms from binary black hole mergers within a family of alternative gravitational theories in order to probe possible deviations from the predictions of general relativity and to search for new physics beyond our current model for gravity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\n\n\nGravitational waves from merging black holes and neutron stars provide important information about these exotic objects and strong-field gravity. Improvements in gravitational wave detectors over the next decade will require scientists to more accurately calculate the expected wave signals from gravitational theory. This project developed new computational methods to calculate gravitational waveforms in Einsteins theory of general relativity, and two alternative models of gravity.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe calculated gravitational waveforms for merging black holes using the complete equations of general relativity. These calculations are done on supercomputers, and can take weeks to months to perform. Our research examined ways to significantly decrease the computational cost of these calculations, using a refinement method based on mathematical wavelets to efficiently represent the black holes in the calculations. These methods allowed us to compute gravitational waveforms from black hole binaries with large mass ratios of 4:1, 8:1, and 16:1 much more efficiently than conventional methods. We validated our solutions using a well-known existing code.\n\n\nRecent developments in supercomputing have shown that GPU devices can perform some calculations much more efficiently than traditional CPUs. We developed a version of our code to run on GPUs, and showed that some gravitational waveforms could be computed 24 times faster than using the CPU version of our code.\n\n\nDetections of gravitational waves from merging binaries allows us to study strong and dynamic gravity. While the waveforms detected to date are consistent with general relativity, future detections will allow us to test the limits of Einsteins model. As such, it is important to also examine gravitational wave physics in alternative theories. We began exploring two alternative theories of gravity, performing strong-field tests of merging black holes.\n\n\nSeveral undergraduate and graduate students participated as researchers in this project, including REU students from different universities and students from under-represented groups. These students all developed skills in scientific and computational research, and had the opportunity to present research findings at scientific meetings. Some students completed research theses to fulfill graduation requirements.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/17/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DavidNeilsen\n"
