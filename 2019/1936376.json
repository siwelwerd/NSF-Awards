 "awd_abstract_narration": "Water is a key component to our planet, particularly to sustain food production and support human existence. To use water judiciously at macro scales e.g., basins or watersheds, a thorough understanding of factors affecting water requirement at smaller scales e.g., individual plants, is required. At the plant scale, the main driver determining water need is transpiration from the leaves. The rate of water loss through leaves is directly linked to sap flow, defined as the rate at which water moves through the stem. The goal of this project is to develop a new technology using principles from physics, based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), to accurately determine sap flow and how it changes in real-time in a plant stem under different environmental conditions. Unlike currently available equipment, the NMR tool is non-invasive and portable, which allows making in-situ measurements easy and handy. Results from the NMR tool will have broad impacts that are of societal relevance by filling a significant knowledge gap about water and nutrient transport in plants. Project personnel will be involved in on-campus activities and events to engage K-12 students and increase their knowledge regarding water management. Project PIs will work with underrepresented groups in science for the Advancement of Women in Science and Engineering (KAWSE) i.e., Girls Researching Our World (GROW) summer workshops focusing on the water use and new NMR technology. The NMR tool has the potential for commercialization and application to other food crops and plants to advance agricultural and ecosystem productivity. \r\n\r\nThe sole phenomenon transporting water and nutrients from soil to leaves through roots and stem vascular tissues in plants is the highly-dynamic sap flow. Quantifying this extremely complex physiological process varying temporally and spatially has been a major challenge in crop science, due to the lack of a robust, non-invasive and portable system. Therefore, this project aims to (1) design and prototype a handy tool to accurately measure temporal variations of sap-flow dynamics in sunflower, and (2) test and validate nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) as a useful and practical tool for characterizing sap flow in crop plants. A portable NMR tool will be designed using a combination of 3D finite-element simulation package and a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II to optimize the magnets' arrays and coils. The optimally-designed NMR tool will be prototyped in the lab, and its magnetic field homogeneity and intensity will be experimentally validated. Furthermore, a narrow tube and two flow rates i.e., 1 and 100 (mg/s) will be used to fine-tune the NMR tool under steady-steady conditions. Sunflower plants will be maintained in state-of-the-art, walk-in growth chambers at 2, 3 and 4 kPa vapor pressure deficit levels. Plant water loss will be measured at high temporal frequency using a load cell and the mass-balance method. NMR velocimetry will be performed thrice daily at different growth stages until flowering to capture velocity distribution at short time intervals. Sap flow estimated via NMR will be compared with that determined by the mass-balance method.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It plays a key role in the photosynthesis process and, accordingly, impacts agricultural production. Managing water resources at large scales requires the knowledge of water use by plants at smaller scales. The amount of water carrying nutrients from soil to leaves through roots and stem vascular tissues in plants is highly dynamic and called sap flow whose measurement has been a challenge. Although there exist various approaches to measure sap flow, most are invasive. In this project, we proposed designing a portable and non-invasive device based on emerging nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technology. After finding optimal solutions while maintaining restrictions (such as weight, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), magnetic field strength, and level of homogeneity), we prototyped a device, shown in Figure 1, based on a technique known as <em>magnetic arrangement for novel discrete Halbach layout</em>. By conducting experiments using water in a tube, we, however, found noises in signals received (Figure 2). Although some noises were eliminated after enabling the spectrum analyzer filtering feature, there exist noises in the signals. It was concluded that one of the following reasons might be the main cause of noises: (1) low accuracy of amplifier used, (2) loosen wires in the transmitter and receiver coils, (3) untuned matching circuit?s capacitance, (4) the constant magnetic field?s homogeneity decreased by the passage of time, (5) the internal forces between the permanent magnets affected the magnetic field consistency, or (6) coaxial cables were not used in the high frequency modules of the system and this might have increased the noise level in the captured atoms reactions.</p>\n<p>To conceptually understand sap flow in plants, we conducted water flow experiments in single tubes using a high viscosity detergent. We applied a pulsed gradient spin echo method to measure water velocity profile. The setup used for this experiment is shown in Figure 3. A syringe and a pump that provided liquid circulation at constant velocity were used. The captured water velocity profile in a glass tube diameter of 10 mm and actual flow rate of 8 mL/min is shown in Figure 4. In this figure, the x axis represents the velocity in m/s and the y axis denotes the radial position in m. Using Poiseuille?s law and the average water velocity captured by the NMR device, we found the flow rate determined by the NMR approach equal to 8.95 mL/min, which is nearly 12% greater than the actual flow rate. Generally speaking, the obtained results using the NMR device are promising, although further experiments in plants are still required.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/02/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Behzad&nbsp;Ghanbarian</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1936376/1936376_10618461_1672693189158_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1936376/1936376_10618461_1672693189158_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Prototyped NMR device\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1936376/1936376_10618461_1672693189158_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Prototyped NMR device\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1- Top view of the prototyped NMR device with stem holder equipped with exciter and receiver coils; a glass tube filled with water has been hold by stem holder.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Mohammad Shadmand</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Behzad&nbsp;Ghanbarian</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Prototyped NMR device</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1936376/1936376_10618461_1672694250159_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1936376/1936376_10618461_1672694250159_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Captured atom\ufffds dynamics by NMR\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1936376/1936376_10618461_1672694250159_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Captured atom\ufffds dynamics by NMR\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 2- The captured atom\ufffds dynamics by the prototyped NMR device (left) with noises and (right) after enabling spectrum analyzer filtering feature.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Mohammad Shadmand</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Behzad&nbsp;Ghanbarian</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Captured atom\ufffds dynamics by NMR</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1936376/1936376_10618461_1672694938262_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1936376/1936376_10618461_1672694938262_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"NMR setup for water velocity measurement\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1936376/1936376_10618461_1672694938262_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"NMR setup for water velocity measurement\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 3- The test setup for measuring water velocity in a single tube using the pulsed gradient spin echo method and instrument.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Mohammad Shadmand</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Behzad&nbsp;Ghanbarian</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">NMR setup for water velocity measurement</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1936376/1936376_10618461_1672695440392_Figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1936376/1936376_10618461_1672695440392_Figure4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"NMR water velocity profile\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1936376/1936376_10618461_1672695440392_Figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"NMR water velocity profile\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 4- Measured velocity profile using the pulsed gradient spin echo-based NMR device for a 10mm glass tube and actual flow rate of 8 mL/min.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Mohammad Shadmand</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Behzad&nbsp;Ghanbarian</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">NMR water velocity profile</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
