 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop will bring together stakeholders from federal agencies, national labs, and universities who are data, domain, and computational scientists to advance community goals for creating the framework for digital preservation and access to developing digital collections. Discussion will also include the tools necessary to make these data ready for research usage. Invited keynote speakers will frame the discussions and all participants will have a chance to contribute through breakout groups, interactive polling, and poster sessions.The writing group will summarize the discussions in a document addressing the two broad goals of the workshop: Goal 1: Work towards developing the framework for preservation of longitudinal seismic data. This includes recommendations for prioritizing scanning efforts, defining metadata and data imaging standards to improve discovery and (re)use, and identifying the associated technical and social challenges. Goal 2: Create an interdisciplinary network of data, domain, and computational scientists to facilitate management, access, and use of digitally imaged legacy data.\r\n\r\nNew seismological data mining methods are supporting discoveries and cross-disciplinary research across Earth system science. Such research is challenged by the relatively short time period of observation for which digital records are readily available. Historical data, recorded on paper and other physical media, potentially extend the time period of Earth observation to many decades. However, if such dark data are to be preserved and made available digitally to harness the data revolution, there are compelling challenges. The historical data are largely siloed; data are only available to scientists who can commit to traveling to specific archives or from archives capable of serving data requests. In addition, some of the physical media have been damaged or lost and/or at risk of losing stewardship. Hence, it is imperative that the community organize to preserve as well as make available these irreplaceable collections. The workshop will provide support for early-career and participants from under-represented groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
