This meeting brings together principal investigators from across the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program. The investigators identify topics and establish a workshop agenda, including speakers and panelists. Specific objectives of the PI meeting include: \r\n\r\n- to stimulate coordination and collaboration amongst SaTC researchers working on the projects in the portfolio; \r\n- to foster new collaborations between SaTC researchers and researchers in other disciplines; \r\n- to share experiences and learn from others' experiences in transitioning research into practice; \r\n- to support undergraduate research in SaTC researchers;  and \r\n- to develop ideas and share methods for improving education, recruitment, and career development in cybersecurity. \r\n\r\nBuilding a strong community among SaTC researchers helps identify new research topics, avoid duplication of existing research, and improve educational opportunities for graduate students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project supported the planning and execution of the technical program for the 2019 Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) Principal Investigators Meeting, held October 27-29, 2019 at the Hilton Alexandria Mark Center in Alexandria, VA.\n\nThis meeting brought together principal investigators from across NSF's SaTC program to stimulate coordination and collaboration amongst SaTC researchers working on the projects in the portfolio; foster new collaborations between SaTC researchers and researchers in other disciplines; share experiences and learn from others' experiences in transitioning research into practice; support undergraduate research in SaTC research; and develop ideas and share methods for improving education, recruitment, and career development in cybersecurity.  This year's symposium had a particular focus on Growing and Diversifying the Cybersecurity Research Pathway, considering questions of how SaTC can increase diversity and inclusivity in cybersecurity research and the cybersecurity workforce and how SaTC can involve more undergraduates in research and inspire them to pursue graduate studies in cybersecurity. This focus was reflected in the panel topics, the choice of presenters, and the inclusion, for the first time, of an undergraduate student track, a dedicated track for undergraduate students who have carried out research as part of a SaTC-funded project.\n\nThere were 580 participants in the meeting, plus an additional 49 undergraduates participating in the undergraduate track.  The program consisted of several kinds of activities, described below, supplemented by casual networking opportunities during breaks.\n\nKeynote Presentations: The event included three keynote presentations:  Kate Starbird (University of Washington) gave a presentation entitled Beyond \"Bots\" and \"Trolls\": Understanding Disinformation as Collaborative Work.  Nick Sullivan (Cloudflare) presented How to Encrypt the Internet.  Matthew Green (Johns Hopkins University) spoke about Building Trust in an Untrustworthy World.  Video recordings of the presentations are available from the meeting web site.  Additionally, Kenneth Calvert (Division Director, Division of Computer and Network Systems, Directorate for Computer &amp; Information Science &amp; Engineering, National Science Foundation) discussed the history and achievements of the SaTC program, as well as future directions, in his presentation, NSF's Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace Program: Where We've Been and Where We're Going.\n\nPanels: Three panels were included to explore the event?s theme and provide diverse perspectives on important topics of interest to the SaTC community. The first of these was a panel on Enabling the Frontiers of Cybersecurity Research and Education, consisting of the assistant directors of five NSF directorates: Computer &amp; Information Science &amp; Engineering; Mathematical &amp; Physical Sciences; Social, Behavioral &amp; Economic Sciences; Education &amp; Human Resources; and Engineering.  The second panel, Moving from Research to Practice: How to Maximize the Impact of SaTC Projects, had four faculty panelists and one NSF panelist, addressing their experiences with transitioning SaTC research into practice.  The third panel, How to Grow and Broaden Domestic Cybersecurity Pathways, addressed ideas for encouraging more students to consider careers in cybersecurity, and more U.S. undergraduates to consider graduate school and research careers in cybersecurity.\n\nBreakout Sessions: Breakout sessions allowed participants to focus on a specific SaTC-related topic, including identifying existing successes, future challenges, and possible new ideas to address the challenges.  There were fourteen topics ranging from trustworthy machine learning to social and behavior aspects of cybersecurity, plus a concurrent session on government priorities and funding opportunities.  For each topic, the session participants developed a report, an initial version of which was presented at the end of the symposium.  These reports are available on the symposium web site.\n\nUndergraduate track: SaTC PIs were encouraged to nominate undergraduate students involved in project research to participate in this track.  Students in the undergraduate track were exposed to SaTC topics and the research community at large.  The students had their own agenda of presentations and panels geared toward them for much of the meeting, while joining the rest of the group for the keynote talks as well as the poster and demonstration session.  Topics included information about graduate school and careers in academia, industry, and government.\n\nPoster and Demonstration Session: A poster and demonstration session included posters from 176 PIs, posters from 46 undergraduates, and 17 demonstrations.  The session took place over two hours and included a reception to give people time to visit multiple posters and demonstrations and to network.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rebecca N Wright"
