 "awd_abstract_narration": "In our increasingly fragmented world, dispersal between habitat fragments is essential for the long-term survival of a species. This project will integrate mathematical modeling and experimental analysis of an insect commonly found in stored grains to describe the effects of habitat fragmentation, conditional dispersal (e.g. an organism?s decision to leave a fragment depends upon competitor presence) and interspecific competition on population dynamics from the patch level to the landscape level. Results from this project will answer key ecological questions including: What effects do competitors have on the emigration behavior of species at patch boundaries? How do relationships between density and emigration affect regional population dynamics and competitor coexistence? How does conditional dispersal affect competition-dispersal tradeoffs that are thought to be a key to competitor coexistence? The project will advance the analysis of mathematical models created to answer these questions and better understand model dynamics. Finally, results from this study will apply to conservation programs and habitat reserve design. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained through PI-hosted workshops and mentorship of independent research projects. Project results will be disseminated to both ecological and mathematical communities through peer-reviewed journals, national and international conference talks, and a user-friendly website. Additionally, an app that estimates key dispersal parameters from field data will be created and made publicly available. This project is funded jointly by the Division of Mathematical Sciences Mathematical Biology program and the Division of Environmental Biology Population and Community Ecology program.\r\n\r\nThis collaborative project will integrate reaction-diffusion models, mathematical analysis, and experimental analysis to explore the effects of habitat fragmentation, conditional dispersal and interspecific competition on the population dynamics and species coexistence from the patch to the landscape level. The PIs will use diffusive Lotka-Volterra competition systems with nonlinear boundary conditions modeling density dependent emigration (DDE) both at the patch and landscape levels and stage structure. Ongoing research suggests that life-history traits, such as whether a species is solitary or gregarious, can provide cues as to the form of DDE for particular species. Knowledge of species' life histories, coupled with our predictions regarding how different forms of DDE can affect species coexistence and connectivity among habitat patches, can help determine whether existing reserves are adequate for species coexistence.  Dispersal experiments will be performed using two Tribolium flour beetle species to parameterize the models and compare model predictions about coexistence and stability with results from long-term experiments. Innovative contributions will be made by providing (1) experimental evidence that interspecific competitors affect within-patch redistribution, boundary behavior and the strength and form of the DDE relationship; (2) the first theoretical framework and empirical evidence for the effects of conditional dispersal on the population dynamics and coexistence of competing species in fragmented landscapes; and (3) novel analysis of elliptic boundary value problems with nonlinear boundary conditions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project will be an integration of mathematical modeling and experimental analysis of an insect herbivore system to provide much needed information on the effects of habitat fragmentation, conditional dispersal (e.g., an organism&rsquo;s decision to leave a fragment depends upon competitor presence) and interspecific competition on herbivore population dynamics from the patch level to the landscape level. There were three objectives: 1) Through model development and experiments, determine how conspecific density dependent dispersal and matrix effects influence patch-level population dynamics of herbivores; 2) Using reaction-diffusion models and experiments, determine how conspecific density dependent dispersal influences population dynamics at the landscape scale; and 3) Explore through models and experiments how competition-mediated dispersal and matrix habitat affects population dynamics at the patch scale. We addressed three key ecological questions in our research: 1) what effects do competitors have on a species&rsquo; boundary and emigration behavior?,&nbsp; 2) how different relationships between density and emigration affect regional population dynamics and competitor coexistence?, and 3) how does conditional dispersal affect the occurrence and strength of competition-dispersal tradeoffs that are thought to be a key to competitor coexistence?</p>\n<p>Through our collaborative efforts, we completed the above objectives and raised a number of new and important questions that will be addressed in a recently funded renewal of this grant. Key outcomes from this work include the following. 1) We formalized a framework to facilitate the connection between small-scale movement and patch-level predictions of persistence through a mechanistic Lotka-Volterra competition model based on reaction&ndash;diffusion equations. The model is capable of incorporating essential information about edge-mediated effects such as patch preference, movement behavior, matrix-induced mortality, strength of competition between species, and effects of conspecific and heterospecific density on emigration. We illustrated the utility of this framework with a model laboratory system involving the flour beetles <em>Tribolium</em> castaneum and <em>T. confusum</em>. Experimentally, we demonstrated that flour beetle dispersal is well-fit by a diffusion model, movement shows a humped-shaped relationship with density and is similarly affected by the density of the other species of competitor. In open patches, where emigration is possible, our experiments and models were in close agreement with regard to the long-term coexistence of species. Although <em>T. castaneum</em> generally excluded the other species across a range of landscape contexts (e.g., different patch sizes, permeability of the patch boundary), if we account for natural variation in population parameters (growth rates, competitive abilities, responses to density), a wide range of population dynamics is possible. We also applied our model to issues regarding species conservation and reserve design. Our model provides a mechanistic explanation for different shapes of the density-area relationship (DAR) for a species. From a conservation perspective, the DAR is crucial to the identification of valuable habitat fragments that favor high abundance and the design of a reserve for a target species. We also illustrated how matrix hostility in combination with non-lethal predator effects can influence DAR, minimum patch size, and species coexistence.
