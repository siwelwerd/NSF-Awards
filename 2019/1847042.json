 "awd_abstract_narration": "Conditions on the Earth during the first two billion years of its history (4.5 to 2.5 billion years before present) were vastly different from the modern Earth.  Key events in Earth history, including the rise of life and the creation of continents, took place during this time, yet fundamental questions remain unanswered.  Did the early Earth exhibit the familiar patterns of continental drift as we see today?  When did the first oxygen-producing organisms evolve?  Did a global magnetic field similar to that of the present-day isolate the atmosphere from loss to the solar wind?  This project will use a new generation magnetic field imaging device, recently developed from advances in quantum sensing, to examine the magnetic properties of rock samples between 2.7 and 4.2 billion years in age.  These experiments are expected to yield new insights into the initiation of plate tectonics, the evolution of the early atmosphere, and the rise of oxygen-producing life.  In parallel with these measurements this project will develop a series of lessons with Boston-area middle school teachers involving student-led observations of the sun through solar telescopes distributed to the schools.  These observations will serve as an introduction to changes in the sun's properties through time and its impact on surface conditions on the early Earth.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental challenge to understanding conditions on Earth during the Archean Eon (4.0-2.5 billion years ago, or Ga) is the lack of well-preserved rocks dating from that time.  Consequently, attempts to recover information about ancient magnetic fields have been severely hampered by pervasive remagnetization through metamorphism and chemical alteration of ferromagnetic phases.  This project will apply a recently developed technology for micrometer-scale magnetic imaging, known as the quantum diamond microscope (QDM), to address major outstanding questions in Archean Earth history.  The high spatial resolution of the QDM permits direct imaging of remanent magnetization carriers in complex, altered rocks, which aids the identification of primary paleomagnetic signals.  In Task 1, the QDM will be used to infer the existence of the geodynamo before 3.5 Ga by recovering magnetic signals from a newly discovered population of 3.3-4.2 Ga zircons from the Barberton Greenstone Belt (BGB) of South Africa.  As part of Task 2, the project team will apply both QDM and traditional paleomagnetic techniques on carefully selected igneous rock units to quantify the mobility of lithospheric plate at 3.45 Ga.  Finally, Task 3 of the project will use the QDM to infer the origin of ferromagnetic iron oxides preserved in 2.78 Ga micrometeorites, thereby testing the controversial hypothesis that the upper atmosphere of the Earth was oxygen-rich several hundred million years before the Great Oxidation Event.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Besides constantly changing the geography of the Earth over millions of years, these motions, known collectively as \"plate tectonics\", regulate Earth's surface temperature, create mountain and oceans, and make available elements like phosphorus that are essential to life.&nbsp;<br />In this project, we combined fieldwork to ancient rock formations in Australia and South Africa with advanced laboratory instrumentation to show that the Pilbara craton, a ~400 km wide block of ancient crust in Australia, underwent a mix of rapid (15-40 cm/y) and slow (&lt;8 cm/y) motions between 3.48 and 3.18 billion years ago. Combined with previous data indicating that South Africa did not move appreciably during some of this interval, we conclude that plate tectonics, along with the resulting motion of crust and regulation of the Earth's surface environment, has been operating on Earth since at least 3.5 billion years ago. The high velocities of these early plates, and the apparently sudden shifts in these velocities through time, hint that plate tectonics can exist in multiple \"regimes\" with different forces that drive them compared to in the present-day Earth. This motivates further research into what kinds of plate tectonic regimes can exist on exoplanets and on other Solar System planets in the deep past, as well as on what these other tectonic regimes mean for the stability of the surface environment.&nbsp;<br />To make these discoveries about the motion of the ancient Pilbara craton, we used the quantum diamond microscope (QDM), which is a recently developed quantum instrument capable of imaging magnetic fields at micrometer (1/25,000 of an inch) scales. This technology allowed us to pinpoint the minerals in the rocks we analyzed that carry the signal of ancient magnetic fields. This was vital for ascertaining the age of that signal and allowed us to use it to quantify the velocity of the ancient landmasses across the Earth's surface. Traditionally, magnetic data used to reconstruct the motion of ancient continents relied on very pristine, well-preserved rocks that have escaped (or assumed to have escaped!) significant post-burial reactions with underground fluids. Our technique allows us to interpret the age of magnetic signals in rocks that have been heavily altered by these reactions, thereby opening the possibility of using a much wider variety of rocks to understand ancient plate motion. These techniques can be used for future reconstruction of plate tectonics in other times in Earth history.&nbsp;<br />In parallel, we used QDM technology to show that ancient zircons (100-micrometer-scale crystals of zirconium and silicon) from both Australia and South Africa are heavily compromised due to reactions with fluids and, unfortunately, cannot be used to reconstruct the motion of continents or the behavior of the Earth's core-generated magnetic field as previously hoped. All is not lost, however, as our data based on whole rocks from the 3.5 to 3.2 billion-year-ago interval strongly suggests that the Earth's magnetic field has, perhaps surprisingly, changed remarkably little in the past 3.5 billion years.&nbsp;<br />Alongside all the scientific advancements described above, we have used resources from this grant to purchase solar telescopes dedicated to observing the Sun safely and while resolving lots of surface detail. We ran a two-day professional development course at the Harvard Museum of Natural History to, with the help of 19 teacher participants, develop lessons involving the relationship between the Sun and conditions on Earth and using the telescopes to take data on the rotation of the Sun. The teachers were able to take the telescopes and the lessons back to their classrooms where they will be used for years to come.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/04/2025<br>\nModified by: Roger&nbsp;Fu</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1847042/1847042_10593683_1741122021674_Screenshot_2025_03_04_at_3.51.37_PM--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1847042/1847042_10593683_1741122021674_Screenshot_2025_03_04_at_3.51.37_PM--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Plate motion at 3.25 billion years ago\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1847042/1847042_10593683_1741122021674_Screenshot_2025_03_04_at_3.51.37_PM--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Plate motion at 3.25 billion years ago\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Key data figure from Brenner et al.
