 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award funds research in mechanism design and contract theory, the economic theory of the effects of incentives. Current core mathematical models are well-understood for simple environments but difficult to extend to more complicated environments. This project will develop new basic modeling tools, with the aim of broadening the scope of the theory. The tools will allow researchers to better design incentive schemes for complex environments, including incentive schemes that guarantee performance despite uncertainties about the economic environment. The integrated education plan includes an interdisciplinary conference to connect theorists in mechanism design with experts in potential application areas; and outreach activities with high school students and educators interested in advanced mathematical problem solving to build awareness of this fruitful area of study. This research promotes the national interest because it will guide the design of better incentive mechanisms. Existing theory in this area has historically had many applications, including taxation, regulation, procurement, and corporate finance. New theory will allow further improvements and better efficiency in these and other areas. \r\n\r\nThe overall project has three main components. (1) Multidimensional mechanism design. Major workhorse models typically assume agents' preferences are summarized by a one-dimensional parameter; extending these models to multiple dimensions is widely viewed as challenging, yet important. This research will adapt a new modeling approach, based on uncertainty about the correlation across dimensions of preference, to study several questions concerning when and why simple mechanisms can deliver good guarantees. (2) Mechanism design when agents' information is endogenous. In many situations, agents can take costly actions to either acquire relevant information or influence others' information before an economic interaction, and a planner designing the interaction may be concerned that this gaming is socially wasteful. This project characterizes mechanisms that give robust guarantees when such \"information games\" are considered. (3) Design of incentives in situations of moral hazard, when it is unknown exactly what actions agents can take. This project considers several theoretical questions on this theme, focusing on understanding when simple incentive structures can be optimally robust in complex situations. The research plan also includes some related directions of study, including approximation of complex environments by simple ones, and optimal experimentation by incentive designers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award supported foundational theoretical research and dissemination of knowledge on the structure of incentives, with a particular focus on mathematical models of incentive design in the face of uncertainty about the environment.\n\n\nThe project \"A General Framework for Robust Contracting Models\" (which, as of this writing, is accepted at Econometrica pending a final revision) studies models of moral hazard, that is, provision of incentives for an agent who takes an action that cannot be directly observed, by paying based on outcomes produced by the action.  For example how a company pays an employee whose efforts cannot be observed, but whose efforts do affect the profits of the company.   Previous work identified a sense in which linear contracts - which simply pay the agent a fixed fraction of the profit they produce, rather than some more complex formula - are optimally robust to uncertainty about the actions available to the agent.  However, that previous work, like most of the theory of moral hazard, focused on a single bilateral relationship between the principal (designer of incentives) and the agent.  In reality, incentive provision is often embedded in more complex organizations, such as hierarchies or teams.  This project shows that extensions of the original model to such organizations may or may not preserve the result on optimality of linear contracts, depending on the details of the model.  The project develops an abstract \"black-box\" framework for describing contracting models without relying on details of organizational form, and in this framework, identifies conditions on a contracting model that are sufficient (and, in an appropriate sense, also necessary) to ensure that it delivers linear contracts as optimal.  The black-box framework may also prove useful for making analogous studies of other kinds of incentive structures besides linear contracts.\n\n\nThe closely related project \"Robust Contracting under Double Moral Hazard\" (now under revision for Theoretical Economics) studies settings in which both the principal and agent need to privately choose actions that jointly determine output.  This kind of setting does not fall under the framework of the previous paper.  We develop several variants of a model in which linear contracts are again optimally robust in terms of the joint guarantees they provide for both parties.\n\n\nThis grant also supported a project in progress, \"Dynamic Incentives in Incompletely Specified Environments,\" which brings a concern for robustness to uncertainty to the study of repeated games - a classic modeling framework used to study dynamic interactions, in which agents can be incentivized to take actions not in their short-run interest through the promise of rewards or punishments by others in the future.  The standard framework usually assumes that the environment in which agents interact is constant over time, or if not, its evolution is fully understood in advance.  Under this assumption, there are well-developed mathematical tools for describing exactly what outcomes of interaction are possible.  This project studies the possibilities for extending these tools to settings where there is non-probabilistic uncertainty about the evolution of the environment, finding that the tools extend in a natural way when only one player is subject to dynamic incentives and a source of public randomness is available.\n\n\nThe grant also supported the writing of a chapter on contract theory, which will be part of the forthcoming group-written textbook \"Online and Matching-Based Market Design\" (eds. Federico Echenique, Nicole Immorlica, and Vijay Vazirani).  This book is targeted at an interdisciplinary audience, particularly in computer science and operations research, and will help acquaint students in these fields with the elements of the classic economic theory of incentives.\n\n\nThe grant also supported training of graduate students through collaboration or assistantship in all of the projects mentioned above, and supported some sessions of the Stanford Math Circle, aimed at acquainting technically-inclined secondary school students with ideas from the theory of incentives.\n\n\n(Note: This award was reduced in scope and duration from the initial award terms due to the original PI's (Gabriel Carroll's) relocation to a non-NSF-eligible institution.)\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/19/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew O Jackson"
