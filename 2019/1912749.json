 "awd_abstract_narration": "The semiconductor industry is undergoing a shift towards creation of value-added products and services, rather than simply focusing on advancing the state-of-the-art in integrated circuit technology, with Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) expected to play an increasingly important role in the new era. The design and development of Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems entails sophisticated Computer-Aided-Design tools, elaborate microfabrication facilities, and extensive packaging infrastructures. Such technological barriers limit the abilities of innovators and entrepreneurs to access and use MEMS technologies. This award supports research to enable a novel, cloud-based MEMS design, development and manufacturing platform that is web-accessible, low cost, expansible and interactive. If successful, this research will foster cybermanufacturing innovation by enabling a new manufacturing service infrastructure that allows a wide range of customers and entrepreneurs to prototype their Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems efficiently and at low cost, thereby directly benefitting the U.S. economy and society. This research also will lead to new curriculum in the rapidly emerging areas of cloud computing, electronics, microfabrication, and sensors. Educational, training, and outreach activities envisioned by this research will entail development of hands-on instructional material for minority and underrepresented high school students.\r\n\r\nThe CloudMEMS platform will establish a novel \"Design Anywhere, Manufacture Anywhere\" approach in the design and development of Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems via standardized processes and materials selections from leading semiconductor foundries easily made available to clients, designers, and entrepreneurs. The multi-university research team will systematically investigate process constraints in the Design-for-Manufacturing of next-generation Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems toward enabling component design and fabrication using standard semiconductor foundry processes. The team will investigate sophisticated mathematical models and scaling laws capable of handling Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems designs based on different structural materials and processes. Pertinent multi-pronged approaches for aiding Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems design will be explored by (1) Fusing commercial Computer-Aided-Design packages into a cloud server and (2) Studying Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems scaling laws for cost effective re-engineering of pre-simulated and pre-decomposed devices. The project will foster distinct design cycles for expert users and non-expert users who lack process knowledge. The CloudMEMS platform will be made accessible via Internet to bridge the cyber and manufacturing domains, thereby promoting leadership of the U.S. in cyber-driven microsystems and manufacturing.",

The design and development of MEMS entails sophisticated Computer-Aided-Design (CAD) tools, elaborate microfabrication facilities, and extensive packaging infrastructures. Such technological barriers limit the abilities of entrepreneurs and independent innovators to access MEMS technologies. On a parallel note, Cloud technologies (e.g. AWS) have recently emerged as an industry standard for sharing computing resources easily, flexibly and securely.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The overarching goal of this NSF project was therefore to address these technological barriers through the development of a novel cloud-based MEMS design, development, and manufacturing platform that is web-accessible, low cost, expansive, and collaborative. Towards this, a web-based application ?CloudMEMS? was successfully developed, tested and validated through the course of this project. Fusing commercial CAD package (i.e. COMSOL) into cloud server, CloudMEMS was specifically designed to contain features aimed at fostering a collaborative ecosystem for MEMS design and simulation as well as enabling rapid prototyping of MEMS devices. These features included: 1) A cloud-based application that transcends the institutional boundaries, allowing collaborating institutions a common, seamless web-based application for MEMS design and simulation and 2) Allowing MEMS designers to create parameterized MEMS components and models that may be shared among the collaborators. The parameterized MEMS components would allow one without substantive MEMS modelling experience to quickly perform simulation based optimization of MEMS based products before prototyping and manufacturing of devices.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project was initially executed at The University of Toledo between 2016 and 2018 where the initial web based application utilizing cloud processing power was successfully tested and validated. The platform successfully allowed users to create parameterized three dimensional parts with the ability to incorporate manufacturing constraints in the design. Further, it allowed the creators of these parts to share them with other users of the platform who could then perform customized simulations using these pre-built parts. Successful end user validation of this platform was performed at The University of Toledo campus by simulating instances where users who may lack detailed MEMS manufacturing process knowledge can easily assemble specific MEMS designs and simulate them over the new CloudMEMS platform through an easy to use user interface. To evaluate accuracy of simulations, results from direct simulations on COMSOL were compared with Cloud based simulations to ensure conformation to actual device measurements and analytical predictions. In 2018, PI Vijay K Devabhaktuni relocated to Purdue University Northwest (PNW).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On relocating to PNW, PI Devabhaktuni established contact with MEMS researcher and faculty member Dr. Venumadhav Korampally of Northern Illinois University (NIU), a school geographically close to PNW. With permission from NSF, PNW granted a subcontract to NIU. The final year of this NSF grant essentially focused on demonstrating the transferability and the adaptability of the CloudMEMS platform. Through active collaboration with NIU, CloudMEMS was successfully deployed on NIU campus working through NIU licensed simulation engine (COMSOL). Further, collaborative MEMS design and innovation practices were demonstrated by having a student from PNW utilize CloudMEMS platform hosted on NIU server to successfully run benchmark simulations. This simulation environment was monitored and facilitated by a Computer Science graduate student at NIU. Benchmark simulations were successfully demonstrated, and simulation results were validated against the simulations conducted previously at The University of Toledo. In addition to the benchmark simulations, the utility of CloudMEMS from an independent site (i.e. NIU) was demonstrated through running newer simulation examples on CloudMEMS and validating the results on locally run COMSOL software. This process established independent testing of CloudMEMS platform.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thus, our strides made in this research effort are expected to pave way to the adoption and expansion of web-based collaborative platforms in the cybermanufacturing innovation domain by enabling a new manufacturing service infrastructure that allows a wide range of customers and entrepreneurs to prototype their MEMS prototypes efficiently and at low cost, thereby directly benefitting US?s economy and society.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/01/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Vijaya Kumar&nbsp;Devabhaktuni</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1912749/1912749_10448327_1598965228131_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1912749/1912749_10448327_1598965228131_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1912749/1912749_10448327_1598965228131_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">CloudMEMS architecture</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">PI and his team</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Vijaya Kumar&nbsp;Devabhaktuni</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1912749/1912749_10448327_1598965283427_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1912749/1912749_10448327_1598965283427_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1912749/1912749_10448327_1598965283427_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Process flow for the creation and simulation of a MEMS structure</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">PI and his team</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Vijaya Kumar&nbsp;Devabhaktuni</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1912749/1912749_10448327_1598965340166_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1912749/1912749_10448327_1598965340166_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1912749/1912749_10448327_1598965340166_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">CloudMEMS interface overview & its various components including: 1.
