These students and fellows will have an opportunity meet senior researchers and industry experts and research results. They will also have an opportunity to present their own work. The conference proceedings are used to support course work and selected papers will be used to develop two special issues of BMC Bioinformatics and BMC Genomics journals.\r\n\r\nICCABS has the goal of bringing together scientists in all the three areas and hence serving as a collaboration platform. The strength of this conference lies in its ability to bring together scientists in various areas of bio and medical sciences and fostering collaborations among them. Collaborations across these domains have a record of leading to the discovery of novel techniques for solving challenging problems at the interface of computing and the biomedical sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
