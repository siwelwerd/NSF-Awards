 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM-A) Program in the Division of Chemistry is funding Professors Igor Rubtsov and Alexander Burin of Tulane University to investigate unusually rapid movement of energy in molecules, so-called \"ballistic energy transport.\" Most often energy (as heat) is transported slowly through materials through the random motion of electrons and atoms making up the material (this is called \"thermal diffusion\"). Professor Rubtsov's research group has discovered systems where energy deposited in long molecules is rapidly transferred to distant locations, not unlike a bullet or projectile. This anomalous transfer of energy may help scientists discover new materials with improved thermal transport properties. The graduate and undergraduate students working on this project are receiving training in optical science, laser spectroscopy and quantum theory. The PI and co-PI participate in a number of educational activities on their campus, including the Tulane Louis Stokes Louisiana Alliance for Minority Participation (LS-LAMP) Summer Undergraduate Research Training Program, which provides undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in science with authentic research experiences.\r\n \r\nProfessors Igor Rubtsov and Alexander Burin and their respective research groups are combining ultrafast laser spectroscopy (relaxation-assisted two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (2DIR)) with theoretical modeling to develop a better understanding of how the very rapid energy transport over molecularly-significant distances occurs. Some of the questions that these scientists hope to answer include: What are the main factors determining the speed of ballistic transport and how to increase its efficiency? How do the transport parameters, such as efficiency, speed, band selection, and cooling rate, depend on the environment and temperature? Can these transport parameters be controlled by external stimuli and how to design molecules for such control? Can the ballistic transport be efficient against the direction of thermal gradient? Among the factors affecting transport to be examined are the primary and secondary chain structure, chain architecture, the nature and energy of the source vibrational mode, and the temperature. These studies are identifying the most likely transport mechanisms and, as such, will likely suggest ways of reducing losses for ballistic energy transport and directing energy to specific targets. The ballistic transport mechanism is considered as a principal component of energy transport in molecules, especially for molecules featuring functional groups with repeating units, which are very common. These studies are helping us understanding how to use the ballistic transport and how to manipulate its outcome. Establishing the fundamental principles needed to make the process either fast and efficient or slow and inefficient could impact a broad class of problems that take center stage in nanoscience and molecular electronics. In addition to the aforementioned training and outreach activities, this project includes the the designing of a novel undergraduate course that incorporates the knowledge obtained in the program and implements an experimental exercise on 2DIR  spectroscopy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

However, we have recently demonstrated that a different regime of vibrational energy transport is possible via oligomeric chains. In this regime, a pack of energy is formed, called a vibrational wavepacket, which moves through the molecular backbone with a constant, often very high, speed. Our research team studied conditions required for initiating such regime (called ballistic regime), designed molecular systems featuring high speed and high efficiency of the ballistic energy transport, and investigated them experimentally and theoretically.</p>\n<p>Importantly, vibrational energy plays the decisive role in determining the rates of chemical reactions. The amount of vibrational energy transferred by the optical phonon wavepackets is about 10-fold larger than typical room temperature vibrational quanta, so initiating chemical reactions remotely may soon become practical using ballistic regime. Note that ballistic transport disregards thermal gradient and can occur against the gradient, transferring energy from thermally cold to hot parts. Understanding ballistic energy transport regime is also essential for the heat management in molecular electronics and sensors.</p>\n<p><strong><em>New regimes of ballistic transport initiation to yield efficient energy transporters. </em></strong>The research team proposed several mechanisms of wavepacket formation from an excited end-group vibrational mode using N<sub>3</sub>-terminated alkyl chains for the study. Note that relaxation of the excited end-group mode (N<sub>3</sub>) into local modes at the end group would not generate a wavepacket in the chain. Specific requirements for wavepacket initiation were developed (see mechanisms in Figure 1B). Mixing of the end-group states with chain states is required in mechanisms A and B. Such mixing can occur for the originally excited end-group mode (mechanism A) or to its relaxation daughters (mechanism B). A wavepacket will not be formed when such mixing is not sufficiently strong to involve several chain states. If so, an anharmonic coupling of the end-group states with the chain states (mechanism C) can lead to wavepacket formation. The study resulted in predictions that the transport mechanism and speed will change for longer chains, leading to faster and more efficient transport. The developed analysis is general and can be applied to any molecular chain and any end group used for the transport initiation.</p>\n<p>Theoretical studies of decoherence for optical phonon transport induced by anharmonic interactions revealed the significance of transverse acoustic modes. Indeed, transverse acoustic vibrations in one dimension possess smoother quadratic spectrum contrasting the linear spectrum of sound waves. Because of the difference in the spectra, transverse phonons serve as subohmic bath for the propagating optical phonons, which substantially strengthen its decoherence. Particularly this theory combined with the density matrix formalism was used to interpret temperature dependent energy transport in oligomeric chains.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Chains featuring electronic conjugation as potential energy-transport switches. </em></strong></p>\n<p>Ballistic energy transport <em>via electronically conjugated chains </em>was observed for the first time. Conjugated chains may support faster transport speeds because of enhanced interaction by the conjugation. Compounds featuring oligo(p-phenylene) chains, (Ph)<em><sub>n</sub></em>, of various lengths, decorated with carboxylic acid and nitro end groups were prepared (Fig. 2). We found that interaction between neighboring unit cells is enhanced by the conjugation between the unit cells. The extent of this conjugation is rather small for (Ph)<em><sub>n</sub></em> oligomers. Nevertheless, the (Ph)<em><sub>n</sub></em> chain features a large number of optical bands with bandwidths exceeding 50cm<sup>-1</sup> (9 bands; each supporting 18-26?/ps speed) and one band with an extremely large width of 170cm<sup>-1</sup>, supporting the speed of 86 ?/ps. Each of the bands can potentially be used for ballistic energy transport. Interestingly, electronic conjugation of the end group (COOH) and the chain resulted in high efficiency of formation of vibrational wavepackets in the chain. An extremely high transport speed of 67?9?/ps was found in (Ph)<em><sub>n</sub></em>. Moreover, the calculations revealed that the transport speed is strongly affected if the extent of conjugation between the neighboring units is changed, suggesting the way of altering the transport speed and efficiency by changing the redox state of the chain.</p>\n<p>The <strong><em>broader impact</em></strong> of this activity is derived from the central role of energy transport processes in science and engineering (e.g., transport in molecular junctions, molecular machines, and nanodevices) and the recently discovered ability of molecules to transport energy efficiently.
