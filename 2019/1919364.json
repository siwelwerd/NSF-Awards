 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for the University of Wisconsin - La Crosse (UWL), a primary undergraduate institution, to upgrade the existing ICEBall array into the La Crosse Internal conveRsion Electron Ball Array (fIREBAll) so that it has the capabilities to probe some of the most important unsolved questions in nuclear science. One of these questions was identified by the Nuclear Science Advisory Committee in 2015: what is the origin of the elements?  Other questions include exploring how theoretical models describe light nuclei, low-lying energy levels, and the various degrees of freedom in deformed nuclei. The new instrument will be a significant addition to nuclear science and the only detector array of its type in the USA. In addition, fIREBAll will provide scientists and students at primarily undergraduate institutions access to cutting-edge nuclear science facilities and will contribute to the education and training of numerous US students. This is a unique opportunity to train students in various research and development skills including using various detectors, troubleshooting, gathering and analyzing data, and the disseminating results in a collaborative environment. These skills are transferable to careers which advance the national health, welfare, and secure national defense.\r\n\r\nThe funds from this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant will create an instrument for the measurements of conversion electrons in coincidence with gamma rays, while supporting the training of multiple undergraduate students in advanced detector techniques. The upgrade includes the purchase of six new Si(Li) detectors, two anti-Compton Bizmuth Germanate (BGO) shields for two existing Germanium gamma-ray detectors. The new fIREBAll with Compton suppressed Ge detectors will be a powerful tool to unravel some of the most outstanding challenges in nuclear structure (the nature of 0+ states in deformed nuclei, testing ab-initio theoretical model predictions in light nuclei) and nuclear astrophysics (the nature of the Hoyle state and other alpha cluster components in light nuclei effecting stellar evolution). The new instrument will be a significant addition to the capabilities of the nation and will open new opportunities for students from the University of Wisconsin - La Crosse (UWL) and other primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs), including Indiana University South Bend (IUSB) and Indiana Wesleyan University (IWU).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
