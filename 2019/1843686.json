 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Division of Earth Sciences Instrumentation and Facilities Program award supports the continued development and maintenance of the Global Navigation Satellites System (GNSS At MIT) GAMIT/Global Kalman Filter (GLOBK) suite of programs, shell scripts, and documentation that continue to be used worldwide for the analysis of GNSS data for scientific studies of a wide range of problems in Earth sciences.  Support provides expert assistance to users in understanding their own data sets and analysis issues, and to continue the development of the suite to accommodate new analysis models, new generations of satellites and updated product and data formats. GAMIT/GLOBK is the sole academic developed GNSS software suite and is open source and freely distributed.  It provides an important independent check on solutions produced using alternative packages (NASA/JPLs GIPSY-OASIS, the commercial Bernese package) and provides a check on reproducibility of GNSS position solutions.  The investigators will also plan and conduct periodic technical short courses on the theory and use of the packages, both within the US and internationally, supporting student training. \r\n\r\nGAMIT/GLOBK is used worldwide by scientists and students to determine GPS/GNSS antenna positions, atmospheric signal propagation delay, earth orientation parameters, and satellite orbital parameters from GNSS observables.  GLOBK, when used in conjunction with other geodetic data such as satellite laser ranging (SLR) and very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) is used to generate derived GNSS products such as station velocities, co-seismic offsets and post seismic motions.  The software packages have thousands of users who employ it for research on crustal deformation processes, including earthquakes, volcanic activity, atmospheric water vapor tomography, ionospheric dynamics, cryosphere dynamics and even to determine soil moisture and snow pack depth, the latter relying on GNSS signal/noise ratio observations that record the effects of microwave ground reflections proximal to the GNSS antenna.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
