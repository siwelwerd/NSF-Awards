 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL), in collaboration with the National 4-H Council, proposes a project to advance effective practices for broadening participation in computing (BPC) in out-of-school-time programs by engaging computer science (CS) faculty and departments at land-grant universities (LGUs) in 4-H programs using entrepreneurial models and tools. The project is aligned with the National Science Foundation's Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorate's (CISE) effort to engage its Principal Investigators (PIs) and their academic departments in meaningful BPC activities. It will advance knowledge on developing a sustainable ecosystem for dissemination and  promotion of computational literacy among rural youth, youth from economically disadvantaged  backgrounds, girls, minorities (particularly African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and American  Indians), and youth with disabilities. The ecosystem comprises national youth organizations (e.g., 4-H),  corporations (e.g., Google, Microsoft), CS departments at LGUs, and K-12 schools. \r\n\r\nThis project will involve CISE-funded PIs and the 4-H units at four LGUs to achieve three objectives: \r\n\r\n1.\tImplement and assess a collaborative strategic planning and resource development process for  BPC that engages LGU CS departments and 4-H programs in four partner states. 4-H programs will collaborate with their local CS departments to collaboratively develop and implement a plan for BPC that builds on their specific strengths. Lessons learned will be adapted and shared as models for action for other CS departments. \r\n2.\t Expand an existing Computer Science Professional Development Toolkit by developing additional resources for supporting equity and inclusion in CS and developing computational thinking. \r\n3.\tExpand access to the developed strategic models and tools for LGU CS departments and 4-H  programs across the country. Existing communication with 4-H digital channels that reach Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)  professionals, including BPCnet.org and others, will be used to reach a wider audience.\r\n\r\nResearch questions will include:  What are the challenges and opportunities for CS departments and state 4-H programs as they create a collaborative plan of action for BPC in their state? What resources are needed to support CS departments and state 4-H programs as they create and execute this plan? and What is the impact of a blended learning model of professional development on the confidence and competence of 4-H professionals, educators, university students and volunteers who facilitate CS experiences?\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
