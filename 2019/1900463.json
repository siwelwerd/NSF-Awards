 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Michael Mirkin of CUNY Queens College and Professor Huolin Xin of the University of California-Irvine are supported by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Division of Chemistry to study two-dimensional materials, such as flat nanosheets of transition metal chalcogenides as electrocatalysts for speeding up the electrocatalytic production of hydrogen from water.  The knowledge obtained is  applicable to other important chemical reactions relevant to alternative energy production and storage technologies.  The project seeks to develop a unique microscopy technique that allows for the high-resolution imaging of the reactive site.  This imaging is conducted using two techniques: transmission electron microscopy (for atomic-scale structural information) and scanning electrochemical microscopy (for electrochemical information).  Correlating the data of the two complementary techniques provides information on the nature of the catalytic nanosheet edges, defects and atomic steps.  The information is needed to understand the catalytic activity of these materials.  The project provides training for a diverse group of students in renewable energy related science and technology, including mathematical modeling and data processing and mining.  Area middle school students are exposed to science research through hand-on experience in the investigators' laboratories. \r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of this collaborative research is to visualize and quantify active sites on two-dimensional (2D) catalyst surfaces via high-resolution (i.e., equal or less than 10 nm) reactivity mapping by scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) in combination with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) techniques.  By using very small nanoelectrode probes and significantly increasing the SECM resolution the researchers map and quantitatively measure activities of the nanosheet edges, defects and atomic steps on 2D electrocatalysts and assess the effects of phase transformations and surface functionalization.  The methodology is developed for multi-technique imaging of the same nanoscale portion of the catalytic surface to obtain spatially resolved mechanistic information about heterogeneous processes on 2D electrocatalysts.  The nature of the active sites is elucidated by correlating the SECM activity maps with atomic scale structural and bonding information obtained by STEM and spatially resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) with one-to-one correspondence.  These approaches investigate two important classes of 2D materials - transition metal dichalcogenides and MXenes. The objective of the research project is to advance the understanding of factors influencing the activity/stability of 2D electrocatalysts and to help put forward new strategies for improving these properties.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe most important outcomes of this project are the demonstration of high-resolution reactivity mapping of 2D catalysts by scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) and the development of the concept of voltage-assisted molecular catalysis.\n\nSECM was used to map the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of a NiO catalyst with an unprecedented sub-20-nm resolution and single-edge sensitivity.  This approach allowed us to locate the active sites at the NiO materials? edges.  In addition to showing the possibility of probing electrochemical signals over individual material edges, this work demonstrated that combining ultrahigh-resolution SECM, electron tomography, and ab initio calculation is a viable strategy for revealing catalytic active sites on structurally complex electrocatalysts. \n\nIn combination with structural, chemical, and electrochemical techniques, SECM was used to show that mixed transition metal nitride MXenes are more catalytically active than the single metal nitride MXene.  These experiments revealed the electrochemical activity of individual MXene flakes, corroborated the bulk hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity trend, and provided the first evidence that HER results from catalysis on the MXene basal plane.  SECM data also showed that the metal loading and processing conditions can have profound impacts on the electrochemical response of individual flakes, modulating the material from semiconducting to metallic.  High-resolution SECM was used to visualize catalytic activities of other types of electrocatalysts, including surface functionalized monolayers of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and a catalyst with Ru-Ni diatomic sites supported on N-doped porous carbon.\n\nThe rate of electron transfer (ET) between a dissolved reactant and a molecular catalyst immobilized directly on the surface of a carbon nanoelectrode was shown to be governed by combination of chemical driving force and electrostatic potential drop across the double layer.  We demonstrated that the applied voltage contributes to the driving force for ET between a molecular catalyst attached to the electrode surface and dissolved molecules.  Such reactions can be driven uphill; e.g., ferrocenium and Ru(bpy)33+ can oxidize water.  Hybrid voltage-assisted molecular catalysts are noble-metal-free and do not suffer from passivation and surface fouling, which typically affect the performance of electrocatalysts.\n\nA new methodology was developed for nanoscale SECM and experiments in which an amorphous carbon film of the TEM finder grid served as a conductive substrate support.  This setup enabled multi-technique (i.e., SECM/TEM and SECM/AFM) imaging of the same nanostructure.  The results suggest the possibility of correlating SECM activity maps with STEM images of the same nanoscale portion of the electrode surface to obtain spatially resolved mechanistic information about electrocatalytic active sites.\n\nThis project provided opportunities for multidisciplinary research to three graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow.  They were trained in electrocatalysis, nanoelectrochemistry, and scanning probe microscopies.  These students gave oral and poster presentations at national and international meetings and participated in preparation of research papers and reports.  They also performed joint research with our collaborators at UC Irvine, Cornell University, NREL, and Brookhaven National Laboratory.  One student has finished her graduate research and will have her PhD defense in the fall 2022.  The postdoctoral fellow has obtained an academic position.  A visiting student from China had been working on this project.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/02/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael Mirkin"
