 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professors Robert B. Grubbs and Surita R. Bhatia of the Department of Chemistry at Stony Brook University are developing new synthetic routes for the construction of sustainable and biodegradable polymer-based materials.  Polymers or plastics consisting of many repeating units linked with carbon-carbon bonds have benefited our society in many different ways.  Due to its light weight, durability and ability to conform to shape, plastic has helped aerospace technologies take giant steps forward over the past 50 years, including advancements in satellites, shuttles, aircraft, and missiles.  In addition, the building and construction, electronics, packaging, and transportation industries have all benefited greatly from plastic materials.  While chemists have created numerous ways to assemble carbon-carbon  units into polymers, methodologies to disassemble them one-by-one are still very rare.  This reverse process is crucial because it leads to polymer recyclability, therefore providing a green life-cycle for plastics that would otherwise accumulate in the environment.  This project addresses the molecular recycling of polymers by providing new synthetic routes for the preparation of polymeric materials with programmable degradability.  New classes of polymers that result from this work are expected to retain the physical properties of current plastics but with the added benefit of being recyclable.  This work provides training and education to undergraduate and graduate students in synthetic polymer chemistry, and collaborative research activities involving researchers from underrepresented groups at a historically Black university (Prairie View University). \r\n\r\nThis research is focused on the design and synthesis of polymers modeled on existing acrylate and methacrylate backbones with the potential for similar physical and responsive properties but with programmable degradability.  The research activities focus on the systematic investigation of the effects of initiators (alcohols and hydroxyl-terminated polymers), catalysts (triethylamines and other organic bases), and monomer structure (glyoxylate and glyoxamide monomers) on the control of the polymerization process.  The incorporation of these different polyacetal and polythioacetal blocks with other polymer blocks into block copolymers is also investigated.  The research is innovative and focuses on the properties and degradation of a class of polymers with high potential for industrial importance.  The synthesized polymers are expected to have tunable thermoresponsivity, hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity and to be susceptible to photoinduced cleavage/degradation by acid.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The development of new degradable polymers is one strategy for addressing this issue. We have investigated the synthesis and characterization of polymers prepared by controlling the polymerization of aldehyde monomers, which results in polymers with degradable backbones consisting of alternating carbon and oxygen atoms, rather than the all-carbon backbones of many non-degradable commodity polymers.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Intellectual merit</strong></p>\r\n<p>We were able to optimize the polymerization methods developed under this grant to control the preparation of polymers containing the monomer ethyl glyoxylate, including polymers with other components including biocompatible, non-toxic, and water-soluble poly(ethylene oxide) units (\"blocks\") and degradable poly(lactic acid) blocks. In collaboration with Prof. Surita Bhatia&rsquo;s group at Stony Brook University, we prepared and characterized hydrogels formed by swelling poly(ethylene oxide)/poly(ethyl glyoxylate) copolymers in water to better understand how the structure of the polymer molecules affects the physical properties (e.g., toughness and stiffness) of the gels (Figure 1).</p>\r\n<p>For applications of these copolymers, it is important to understand the degree to which the different types of polymers mix with one another. We have found that the poly(lactic acid) and poly(ethyl glyoxylate) components of copolymers do not mix with one another, despite the fact that both polymers contain ester functional groups. This type of phase separation is typical for most classes of block copolymers, but had not previously been examined for poly(ethyl glyoxylate) copolymers. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) of thin films of the copolymers clearly shows the presence of two different domains with sizes in the 10-50 nanometer range (Figure 2), and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), carried out in collaboration with Dr. Dmytro Nykypanchuk at Brookhaven National Laboratory, shows peaks consistent with phase separation at this scale (Figure 3).</p>\r\n<p>While poly(ethyl glyoxylate) is known to slowly degrade in the presence of water, our preliminary studies into accelerated hydrolysis have found that the polymers are more stable than anticipated in the presence of acid. This suggests that these polymers may be stable enough for commercial applications or as degradable components of biomedical devices.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Broader Impact</strong></p>\r\n<p>Over the course of the grant, 8 graduate students and 4 undergraduate students participated in the project. One manuscript on polymerization of glyoxylate esters was published in 2021 (Hewitt, D. R. O.; Grubbs, R. B. \"Amine-catalyzed chain polymerization of ethyl glyoxylate from alcohol and thiol initiators.\" <em>ACS Macro Letters</em> <strong>2021</strong>, <em>10</em>, 370-374. doi:10.1021/acsmacrolett.0c00865).
