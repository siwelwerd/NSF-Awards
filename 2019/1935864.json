 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will transform the fields of gastrointestinal human and animal microbiology and vastly increase our knowledge of their microbiome. Current sampling technology is limited to degraded stool samples and to invasive endoscope sampling that, in humans, cannot reach the distal small intestines. The technology developed here offers a non-invasive system for sampling gastrointestinal microbiota in their localized environment for discovery, characterization, medical research, diagnostics, and treatment never before possible. There will potentially be a new paradigm in human and animal health for microbiome research and commercial applications.  Initial application focus will be on the unmet needs of human gastroenterology and the human microbiome.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project further develops a non-invasive ingestible, non-digestible capsule used to sample digestive tract microbiome.  It is placed inside an immediate or delayed release outer capsule. When the outer capsule dissolves according to its specifications, enteric fluid and content enters the sampling capsule through its ports triggering a hydrophilic stop to release a pulling force, closing the ports, capturing the sample, holding it sealed until it completes passage through the digestive track, and recovered from the feces for analysis. The novel capsule device has a competitive advantage because it can take samples in their localized environment and it can access the restrictive areas of the small intestines. The capsule technology has the potential to be a disruptive technology for the field of gastrointestinal human and animal microbiology and the microbiome.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
