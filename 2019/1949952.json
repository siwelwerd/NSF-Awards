 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Initiation Awards provide support for junior and mid-career faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are building new research programs or redirecting and rebuilding existing research programs. It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at his home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences. The award to Tuskegee University has potential broader impact in a number of areas. The project seeks to investigate methods of mapping the electromagnetic field distribution of pico/nano/micro satellites (PNMSats) and aid in the refinement of their orbit determination and control capabilities. Undergraduate aerospace engineering students will gain research experiences by working on the project.  \r\n\r\nThe overall research goal is to develop a better understanding of the magnetic activity of PNMSats and investigate methods of modeling the magnetic map of such satellites.  A Magnet Coil Test Facility, designed around a 3-axes Helmholtz coil (HHC) cage and precision fluxgate magnetometers, will be used for carrying out the research.  The PNMSat specimens will be subject to relevant on-orbit control modes inside the HHC cage. Using the magnetometer measurements taken during the emulation of these control modes, a harmonic understanding of the magnetic activity will be investigated.  The research will aid in the refinement of the various subsystems of a PNMSat - particularly the operation of attitude determination and control systems, as well as electro-magnetically sensitive instrumentation. It will further aid in designing magnetic booms for PNMSats.  This research is a stepping stone to founding a PNMSat program at Tuskegee University and provides an opportunity for collaboration with other Historically Black Colleges and Universities.",

A significant outcome of this project is a 2-step process for mapping the magnetic field of such a compactly designed satellite. The 2-step process involves, (i) carrying out experiments in a Helmholtz cage (HHC) to obtain discrete measurements of the satellite magnetic field, and (ii) performing a Fourier analysis to extrapolate the discrete measurements into a continuous map. The magnetic maps, thus developed, facilitate an understanding of the adverse effects of satellite magnetic field on sensors, instruments. In the larger context of the development of the principal discipline of the project, one can think of this approach as a means of understanding the magnetic field of any entity, including those of planetary bodies. The magnetic maps developed using the 2-step process could assist in determining the magnetic field distribution of planetary bodies as well.</p>\n<p>The Earth's magnetic field is a significant factor, which affects seed germination and plant growth. However, this factor varies considerably in space and on the surface of planetary bodies, including Moon and Mars. The research has demonstrated that magnetic field exposure (MFE) of plants may result in changes in their physiology, growth, performance, chemical structures, etc. Through this study, we developed a detailed protocol and through macro-analysis, we observed an increased biomass, among others, in selected plant species due to an uncharacteristic MFE, representative of non Earth-like MFE.&nbsp;As we explore the frontiers of outer space and look to Moon, Mars, and exoplanets as future home, it is critical to investigate plant responses to super-weak magnetic fields (Moon&rsquo;s magnetic field is &lt;0.01 that of Earth) in non Earth-like environments. A follow-up study could be critical in quantifying the effects of MFE on plant germination, physiology, growth, and the nutrients through microanalysis such as nuclear magnetic resonance - NMR - analyses of their chemical structure. The investigation could address several outcomes, including relevance to Earth-based agriculture, insight gained on plant physiology, cellular processes, performance, and inspiration for research/outreach on Earth.</p>\n<p>Chlorella vulgaris is a commonly found eukaryotic green microalgae species that frequently appears in many natural and manmade freshwater and soil environments.
