 "awd_abstract_narration": "We will fabricate and characterize a self-powered biosensing microsystem that simultaneously generates bioelectricity and monitors glucose. This will be accomplished by using inertial power scavenging design by converting interstitial glucose into energy through the coupling of enzymes and three-dimensional nanowire arrays to potentially power ultra-low power implantable glucose monitors. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Continuous, self-powered monitoring of glucose in diabetics is quite important and will save lives. The proposed self-powered biosensing microsystem will monitor sugar levels and it embodies two key new contributions: (1) The approach eliminates the need for a potentiostat circuit and an external power source or batteries, thus leading to dramatic improvements in both speed and energy efficiency. Enzyme biofuel cells based on three-dimensional nanowire anodes fused with an energy harvesting circuit and a capacitor will provide integrated devices that will sense input potential and step up the electric power to operate a light emitting diode. (2) The work is both innovative and transformational, since it will provide an autonomous, self-powered, low-power biosensing microsystem. The biosensing microsystem will generate a drive signal in real-time and periodically power an electrical device solely by generating and accumulating electrical power in the capacitor as a result of the catalysis of glucose oxidation.\r\n\r\nBroad Impact: Both the research and educational objectives have a significant broader impact.\r\nThe research addresses a crucial problem in diabetes treatment - a self-powered biosensing microsystem for continuous monitoring of blood glucose. The combination of the two areas; nanowire enzyme-based biofuel cell and biosensing system; can usher in a new era in self-powered biosensor microsystems for glucose monitoring. Demonstration of a self-powered, stable, continuous, long-term biosensing microsystem for glucose could lead to improvement in the quality of life for people with diabetes. The educational component enriches and complements other programs at UMBC that are designed to increase minority and female participation in math and science. The exposure of these students to a real-world problem and its solution will enable them to better appreciate the contribution of scientific research.\r\n",

Various nanomaterials (free-standing nanowires, dense mesh network of multiwalled carbon nanotubes, nanoparticles, gas diffusion electrodes, etc.) and biorecognition elements (glucose oxidase, pyrroloquinoline quinone glucose dehydrogenase, laccase, and bilirubin oxidase) were explored in the design and development of the self-powered biosensing system. The two-dimensional array of nanowires exhibits large surface area that can improve enzyme loading (glucose oxidase and laccase). At physiologic glucose concentration (5 mM), an open-circuit potential of 389 mV and a maximum power density of 18.8 &mu;W/cm2 at 0.17 V was obtained. Glucose dehydrogenase and laccase immobilized on mesh-dense network of multiwalled carbon nanotubes were investigated in order to optimize the power density achieved in the biofuel cell system. With this combination, we successfully developed a self-powered biosensing system through the integration of a single biofuel cell with a two-stage electrical power amplification circuit to generate usable electrical power while sensing glucose. This work demonstrates a stable self-powering glucose biosensing system constructed by combining a charge pump IC and a capacitor functioning as a transducer with a glucose biofuel cell. The glucose biofuel cell design when applied to various concentration of glucose analyte, demonstrated linearity up to 45 mM glucose. The glucose/O2 biofuel cell is capable of generating sufficient power from normal blood glucose concentration to power a light-emitting diode (LED) via a single glucose biofuel cell.

Furthermore, a steady output DC supply of 3.2 V was obtained by interfacing a step-up DC convertor circuit to the charge pump circuit. Such a system simultaneously senses glucose and harnesses energy in the presence of various glucose concentrations. We observed a 3.7-fold increase in sensor sensitivity when compared with previous self-powered glucose biosensors. The self-powered glucose biosensor that we report remains stable over 53 days of operation.
