 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as automobiles, planes, and heavy equipment rely on complex distributed supply chains that source parts from manufacturers across the world. A fundamental problem that these systems face is ensuring the safety, security, and integrity of both the cyber components and physical parts that they receive through their supply chain. Because of the separation between the manufacturer and the consumer of the part, there are immense challenges in ensuring that physical parts arrive from the desired source and are not modified or swapped for inferior copies in transit. For example, the Aerospace Industries Association states that \"though we know counterfeit parts enter the aerospace supply chain, the time and place of their entry is unpredictable.\" If either the cyber-components or the physical parts being incorporated into these systems have been tampered with, significant cyber-physical security risk is introduced. As an example, an attacker who has a part's cyber-information can simply produce a counterfeit part, clone any physical identifiers (serial numbers, etc.), and claim that the cyber-information is for the cloned part. \r\n\r\nWhile cyber-security techniques, such as roots of trust and signing chains, exist to help ensure software integrity, there are no commensurate roots of trust and signing chains that can guarantee the source and integrity of both the cyber components and physical parts. As such, there is a risk that the algorithms and control approaches used in a supply chain will not identify the inferior performance characteristics of a counterfeit part and control its operation in an unsafe manner. The primary goal of this research is to create an integrity mechanism based on physically unclonable functions to ensure that an entire CPS is built from both trusted software and physical parts. To achieve this goal, the research investigates (i) a physical measurement technique (electro-mechanical impedance) to provide parts an unclonable physical identity and (ii) the cyber signing approaches to build chains of trust from these identities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This approach leverages the natural process variation present in AM, which results in small part-to-part differences in geometry and material properties such as mass, stiffness, and damping, which results in a different EMI response for each unique part instance.</p>\r\n<p>To enable part identification via EMI measurements, the research team created a novel damage metric &ndash; the Peak Shift method - for comparing pairs of EMI responses, with the goal of being able to differentiate between responses from the same unique part instance and responses that are from distinct part instances. &nbsp;This novel metric was first validated by comparing the impedance signatures of 27 distinct, nominally identical parts fabricated via metal (316L stainless steel) powder bed fusion AM. It was shown to be capable of identifying each unique part correctly with an F-score of 97%. This work confirms that a part&rsquo;s EMI response can function as a unique, measurable fingerprint that can be used to differentiate the part from nominally identical parts. This allows digital records to be linked to a physical part and enables the detection of counterfeit parts introduced into a supply chain.</p>\r\n<p>Second, the metric and methodology was validated against parts made by other AM processes. To investigate the intrinsic part variation across AM processes and its effects on part EMI responses, multiple sample parts were produced across multiple AM processes and materials, including metal binder jetting (BJT), polymer material extrusion (MEX), and polymer material jetting (MJT). Experimental results support the use of the EMI response as a unique identifier for AM parts, especially for PBF and BJT metal-based processes. It was relatively successful for identifying unique MJT parts.</p>\r\n<p>Despite its success, EMI measurements are sensitive to environmental conditions, which has been an ongoing challenge facing the wide adoption of this method. Temperature&#8208;induced variation in EMI signatures can be misinterpreted as damage, leading to false positives, or may mask the identity of the part, leading to authentic parts being classified as counterfeit. To combat this, the team created a new method for temperature compensation of EMI signature is developed using parametric data&#8208;driven modeling. Data&#8208;driven dynamic models are first developed by fitting EMI signatures measured at various temperatures using the Vector&#8208;Fitting algorithm. Once these models are developed, the dependence of model parameters on temperature is established. A parametric data-driven model is then derived with temperature as a parameter. This allows for EMI signatures to be calculated at any desired temperature.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, the team leveraged EMI measurements as a means for detecting residual powder in metal parts printed by the powder bed fusion AM process. Parts printed by this process require significant post-processing to remove residual powder trapped within them. Detecting residual powder is critical to ensuring part performance (e.g., it could block internal passageways). Unfortunately, detecting loose powder can be difficult as the natural process uncertainty in AM means that dimensional or mass-based powder detection is not sufficient. &nbsp;Through experimental EMI measurements and statistical analysis, the team determined that the presence of powder of powder causes a detectable change in the resonant behavior of a part, which can be measured via EMI responses using low-cost equipment. This novel method of powder detection was found to be significantly more sensitive than mass-based methods, with the EMI-based method detecting the presence of residual powder down to within one standard deviation of mass-based estimates.</p>\r\n<p>The project has established a technology, measurement protocol, and secure platform for identifying and verifying individual manufactured part identity. This technology spans both cyber-physical systems and engenders a new way to consider cybersecurity threats and best practices, in the context of manufacturing and supply chains in general. Specifically, these impacts include:&nbsp; 1) addressing unsolved issues in manufacturing networks as well as considering issues with current counterfeit mitigation techniques, and 2) a novel framework to minimize the number of counterfeit parts that pass undetected by legacy quality control.</p>\r\n<p>The project provided both graduate and undergraduate students an opportunity to learn multi-disciplinary skills in cyber-physical systems, cybersecurity, and manufacturing processes.
