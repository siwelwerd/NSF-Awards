 "awd_abstract_narration": "Composite fibers made by including graphene in polymers offer a solution to many materials challenges where low density and high performance requirements limit the current applications. Theoretical predictions of materials performance show promise for polymer nanocomposites, but experimentally manufactured fibers to date have not demonstrated the efficiency and performance levels of theoretical predictions. This EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award supports research to close the gap between theoretical predictions and attainable materials performance, through the fabrication of a novel type of composite fibers. A customized fabrication apparatus will be used to demonstrate the capability to produce hierarchical microstructures in thin fibers, and to characterize the fundamental processing-property relationships in the resulting materials. These composite fibers can be tailored for a variety of functions, including  mechanical dampening, impact resistance, heat exchange, electrical conductivity, sound absorption, drug loading/release, and water treatments. This research contributes new knowledge to the manufacturing process of composite fibers and will promote the progress of science and the development of new materials for industry and national defense needs. The research utilizes a multi-disciplinary approach, including polymer physics, mechanics, heat transfer, manufacturing, and materials science.  This integrated approach will have a positive impact on engineering education and help engage the participation of students from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is scalable manufacturing of co-axial polymer/graphene composite fibers with a uniformly distributed, continuously bridged and anisotropically oriented single-layer graphene channel. The research team will fabricate the polymer-graphite hybrid formations, perform multi-phase fiber spinning processes, and characterize the mechanical and thermal properties. Graphene exfoliations and orientations will be studied via relative movement of molecular chains on top and bottom layers of the graphene channel. The relationship among the graphene morphology evolution, the interfacial interactions, and the constraining effects and shear forces from surrounding polymer chains will be studied. This award supports the research of graphene morphologies to develop multifunctional nanocomposite fibers, filling a knowledge gap on the mechanism(s) of graphene exfoliation and orientation as a function of fiber spinning parameters and material configurations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
