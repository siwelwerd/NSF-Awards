 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most crop foods, including seeds, grains, fruit and vegetables, are the result of plant sexual reproduction.  Successful reproduction requires the interaction of parental chromosomes.  The same kind of chromosomal interactions are used by plant breeders to create new combinations of favorable traits.  The Copenhaver lab at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill together with their collaborators, the Henderson lab from the University of Cambridge previously developed a powerful technique for detecting and quantifying these chromosome interactions in a model plant species related to the mustard plant.  In this project the Copenhaver and Henderson labs will extend that technology into a commercial crop species tomato.  They will then use that technology to measure the effects of genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors on influencing the number and genomic distribution of these chromosome interactions in order to understand the fundamental biological mechanism that drive plant reproduction, as well as to identify fruitful avenues for accelerating crop breeding.  The Copenhaver and Henderson labs will publish their findings in open-access formats, and make the genetic resources they develop available to researchers and industrial colleagues.  \r\n\r\nPreviously, the Copenhaver and Henderson labs developed a visual assay for measuring meiotic recombination frequencies directly in the gametes of Arabidopsis thaliana.  They assay, called the FTL system, employs a collection of lines harboring transgenes encoding pollen-specific fluorescent proteins expressed in the quartet (qrt) mutant background, which enable tetrad analysis in a higher plant.  In this project they will translate the FTL system into Solanum lycopersicum (tomato).  Using the tomato FTL system they will test whether CRISPR/Cas9 induced mutations in recq4 helicase homologs result in genome wide hyper-recombination.  They will also test whether CRISPR/Cas9 induced mutations in genes that mediate epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and small RNA biogenesis can alter recombination frequencies around specific chromosomal domains with distinct chromatin environments such as centromeres.  Prior work in Arabidopsis, suggests that exposure to high and low temperatures can significantly modulate recombination frequencies.  The Copenhaver and Henderson lab will test whether similar environmental manipulation can alter recombination frequencies in S. lycopersicum.  The project will provide training for two postdoctoral fellows as well as independent research experiences for undergraduates in both the Copenhaver and Henderson lab.  The research findings will be published in open-access formats, and all genetic resources will be made available to both research and industrial colleagues.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSexually reproducing organisms, including plants, have a specialized cell division process that generates gametes (sperm and eggs) that are used during fertilization to produce the next generation.  During that cell division chromosomes physically interact and exchange segments of DNA in a process called recombination.  Recombination is critical because it ensures that daughter cells receive balanced complements of chromosomes, but it also creates new genetic combinations that result in different traits in progeny.  When errors occur in the molecular processes that drive recombination it can result in fertility defects, sterility and chromosomal abnormalities.  Conversely, through an understanding of those molecular processes, aspects of recombination can be engineered to be beneficial to plant and animal breeding programs in agriculture and biotechnology settings.  Our project used a model plant called Arabidopsis thaliana (a weedy relative of mustard) as a rapid discovery testing platform to develop tools that allow recombination to be measured in a low-cost, high-throughput manner, and to discover genes that influence the regulation of recombination.  We then took those tools and transferred them into a commercially important crops species tomato.  Through this work we have gained important insights in the molecular mechanics of a fundamental biological process, and demonstrated that discoveries and tools made in model laboratory species can be rapidly transferred to species that potentially directly benefit society.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/11/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gregory P Copenhaver"
