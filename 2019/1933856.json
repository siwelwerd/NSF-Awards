 "awd_abstract_narration": "The US infrastructure and productivity in scientific research remains unparalleled and is the envy of the world.  However, over the past 20 years, the United States has developed a growing negative trade imbalance in high-technology manufactured goods.  This gap inhibits both the growth of the economy and the rate of innovation, since it is difficult to innovate the next-generation of products when the current generation is not produced domestically.  A skilled manufacturing workforce is a prerequisite for successful global competition, but the US has lost its focus on preparing the technical workforce in recent decades.  New frameworks, pathways and partnerships for producing appropriately skilled workers are needed to protect America's economy and security.  Industry, academia, local economic development agencies, other non-governmental agencies, technical societies and federal agencies all have programs to address these problems, which are widely recognized.  There is a strong need to coordinate these stakeholders to develop evidence-based, actionable and replicable programs to train the next generation of manufacturing workers.  \r\n\r\nThe Manufacturing USA Institutes represent the largest investment in manufacturing technology development and workforce development in a generation. They are possibly the best leaders and conveners to set frameworks and programs for next-generation career technical education.  They are unique in that each is part of a national network that includes academic, federal and other stakeholders, while embedded in and highly-connected to the local economies in which they are located.  This creates a powerful opportunity to implement programs that serve local needs, while leveraging a national network of resources.  The workshop will bring together a team of experts to plan a series of workshops.  The planning team includes Manufacturing USA workforce directors, regional economic development advocates and academics who will define a strategy that positions the Institutes to be leaders and catalysts for a revitalized program for holistic workforce development ranging from K-12 education to professional development for incumbent workers. This overall program will close the gap between scientific discovery and impact on the US economy, including better jobs for workers.  The first workshop is scheduled for May 16-17 in Columbus, Ohio on the campus of The Ohio State University.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project is designed to design actionable programs to increase the size, quality and diversity of the United States? technical workforce to help the United States regain a leadership role in advanced manufacturing.  While the U.S. is a leader in research and development, many factors are responsible for it lagging in advanced manufacturing, one of these is a technical workforce that is too small, insufficiently skilled and aging.  A robust and innovative advanced manufacturing sector is essential for economic and military security.  \n\nA uniquely qualified team of experts representing industry, federal agencies (Department of Education, Department of Defense and NSF) and other experts was brought together to address the questions of how the Manufacturing USA Institutes could lead national career technical education and workforce development.  The objective was to model how the Institutes, when acting as regional economic assets, assume responsibility for convening all the necessary stakeholders, driving an understanding of manufacturers? competency needs, and designing educational and training pathways for individuals to attain those competencies.  The ultimate project will disseminate a new vision for CTE, which may include new strategies for educational delivery and may have the Institute network at its core. \n\nSubordinate questions that were considered were:\n\nHow can the institutes, with their limited resources help pull together regional actors to assure that CTE is, in fact, rethought to meet the needs in advanced manufacturing?\nHow can the institutes help establish a trusted intermediary to facilitate the many relationships needed between industry, research, and educational institutions at all levels?\nHow can the institutes rally the education and workforce development infrastructure to attend to each of the critical elements in an effective career pathway system, e.g., credentials and testing, teacher training and professional development, curricular development and modularity?\n\n\nThe product of the initial workshop held at The Ohio State University was a position paper, Moving from Programs to Strategies Through CTE. which was provided to national thought leaders, particularly those at the Institutes, and these ideas were expanded upon at a subsequent workshop with several Manufacturing USA Institute Education and Workforce Directors at BioFabUSA in November 2019.  The net result of this work has been the development of a plan of action to develop a workforce training program to be executed within the Institutes in coming months.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/15/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Glenn S Daehn"
