 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Initiation Awards provide support for junior and mid-career faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are building new research programs or redirecting and rebuilding existing programs. It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at the home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences. The award to Xavier University of Louisiana seeks to synthesize and characterize solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) phosphonium ionene in lithium-ion batteries as an alternative source of energy. Additionally, the project will provide research training to a diverse population of undergraduate students in the field of polymer science. \r\n\r\nSolid polymer electrolyte (SPE) membranes have the potential to improve the safety of lithium ion batteries by eliminating the potential for catastrophic battery failure due to lithium dendrite formation in solvent-based electrolyte formulations. Because they act as both the electrode separator and the lithium ion transport medium, SPEs have the potential to enhance lithium ion transport leading to extended lifetimes of lithium ion electrochemical cells. The overarching goal of this proposed research is to develop new polyelectrolyte SPEs for lithium ion batteries that are based on phosphonium ionenes. The PI intends to employ phosphonium ionenes in lithium ion batteries for the first time and directly study the impact of localized segmental motion on lithium ion transport through SPEs. This will be achieved by synthesizing and characterizing a library of phosphonium ionenes and segmented phosphonium ionenes with variable charge density distribution and chain flexibility. The outcomes will contribute to the overall state-of-knowledge in the field by providing essential data towards understanding the role of polyelectrolyte charge density and polymer chain segmental motion on lithium ion transport in all-solid-state batteries. Further, an essential educational impact of this work includes engaging undergraduate students who are historically underrepresented in the field of polymer chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
