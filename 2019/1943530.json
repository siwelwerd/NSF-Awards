 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project launches crucial exploratory research and development activities to (1) birth a Community of Practice of K-12 CS teachers in the US centered on a shared need for quality assessments and building CS teachers' assessment capabilities and (2) lay the foundation for a sustainable technology hub (created for and by teachers along with researchers and technologists) of rich, innovative assessments organized by CS standards, grade, concepts, curriculum, and other relevant criteria for intuitive use by teachers of all experience levels. \r\n\r\nThe project will be carried out by an interdisciplinary leadership team from Looking Glass Ventures, LLC (creator of the National Science Foundation funded assessment authoring and delivery platform \"Edfinity\") and Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA), in collaboration with K-12 CS teachers, the CSForAll community, and experts in the field (as advisors). Key activities include: (a) bringing together teacher experts to aggregate, create, taxonomize CS assessments; (b) creating a classroom assessment training module for use in teacher training and workshops; (c) planning and conducting multiple teacher workshops co-located at conferences and other venues where the K-12 CS community convenes; and (d) conducting research on the development of a community of practice and classroom use of CS assessments on Edfinity. The research and development activities will be guided by the following questions: \r\n\r\n(RQ1) To what extent does the Edfinity platform and its features support development of an assessments hub of rich formative and summative CS assessment that covers CS standards, grade levels, and topics, and can be created and used by teachers for sharing and classroom teaching? \r\n\r\n(RQ2) What is the value of the workshops and the assessments hub for teacher community engagement and for supporting shifts in teachers' vision for, and participation in, an assessment-driven community of practice of CS teachers? \r\n\r\n(RQ3) (a) To what extent does the use of the assessments hub and the classroom assessment training help teachers' confidence around, and understanding of, formative assessments of CS? (b) How do teachers' classroom practices change with the use of formative assessments? (c) How does the use of formative assessments in the hub help teachers better track student understanding and their ability to get timely feedback about students?\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

FCAT is designed to deepen teachers' understanding of how to adapt and use formative assessment in K-12 CS classrooms. In this multi-part series, we present a synthesis of research and many examples, plus interactive activities to practice evaluating, adapting, and responding to assessment items. Examples cover content related to algorithms and programming, with examples across grades 3-12. We also created supporting community resources covering granular learning goals and a misconceptions corpus for introductory programming topics. Teacher feedback to the workshops was overwhelmingly positive and indicated that FCAT filled a much-needed gap.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Dissemination &amp; Outreach to Teachers. </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">An early blueprint of the approach in this project was articulated as a Framework for Formative Assessments for K-12 CS that was presented as a paper at SIGCSE 2021 and at the Raspberry Pi Foundation CS education seminars. We also presented our work on innovative assessments design in Edfinity st SIGCSE 2022. Besides the FCAT module pilots, we conducted online workshops alongside SIGCSE (2020), and CSTA (2020, 2021), and presentations at the CSTA Chapter Leaders Summit (2021, 2022).&nbsp; Through these outreach activities we directly reached about 700 teachers and and through the ~100 CSTA chapter leaders we reached thousands of CS teachers in the US</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Covid-19 Impact. </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The work of this project was conducted in 2020, 2021, and 2022. Needless to say, teacher availability and engagement was a big issue during these years due to Covid-19 disruptions and challenges. Given these constraints, we believe the project managed to accomplish its proposed goals, although engagement with the teacher community might have likely been higher had it not been for

  "por_txt_cntn": "This CSForAll:RPP EAGER effort led by Looking Glass Ventures (Shuchi Grover, PI, Shivram Venkatasubramaniam, Co-PI) and CSTA (Bryan Twarek PI) focused on assessment of and for student learning-- building capacity (in terms of infrastructure and teacher preparation) to provide K-12 CS teachers with the knowledge and resources needed to measure student learning of CS (especially programming) with a focus on improving learning outcomes. In order to address the crucial need for quality formative assessments for classroom feedback to improve classroom teaching and learning of CS, we aimed to:\n\nCreate a rich repository of assessments for and by teachers on Edfinity.com, an NSF-funded technology-rich platform for assessing learning, and examine its use by teachers.  \nBuild capacity and support CS teachers in using formative assessment through the design and implementation of a multi-session assessment literacy-focused teacher PD \"Formative Classroom Assessment for Teachers (FCAT)\".     \n\nOver the course of the project the CSAssessmentsHub was created and seeded. \n\nIt includes over 1200 items in the \"K-12 CS repository\" that were added to Edfinity by teachers who participated in the project.  \nMany researchers, teachers, and curriculum providers (such as Code.org, MobileCSP, Beauty &amp; Joy of Computing, UTeachCS) contributed their items to this effort.  \nThese items are organized by a robust taxonomy that was created and iterated upon with the help of our teacher partners for intuitive organization by CSTA standards, curricula, grade level, CS topics, and other relevant criteria (such as those for AP CSP and AP CSA).  \nThere are free format tags that can be added to each problem such as the programming language in which the problem is coded, the curriculum it maps to, etc. \nThe search and discovery capabilities in Edfinity for the CSAssessmentsHub were enhanced to search on these tags as well. \nEdfinity.com innovated to create several various new problem types that are inspired by K-12 CS education research. Thare new types are engaging, interactive, and intuitive compared to the usual multiple choice and multiple select types.   \nSequence - to support Parson's problems \nHotspot interaction - to support items that include responses corresponding to part of an image (like code snapshots) \nPoint &amp; Click - a variation of the Hotspot type \nMatching Column - to support Code.org courses that embed matching column formative assessments \nCode Correctness - supporting Python unit-test items \nLabel image - to support subgoal-labeling type problems \n\nWe also created master courses for AP CS A, and generic high school and middle school topics covering the typical topics for those grade levels.  \n\nThree teachers each in years 2 and 3 of the project used Edfinity and provided feedback on their experiences. About 300 students in all were involved in the trial use of Edfinity in secondary grades. Teacher feedback was largely positive but there also provided suggestions on how to improve the CSAssessmentsHub both in terms of content and user experience. \nIn all, about 15 teachers were engaged as \"teacher partners\" and \"teacher experts\" on this project for building out the CS taxonomy, seeding the assessments hub, dissemination activities, and participation in classroom research.  \n \nAnother noteworthy accomplishment was the creation and piloting of a first-of-its kind Formative Classroom Assessment for Teachers (FCAT) \"PD-in-a-Box\" that we have made freely available on the project website https://csassess.org. FCAT is designed to deepen teachers' understanding of how to adapt and use formative assessment in K-12 CS classrooms. In this multi-part series, we present a synthesis of research and many examples, plus interactive activities to practice evaluating, adapting, and responding to assessment items. Examples cover content related to algorithms and programming, with examples across grades 3-12. We also created supporting community resources covering granular learning goals and a misconceptions corpus for introductory programming topics. Teacher feedback to the workshops was overwhelmingly positive and indicated that FCAT filled a much-needed gap.\n \nDissemination &amp; Outreach to Teachers. An early blueprint of the approach in this project was articulated as a Framework for Formative Assessments for K-12 CS that was presented as a paper at SIGCSE 2021 and at the Raspberry Pi Foundation CS education seminars. We also presented our work on innovative assessments design in Edfinity st SIGCSE 2022. Besides the FCAT module pilots, we conducted online workshops alongside SIGCSE (2020), and CSTA (2020, 2021), and presentations at the CSTA Chapter Leaders Summit (2021, 2022).  Through these outreach activities we directly reached about 700 teachers and and through the ~100 CSTA chapter leaders we reached thousands of CS teachers in the US\n\n \n\nCovid-19 Impact. The work of this project was conducted in 2020, 2021, and 2022. Needless to say, teacher availability and engagement was a big issue during these years due to Covid-19 disruptions and challenges. Given these constraints, we believe the project managed to accomplish its proposed goals, although engagement with the teacher community might have likely been higher had it not been for Covid.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/20/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Shuchi Grover"
