 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum computers have emerged quickly and quantum supremacy is around the corner. The quantum hardware is getting better but quantum software is lacking behind. We need the same kinds of software tools that enable quick and reliable programming of traditional computers. Indeed, for quantum computing to be successful, we need an entire software stack of programming languages, compilers, and verification tools. This award is made to hire a faculty member who will spearhead multi-disciplinary research on building such a software stack for quantum computing.\r\n\r\nThe UCLA Computer Science department includes three research groups that each will contribute to the effort spearheaded by the new faculty member. The first group is focused on cryptography and machine learning, the second on software systems, and the third on design automation and customization. These areas will be key to building a software stack for quantum computing. The goal is to integrate the new faculty member into the department in a way that interfaces naturally with all three groups. The broader context at UCLA is the Center for Quantum Science and Engineering which is the focal point for research and education in quantum science. The new faculty member will teach three courses on quantum computing annually.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
