 "awd_abstract_narration": "Edge computing provides opportunities to process data closer to its sources, on computing elements embedded in the data network path. It can be transformative for many important classes of latency-sensitive and data-intensive applications, such as Smart City, autonomous systems and transportation, augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), visual analytics, etc. However, realizing the potential benefit of edge computing is not trivial, because it relies on the ability to make timely decisions across diverse resources and services, disaggregated across many siloed providers, and governed by dynamically changing operating conditions. For applications seeking benefits from edge computing, this presents challenges in obtaining the right set of available resources. For stakeholders contributing resources to edge computing, this presents challenges in maintaining desired degree of control over their resources. To address this problem, this project develops a new Decentralized Edge Exchange that builds on a new system-level abstraction, called connected namespaces, to enable dynamic, fine-grained, and cross-stakeholder resource orchestrations in edge computing. Importantly, the exchange natively integrates use of tailored cryptographic techniques, namely, multi-party computation (MPC), to achieve full privacy while meeting all the real-time performance requirements of the complete system. \r\n \r\nThe technologies developed in this project permit edge computing applications to utilize the best available edge resources, even when those are fragmented across and owned by multiple parties, while still providing each stakeholder with controls regarding their resource use and sharing policies. The ability to deliver on performance without sacrificing confidentiality and controls removes critical concerns about edge computing, which otherwise hamper its adoption. As a result, this research presents a path for future developments in the new edge infrastructure tier, support for important classes of emerging applications, new execution platforms comprising novel hardware and software technologies for the edge, and catalyzes the adoption of edge computing as a new source of revenue streams and economic growth.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
