 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to identify, explore, render rigorous, and validate one piece of the solution to the puzzle \"how does the brain work?\" - one of the truly fundamental and most challenging frontiers in all of science. Computation in the brain will be approached at an intermediate level of scale, far larger than that of individual neurons and synapses yet significantly smaller than that of the whole brain. The core hypothesis is that \"assemblies,\" large and highly interconnected sets of neurons, are the engine of brain computation. Studying computation at this level is crucial for understanding higher cognitive functions, especially in humans, such as reasoning, planning, and language; and this formulation of brain computation is particularly amenable to the methodology and point of view of the theory of computation, and will further its reach. This project is quintessentially interdisciplinary, and will provide multi-faceted training to graduate and undergraduate students in Computer Science Theory, Machine Learning, and Cognitive Neuroscience and Psychology. It will develop interdisciplinary graduate courses in this particular scientific interface. The results of the project will be disseminated broadly via conferences and journals in all these disciplines, but also in colloquia and public lectures, while students of a great variety of backgrounds will participate in a cutting-edge research experience.\r\n \r\nAssemblies can be the basis of a powerful computational system involving a repertoire of operations including project, associate, and merge. These operations can be shown, through theorems and simulations, to be plausible (that is, they can be \"compiled down\" to the level of neurons and synapses) and useful (in the sense that they can help explain extant experimental results). The project will pursue this assembly hypothesis through: (1) expanding our modeling and our mathematical techniques of analysis for the study of assembly computation; (2) developing more accurate and efficient simulation methodology; (3) embarking on a multi-pronged exploration of the computational power of assemblies in novel modalities beyond formal computation, in particular (a) probabilistic and dynamical systems-like computation through pattern completion and (b) learning and prediction; (4) mathematical modeling and algorithmic investigation of the ways in which the dynamics and biases of synaptic connectivity, as well as assembly overlap, affect the various modes of brain computation; and, importantly, (5) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments, and the analysis of the results of these experiments and extant electrocorticography (ECoG) data through novel algorithmic and machine learning techniques for the purpose of identifying evidence of assembly computation in the human brain.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOne of the major difficulties currently facing the study of the brain is the immense gap between the two predominant scientific views of the brain, namely cognitive neuroscience (which mainly studies high cognitive functions such as language and planning), and experimental neuroscience (which mainly focuses on the workings of neurons, synapses, and their circuits).  This scientific challenge is often called \"the bridging problem\".  The purpose of this project was to address the bridging problem by articulating a computational theory of the brain.  This theory should be firmly rooted in current understanding in experimental neuroscience and capable of implementing cognitive phenomena such as language and planning.  A second goal was to validate this computational theory through EEG experiments on human subjects. \n\nDuring the three years of this project, researchers in the project's team have articulated such a computational theory, and published their findings in a 2020 PNAS article titled \"Computation by assemblies of neurons\".  The theory builds on work by neuroscientists over the past two decades identifying in the mammal brain assemblies of neurons.  Assemblies are large and densely populations of neurons in a brain area whose near-simultaneous spiking is tantamount of the subject thinking of an object, concept, person, word, episode, etc.  Our work equips assemblies with operations, creating the Assembly Calculus, a complete computational system.  Much of our work is about providing convincing evidence that (1) assemblies and their behaviors are simulated by biologically plausible neurons ans synapses, and (2) that assemblies and their operations can effect higher cognitive functions such as language, two research fronts which we collectively call \"the assembly hypothesis.\"  For goal (1), we have defined a formal model of the brain, compatible with the basic tenets of Neuroscience, and we have proved mathematically and through simulations that assemblies are an emergent attractor of the dynamical system described by the model, and that the operations of the Assembly Calculus indeed function as specified.  For (2), we have implemented in our model several nontrivial aspects of cognition.  We have shown that assemblies are capable of learning aspects of the world through few-shot training.  We have constructed a system implemented by the Assembly Calculus for solving planning problems in the classical Blocks World setting, where piles of blocks are presented, and the subject is asked to rearrange the blocks into a target configuration of piles.  Finally, we have created a biologically plausible paresr of English, consisting exclusively of a dynamical system of neurons and synapses, and correctly computing (through retrievable side-effects) the correct parse tree of a great variety of reasonably complicated input sentences, under the assumption that the input of an individual word results in the activation of the corresponding word assembly in the subject's lexicon brain area, \n\nRegarding the other part of the project's scope, namely the testing of the assembly hypothesis by EEG experiments on human subjects, this aspect of our work was ineditably delayed by the pandemic, and is taking place now during a year-long extension of the part of the project led by the CUNY coPIs.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/13/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christos Papadimitriou"
