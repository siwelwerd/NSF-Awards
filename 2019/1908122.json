 "awd_abstract_narration": "Black holes are the best laboratories for studying gravity.  In the center of our galaxy, the Milky Way, lies a massive black hole that weighs four million times the mass of our Sun.  The spacetime around this black hole is curved by its mass and twisted by its rotation.  This project aims to study the deformed spacetime around the Milky Way's central black hole by monitoring the motions of special types of stars orbiting the black hole.  These peculiar stars emit bright radio-frequency lasers (called masers) that radio telescopes can observe and measure very precisely.  Radio telescopes in Chile and New Mexico will track the motions of these maser stars in three dimensions and map out the spacetime around our nearest massive black hole.  The main goals of this project are to study gravity in the center of our galaxy, to promote science education at all levels, and to make this science publicly accessible.  \r\n\r\nThe investigators measure the positions, velocities, and accelerations of stars in the central few light years of the Milky Way, as they react to the gravitational field of the supermassive black hole (SMBH), stars, and stellar remnants in the Galactic Center.  This is done through Doppler tracking of stellar atmosphere silicon monoxide (SiO) masers using the NSF's Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and the Very Large Array.  With a series of observations, the investigators provide a reference frame for infrared observations of stars orbiting the SMBH and probe the dark stellar remnant population.  By tracking these stars, the investigators can measure the spin and mass of the central black hole and test the equivalence principle, the \"no-hair\" theorem of black holes, and frame-dragging. \r\n\r\nThis program will train new scientists and create synergy between theoretical and observational studies of gravity.  The investigators will bring the research into the classroom and the public domain.  Undergraduate and graduate students will be directly involved in the research and in outreach to traditionally under-represented groups in STEM fields, including minorities, women, first-generation college students, and rural communities.  Animated theoretical and observational visualization of the motions of stars close to a massive black hole will be developed for the Science on a Sphere (SOS) program and distributed to the roughly 150 SOS installations worldwide. The investigators will adapt the visualizations for digital planetarium presentation, using Colorado's Fiske Planetarium as a development testbed, and distribute them to all digital facilities for maximum impact.  This project will enable communication of the broad ideas of gravity, relativity and black holes to the public and to K-12 schools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
