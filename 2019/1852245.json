 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the University of Toledo, in Toledo, OH, will support the training of 30 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2019- 2021. Research is conducted at the University of Toledo's Lake Erie Center, Main Campus, Health Sciences Campus, and adjacent field sites.  Students will address complex challenges at the land-lake interface to understand how natural resource use impacts biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and public health, with the goal of advancing environmental sustainability.  Students will be paired with faculty and graduate student mentors from the Departments of Environmental Sciences, Geography and Planning, Public Health, or Engineering, and will design and conduct independent research projects in ecology, limnology, remote sensing, or engineering.  Field trips will introduce students to the diverse habitats and ecological challenges facing Lake Erie, and students will receive training in research ethics, experimental delesign, data analysis, writing scientific papers, and applying to graduate school.  Students will write a final report and present their research at a public poster gala. This program targets minority applicants, women, veterans, and first-generation college students.  The PI and co-PI will evaluate applicants based on academic excellence, letter of reference, and demonstrated interest in environmental issues, and will match REU fellows with an appropriate faculty mentor based on students' indicated preference for research areas.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. \r\n\r\nA common web-based assessment tool used by all REU Site programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program, including an online application, is available by visiting http://www.utoledo.edu/nsm/lec/REU/main.html, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Jeanine Refsnider at jeanine.refsnider@utoledo.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Kevin Czajkowski at kevin.czajkowski@utoledo.edu).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

of at least one professor and a graduate student or post-doctoral mentor.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;principal discipline of our REU Program is environmental science, particularly regarding water quality issues in Lake Erie, which include harmful algal blooms, invasive species, and degradation of aquatic and adjacent terrestrial habitats.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our REU Program is multi-disciplinary and engaged faculty from the Departments of Environmental Sciences, Geography and Planning, Civil and Environmental Engineering, and Occupational and Public Health.&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this multi-disciplinary approach, our program gives REU Fellows a taste of the different disciplines associated with the Lake Erie land-lake interface.&nbsp;&nbsp;REU Fellows in our program contributed to our understanding of how farming practices can reduce the impacts of harmful algal blooms on wildlife and human health, developed tools we can use to predict and follow the formation of harmful algal blooms, tested new methods of tracking both native and invasive species in Lake Erie, tested solutions for reducing runoff into waterways that contribute to harmful algal blooms and other water quality issues, modeled soil processes and their influence on coastal ecosystem wetland functioning, and made recommendations regarding what policy makers could do to solve these environmental problems.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Over the course of three years, we recruited 30 highly talented and diverse&nbsp;REU Fellows&nbsp;consisting of 23 women (77%), ten first-generation college students (33%), one non-traditional college student (3%), and 14 students from under-represented minority groups (46%; including African-American, Hispanic, and Pacific Island/Native Hawaiian students). &nbsp;All but one of the REU fellows were from institutions outside the University of Toledo.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our REU Fellows were placed in a variety&nbsp;of research laboratories and given the opportunity to learn research skills with their peers and mentoring groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;During the period of this REU Award, our REU Fellows have been co-authors on seven peer-reviewed publications and seven juried conference presentations.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there have been 17 presentations with REU Fellows as co-authors at research symposia or task force meetings, 13 of which had the REU Fellows as the presenting author.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our REU Fellows have contributed significantly to the public outreach activities of the University of Toledo?s Lake Erie Center.&nbsp;&nbsp;Through their research, they engaged with local and state agencies, farmers, and land managers.&nbsp;&nbsp;They also presented their research to the public through the final poster gala held annually at the Lake Erie Center, and several REU Fellows presented their ongoing research to representatives from federal funding agencies during their summer research.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, following the end of the summer program, many of our REU Fellows presented their research to peers and other scientists at their home institutions and at national professional conferences.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast
