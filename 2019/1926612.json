 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cell metabolites are small molecules used or produced by cells and are direct indicators of the cellular state, function, and health. Metabolomic analyses is the characterization of cellular metabolites, and it is key to our understanding of cell function. Current metabolomic methods include mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance, techniques which require large, expensive instruments and long times for analysis. Here, an alternative approach is to use integrated optical sensing devices to detect the chemical fingerprints of metabolic changes within cells on the time scale of minutes. These devices will fingerprint bacterial metabolites involved in stress responses-a basic component of bacterial survival in dynamic conditions. As part of this work, scientific questions about the relationship between the molecular scale architecture of optical sensors and the ability to differentiate metabolite response in the resulting data will be answered. The demonstration and characterization of this sensing platform will also involve the rapid collection of large data sets and the application of automated big data analysis software to interpret complex sensor signals. Results from these studies will inform understanding of bacterial behavior in diverse habitats ranging from medical infections and industrial contamination to probiotics in human health and agriculture, and microbial interactions influencing nutrient cycling in the environment. The principal investigators and students will engage in an annual two-week summer outreach program for a diverse group of high school students - ASPIRE: Access Student Program to Inspire, Recruit, and Enrich. Graduate, undergraduate and high school students will learn how to define, analyze and solve research problems and communicate results that focus on the importance of metabolomics in health and the environment and the importance of technology innovation. \r\n\r\nPractical nanophotonic sensing platforms will provide a new lens for examining dynamic biological function. Control of surface-enhanced Raman scattering sensor architectures and surface chemistry will be investigated to design sensitive receptors that both enable the rapid collection of large data sets and differentiation of metabolite fingerprints in complex biological media.  Measurements of phonon-plasmon coupling will inform of chemical interactions between functionalized sensor surfaces and metabolites of interest.  Machine learning algorithms will be further developed that are best suited to accurately analyze the large volume of vibrational spectra generated as part of these studies. Libraries of microbial metabolic fingerprints and methods for analysis of spectral information will be disseminated. The fundamental studies of nanophotonic device architecture, nanoparticle surface chemistry, and machine learning analysis of complex Raman spectra will then be utilized for the detection of metabolic fingerprints associated with stress response in polymicrobial bacterial communities. Metabolic changes associated with bacterial stress responses to antimicrobials and inter-species interactions will be measured to develop new methods to understand how to control, nurture, and mitigate various microbe-host interactions-a key application area of the investigated sensing technologies.  High throughput detection of the bacterial stress response is important for screening antimicrobial treatments for bacterial contamination in medical and industrial settings. Similarly, metabolic markers of bacterial stress can be used as indicators of the presence of chemicals of interest in the environment, such as heavy metals or toxic organic compounds. In both cases, the ability to quickly and accurately detect stress-induced metabolic changes in bacteria is a critical technological challenge uniquely addressed by this nanophotonic sensing platform.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Metabolic responses of environmental changes are fast and reliable metrics of numerous types of stresses such as susceptibility to antibiotics, the presence of toxicants in the environment, and cell viability in variable culture environments. The composition and dynamics of metabolic reactants and products within the cell respond to stresses on the order of minutes, while the timescales for alterations in the concentrations and content of cellular biomolecules &ndash; DNA, RNA, and proteins &ndash; typically occur on the scale of hours. Consequently, metabolomic analyses are paramount to understanding microbial stress response. In the project period, the investigators have developed low-cost, nanophotonic sensors capable of rapid and sensitive detection of spectral features of microbial metabolites in response to antibiotics and environmental pollutants.&nbsp; Machine learning algorithms were also developed to decode the complex spectral data for automated analysis. <strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The integration of nanophotonic sensors with machine learning analyses has yielded the ability to differentiate susceptibility from resistance to antibiotics of microbial pathogens on the time scale of several minutes with greater than 99% accuracy to provide new tools for Antibiotic Stewardship guidelines set by the Center Disease Control and Prevention to address the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. In addition, detection of antibiotics in wastewater was also demonstrated with the integrated system to assess efficacy of removal in treatment processes, which is important to reduce the proliferation of antibiotic resistant microbes in water systems. The team has also detected heavy metal toxicants, chromium and arsenic, and quantified at concentrations thousands of times lower than the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s maximum contaminant levels. Sensing contaminants in water will support sustained efforts for water security as wide adoption of nontraditional water sources such as recycled that may contain a variety of metal contaminants requiring new treatment protocols. Overall, the fundamental scientific understanding and resultant technology developed in the award period provides a foundation for next generation sensors for healthcare and environmental monitoring.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/04/2024<br>\nModified by: Regina&nbsp;Ragan</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1926612/1926612_10622219_1704355205345_AST2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1926612/1926612_10622219_1704355205345_AST2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Nanophotonic Antibiotic Susceptibility Test\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1926612/1926612_10622219_1704355205345_AST2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Nanophotonic Antibiotic Susceptibility Test\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Example of optical spectrum (top) that is encoded in latent space using an artificial neural network architecture and then decoded to determine susceptibility or resistance to antibiotics (bottom); the control group has not been exposed to antibiotics (lighter/darker colors correspond to 0.5/2 hr).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Regina Ragan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Regina&nbsp;Ragan\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Nanophotonic Antibiotic Susceptibility Test</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1926612/1926612_10622219_1704355279732_Untitled--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1926612/1926612_10622219_1704355279732_Untitled--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"AI Analysis of Whole Cell Sensors for detection of Water Pollutants\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1926612/1926612_10622219_1704355279732_Untitled--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"AI Analysis of Whole Cell Sensors for detection of Water Pollutants\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">b.
