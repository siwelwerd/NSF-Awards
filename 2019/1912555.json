 "awd_abstract_narration": "Some of the most sensitive probes scientists have for learning about the universe are in fact single atoms.  To access this sensitivity, charged atoms (ions) are individually isolated in vacuum chambers, cooled to nearly absolute zero by lasers, and levitated in electromagnetic fields known as ion traps.  Ytterbium ions, arguably the most popular for this type of science, can store energy for years in a unique (and poorly understood) \"metastable\" excited state.  Rare atomic effects have been predicted to exist in this metastable state that should make it particularly good for building atomic clocks and seeing the shape of the atom's tiny nucleus.  This program is experimentally studying these effects for the first time to gain insight into the high precision measurement capabilities offered by this unusual state.\r\n\r\nThis program seeks to observe and study two unusual features that have been predicted to exist in the low-lying 2F7/2 state of the relatively unexplored (I=5/2) ytterbium-173 isotope.  First, hyperfine-induced state mixing 173Yb+ has been theoretically predicted to reduce the lifetime of four of the six hyperfine levels of the 2F7/2 state by approximately two orders of magnitude  (as compared to 171Yb+) to the experimentally-desirable level of a few days.  The group is measuring this effect for each affected hyperfine state to determine how large the corresponding reduction in ac Stark shift systematic error will be when this system is used in place of the current 171 isotope as a clock.  Second, the group is demonstrating a scheme to measure the (currently unknown) hyperfine structure in the 2F7/2 state of 173Yb+. The large spin of both the electronic state and the nucleus allows the possibility that this \"electron microscope for the nucleus\" will show signatures of its electromagnetic multipole moments, including the nuclear magnetic octupole, electric hexadecapole, and possibly even the magnetic 32-pole moment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We have developed and demonstrated means for direct laser cooling of these single atoms to fractions of a degree above absolute zero, a prerequisite for applications in quantum information science.  Using the scattered cooling light as a signal to tell us when various transitions have occurred, we have determined the energy splittings in the 7 low-lying electronic states used for quantum technology applications in the other isotopes.  In particular, we have observed the first energy splitting in the quasi-stable \"F-state,\" a state that is used to make atomic clocks, and mapped out the means for completing the spectroscopy of the other levels in that state.\n\nIn addition, the investigations of the metastable state in this ion have inspired advances in the closely-related fields of trapped ion quantum processing and cold molecules.  In particular, we have outlined how metastable states can be used in trapped atom quantum processing in what is now called the \"omg blueprint\" for architecture.
