 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many new membrane materials have been developed in recent years; however, very few of them have made it to industrial applications, mainly due to lack of durability and robustness under realistic operating conditions. This research project aims to develop a molecular-level understanding of transport mechanisms in membrane materials and to inform the development of the next generation of membrane materials that can compete with traditional energy-intensive gas separations technologies. The types of membrane materials that will be investigated have a molecular structure that creates permanent, non-collapsible voids (free volume) in the material. The free volume is available for selective gas sorption, and the molecular structure around the voids helps the material to maintain its free volume and separation performance, unlike current separation membranes. The scientific knowledge generated by this research should enable significant advances in separation membranes that will meet the needs for a broad range of industrial applications. The research project serves as a training ground for undergraduate and graduate students to perform cutting edge research and will engage students from groups underrepresented in STEM fields. The researchers will also engage in well-structured education and outreach activities, including developing new courses, formulating educational and research components for high school students, giving presentations at a public \"research night\" event, and creating an educational video streaming for general public. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this research project is to elucidate how conformation- and configuration-based free volume contribute, individually and synergistically, to the membrane transport properties. The research hypothesis is that configurational free volume is much more stable than conformational free volume, and thus it provides unprecedented resistance to physical aging and plasticization even under harsh conditions, i.e., at high temperature and in chemically challenging environments. Iptycene-based polymers with specifically, yet systematically, varied free volume architecture will be synthesized, and the effect of configurational free volume on molecular transport will be studied. Fundamental transport properties (i.e., sorption, diffusion and permeation) will be investigated experimentally and theoretically under both ambient and harsh conditions. Finally, atomistic simulations will be performed to elucidate the underlying transport mechanism in polymers with configuration-based free volume and the effect of nano-confinement. The outcome of this project will be improved membranes for industrial gas separations, especially under harsh conditions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

However, they suffer from low selectivity, and more significantly, poor resistance to physical aging and plasticization. This collaborative project, which included a chemical engineer, a polymers chemist and a computation chemist, interrogated the fundamentally new concept of ?configuration-based free volume? as a solution to these grand challenges faced by existing microporous polymers, whose free volume is primarily based on transient conformational features (e.g., inefficient packing due to restricted rotation). We demonstrated that polymers containing iptycene moieties exhibit exceptional size sieving ability, and are aging and plasticization resistant, due to the existence of unique ?internal free volume? delineated by iptycene molecular configuration. We defined this internal free volume as configurational free volume, which, as opposed to the transient nature of conformational free volume in conventional glassy polymers, is related to the permanent molecular configuration. This project developed a previously unavailable fundamental understanding of the connection between free volume microporosity and properties for iptycene-based polymers, thus generating new transformative concepts across fields, such as polymer chemistry, polymer physics and separation science. This project elucidates, for the first time ever, how conformation- and configuration-based free volume contribute, individually and synergistically, to the membrane properties.

In contrast, configurational free volume suppresses, via a purely entropic mechanism, the solubility of bulkier vapor molecules in the polymer, leading sorption- and diffusion-selectivity to work synergistically instead than against each other, ultimately offering an unexpectedly high sorption-selectivity that can even exceed the size sieving ability.
