 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of North Carolina Greensboro (UNCG) ADVANCE Adaptation project will implement activities to improve equity for STEM faculty at UNCG, a minority-serving institution with a diverse student enrollment.  The institution has done a self-study to identify equity issues for STEM faculty by gender and have identified promising practices from other ADVANCE grantees as well as at UNCG itself.  The UNCG ADVANCE Adaptation project fits well with the campus-wide Strategic Plan and will contribute to the need in the Piedmont of North Carolina region for a well-prepared and diverse STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThe UNCG ADVANCE project is expected to result in an enhanced \"culture of care\" by: 1) making promotion and tenure and search committee enhancements and reviewing exit interview data from faculty that leave the institution; 2) mentoring and standardizing the review of external research proposals by the institution and coordinating proposal preparation; and 3) increasing awareness, standardization, and implementation of policies that promote career-life balance at UNCG.  These institutional change efforts will be supported throughout the campus by the work of a trained, volunteer, group called Spartans ADVANCE Allies, who will contribute to the creation of an overall \"culture of care\" at UNCG.\r\n\r\nThe NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions.  Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational culture and climate.  ADVANCE \"Adaptation\" awards provide support for the adaptation and adoption of evidence-based strategies to academic, non-profit institution of higher education as well as non-academic, non-profit organizations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
