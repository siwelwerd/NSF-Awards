 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chirality, or the nonsuperimposability of mirror images, is a fundamental symmetry property of Nature. Just as human left and right hands are nonsuperimposable mirror images, biomolecules such as protein and DNA and other biologically-active molecules are chiral. The nonsuperimposable structural forms of these molecules are referred to as enantiomers. Artificially synthesized molecules are often a mixture of enantiomers. The ability to separate the mixtures into enantiomerically-pure compounds, or a single enantiomer, is particularly important to the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, as one enantiomer may have an entirely different effect than another. Yet, enantiomeric separations remain a costly aspect of the chemical production process. With support from the Molecular Separations program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems, and partial co-funding from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging program in the Division of Chemistry, the PIs will examine the application of a novel and potentially generic principle for the separation of enantiomers using magnetic solid surfaces. In chiral molecules, applying a voltage affects how strongly the molecule interacts with a ferromagnetic surface. The strength of the interaction depends on whether the molecule is left-handed or right-handed. To separate enantiomers using magnetic surfaces and applied voltages, however, the chiral molecules and surface must be in direct contact. The goal of the project is to establish the molecular parameters affecting the separation and to identify the ideal magnetic materials. The ability to separate enantiomers using such an approach has the potential to reduce the cost of producing drugs and other agriculturally-relevant molecules, improving human health and promoting sustainability.\r\n\r\nThe proposed activity builds on fundamental insights into the chiral induced spin selectivity effect and the recent finding that charge polarization in chiral molecules is accompanied by spin polarization. Recent results show that chiral molecules enantiospecifically adsorb on ferromagnets, where the adsorbed enantiomer is determined by the direction of magnetization of the substrate. The molecule's spin polarization affects the adsorption energy with a magnetic surface primarily through a change in the Pauli repulsion. The spin polarization changes the symmetry constraints on the electronic wavefunction, and this strongly affects the Pauli repulsion energy as the electron cloud of the molecule overlaps with the electronic wavefunctions of the substrate. Based on this behavior, a new approach to enantioselective separations and purification using magnetic materials will be developed. This goal will be accomplished through four objectives: 1) examining how the enantioselective adsorption of chiral molecules depends on the molecular properties; 2) examining different chromatographic constructs for separating mixtures of enantiomers; 3) exploring and defining the experimental conditions for efficient separations; and 4) examining the use of crystallization with magnetic surfaces for separations. The research will result in fundamental understanding of enantiomeric separations using magnetic materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This 'handedness' of molecules is known to affect their chemistry and can have dramatic biological effects. Thus, it is important to be able to separate molecules based on whether they are left-handed or right-handed. Recent studies into the chiral induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect show that chiral molecules become spin-polarized (magnetized) when their electron clouds are distorted. In order to test this idea and to examine whether it is possible to use magnetic surfaces to separate left-handed molecules from right-handed molecules, we studied the interactions of chiral molecules with magnetic surfaces.\n\nBy controlling the voltage applied to a magnetic electrode, we were able to control the interaction of chiral molecules with the magnetized electrode surface and examine detailed features of the process.  We showed that the binding strength of chiral molecules with the surface does not change with the magnetization direction (North pole versus South pole) of the electrode, but that the rate of its binding to the surface (adsorption) does change.  This work is important because it shows that we can separate right-handed molecules from left-handed ones in processes that distinguish the rates of adsorption.\n\nWe also studied the adsorption of amino acids onto magnetic electrode surfaces that were coated with a layer of chiral molecules.  This system allows us to compare the importance of the spin-polarization effect on the binding (see above) with the more traditional explanations of binding between chiral molecules.  The conventional wisdom explains the selective binding between chiral molecules in terms of their shape; i.e., the three-dimensional corkscrew shapes of the molecules only fit together in a unique way - like a 'lock and key' mechanism.  Our studies show that the traditional shape effect and the spin polarization effect are comparable in magnitude, at least for the amino acid systems used in our studies.  This work is important because it points to a new type of interaction that contributes to the interaction of chiral molecules with one another.  Further work will be required to understand how important these effects are in the binding of more complex systems, such as a protein with another molecule.\n\nIn related work we collaborated with a team in Israel to  the importance of the electron spin in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).   Our work shows that control over the spin at an electrode surface improves the efficiency of ORR. In addition to being an important part of respiration and critical for living organisms, the ORR is an important reaction step in fuel cells.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/10/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David H Waldeck"
