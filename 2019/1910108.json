 "awd_abstract_narration": "The past decade has brought a sea change in the availability of data. Devices and data acquisition tools make it easy to acquire new data, cloud hosting and \"data lakes\" make it easy to centralize and share files, and cloud data analytics and machine learning tools have driven a desire to integrate and extract value from that data. Data scientists must operate within a plethora of datasets, versions, and representations that span users, groups, and organizations. They often end up doing redundant work because they have no effective way of finding appropriate resources to reuse and retarget to new applications. Data scientists need a set of holistic data management tools to find, standardize, and reuse the existing resources in the data lake. The proposed work will address these needs, and it will enhance the widely-used Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab data science environments. The tools will also be integrated and evaluated with the PI's existing life-science collaborations, with neuroscientists (including the IEEG.org portal with over 3000 users), geneticists, and radiologists. The proposed work will leverage Penn's efforts to involve female students, and those from underrepresented groups, in summer research; and the research will be incorporated into the curriculum of Penn's Data Science Master's program and online degree programs.\r\n\r\nThe PI will develop the Juneau system, a novel data management platform for data lakes.  It will provide efficient versioned storage of source, intermediate, and final datasets and data products, making it easy to index, search, and compare different results. A rich set of search tools and ranking algorithms for taking an existing table fragment, schema, or task, and finding related tables will make it easier for users to reuse the results of prior work. The project will develop techniques that learn from past data schemas and processing pipelines, and help users design new ones that do not need to start \"from scratch,\" making it easier for users to reuse the data models and tools that were previously developed.  It will also develop techniques for analyzing computations performed by the user community, and developing schemas and representations for sharing, making it easier to promote data modeling based on how data is actually being used.  Finally, the researchers will create models and tools for \"retargeting\" limited classes of data pipelines from one data processing platform to another, making it easier to share and reuse code across different languages and tools. Juneau will be accessible to a broad user community because it will layer underneath the popular Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab platform, which can be deployed locally or on the cloud.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
