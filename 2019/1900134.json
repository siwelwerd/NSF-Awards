 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for US participation in the joint conferences \"Young Mathematicians in C*-Algebras\" and \"Young Women in C*-Algebras\" that will be held August 5-10, 2019 at the University of Copenhagen. This joint conference focuses on recent developments in operator algebras (both von Neumann and C*-algebras), noncommutative geometry, and related areas of mathematical analysis, with a particular emphasis on the interplay between operator algebras and the fields of geometric group theory, logic, and dynamical systems.\r\n\r\nYoung Mathematicians in C*-Algebras and Young Women in C*-Algebras are organized for and by master/Ph.D.-students and postdocs in operator algebras and related areas, with the goal of fostering scientific and social interaction between young researchers. The conference will feature three mini-courses by established researchers (Cornelia Drutu, Ilijas Farah, and Ian Putnam) alongside many contributed talks by participants, as well as mentoring activities designed to increase retention of underrepresented groups in operator algebras. This award gives US-based early career researchers and members of underrepresented groups an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference.   The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups via advertising in a variety of venues. More information will be made available at: https://www.math.ku.dk/english/research/conferences/2019/ymcstara2019/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
