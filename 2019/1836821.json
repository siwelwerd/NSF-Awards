The Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) model is currently used for operational forecasts of the solar wind. The semi-empirical WSA model provides a distribution of the solar wind parameters at a spherical interface between the Solar Corona (SC) and Inner Heliosphere (IH) based on the latest synoptic map for the solar magnetic field. The research will develop a physics-based, self-consistent model to understand and forecast the ambient state of the Solar Corona (SC). The research will (1) enhance understanding of the fundamental processes, (2) improve our capability to model and forecast the ambient state in both SC and IH, and (3) allow the further Research to Operation (R2O) transition to a predictive tool to simulate and forecast dynamical Space Weather Events. The new model for the SC based on the Alfven wave turbulence will be delivered to the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) to enable broad use by the heliophysics community. Realtime runs of the model at CCMC will be available to observers, who can use these models results to interpret the observational data. The research project will also provide education and training opportunities for students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nThe semi-empirical Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) model  is currently used for operational forecasts of the ambient state of the solar wind. It is known to compare well with solar wind observations at 1 AU. It relies on two factors strongly affecting the solar wind parameters. The first factor is the expansion rate of the open coronal magnetic field where larger expansion rates in coronal\nholes result in slower and denser solar wind compared with smaller expansion rates found at the center of large coronal holes, such as polar holes, which produce fast solar wind of lower density. The second factor is the angular distance, &theta;, between the point of origination of the solar wind and the coronal hole boundary. This parameter is especially important for larger coronal holes because it distinguishes the slow solar wind, which originates from the coronal hole boundary (small &theta;), from the fast solar wind forming at the inner\npart of the hole at larger &theta;.  Any extension of the WSA model capabilities is\nworthwhile only if does not degrade the quality of model predictions.\n \nIn the reported research we developed a self-consistent model for the ambient\nstate in the SC. The existing Alfven wave turbulence-based model for the solar atmosphere, AWSoM has been  enriched with an attractive feature of the WSA model by incorporating a dependence of the solar wind parameters on the angular distance from a coronal hole boundary. Specifically, we included an extra dissipation for the Alfven surface waves, which is due to the steepening of the plasma density gradients across the coronal hole boundary. The increased plasma heating due to the enhanced dissipation of the Alfven wave turbulence results in a denser and slower solar wind near the coronal hole boundary, which is a physical counterpart of the semi-empirical &theta;-dependence assumed in the WSA model.\n \nAnother new feature to introduced into the AWSoM is the use of aa special form of the computational MHD model, the \"stream-aligned MHD\". The WSA model assumes that the semi-empirically predicted state of the SC then propagates through the inner heliosphere  in a form of the Parker-spiral solution. This feature of the WSA model is not easy to reproduce in the global MHD simulation, since the magnetic field is not aligned with the streamlines in the corotating frame of reference. This flaw is especially significant near the heliospheric current sheet, where the numerical solution is prone to \"numerical reconnection\" afffecting the field topology.

This extension allows an extra validation of the model with the multi-wavelength SC observations as well as a forecast capability for missions at the heliocentric distances below 20 &divide; 25 R .  The designed approach to expand the empirical WSA method with a physics-based MHD methodology.  The proposed approach integrates the best of two worlds: it uses the climatological WSA model to\noptimize the subgrid parameterization of a high-end physics-based model.\nBroader Impacts\nAn important element of this project is community support. As\nupdates to SWMF, a new model for the SC based on the Alfv &#769;en wave turbulence, has been delivered to the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) to enable broad use by the heliophysics community. The real-time runs will be of great use to observers, who use these models to interpret data. \n \n\nThe SWMF has recently been transitioned to NOAA\u2019s Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) and was operationally used to forecast the geospace environment starting October 1, 2016. In addition, discussions are under way to eventually evolve the new capabilities to be developed by this proposed project into a predictive SEP capability at SWPC: such a capability is high on the wish list of both NOAA and the Air Force. \n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/30/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Igor Sokolov"
