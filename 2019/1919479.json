 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the City University of New York, Queensborough Community College (QCC), to purchase a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system for the analysis of gene expression and protein-protein interactions.  QCC serves a diverse population of first-generation college students and admits many students who would otherwise not have access to higher education.  The acquisition of the PCR system will complement a Biotechnology core facility that includes a flow cytometry machine, a confocal microscope and tissue culture capability.  This facility supports research by faculty members within the Department of Biological Sciences and Geology, many of whom include students in their research projects.  The instrumentation in the core facility allows faculty to introduce students who are underrepresented in STEM to leading-edge experimental methodologies and helps prepare them to enter the STEM workforce.  Furthermore, the newly acquired PCR instrument will be used as an integral part of the educational training in the Biotechnology program and other program in Biology at QCC, thus impacting even more students. \r\n\r\nA variety of diverse projects will be supported by the acquisition of the qPCR system. These include studies of (a) the molecular regulation of STAT3 in cell-cell interactions, (b) miRNA regulation of gene expression in C. elegans, (c) microbial communities in wastewater treatment plants, (d) epigenetic changes leading to gene silencing, (e) parasite-host cell interactions, (f) the molecular regulation of cnidarian behaviors, (g) rhomboid proteases in Streptomyces coelicolor and (h) cell fate in Arabidopsis regeneration.  Data generated using the qPCR instrument will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals, at professional scientific conferences and at regional and national research conferences for undergraduates.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic forced the QCC campus to shut down most of 2021 and it has only partially opened up starting January 2022.  Thus many of the planned experiments involving the qPCR instrument (Quanstudio6) were not achieved.  Nevertheless, acquiring the qPCR during the funding period from 2019 &ndash; 2022, has allowed us to complete many of our goals.  The most significant accomplishment are:  1) Dr. Nguyen\u2019s group used the qPCR to examine the expression of genes in RAW264.7 cells and bone tissues isolated from conditional knock-out mice.   With Dr. Orlofsky and Dr. Li at IUPUI, they published a manuscript:  \"The loss of STAT3 in mature osteoclasts has detrimental effects on bone structure\".  PLoS One.  15(7). E0236891.  2020 and a second one titled,  \"The loss of STAT3 in osteoblasts has sex- and strain-dependent detrimental effects on bone structure and strength\" is in preparation.   Dr. Nguyen and Dr. Orlofsky and their students also used the loop mediated isothermal amplification method to detect microbes in environmental samples.  Their data was published in Frontiers in Microbiology,  https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.603381 2020.   They plan to use the qPCR and a molecular beacon to detect LAMP amplicons.

Feb 3, 2022).  Her initial work on these projects used the Quanstudio6 qPCR at QCC.  4) Dr. Orlofsky\u2019s group used the qPCR for a series of experiments investigating the regulation of host cell amino acid transporter expression by the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii.  These experiments demonstrated the selective upregulation of specific transporter expression in multiple host cell types. \n\n                The users of the qPCR have trained overall eleven students during the grant period.  As more classes are taught in person at QCC, qPCR instrument usage has increased in recent months.  Several of our faculty members have mentored the CUNY Research Scholar Program (CRSP) students and have trained some of the students on the usage of the qPCR.  Additionally, Dr Ghoshal who teaches Biotechnology has conducted workshops, where students are provided with hands-on-training on real-time PCR.\n\n                The Quanstudio6 qPCR has also allowed two new faculty members who recently joined the QCC Biology Department to advance their careers.  Dr. Mello has piloted a program with the college\u2019s Science and Technology Entry Program that provided minority NYC high school students the opportunity to gain hands-on experience with modern instrumentation and data management.  She has worked with students to engineer plasmids with RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down genes of interest in C. elegans and quantify their effects using the qPCR to evaluate the efficacy of the RNAi.  Additionally, Dr Sarbani Ghoshal and her collaborator Dr Sanjai Kumar Pathak from Queens College are investigating the inhibition of NEK-2 pathway in cancer cell lines. They have used the qPCR to delineate gene expression in the A549 lung cancer cell line and MDA MB231 breast cancer line which have been treated with a selective Nek2 inhibitor\n\n                Acquiring the Quanstudio6 qPCR has helped several PIs to propose experiments in their grant which they would otherwise not have the capability to do. Several of the PIs received PSC-CUNY grants.  Dr. Ghoshal has secured an enhanced grant on examining adropin expression in neuroinflammation and cognitive function of aging mice.  She also received a CUNY Community College Research Grant titled, \"Targeting Energy Expenditure pathways to combat obesity, insulin resistance and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in aged mice.\"  Dr. McLaughlin received funding for her proposal, \"Implementation of RNA interference to explore the role of polycystins and calcium sensing receptors in Hydra feeding behaviors.\" Dr. Trujillo submitted and has been awarded an NSF grant entitled, \"Developing the data analysis skills of the community college students using the cloud technologies\".   Dr. Orlofsky received funding for his proposal \"Regulation of host amino acid transporters by an intracellular parasite\". Dr. Nguyen received funding for his project, \" Examining the functions of STAT3 in modulating the redux potential and apoptosis\". \n\n                Overall, acquiring the qPCR has allowed us to introduce students to qPCR and to train students on the use of a qPCR instrument.  It has also allowed PIs to perform experiments in their respective areas of expertise which allows them to collect preliminary data to seek NSF and private agencies for funding. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/20/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew Nguyen"
