 "awd_abstract_narration": "A smart grid system is complicated because it combines new and old technologies and is dependent on different cyber and physical components. Because it is complicated, a smart grid is more likely to be attacked due to misconfigurations and lacking security measures. Therefore, the secure and resilient operation of smart grids must be ensured by identifying potential threats and their impact and finding affordable solutions to defend against identified threats. This research aims to achieve these goals through the development of an efficient security analysis framework for the Energy Management System (EMS), a core smart grid component. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed research lies in advancing the science of security analysis for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) by integrating different theories, such as formal verification, model simulation, data and control flow, and security concepts, into the CPS components. This work will contribute to the CPS security science by: (a) developing a comprehensive formal model for stealthy attack verifications and (b) designing an efficient mechanism for systematically performing the impact-oriented threat analysis. Although this research targets EMS in smart grids, the approach is broad enough to be generalized for other CPS control loops that utilize measurement-based estimation.\r\n\r\nCPS, like power grids, are critical to the national infrastructure, requiring that they be secure and dependable, especially with the increase of cyberwarfare. This research aims to address the urgent need to analyze CPS security. In addition to the technical project contributions, graduate and undergraduate level course modules on CPS security will also be developed. Underrepresented and minority students will be encouraged, through local and outreach activities, to participate in the project. Results of this project will be widely publicized in the research community through peer-reviewed journals articles and conference papers.",

Therefore, it is essential to proactively identify potential threats and assess impacts for cost-efficient mitigation planning. This project achieved this goal by developing an efficient security framework for a CPS to characterize potential attack space and identify the system's resiliency by verifying the details of an attack and determining its consequences depending on various adversarial attributes. In this project, we consider power grids as the reference CPS, the energy management system (EMS) as the reference control system, and stealthy attacks as the reference threat. These attacks are also known as undetected false data injection (UFDI) attacks. Here, we develop various tools based on comprehensive formal modeling of stealthy attacks and designing efficient mechanisms for impact-based threat synthesis. The tools have the key features of providing logic-based models of cyber and physical properties of the EMS modules, the interdependency among various modules, stealthy attacks and adversary attributes, and characteristics of the attack impacts on the economic and secure operation of the grid. We unify these different logical models, a set of constraints, into a single framework and build necessary security analytics. The core of this formal design is SMT (satisfiability modulo theories), an efficient state-of-the-art formal method for constraint satisfaction problems. Other techniques like MATLAB Simulink are integrated to deal with various non-linear control mechanisms in the EMS. </span></p>\n<p><span>More specifically, the major activities of this project created several tools. We built a hybrid framework that combines formal analytics with Simulink-based system modeling to investigate the feasibility of stealthy attacks and their influence on OPF in a time-efficient manner. The proposed approach is illustrated in synthetic case studies demonstrating the impact of stealthy attacks in different attack scenarios. We extend this framework to identify stealthy attacks regarding their effects on the grid's secure operation by modeling contingency analysis when the loads are misestimated due to FDI. We model the security-constrained OPF that considers contingency analysis solutions to find the OPF dispatches. We implement the formal model and evaluate it based on the synthetic data generated based on the standard IEEE test systems. We verify the identified threat vectors using OPAL-RT, a real-time power system simulator fully integrated with MATLAB/Simulink. We develop tools to verify stealthy attacks considering the AC power flow-based power system for small-signal stability and relay operations. Since non-linear complex power equations do not allow a feasible solution to the formal model, we assume some linearization to represent the power system dynamics. </span></p>\n<p><span>Indeed, the intellectual merit of this research lies in developing the science of security analysis for CPSs by integrating different theories, such as formal verification, model simulation, data and control flow, and security concepts, into the CPS components.

More importantly, although the target of this research is EMS in smart power grids, the approach is broad enough to be generalized for other CPS control loops that utilize measurement-based estimation. The project's partially supported developments justify this claim. We build impact-aware formal analysis frameworks that synthesize potential attack vectors that perform stealthy false data injection to the sensors to create targeted damage on a water treatment center and personalized rule-based smart healthcare systems.

In addition to this technical contribution, this project contributes to developing graduate and undergraduate level course modules on CPS security and resiliency. The PI integrated the project-related topics and problems as discussions, assignments, and term projects in three graduate courses and two senior undergraduate courses. The participation of women and minority students in this project is encouraged. The PI supported a female doctoral student through this project.

The results of this project were widely publicized in the research community by publishing peer-reviewed articles. The project's direct or indirect outcomes generate four journals and thirteen conference papers. The papers are also shared with the CPS community through the CPS Virtual Organization (CPS-VO). The codes related to the tools are mostly publicly available over Git-hub.
