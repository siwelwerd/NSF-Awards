 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Instrumentation Programs. Professor Joseph Rugutt from Missouri State University - West Plains and colleagues are acquiring a 90 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the examination of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the rates of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state.  The NMR studies improve understanding of synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate students that impacts green chemistry and recyclable ionic liquids used to accelerate reaction rates. Many students use the spectrometer in a bioinspired initiative named \"Undergraduate STudent Achievers in Research\" (USTAR) that promotes student participation in STEM (science technology, engineering and mathematics) at the institution and at neighboring high schools in Missouri.\r\n\r\nThe award of the NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. This instrument acquisition especially impacts the characterization of synthesized bioassay-directed chalcones which are aromatic ketones that form the central core of important biological compounds. The syntheses incorporate nanomaterials that can be used in green chemistry and molecular modeling and for spectroscopic studies. The researchers are generating a small library of chalcones that are tested against biological targets.  They are also studying ionic liquids to be used as catalysts to accelerate chemical reactions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The mission of most 2YCs is to provide high-quality education that is readily accessible, affordable, and receptive to the needs of local communities. Because of the open-enrollment policies, students in 2YCs have academically diverse backgrounds. Moreover, most of these students have high course loads and work for at least 15 hours per week to pay tuition and living expenses. Just like the students, faculty in 2YCs encounter numerous roadblocks such as heavy teaching loads and a lack of onsite modern research facilities. Therefore, they do not have the time for research. To alleviate students' and faculty members' barriers to research at MSU-WP, the PI used the Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) method as a vehicle to implement green synthesis of chalcones (IUPAC names 1,3-diphenylprop-2-en-1-ones). Chalcones are natural products belonging to the flavonoid family. They exhibit broad-spectrum biological activities, including anticancer, antimalarial, antibacterial, and antimicrobial. Chalcones are interesting compounds for research in 2YCs due to their simple chemistry and ease of synthesis. To implement a chalcone-based capstone CURE project, students enrolled in chemistry lab courses at MSU-WP worked in groups. They searched the chemical literature for new bioactive chalcones recently isolated from natural products. Each group selected one chalcone and collaborated in developing a green method to synthesize it. For example, students have used a literature-based solvent-free method to prepare a small library of dihydroxychalcones. They acquired the NMR data of their compounds using a 90 MHz NMR spectrometer. Through the chalcone-based CURE project, students acquired basic research skills in synthesis, purification, NMR techniques, searching the chemical literature, writing annotated bibliographies, scientific communications, research ethics, teamwork, intellectual property rights, and patents.</p>\n<p>Two-year colleges (2YCs) are underrepresented in STEM research. The 3-year MRI award empowered freshmen and sophomores to engage in chalcone-based capstone CURE project at MSU-WP. One Laboratory and Stores Supervisor, two college faculty members, one high school science teacher, four high school students, and 532 two-year college students participated directly or indirectly in the project. The student-centered capstone project led to the effective implementation of high-impact practices (i.e., engaged student learning communities, scientific communications, undergraduate research, and capstone experiences). These practices will prepare 2YC students for successful careers in 4YCs and beyond. The capstone project has the potential to create new knowledge in the field of chemistry by developing efficient and environmentally benign<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> </span>green methods for bioactive chalcones. 2YC students disseminated their research data by discussing with group members and writing individual research reports. Excellent research data will be published in peer-reviewed journals, posted on MSU-WP's website, and presented at ACS conferences. The chalcone-based capstone CURE project can be successfully replicated by chemistry faculty in PUIs who have high teaching loads, limited research time, and lack modern equipment.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/29/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Joseph&nbsp;K&nbsp;Rugutt</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div
