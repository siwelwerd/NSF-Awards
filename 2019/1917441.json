 "awd_abstract_narration": "Newly discovered high-temperature shape memory alloys can recover large deformations at elevated temperatures through a reversible transformation of their crystal structure. This has warranted significant interest in their use as solid-state actuators in aeronautics, automotive, and energy-conversion applications. These actuators could potentially provide ultra-high energy density actuation and would allow multifunctional use, resulting in lower cost and maintenance due to simplified device designs. The aim of this research project is to accelerate the development cycle of these materials by elucidating the life-limiting fatigue mechanisms. The knowledge of fatigue progression in these alloys will facilitate the wider acceptance of materials exhibiting reversible martensitic transformation in engineering applications. Furthermore, through the synergistic combination of experiments and modeling and its multidisciplinary nature, this research will train the next generation of experts in multifunctional, phase transforming materials. It will also support the involvement of underrepresented groups in research and professional experiences via partnership with the Boeing Company, NASA, and international collaborators.\r\n\r\nThis research will involve multiscale thermomechanical testing and microstructural characterization as well as sophisticated modeling to identify defect kinetics as a function of microstructural attributes in the presence of reversible martensitic transformation and associated irreversible processes. While recently discovered Nickel-Titanium-Hafnium (NiTiHf) alloys will be used as a model material system, many of the experimental findings and models are expected to be transferable to other phase transforming materials as well. The experimental work will rely on in-situ thermomechanical testing in scanning electron microscope and ex-situ transmission electron microscopy, as well as digital image correlation and synchrotron X-ray tomography to monitor defect formation/growth and to characterize microstructure, deformation structure, and fracture surfaces. The modeling work will be based on a phase field approach to fatigue crack formation and growth. This approach will provide an advantage over current methods that rely on self-similar crack growth assumptions of conventional fracture mechanics, which break down due to the variability of the underlying microstructure and their complex influence on the mechanical fields close to the crack tip.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

SMAs exhibit a diffusionless, solid-to-solid, phase transformation of their crystal structure from austenite to martensite. Forward phase transformation from austenite to martensite results in large strain accommodation, which can be almost completely recovered during reverse phase transformation, triggered by unloading (superelastic effect) or unloading followed by heating (shape memory effect). The above functional properties render SMAs desirable in a wide range of applications, from biomedical stents to solid-state actuators, elastocaloric cooling, robotics, and consumer electronics. However, main stream utilization of these materials has yet to be realized, especially in areas other than biomedical applications, due to insufficient mechanistic understanding and lack of robust predictive models of their failure response.</span></p>\n<p><span>Towards this end, in this project, a constitutive model for the anisotropic deformation response of SMAs in the subgrannular level was developed, capable of describing phase transformation, TRansformation-Induced Plasticity (TRIP), and thermomechanical coupling,&nbsp;</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, latent heat effects [Figure 1]. TRIP was described based on arguments of the underlying physics,&nbsp;</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, as an accommodation of the local deformation incompat- ibility at the austenite&ndash;martensite interfaces. The implementation of the model was based on a numerical method that falls into the class of forward gradient methods that leads to improved numerical stability by resulting in a tangent stiffness expression which is considerably reduced from the elastic stiffness. Cali- bration and uncertainty quantification of the material parameters of the developed subgrannular model was performed via Bayesian Inference. The subgrannular constitutive model provided the elastic, transformation, and TRIP work contributions to the stored energy functional of a phase-field model for thermomechanically- induced fracture at the subgrannular level,&nbsp;</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, fracture under loading paths that may take advantage of either of the functional properties of SMAs&ndash;superelasticity or shape memory effect.

Performed experiments demonstrated that the toughness enhancement due to crack advance in SMAs may be &ldquo;reversed&rdquo; by partial unloading, which has implications on the evaluation of the resistance curve and its validity conditions, and provided an experimental verification of the theoretical insight into the mechanics of stable crack growth [Figure 4].

Furthermore, the fracture toughness of SMAs under actu- ation loading conditions was measured for the first time through a proposed mechanics-aided methodology. The obtained data suggests that transformation-induced toughness enhancement is highly dependent on the loading conditions; isothermal conditions provide a more pronounced toughness enhancement as compared to thermal loading under a constant bias load [Figure 5]. Lastly, the relative importance of the cleavage and ductile fracture in the overall failure response of SMAs was investigated. Although SMAs belong to a relatively brittle class of materials, that of intermetallics, their fracture surfaces are characterized by both cleavage and dimples, with the latter being indicative of ductile rupture. Two clear differentiators of SMAs from other intermetallics, which may contribute to the presence of ductile rupture are their ability to trans- form their crystallographic structure and the presence of precipitates in large volume fractions. It was shown that void growth and coalescence should play a minor role in the fracture of precipitated SMAs, as compared to that of void nucleation and cleavage.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/26/2023<br>\nModified by: Theocharis&nbsp;Baxevanis</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1917441/1917441_10616544_1703643994778_Fig1--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1917441/1917441_10616544_1703643994778_Fig1--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1917441/1917441_10616544_1703643994778_Fig1--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Contour plots of the martensite volume fraction, effective transformation, and effective plastic strain profiles on the block\ufffds surface and on a cross section (in-depth direction) at the end of loading and the end of unloading.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Afzal Md Hossein</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Theocharis&nbsp;Baxevanis\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1917441/1917441_10616544_1702486277760_Fig5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1917441/1917441_10616544_1702486277760_Fig5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 5\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1917441/1917441_10616544_1702486277760_Fig5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 5\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Load vs load-line displacement (LLD) and resistance curves for the isobaric and isothermal fracture tests.
