The work is supported by the Course Social and Cognitive Engagement (CSCE) Framework.  The expected outcomes of this project are: (1) an exploratory framework for how engineering faculty make choices and engage in evaluation processes; (2) a deeper understanding of processes that underlie cognitive and social engagement in engineering classrooms; and, (3) a valid and reliable CSCE instrument with modular subscales to measure student engagement of STEM education.",
