 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part 1:\r\nIn order to broaden student participation in geosciences, Geoscience Education through Authentic Research will focus on the engagement of high school and undergraduate students in relevant geoscience research. Because students have limited exposure to geoscience in high school, they are unlikely to choose it as a major course of study in college. This project will provide an opportunity for underrepresented high school students and non-Geology majors in an introductory Geology course to plan and execute real geoscience research. It will advance knowledge on the role that participation in undergraduate research has in choosing and maintaining a course of study in the geosciences. The project will also advance knowledge on how this type of experience can impact underrepresented students and their decision to go to college and to choose a geoscience major and career. It seeks to create a pathway for students to pursue a career in geoscience who may not have otherwise considered one. The project will also create an awareness of geoscience issues, their relevance to the community and region, and research avenues to address these issues. The ultimate goal is for both groups of students to see relevant study and career options in the geosciences through conducting authentic geoscience research. \r\n\r\nPart 2:\r\nThrough Geoscience Education through Authentic Research both high school (particularly those from underrepresented populations) and undergraduate students will do research focused on legacy heavy metal contamination in urban community gardens and residential soils. Students will work directly with community gardeners in Toledo, OH, and personnel from the Toledo GROWs organization, which oversees over 125 gardens. BGSU undergraduates will participate in this project through a laboratory component of an introductory Geology class, Geology 1010. Students from Toledo Public Schools' Natural Science and Technology Center (NSTC) will work with BGSU students to determine sample sites and to collect and characterize the samples using GLOBE and other protocols. The groups of students will work in BGSU labs to learn how to prepare and analyze samples. The students will share results using virtual means of communication and develop joint presentations. In just the first year, over 130 students will participate in the project. The redesign of Geology 1010 and proposed addition to the BG Perspective (general education) curriculum will allow up to 300 undergraduates a year to be enrolled in the course and therefore, would provide a pathway into geosciences for a large student population. In addition, the project will generate a large database on heavy metals concentrations and distribution in urban community gardens. The participating students will disseminate their results to gardeners and other community members in order to alert them to potential issues and advise them on best practices for minimizing their exposures. These results will be not only be relevant to the Toledo, OH area but also to other urban centers of similar size and age.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The project focused on high school students, especially 8<sup>th</sup> graders, as it has been shown to be a key time for development of career interests and persistence in STEM disciplines.</p>\r\n<p>We developed a 3-session series of hands-on team-based collaborative learning activities focused on the place-based issue of lead in their community and its negative impact on young children as described at <a href=\"https://www.bgsu.edu/nwo/current-grant-projects/GP-EXTRA.html\">https://www.bgsu.edu/nwo/current-grant-projects/GP-EXTRA.html</a> (also see attached).</p>\r\n<p>The program was evaluated using a Likert scale pre- and post-survey with a total of 597 usable surveys obtained in the 2023-2024 year (51% minority, 53% female). Questions were designed to capture changes in student&rsquo;s perception of science, self-efficacy, career interest, anxiety towards science, and value of place-based education. Statistical analysis revealed a positive impact on all five of the measured survey areas and all were determined to be reliable and had educationally meaningful impacts. The greatest effect size was in self-efficacy, the belief that one can accomplish goals and succeed at tasks, which has been shown to be a strong predicter of student academic achievement and future career choices. Further, there was no significant difference in the changes in survey responses based on ethnicity with all ethnic groups showing significant gains. However, by gender, females showed greater gains in all five survey areas and statistical analysis showed it was significant for self-efficacy and anxiety towards science.</p>\r\n<p>In summary, the results of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of place-based hands-on cooperative group learning research activities to enhance high school student&rsquo;s perception of science, self-efficacy, anxiety towards science, and geoscience career interest through <strong>only</strong> three 50-minute sessions.</p>\r\n<p>An important aspect of the demographics of the students who participated in this project is that they were not self-selected based on prior interests in STEM fields but rather reflect a representative population of urban and inner-city high school students who are largely disinterested in science and math often due to a sense they are not capable to do science (low self-efficacy). A majority of the students are from historically underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines, and many are from socioeconomically depressed communities. There is a critical need for diversity in the geosciences. By doing authentic science activities students of all ethnicities and genders learned they <strong>can</strong> do science.</p>\r\n<p>Beyond the measured outcomes, this place-based project involved a total of over 1600 high school students from 14 different schools along with 28 science teachers in the Toledo, OH area in a series of hands-on activities focused on the harmful effects of legacy lead in the environment. Lead poisoning, especially in young children, is an ongoing concern in Toledo as well as many other older urban socioeconomically depressed areas. In addition, legal battles over enforcement of city ordinances regulating lead in housing units are reported weekly to monthly in local newspapers and television news.</p>\r\n<p>Through this project students collected and analyzed soil samples from around their own residences to test for lead and other heavy metals contamination. Students were instructed on the harmful effects of lead exposure to improve their knowledge and awareness of how to minimize their exposure by understanding the sources and transport of lead in their communities. Their soils data were compiled and discussed with the class and a copy of the lead concentrations found in their soils was sent home with them to share with their parents/guardians along with a compilation of USEPA and CDC recommendations on how to reduce human exposure to lead in soils. In this fashion, we were able to educate parents/guardians to the potential hazards of lead in their community as well.</p>\r\n<p>An important outcome of this project was an increase in student&rsquo;s perception of science and appreciation of the important role earth science plays in our society and our local communities. Most of the students involved in this project will not pursue careers in STEM fields, but demonstrating the value of the earth sciences to society is especially important for high school students who represent the next generation of taxpayers, voters, and community leaders. There is a clear need to have well informed citizens regarding important science and health issues. In addition, previous studies have shown that students are strongly motivated by environmental injustice and empathy to pursue environmental geoscience careers and/or activism.</p>\r\n<p>This project also partnered with the Toledo GROWs organization which provided us with direct access to community gardens in the Toledo area. Through presentations at quarterly meetings and working directly with gardeners to collect and analyze their soils, we have helped them to understand the potential harmful effects of lead in their communities. We have worked directly with garden site managers providing advice on best gardening practices to minimize their lead exposure.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/02/2025<br>\nModified by: John&nbsp;R&nbsp;Farver</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1911577/1911577_10642769_1735841794615_Place_based_Learning--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1911577/1911577_10642769_1735841794615_Place_based_Learning--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Place-based Learning\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1911577/1911577_10642769_1735841794615_Place_based_Learning--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Place-based Learning\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Place-based learning in Toledo, OH  using lead sources and hazards in the environment.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">PI</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;R&nbsp;Farver\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Place-based Learning</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1911577/1911577_10642769_1735841996609_Activity_2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1911577/1911577_10642769_1735841996609_Activity_2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Activity 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1911577/1911577_10642769_1735841996609_Activity_2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Activity 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Activity 2 students working on abandon lot reclamation plan and their recommendations.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">PI</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;R&nbsp;Farver\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Activity 2</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1911577/1911577_10642769_1735842080598_Activity_3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1911577/1911577_10642769_1735842080598_Activity_3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Activity 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1911577/1911577_10642769_1735842080598_Activity_3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Activity 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Activity 3.
