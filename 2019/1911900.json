 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award supports fundamental scientific research across multiple length-scales ranging from atomic to macro-scale for manufacturing of industrial-scale selenium-based battery electrodes. The most commonly used lithium-ion batteries are not sufficient to meet the ever-increasing energy demand of our society. Lithium-selenium batteries are a viable replacement for lithium-ion batteries. However, the lack of basic knowledge that controls the processing-structure-performance relations is hindering the progress of manufacturing lithium-selenium batteries at industrial scale. This project addresses these issues and creates transformative new insights into roll-to-roll atomic layer deposition, which is a novel and largely unexplored manufacturing process for selenium battery electrode manufacturing. The roll-to-roll technology is an important manufacturing platform for mass-production of many film-type products. It is seen as a potential 'game-changer' for the U.S. economy. Atomic layer deposition is a layer-by-layer process that results in the deposition of thin films one atomic layer at a time. This research enables broad penetration of high-power batteries into applications where conventional batteries are not suitable, leading to major energy savings and carbon dioxide reduction. The GOALI partnership facilitates in translating laboratory knowledge into manufacturing technology and provides an opportunity for students to combine academic experience with industrial research and development. The award provides opportunities for U.S. Military Veterans, elementary to high-school students, and STEM teachers to engage in activities in both academic and industrial settings. \r\n\r\nLithium-selenium batteries have the potential to store twice the energy as state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries and potentially be employed for high power applications. This research elucidates key aspects that control the processing-structure-performance relations in nanolayered selenium-based electrodes manufactured by roll-to-roll (R2R) atomic layer deposition (ALD). The computational plan focuses on molecular dynamics (MD), density functional theory (DFT), DFT with finite element solvers (DFT-FE), and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations for electrode development. The experimental plan focuses on the study of industrial-scale R2R modeled on laboratory-scale R2R, electrochemical analysis, and analytical characterization of ALD coating/Se/2D carbon electrode (cathode) architectures. The GOALI partner is involved in translating the laboratory ALD results into R2R ALD small-scale manufacturing runs and packaging the materials into commercial-scale pouch cells. The effort combines state-of-the-art pilot-line R2R manufacturing of both electrodes and the ALD coatings with advanced microstructural characterization employing techniques such as TEM and surface science XPS. Electroanalytical testing of electrodes is performed at multiscale, from laboratory 2032 (22 mm diameter x 3.2 mm height) button cells to commercial pouch cells. The academia-industry partnership that is at the core of this research brings a unique intellectual advantage to the approach, allowing a broad spectrum of learning starting at fundamental mechanistic insight to fabricating industrial-scale electrodes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Despite these advancements, the industry has hesitated to widely adopt and directly replace microstructured electrodes with their nanostructured counterparts.

The computational work focused on the use of selenium (Se) as a potential material. Computational analyses revealed that when active materials come into contact with the 3D current collector or binder, the interface adhesion is exceptionally strong, resulting in increased interfacial stress and potential fracture or delamination issues. However, coating Se can reduce this interface adhesion. For instance, computational analysis showed that Se placed on graphene exhibits lower adhesion compared to Se on aluminum. Notably, we have observed chemical reactions occurring at the Se-Al interface, whereas such phenomena at the Se-graphene interface are minimal. Furthermore, our computational work has shown a correlation between interface adhesion and interfacial charge transfer, potential gradient, and other factors. In a previous computational study, we conducted Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations on silicon (Si)-based electrodes, revealing that Si on a carbon support generates lower interfacial stress during the charge-discharge cycle.

For instance, they maintain specific capacities of 442 and 357 mAh/g after 1500 and 2000 cycles at 5C and 10C, respectively. Post-mortem microstructural analysis confirms that the structures remain intact throughout extended cycling. According to GITT analysis, Se@HHCS displays significantly higher diffusion coefficients in both lithiation and delithiation processes compared to the baseline. The superior performance of Se@HHCS can be attributed to its macroscopic and nanoscale pore structure.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Throughout the project, we actively collaborated with our experimental partner at UT Austin and industry collaborators at GDI.
