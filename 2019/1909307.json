 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomers are searching for signs of the first stars and galaxies that formed in the universe.  This period in cosmic history is called the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The Experiment to Detect the Global EoR Signature (EDGES) is an ongoing project to study this early period. In 2018, EDGES reported the first-ever detection of evidence of light from the first stars. These stars where shining 180 million years after the Big Bang, when the universe was merely one percent of its current age. The EDGES project uses radio observations to probe the early universe. This project will build a new radio antenna and receiver for EDGES. The instrument will be used to confirm previously reported evidence. Students from the diverse community of Arizona State University will help to build the instrument and analyze its data. This experience will help to prepare them for future careers and give them a unique research opportunity.\r\n\r\nObserving the formation of the first stars, galaxies, and black holes over 13.5 billion years ago is the next frontier in observational cosmology. After the first stars formed, they produced a background of ultra-violet photons that affected the surrounding hydrogen gas, enabling the gas to be detected in absorption against the cosmic microwave background. In early 2018 this research team reported the first evidence for detection of this signal, but the amplitude was twice the predicted level and the timing of the signal was earlier than expected. This project will develop a new radio antenna and receiver that will improve on previous performance by a factor of three, enabling a verification of the previous detection and detailed characterization of the signal. The project will engage students from Arizona State University to build the instrument and analyze its data, preparing them for future careers. The research team will disseminate technical advances in radio instrumentation through technical memos and journal articles.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project targeted a weak and subtle signal from neutral hydrogen in the early universe, during a period known as \"Cosmic Dawn\", marked by the emergence of the first stars when the universe was a small fraction of its current age. Radiation from these stars caused a change in the surrounding hydrogen gas permeating the universe, and some of the radio background glow (the cosmic microwave background, or CMB) was absorbed by the hydrogen at specific frequencies. This absorption is very weak and hard to detect, but of profound significance to our understanding of the evolution of our universe, and the physics underlying that evolution.\n\n\nIn 2018, the EDGES team discovered the predicted absorption feature, which turned out to be quite a bit stronger than anticipated, posing a theoretical conundrum that has yet to be resolved. The measurement is a difficult one, and must be conducted from remote locations far from civilization in order to avoid human-generated radio interference. The sky itself also shines brightly at these frequencies (wavelengths of a few meters), and the signal being sought is 10,000 times fainter than the general sky glow, meaning the system must be capable of measurement precision at a level 10 times lower than that, or 100,000 times fainter than the sky glow. This award funded significant refinements of the EDGES instrument, already a state-of-the-art system, to allow even more precise measurements and to support deployments to different geographical locations.\n\n\nThis upgraded EDGES-3 system was deployed to three locations, including remote southeastern Oregon, Devon Island in the high Canadian arctic at 75 degrees north, and at a radio-quiet radio observatory in the western Australian outback. The data from these deployments validated the improved measurement quality of the EDGES-3 system, identified a range of additional challenges that any such experiment must overcome, and confirmed that the signal detected in 2018 appears to also be present, as originally detected and measured, in the EDGES-3 results. \n\n\nDue to the significance and theoretical importance of this result, the EDGES team, including partners at Arizona State University, have been developing a new data reduction pipeline with increased statistical rigor that is capable of more precisely setting confidence intervals on the parameters of any detected feature. The EDGES-3 hardware and deployments have provided the highest quality data to date in order to support this analysis.\n\n\nThis award supported a postdoctoral researcher, providing scientific training and field experience. The EDGES effort has generated significant public interest and is regularly featured in a range of outreach activities conducted by Haystack Observatory. The instrumentation involves an antenna system featuring exquisitely accurate absolute calibration, meaning that it is capable of radio signal measurements in the field of greater quantitative precision than any other system we are aware of. This has a variety of potential applications, both scientific and possibly commercial. Finally, the data collected by EDGES-3 contains unique information on phenomena unrelated to the early universe, such as solar burst activity, radio propagation conditions in the upper atmosphere, and the incidence of meteors constantly impacting the atmosphere and burning up.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/31/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ColinJLonsdale\n"
