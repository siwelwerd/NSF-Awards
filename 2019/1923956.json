The investigators will facilitate focused discussions on the factors that support and impede HSIs in securing funding. It is critical for the health of our nation to build capacity at HSIs to conduct research and advance educational attainment in computing of Hispanics and other underrepresented students, including first-generation and low-income populations \r\nwho are enrolled in high shares at most HSIs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
