 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the renewal of the existing Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site program associated with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) project at Caltech. The project will support thirteen undergraduate students for ten weeks of summer research per summer. LIGO provides a unique and exciting opportunity for undergraduate students to participate in the opening of an entirely new observational window on the Universe using and developing detectors with unprecedented precision. REU participants work closely with individual LIGO scientists on projects involving many aspects of detector technology, data analysis, and source modeling. Every student develops skills in scientific writing and communication, through preparation of a project proposal prior to the summer, progress reports, and a professional-quality presentation and report at the end of the summer.  \r\n\r\nThe LIGO REU program provides undergraduate students with a rewarding research experience at the frontiers of precision metrology, strong-field gravity, and observational astrophysics in which they make real and lasting contributions to a major scientific effort. Students work with and are mentored by professional scientists from LIGO Laboratory, Caltech theoretical astrophysics, and the global LIGO Scientific Collaboration and learn first-hand how large projects are organized and operate. They acquire new skills that are applicable in a broad range of technical careers, involving optics, lasers, electronics, servo controls, mechanical systems, data analysis, numerical relativity, astrophysical source modeling, software development, high throughput computing, and related technologies. They benefit from a well-established laboratory infrastructure, the availability of high-throughput computing, document control, safety and security procedures, and administrative support. A highlight of the summer is a trip to one of the LIGO Observatories.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

GWs are produced by some of the most energetic and interesting phenomena in the universe, where gravity is very strong and rapidly changing: neutron stars, black holes, the Big Bang. LIGO observations have opened a new and rich field of astrophysics.

During the summer, they visit the LIGO Livingston Observatory (LLO) in Louisiana, where they tour the facilities, including our outstanding Science Education Center. At the end of the summer, they present their research and results to all participants (other students, mentors, and interested members of the Laboratory and campus gravitational-wave community) in a 15-minute talk. They write up a final research report, following the standards of a scientific publication. All final papers are publicly available. In many cases, their work is or will be represented in scientific publication(s). Often, students present their results to their professors and peers at their home institutions.
