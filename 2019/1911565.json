 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part 1\r\nRecruiting undergraduate students to geoscience majors in\r\nTennessee is severely hampered by the fact that most Tennessee high schools do not offer\r\na geoscience class. As a result, students tend to graduate high school and enter college\r\nwith no real idea that geoscience is a potential major. Project ICE-AGE will engage with\r\nhigh school students by exposing them to the geosciences in the context of core science\r\nclasses. First, a series of \"Lessons-In-A-Box\" will be designed to meet state\r\neducational standards in the core sciences of biology, chemistry, and physics, but drawn\r\nexplicitly from interdisciplinary geoscience fields. These lessons will be tested with\r\nvisiting school groups at a campus museum, introduced to area teachers through\r\nworkshops and educational conferences, and circulated by the Knox County Public\r\nLibrary System. Second, the PIs will collaborate with three groups of high school students,\r\nincluding two that consist primarily of underrepresented minorities, on authentic\r\nscientific research. This work expands a project with one high school that has resulted in\r\nparticipation of students in writing a peer-reviewed paper, and four student-led\r\npresentations at regional and national scientific meetings. Finally, PIs will create two new\r\nclasses for future teachers in culturally responsive geoscience education and research\r\nmethods in science. Taken together, PIs expect to introduce area high school students and\r\nfuture teachers to the geosciences in such a way as to enhance their required learning\r\nobjectives and expose them to the potential for further study and employment in geology\r\nand related fields.\r\n\r\nPart 2\r\nThe project proposes to develop and deploy an integrated set of\r\nprograms that will engage high school students along a spectrum from one-day lessons\r\nthat will contact large numbers of students, to intensive, year-long research projects that\r\nwill involve a smaller number of students. PIs will also train pre-service STEM teachers\r\nin the use of active learning techniques using geological concepts. PIs will specifically\r\nwork with high school populations that are enriched in underrepresented minorities, in\r\norder to address the low diversity of current geoscience students and practitioners. PIs\r\nwill actively promote these programs to teachers around the country via teachers'\r\nworkshops, STEM education conferences, and professional geoscience conferences.\r\nFinally, this project will produce scholarship in the fields of education and geoscience.\r\nPIs expect that these efforts will expose ~165 high school students to authentic\r\ngeoscience research and at least 1000 students to Lessons-In-A-Box. The project will also help to\r\ntrain ~90 pre-service teachers, 6 graduate students, and 1 undergraduate in teaching\r\ngeoscience and generating culturally responsive lesson plans. This project will also lead\r\nto closer collaboration between faculty in the University of Tennessee's Departments of\r\nTheory and Practice in Teacher Education, and Earth and Planetary Sciences. In the long\r\nterm these collaborations will help EPS faculty to improve teaching techniques for\r\nundergraduates and to train more pre-service teachers in geoscience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The carbon cycle modeling lesson has been used in the same undergraduate geology course and has supported non-science majors in particular with concrete representations of carbon cycling and structure. The kits were designed to be scalable to different academic grades, making them accessible to a broader array of students. Notably, both kits fulfill next generation science standards for high school chemistry and biology courses, which are required in Tennessee, and general education science requirements at both participating universities.
