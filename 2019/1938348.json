 "awd_abstract_narration": "How can computers be used to answer big questions in the humanities and social sciences? Since its inception in 2009, the Digging into Data Challenge program has helped to spark exciting new research avenues for the humanities and social sciences utilizing computational techniques. Digging into Data projects span continents and traditional disciplinary boundaries. They bring together social scientists and humanists with computational and digital scholars, and they bring together researchers from different global perspectives and traditions. In this way, the Digging into Data initiative has wide impacts across academia and into industry. This conference will contribute importantly to shaping the future of the Trans-Atlantic Platform and of the Digging into Data Challenge initiative. The conference will be centered around participants from the Digging into Data funded projects and representatives from the funding agencies, but the conference will be publicized and open to the public.\r\n\r\nThis conference brings together research teams from eleven countries to present their work applying large-scale computational techniques to research questions in the humanities and social sciences. The presenters will be current or past recipients of grants from The Digging into Data Challenge, a program of the Trans-Atlantic Platform for the Social Sciences and Humanities. Participating nations and funding organizations include:  Argentina (MINCyT); Brazil (FAPESP); Canada (SSHRC, NSERC, FRQ); Finland (AKA); France (ANR); Germany (DFG); Mexico (CONACYT); Netherlands (NWO); Portugal (FCT); United Kingdom (AHRC, ESRC), and United States (NEH, NSF, IMLS). Researchers are working on projects in areas such as musicology, economics, linguistics, political science, and history. They will share the results of their research projects and participate in a larger discussion about the sustainability of Digging into Data and the projects that have been funded. This conference will take a longitudinal perspective on the initiative after four funding cycles, to help participating funding agencies make informed decisions about the future of this initiative.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This conference showcased all 14 projects supported by funding agencies from 11 countries involved in the Trans-Atlantic Platform (Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Mexico, Netherlands, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States). These projects examined large-scale data about spoken and written language, music, stock trading, social media, journalism, history, folklore, information flow, and data storage. The conference involved 34 Principal Investigators and other team members from the 14 projects, representing 10 of the 11 countries involved in the Trans-Atlantic Platform. Eight Principal Investigators from previous rounds of the Digging into Data Challenge served as discussants, panelists, and workshop facilitators, representing the four countries involved in the first three rounds of the Digging into Data Challenge (US, Canada, UK, and the Netherlands). All of these people came together for three days to hear the results of the specific projects and to generally discuss the sustainability of data-intensive projects in the humanities and social sciences, the communities that develop around them, and how they may be funded in the future.
