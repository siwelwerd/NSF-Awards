The conference focuses on\r\nrecent developments in Operator Algebras and Operator Theory.  This symposium\r\naims to be a conference covering broad areas with large participation,\r\nincluding many young people, who are encouraged to give talks.\r\n\r\nA number of distinguished mathematicians have already agreed to attend\r\nand speak at this conference.  This award gives early career\r\nresearchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded\r\nby NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this\r\nconference.  The organizing committee will strive to make this funding\r\nopportunity known to target groups through a number of different\r\nactivities.  More information will be made available at:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.math.tamu.edu/~kerr/gpots2019/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
