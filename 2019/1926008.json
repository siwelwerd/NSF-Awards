 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will continue the US contribution to the RAPID-MOCHA oceanographic mooring array at 26.5N in the Atlantic Ocean for an additional 18 months, bringing the length of data record to 17.5 years. This time series monitors the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and meridional heat transport in the Atlantic Ocean. The RAPID-MOCHA array has yielded results that have changed widely held views about the deep ocean circulation and movement of heat across the ocean basin. Continued monitoring of the ocean structure and currents will allow oceanographers to better determine the relevant dynamics that control heat transport and to improve representations of the ocean role in climate models.\r\n\r\nThe AMOC is known to be an important component of the climate system and it is believed that better understanding of the ocean dynamics that control heat transport in the AMOC will lead to better fundamental understanding of the Earth?s climate system and improved climate prediction. The 18-month extension of the RAPID-MOCHA will allow for longer term planning and reconsideration of the mooring array configurations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

As of March 2023 we have completed 18.9 years of observations.&nbsp;Estimates of the AMOC strength and ocean meridional heat transport (MHT) have been published and made publicly available for the period from April 2004 to December 2020, which constitutes the latest update of the full time series from the data that have been recovered and processed to date.</p>\n<p>The AMOC shows large short-term variability at 26.5 N with 10-day estimates varying over a range of about 0-30 Sv (<span>Fig. 1</span><em>a</em>). The Gulf Stream, Ekman and mid-ocean transports all contribute to the AMOC variability, but their respective contributions are a strong function of time scale, with the mid-ocean transport having dominated the low-frequency variability thus far (<span>Fig. 1</span><em>b</em>).</p>\n<p>The first 4 years of the AMOC time series were dominated by an annual cycle, which was shown to be caused by seasonal wind stress curl variations mainly in the eastern part of the basin, and that can be largely explained by wind-forced Rossby wave dynamics. In 2009, the observed seasonal cycle began to break down and instead a large negative AMOC anomaly occurred in the winter of 2009-2010 with sustained values below 10 Sv. This low AMOC state was forced in part by reduced Ekman transports associated with extreme low values of the NAO index in winter 2009-2010, which recurred again in winter 2010-2011. However, the geostrophic mid-ocean circulation also increased in strength (trending towards more southward transport) after 2008 leading up to this event, which also contributed to its intensity. The 0.6 Sv yr<span>&minus;1 </span>decline of the AMOC over the period from 2007 to 2011 was almost 10 times larger than the rate of long-term decline predicted by the IPCC as a result of climate change, and is believed to represent an interannual anomaly linked to wind forcing over the North Atlantic rather than an anthropogenically forced change.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, since 2011 the AMOC has continued to occupy a weaker state relative to the first years of observations, with annual mean values in the range of 15-17 versus 18-19 Sv during 2004-2008. It is not clear that this can be explained by wind forcing and it has been suggested that the overall downtrend of the AMOC over the RAPID time period is linked to reduced convection in the Labrador Sea after 2000 that propagates via density anomalies to the subtropics on time scales of 7-8 years. Over the 2005-2011 period, we observed a decreasing trend in densities within the DWBC off Abaco (not only within the Labrador Sea Water layer but through the whole NADW water column from approximately 1200-4500 m), which could be consistent with this explanation. Some part of this downtrend could also be linked to anthropogenically forced changes, but the observational record is still too short to discern a forced trend from decadal scale internal variability.</p>\n<p>The average strength of the AMOC over the entire period of the RAPID array to date (April 2004-December 2020) is 16.9 +-1.2 Sv. The corresponding time-mean MHT over the total duration of the measurements (2004-2020) is 1.20 +- 0.12 PW. Annual averages of the MHT for the first 5 years (2004-2008) were close to 1.3 PW, followed by a drop to values near 1.0 PW during 2009-2010, after which the MHT recovered to values of 1.05 - 1.22 PW during 2011-2017 but still consistently lower than in the first 5 years of measurement. (Fig. 2). Only in the last few years (2018 and 2020) have the annual mean values begun to approach the approximately 1.3 PW values that were observed in the first 5 years of measurement. Even when excluding the extreme low values of the MHT during 2009-2010, the mean MHT over the last decade of measurements (2011-2020) is 1.17 +- 0.09 PW, about 0.15 PW smaller than during the first 5 years of measurement. These large changes in MHT have been shown to have a measurable impact on the heat budget of the North Atlantic. The large reduction in MHT during 2009-2010 caused a dramatic cooling of the northern subtropical gyre - the largest heat content drop observed over that region in 60 years - which had follow-on impacts on western European winter climate and the subsequent development of the NAO in winter of 2011. While the extreme 2009-2010 AMOC event mainly impacted the northern subtropics, the sustained MHT reduction since 2009 appears to have had its greatest impact on the subpolar gyre, where broad cooling of up to 2 degC in SST has occurred since 2009.</p>\n<p><span><br /></span></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/30/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: William&nbsp;E&nbsp;Johns</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1926008/1926008_10620915_1698349302702_Fig3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1926008/1926008_10620915_1698349302702_Fig3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"AMOC TIme Series\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1926008/1926008_10620915_1698349302702_Fig3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"AMOC TIme Series\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Top panel: AMOC time series with upper ocean components (Florida Current, Ekman, and upper mid-ocean transport), and the transports within the upper and lower NADW layers.
