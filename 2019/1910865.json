 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports participation of US based mathematicians in the workshop \"Quasi-isometries and  groups: rigidity and classification\" which will take place from September 9th until September 14th, 2019, in Ventotene, Italy. A major goal of the workshop is to train and support the next generation of mathematicians in the field of coarse geometry and quasi-isometries. The conference will help to educate graduate students and recent PhDs on the latest developments in the field. The conference will introduce junior mathematicians to various topics in geometric group theory and bring them up to the forefront of research. A part of the conference will be devoted to three mini-courses, taught by experts known also for their ability to give enlightening lectures. In parallel to the minicourses, there will be research talks. The speakers will be prompted by the organizers to aim their lectures at a broad audience of mathematicians. The majority of funding will support junior participants coming from USA. The organizing committee will encourage and support broad and diverse participation. In particular, women mathematicians and members of other under-represented groups are especially encouraged to apply for support. \r\n\r\nThe workshop consists of the following three minicourses on different aspects of \"Quasi-isometric rigidity for certain classes of solvable groups\"  (Tullia Dymarz, University of Wisconsin), \"The asymptotic geometry of certain Artin groups\"(Jingyin Huang, Ohio State University), and \"Analysis on boundaries of hyperbolic groups\" (John MacKay, University of Bristol). The workshop will also feature research talks and informal discussions. Participants will include leading U.S. and European researchers from different areas relevant to the centerpiece of the workshop (3-manifold topology, geometric group theory and hyperbolic geometry) as well as junior researchers, both graduate students and postdocs. Additional information can be found at the workshop website https://www.ventoteneinternationalworkshops.net/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
