 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the Oklahoma State University (OSU) to acquire a confocal laser scanning microscope. The instrument will provide advanced imaging capabilities to support research from faculty, postdoctoral researchers, graduate students and undergraduate students in over 10 departments from OSU Stillwater campus, Tulsa campus, and other institutes in Oklahoma. The proposed microscope will become part of the array of equipment that the OSU Microscopy Lab uses for public outreach and engagement, including STEM education at the K-12 level. This project is also embedded in the OSU research mission and provides support and training opportunities to students from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in the sciences. This project will have an immediate impact on 62 individuals from underrepresented groups. Acquisition of this instrument will not only impact research and research training but will also play an important role in development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce by advancing research at OSU and assisting in the recruitment of underrepresented minority students. \r\n\r\nThe microscope has specialized capabilities for high-resolution scanning, live-cell imaging, and 3D reconstruction. Primary projects to be supported include but are not limited to: stem cell differentiation modeling, 3D tissue-engineered modeling, virus-like particles for gene delivery, and innate immune response to viral infection. Other research areas impacted include host-pathogen interactions, pathogen detection and mitigation, regulation of signaling pathways, cell differentiation, plant development, and the characterization of nanomaterials. New capabilities provided by the award will allow users to expand the scope of their research, advance current projects and promote new research directions. The research will be disseminated through professional presentations, peer-reviewed publications, curriculum development, workshops, and outreach activities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
