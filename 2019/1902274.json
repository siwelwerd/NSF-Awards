 "awd_abstract_narration": "At heart, arithmetic geometry is a subject that aims to understand systems of polynomial equations in many variables, with the constraint that the coordinates of the solutions be rational numbers or integers.  A system of polynomial equations has a geometric avatar, called an algebraic variety.  The mantra of arithmetic geometry is that geometric properties of an algebraic variety, like curvature, bear strongly on the types and the structure of solutions to the underlying system of polynomial equations.  The PI studies systems of polynomial equations whose algebraic varieties are surfaces, i.e., they are two-dimensional.  Algebraic surfaces are classified into four rough phyla. Within this classification, the PI studies the class of K3 surfaces, within a phylum of \"intermediate complexity.\"  Our knowledge of the geometry of K3 surfaces is ripe enough now for a meaningful study of the rational points they harbor.  The projects supported by this award aim to answer questions like: given a set of polynomial equation that define a K3 surface, is there an algorithm that will determine whether the system of equations has solutions?  If so, can this algorithm be implemented?\r\n\r\nK3 surfaces have a rich and structured geometry; their arithmetic is subtle, yet conceivably tractable. A host of conjectures in the last 10 years point to a surprising expectation: given equations for a K3 surface over a number field, there should be an algorithm that detects whether the surface caries rational points. Many of the projects are designed to either provide evidence towards this expectation, or to give practical methods for detecting the existence of rational points on K3 surfaces.  Proposed projects include a detailed study of moduli spaces of K3 surfaces with Brauer group level structures, as well as a type of inverse Galois problem to study the possible algebraic Brauer groups of K3 surfaces.  The PI also proposes to study a class of orbifold points on algebraic varieties that interpolate between rational points and integral points, and to do so in a uniform way, so as to develop a better understanding of when treatments of these two types of points must be separated.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nAlmost 1800 years ago, Diophantus of Alexandria began the systematic study of whole-number solutions to polynomial equations with integer coefficients; today we call such equations Diophantine equations. The quest to solve particular kinds of diophantine equations has captivatived countless generations; Fermat's Last Theorem, an inarguably famous cornerstone of 20th century Mathematics, is fundamentally a diophantine equation problem.\n\n\nThe research supported by this grant aimed at understanding specific kinds of diophantine equations through the properties of their geometric avatars. Just like the real solutions to the equation x2+ y2= 1 can be interpreted as the unit circle on the plane, every system of diophantine equations has a geometric counterpart, called a variety. Properties of this variety, like its curvature, are known to bear on the possible solutions of the original system of equations.\n\n\nIn the 20th Century, diophantine equations defining elliptic curves played a fundamental role in the development of number theory, as well as in real-world applications, like cryptography. Moving up in dimension to systems of equations with 2-dimensional geometric avatars, elliptic curves can be generalized to either abelian surfaces or K3 surfaces. Our knowledge of the geometry of K3 surfaces today mirrors our knowledge of the geometry of elliptic curves in the early 20th century. So the time is ripe for the study of the number theory of K3 surfaces!The first set suite of problems proposed in this grant involved the arithmetic of K3 surfaces.\n\n\nIn 2009 Skorobogatov conjectured that an invariant of a K3 surface called the Brauer group essentially governs if the corresponding system of diophantine equations can be solved, after some easy consistency checks. In this project, I studied, among other things, the construction of exotic elements of the Brauer group of K3 surfaces blocking the existence of solutions to the corresponding diophantine problems, as well as the behavior of Brauer groups in families of K3 surfaces. In 2015 I conjectured there are only finitely many possible Brauer groups that for K3 surfaces over the rational numbers; I gave more evidence for this conjecture as part of the grant.\n\n\nAs often happens, unexpected new research directions emerge during a project. During this award, in joint work with Nils Bruin and Jordan Thomas, we studied a famous diophantine problem whose geometric avatar is also a surface (albeit not a K3 surface). The problem is to find a 3 x 3 magic square of squares. Bruin, Thomas and I showed that it is very unlikely, in a sense that can be made precise, that such a square exists. I wrote up a note about this, and other problems, for the Notices of the American Mathematical Society, and recorded a Numberphile video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdsj84UdeYg\n\n\nThe second half of the grant involved studying points on varieties whose coordinates are rational numbers with prescribed properties in their denominators (e.g., if a prime p divides a denominator, then in fact p2or p3must divide the denominator). These points are known as Campana points, and they interpolate between points with arbitrary rational coordinates and those with integral coordinates. In tis grant, we gave a robust definition of Campana points that is compatible with some long-standing conjectures (e.g., Manin's conjecture) and we studied the distribution of Campana points on a large collection of diophantine problems. The resulting paper has already generated a vigorous amount of research by other mathematicians.\n\n\nAs a result of furthering our understanding of rational points on surfaces, I was able to collaborate with Ceclia Salgado and Felipe Voloch to construct codes out of algebraic surfaces with good local recoverability properties. In simpler terms: when we store large amounts of information (e.g., a sever farm that is part of the cloud), data losses are inevitable (hard drives fail!). Our work is part of a theoretical study of how one can build redundancy into information in such a way that when some of the information is lost, it can be reconstructed by accessing the information still available. We used surfaces over finite number systems to construct an encoding system that can help reconstruct lost information, while not being wasteful about the amount of back-up data needed.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/17/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: AnthonyVarilly-Alvarado\n"
