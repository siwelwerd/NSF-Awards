 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this workshop is to have a group of leading experts from government, industry, and academia with expertise covering microelectronics, semiconductor materials, wireless systems, internet-of-things (IoT), RF antennas and electromagnetic wave propagation, analog/mixed-signal processing, etc. to discuss how the RF/analog technologies in microelectronics and electromagnetics can advance the security of future communications and sensing. The workshop will focus on two main objectives: (1) Security vulnerability in RF/analog microelectronics and electromagnetics; (2) Secured Communications and Sensing by RF/analog microelectronics and electromagnetics. The outcome of the workshop will be a report on the needs and challenges in RF/analog-based security for future communication and sensing systems. The outcome of the workshop is expected to encourage researchers from different research communities to work together and explore opportunities for new security techniques in RF/analog hardware domain, which may lead to new avenues of important research. The two-day workshop will feature keynote talks, panel discussions, breakout sessions, and a wrap-up conclusion session.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
