 "awd_abstract_narration": "Information and decision systems are an essential part of many present-day systems in a vast array of domains, from engineering and operations to the social sciences and the life sciences. For example, communications and information technology is ever-present in many daily activities, while autonomous systems are also becoming ubiquitous. This two-day workshop will lay out the foundations for future research in the underlying information and decision sciences and will help identify critical open problems to be addressed by the community. \r\n\r\nMany of the spectacular recent advances in data science and machine intelligence are all about systems that process information, and then make inferences and decisions. Research in information and decision sciences provides much of the methodological core that underlies such developments, illustrating that despite tremendous changes in the technological landscape, many of the fundamental ideas and tools are timeless. This workshop will examine the past, present, and future of the field of Information and Decision Sciences, with focus on the following themes: Systems, Optimization, and Control; Communications, Information Theory, and Networks; Data, Inference, and Machine Learning; and Transitions from theory into practice or between fields. This intellectually significant event will act as a catalyst for opening new research directions along these themes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
