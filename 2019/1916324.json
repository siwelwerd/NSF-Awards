The Course will provide an overview of scattering techniques that probe the structure and dynamics of polymers. It will also highlight ways to integrate scattering data with molecular simulations and microscopy, as well as approaches to manage the large data sets typical of scattering measurements. The majority of attendees at the workshop are expected to be graduate students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The short course was organized by Gila Stein from the University of Tennessee. Funds from NSF were used to support student attendance at the conference by reimbursing the short course registration fee. The curriculum included the following topics, with presenters noted in parentheses: Small angle scattering (Karen Winey, Mark Dadmun), Reflectivity (David Bucknall), Grazing Incidence X-ray Scattering (Eva Herzig), Soft X-ray Scattering and Reflectivity (Dean DeLongchamp, Eliot Gann), X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (Sunil Sinha), Neutron Spin Echo (Rana Ashkar), Machine learning/big data (Alex Hexemer), and Quasielastic Neutron Scattering (Chris Soles). The presenters reflect the growing diversity of the DPOLY community, including three women, one early career faculty, and two international scientists. Course materials were distributed to all participants via a shared Google drive (presentations for each module, prepared by the speakers). A related symposium was held during the APS meeting that highlighted the research of several course instructors (Mark Dadmun, Eva Herzig, David Bucknall, and Rana Ashkar).
