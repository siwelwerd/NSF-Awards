 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bag-valve masks are simple, squeezable tools for manual ventilation of patients and are the most common manual method used in both emergencies and routine surgical procedures. The simplicity and minimal cost of BVMs have contributed to their widespread use and sales of approximately 13.1 million disposable resuscitators annually in the U.S. alone. Despite the regular use of BVMs, providers of any training level regularly deliver ineffective ventilation or uncontrolled, inadvertent, forced over-inflation. Studies show that, while using a standard BVM, 88.4% of trained users exceeding the recommended pressure and 73.8% exceeding the recommended volume range2 Improper ventilation for even short periods can lead to two major complications 1) Lung injury from over-stretching (called volutrauma); too much air and 2) Lung injury from over-pressurization (called barotrauma); too much pressure. These conditions can lead to life-threatening conditions as well as prolonged and expensive hospital stays with costs approaching $170,000 (CAD) per injury. \r\n\r\nWhen used in emergency situations, execution of proper BVM technique is required to provide optimal oxygenation during CPR. Devices to monitor the depth and rate of CPR compressions are widely available and are soon to be required in all training centers by the AHA.  However, no technologies exist to provide similar feedback for manual ventilation. It is likely that real-time feedback can reduce or eliminate the rate of dangerous ventilation among caregivers of all levels and that BVM training with feedback can lead to improved skill retention. Thus, a novel  technique and complementary device have been developed to provide real time feedback to trained and training personnel and ensure they meet guidelines from the American Heart Association (AHA) and European Resuscitation Council (ERC). This project is a comprehensive system development pathway composed of three aims that will refine our sensor system and initiate studies into the benefits of real-time feedback during BVM usage. This method utilizes a unique sensor system that can be coupled to a bag valve mask to measure the air pressure and volume delivered to a patient. Using these metrics for each squeeze of the bag, this device can alert users of both excessive pressure and volume in real time.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
