 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Harvard University to do research to develop a novel instrument for studying the mechanics of cells, tissues, and biological materials. Forces ultimately drive the motions that underlie biological functions, but very little is known about them because of the lack of relevant experimental techniques. The instrument that will be developed will help to remedy this situation. The project will result in undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows being trained to create novel technologies that combine approaches from nanofabrication, optics, and biology. Students and fellows will be recruited to take part in the development effort through a research exchange program. Participants will also be coached in professional skills and learn how to work at the interface between biology, engineering, physics, and math. Middle school students will be introduced to microscopy and will learn about the excitement of developing cutting edge instrumentation.\r\n\r\nThe instrument will make use of nanofabricated wires to manipulate magnetic fields. These magnetic fields will be used to control forces simultaneously exerted on multiple magnetic beads, allowing them to exert complex patterns of forces on cells and tissues. At the same time, the instrument will also employ femtosecond laser ablation to rapidly cut three-dimensional patterns with submicron resolution. The combination of applying forces with magnetic beads and cutting with laser ablation will provide a means to dissect internal forces, how they are generated, and the responses they produce. Research projects enabled by this instrument include the characterization of forces involved in chromosome segregation, nuclear envelope rupture and repair, and DNA breaks, as well as the mechanics of gastrulation and limb development. Creating the instrument will require the optimization of nanofabrication procedures and optical controls, and their integration. The results from this development activity will be disseminated in peer-reviewed publications and at scientific meetings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
