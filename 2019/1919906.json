 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly funded by the Chemical Research Instrumentation (CRIF) program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program. Professor Paul Rupar from the University of Alabama Tuscaloosa and colleagues Elizabeth Papish, Jason Bara, Marco Bonizzoni and Lukasz Ciesla are acquiring a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometers measure the interaction of radio waves with a sample's atomic nuclei in the presence of a strong magnetic field. The information provided by NMR spectrometers allows researchers to identify unknown substances, determine the structure of molecules, macromolecules, and biomolecules, and monitor reaction dynamics in solution. Because of its versatility, ease of use, and non-destructive nature, NMR spectroscopy supports much of modern chemical-based research and is critical to the fields of organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, biology, chemical engineering, biochemistry and materials science. The cryogenic probe provides a significant increase in sensitivity relative to standard NMR probes. The instrument is also used to train undergraduate and graduate students in the use of this powerful tool. The spectrometer is available for use by researchers at other institutions including Tuskegee University and Samford University.\r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. Many research projects are progress and aided by this spectrometer. One project conducts structural studies of polymers used in chemical sensors, three-dimensional (3D) printing and in non-viral gene-transfection. Studies of the reduction of carbon dioxide catalyzed by transition metals are also being carried out. Work in another research group focuses on the bioinorganic chemistry of chromium, a potent mutagen and carcinogen when present as chromate. Routes to the development of pure cellulose-based plastics using current 3D printing technology are under study. Carbon dioxide reduction using ruthenium complexes as catalysts is also being investigated including efforts to eliminate the photosensitizer in the reduction process.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis NSF MRI grant allowed for the purchase of a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer  equipped with a cryogenically cooled probe (CP-NMR).  The CP-NMR is being used for research and teaching at the University of Alabama (UA) in Tuscaloosa.  The instrument, a Bruker NEO500, was commissioned in June 2021.   \n\nNMR spectrometers allow scientists to probe matter at the molecular level, gain insights into molecular structures and molecular interactions, observe chemical transformations, and seek out new compounds in complex mixtures.  The CP-NMR is a state-of-the-art NMR spectrometer that has greatly improved resolution, sensitivity, and sample throughput compared to existing NMR spectrometers in the UA NMR facility.  To date, the CP-NMR has been used by over 55 UA researchers from the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, and Biological Science.  Research efforts that use the CP-NMR include the structural studies of polymers; the identification of secondary metabolites in complex mixtures to combat neurodegenerative diseases; the detection of reactive intermediates in transition metal-catalyzed CO2 reduction; and structural insights into phosphorus-containing biopolymers. \n\nHighlights of research results made possible by the CP-NMR include the synthesis of novel amine-containing polymers with the potential to act as non-viral gene transfection vectors and CO2 capture capabilities (Rupar), the synthesis of novel polymers via the chemical upcycling of waste polyester (Rupar), the report of cobalt-based catalyst for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 (Papish), the synthesis of ionic liquids (IL) and IL-based polymers for CO2 capture and separations (Bara), improved understanding of binding of cyclodextrin with phenolic and carbohydrates analytes (Bonizzoni), an improved understanding of the potential of chromium to bind and damage DNA (Vincent), and the identification of flavonoids responsible for neuroprotection in the Drosophila model of Parkinson\u2019s disease (Ciesla). To date, 11 peer-reviewed publications have resulted from research added by the CP-NMR.\n\nThe CP-NMR has become a centerpiece in undergraduate education at UA. The high-throughput capabilities of the CP-NMR allow undergraduate students to collect NMR spectra of their chemical samples from teaching laboratory experiments.  Approximately 60 students/year enrolled in 338 Organic Chemistry Labs have ca. 300 1H NMR spectra/year acquired on the CP-NMR.   Students enrolled in CH413 Inorganic Chemistry (ca. 20/year) routinely use the CP-NMR for sample characterization.   In CH424 (Instrumental Analysis), ca. 12 students per year get hands-on experience with CP-NMR as part of the quantitative analysis of caffeine in commercial beverages. \n\n The CP-NMR also plays a supporting role in broader impact activities at UA.  Undergraduate students from Stillman College (an HBCU), as part of the NSF-funded RII-BEC program, were introduced to the NMR facility.  The RII-BEC program project goals include enhancing the competitiveness of HBCU student participants preparing to enter the STEM workforce.  Undergraduate students participating in the \"Interdisciplinary Application of Advanced Polymers for Engineering Innovations\" REU program also made use of the CP-NMR.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/08/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul Rupar"
