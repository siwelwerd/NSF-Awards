 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project will support data collection efforts to capture the after-effects of Hurricane Florence on the Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina (FBCENC). Food Banks operate a unique supply chain network to support people in hunger need in their service region. Natural disasters like hurricanes disrupt the normal operation of a food bank causing a sudden increase in demand, damaging sources of local supplies and upsetting the regular food delivery system. During Hurricane Florence, FBCENC operations were severely disrupted as more than 50 percent of their service network including two branch locations were affected by the storm. Immediately after the storm, FBCENC needed to respond to the disruption caused by Florence while keeping the regular business of satisfying dynamic hunger need. This RAPID NSF project will collect data on the challenges encountered by FBCENC after Hurricane Florence to provide insight for how nonprofit food distribution organizations can prepare, respond, and recover from disruptions to their network. This scientific research contribution thus supports NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and to advance our national welfare. In this case, the benefits will be insights to improve management of humanitarian logistics post disaster which can save lives and reduce economic losses. \r\n\r\nThis RAPID project will collect time sensitive operational information and data related to a food bank network's preparation, incident management and recovery for Hurricane Florence. The research objectives of the project are to: (i) study the decisions taken by a food bank having its operational network undergoing a natural disaster; (ii) scrutinize the responses of the  human components (donors, food bank personnel, agency owners, clients) in the disrupted network; (iii) characterize the impact on demand and supply before, during and after a disaster; (iv) identify the optimal trade-offs between equity, efficiency, and effectiveness for disaster preparation and recovery; and (v) distinguish the disaster-related parameters impacting  food demand. The project will facilitate the study of how the differences in organizational characteristics and structure affect the ability of food banks (and agencies) to be resilient to the impact of disasters like hurricanes. This project will collect the data necessary to develop smart recommendations for disaster preparedness and response based on field data collected from a large-scale network disruptive event.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our research captures (i) the strategies used by food bank decision makers to prepare, manage and recover from the impact of the hurricane; (ii) identify the greatest vulnerabilities to the food distribution network; and (iii) identify the key similarities and differences between the organizational characteristics and structures of the branches and agencies in the impacted areas. </span><span>Our knowledge capture integrates focus groups, semi-structured interviews, surveys, process observations, and operational data analysis. </span><span>The goals of this process is to collect data that can describe: (i) what happened to the FBCENC network after the hurricane; (ii) what decisions FBCENC made to recover from the disruption in their food distribution network due to the damage caused by the hurricane; (iii) how this decision process evolved over time as the post disaster recovery evolved; (iv) what special activities (additional and/or different activities) had to be performed that were not part of&nbsp; the normal operating activities; (v) of FBCENC's normal activities, which changed the most significantly because of the disaster and how did these activities change; (vi) what new decision making had to be performed because of the disaster; (vii) what activities and decisions were inhibited due to a lack of information during the disaster preparation, response or recovery; (viii) how the system adapted to compensate for the information disruptions; and (ix) what organizational roles may have been changed during the disaster preparation response or recovery and how.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Across the interviews several key themes emerged: Learning from Hurricane Matthew, Uniqueness of Florence, Off-site Storage Space, Community, Adaptability and Continuous Improvement, and Mental Health Impacts. The focus group discussions revealed several emergent themes: Preparation, Impacts, Response, Adaptation, Equity, Social Networks, and Rebuilding-Recovery-Resilience.&nbsp; We also found that these themes overlapped in meaningful ways with theoretical constructs related to social capital and resilience. The process observations highlighted the significant role that capacity both human and physical played in sustaining operations pre- and post-disaster. Storage capacity played a critical role in pre- and post-disaster operations. In addition, with the increased (and sustained) demand generated by the hurricane, the additional warehouse space has played a critical role in augmenting the branch distribution capacity before, during and post-disaster. In fact, this additional storage capacity has played a significant role in supporting pandemic response. Volunteers played a significant role in sustaining operations and supplementing distribution capacity. At all levels of FBCENC, from the hub in Raleigh to the impacted branches, supplemental volunteer staff supported operations for several months. Our observations highlighted that this need to supplement capacity was sustained over several months (some need remained more than a year after the disaster). Visualization of donation and distribution data provided insight into the impact of the hurricane at the branch, county and agency levels. These analyses showed significant increases in the donation and distribution of non-food items during the disaster. From September 10 - November 19, 2018, the network observed a 20% increase in food donation, 360% increase in non-food donation, 23% increase in food distribution, and 374% increase in non-food distribution. The statistical analysis showed significant interaction between the impact and phase of the disaster, and between the affected branches and phase of the disaster.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>To understand and identify the timing and attributes of the recovery period for FBCENC, we integrated our data analyses, process observations and the findings and themes from the interviews, focus groups, and survey. These analyses were used to identify significant changes in the distribution and donation patterns to capture the timing of the recovery period. Our analyses of the focus group and operational data suggest the resilience of FBCENC was connected to its robust network where non-impacted areas of the networks supported impacted areas of the network to facilitate recovery. Agency leaders discussed short-term and longer-term aspects of recovery and rebuilding.&nbsp; Across the focus groups, agency leaders noted the crucial role in recovery played by interagency/group relationships, cultural support systems, and access to additional resources.&nbsp; Agency leaders described how the established relationships they had with other agencies, organizations, and churches were leveraged during the immediate efforts to rebuild and recover.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/01/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by:
