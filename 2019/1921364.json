 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research proposal is to develop a class of novel mobile smart glucose monitoring system (mSGMS) that is able to detect glucose levels from interstitial fluid without the use of an external power source or a battery. In a clinical context, the work will provide a new technique for continuous glucose measurement that is far more effective at detecting transient changes in glucose levels. The mSGMS will provide faster analysis and better diagnostic information, with the added benefit of responding rapidly to abnormalities in glucose levels. The ability to continuously monitor glucose means it will no longer be necessary to frequently sample blood with some associated degree of inconvenience and pain.  The smart glucose monitoring system integrated with data transmission-communication modules could potentially replace continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) used in monitoring blood glucose in healthcare applications. Educational outreach activities and research experiences will be developed to engage Baltimore area high school students, undergraduates, and graduate students in the proposed research. This work will be of significant use in improving glycemic control and improving the quality of life with fewer complications and lower healthcare costs. \r\n\r\n\r\nA class of novel stretchable and flexible mobile smart glucose monitoring system (mSGMS) capable of continuous glucose measurement that is far more effective at detecting transient changes in glucose levels from interstitial fluid is proposed. The development of the mSGMS will be achieved through the following specific aims: (Aim 1) Design, fabricate and test the smart glucose monitoring system capable of detecting glucose levels. (Aim 2) Develop a mobile smart glucose monitoring system (mSGMS) that integrates wireless telemetry and performs data collection, signal processing, data analysis, and information transmission to patient and caregivers, and (Aim 3) encapsulate the smart glucose monitoring system. The proposed research is innovative because the mSGMS generates and accumulates electrical power in a capacitor via a charge pump integrated circuit (IC) as a result of the oxidation of interstitial glucose for sensing glucose without the use of a potentiostat circuit or an external power source, while simultaneously via a DC-DC converter powering the data acquisition, processing, and data transmission-communication modules. This research offers tremendous opportunities to overcome the limitations of commercially available glucose monitoring technologies by providing a device that allows sensitive and rapid detection of transient changes in interstitial glucose concentration. The proposed studies will generate continuous glucose recording in interstitial fluid samples from patients with type 1 diabetes for long duration.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
