 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates centromere function and evolution in fruit flies (Drosophila). Centromeres are essential chromosome regions that ensure proper chromosome segregation during cell divisions. Variation in centromeres impacts genome evolution, speciation, and human disease. Little is known about the role of specific DNA sequences in centromere function and evolution. Drosophila species are excellent model organisms to study fundamental aspects of centromere biology because of their compact genome sizes. The project will investigate centromere variation within and between species to gain insights into the function and evolution of centromeric DNA sequences. The project will also generate interdisciplinary research opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral trainees, with a focus on increasing participation from underrepresented groups in STEM. The educational goals are to: 1) integrate research and data from the project into the PI's \"Applied Genomics\" course; 2) recruit diverse undergraduates for research on the project; and 3) increase participation from groups underrepresented in STEM through summer workshops.\r\n\r\nCentromeres vary in size and complexity across organisms. Retrotransposons are conserved features of centromeres in plants, mammals, yeast, and insects, but their roles in centromere function and evolution are unknown. The project will investigate centromere dynamics in Drosophila to understand how retrotransposons shape molecular and evolutionary aspects of centromere organization. The research goals are to combine genomic, molecular, and genetic approaches to: 1) determine centromere organization in closely related species of Drosophila melanogaster and the simulans clade; and 2) study the pattern, age, frequency, and activity of retrotransposon insertions to test the hypothesis that these elements are under selection for centromere function. This work is important for broadly understanding the functional implications of structural variation at centromeres and the role of retrotransposons in genome evolution.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
