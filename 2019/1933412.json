 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is significant from both economic and societal standpoints.  There are 8 million people in the US who are Visually Impaired (VI).  A large percent of adults with VI are unemployed. This platform helps to address these challenges by allowing VI individuals to be physically and socially mobile. The platform reads characters and identifies objects and communicates this information to the user. When the VI user needs immediate help, the system can stream a video feed to friends or family members to provide immediate support.  This platform creates value through reducing the demands placed on VI caregivers.  It is also expected to reduce insurance premiums by minimizing accidents.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project combines AI (Artificial Intelligence) and community based peer-to-peer support. This technology uses well tested AI features such as character and object recognition. By eliminating the high end features of AI, both uncertainty and costs are reduced. The other technology, the peer-to-peer support system, typically uses either paid or unpaid helpers.  For peer-to-peer support, this system includes helpers identified by the users. By blending proven features of two technologies and allowing the users to use their own helpers, this system represents a new innovative and customized technology. The Visually Impaired (VI) population can potentially use the platform with ease and comfort.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
