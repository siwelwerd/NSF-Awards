 "awd_abstract_narration": "Communities on modern river deltas with total populations greater than 500 million people face threats from global reductions in river sediment, land subsidence and rising sea level. Risk mitigation efforts may require intensive computer simulations that are integrated with data collection and engineering analytics for guidance. This project establishes a Coastal Resilience Collaboratory with a three-fold mission: 1) enhance the collaboration among earth scientists, computer scientists, cyberinfrastructure specialists and coastal engineers tasked with solving the sustainability issues of deltaic coasts; 2) identify risk mitigation for coastal communities subject to flooding hazards using approaches that integrate restoration and protection; and 3) leverage NSF investments in cyberinfrastructure to address problems of major national importance involving engineering design guided by coastal system responses to specific hazard mitigation projects. Effective linkages of cyberinfrastructure that enables rapid sharing and integration of available data resources and computational tools will be evaluated. The project will also evaluate how effectively these cyberinfrastructure products promote the wider use of high-performance computing and data analytics in the coastal engineering and science research community. The proposed project has a wide range of broader impacts, ranging from education and workforce development, to dissemination of research results to the general public, K-12 students, and coastal managers and decision makers.\r\n\r\nThe Coastal Resilience Collaboratory core research program builds on a recently funded Coastal SEES project (EAR-1427389), which serves as the science driver for the cyberinfrastructre development and its enabled simulation experiments. One of the grand challenges for earth system science is to characterize dynamic environmental processes at appropriate space and time scales with integrated observation networks and models. The project advances four elements: 1) A simulation management system for a high-level web-based interface, improving multiphysics model usability for coastal scientists/engineers not familiar with advanced computing resources; 2) Application packaging for cloud-computing using Docker container technology to facilitate prototype simulation experiments in two large river deltas to test a range of hypotheses; 3) Accelerator technology to achieve high performance levels aimed at making a GPU- accelerated Boussinesq code base available to coastal engineers for the design of sustainable infrastructure; and 4)Aapplications for visualization and access to toolkits on mobile devices to support decision-making and educational activities. The three simulation experiments that test system interactions in the modeling framework proposed is expected to produce foundational knowledge that can evaluate potential impacts of deltaic landscape change on coasts around the world and suggest mitigation solutions.",

The Cyber SEES project established the Coastal Resilience Collaboratory (CRC) to enhance collaborations among earth scientists, computer scientists, cyberinfrastructure specialists and coastal engineers tasked with sustaining deltaic coasts. We have identified risk mitigation techniques for coastal communities using nature-based solutions (e.g. coastal wetlands) to reduce storm surge and wave impact.

The goal was to create a cloud-ready repository of open-source coastal modeling tools which enable scientists and engineers to use high performance computers to study a variety of coastal processes. The system leverages Jupyter notebooks, Docker, Singularity, and the Agave Platform to create a platform for running jobs and analyzing data in a way that is (1) intuitive, (2) repeatable, (3) and collaborative. The CMR predicts storm surges, tsunamis, hurricane-generated waves, and coastal erosion. The system makes it easier for coastal scientists and engineers to model coastal hazards and share data.</p>\n<p>Barrier islands serve as the first line of defense against oceanic and meteorological forces. Extreme storms cause large morphological changes on coastal barriers, which may degrade their defensive capabilities. The understanding of morphological impacts is therefore important for coastal resiliency, but is often challenged by site-specific characteristics, such as land cover and sediment availability of a deltaic coast. We investigated the effects of land cover and limited sediment supply on low-lying barrier island morphology under storm conditions by using process-based numerical models. The simulation results show that a short-duration overwash regime dominates the morphological change in the low-lying barrier and is influenced by backbarrier wetland deterioration. The morphological response to overwash is modulated by backbarrier land cover and topography. An intact backbarrier marsh reduces landward washover sediment transport distances and promotes deposition at supratidal elevations. The implication of our study for coastal protection is that simultaneous restoration of backbarrier wetlands in conjunction with subaerial beach renourishment will increase the resiliency of low-lying barriers subject to frequent overwashing by storms.</p>\n<p>The understanding of hurricane-induced sedimentation in coastal wetlands was expanded through a coupled hurricane wind, storm surge, wave and sediment transport modeling system running on HPC systems. We successfully reproduced the observed hydrodynamic response in coastal Louisiana during Hurricane Gustav (2008). The simulations showed that during a hurricane event, the sediment suspension and redistribution mainly occurred to mud on the mud-dominant deltaic coast; in contrast, the transport of sand was relatively negligible during the hurricane. The modeled spatial range and mean sediment accretion on the vegetated wetland surface within the Terrebonne and Barataria Basins, LA were in good agreement with the field measurements after Gustav. The model prediction of wetland deposition was sensitive to sediment properties in the model, i.e., settling velocity, erosion rate and critical shear stress. The long-existing hypothesis about the source of deposition in wetlands during a hurricane was verified via numerical simulation for the first time. Our model results indicate that the suspended material from the coastal bays made up 88.7% of wetland deposition in Terrebonne Bay and 98.2% in Barataria Bay during Hurricane Gustav. During the largescale (but short-term) sediment transport and redistribution, Terrebonne Bay and Barataria Bay acted as a major source of sediment transported to the adjacent coastal wetlands. The implication of our study for coastal restoration in Louisiana is that keeping sediments from the Mississippi River within the estuaries is essential.</p>\n<p>Coherent waves are pairs of waves having identical frequency and waveform with constant phase difference leading to a stationary wave interference in the wavefield of phase-resolving wave models. The resulting stationary interference due to the presence of coherent water waves results in the longshore variation of the wave height in longshore uniform topography. This variation affects the radiation stress throughout the domain and leads to the longshore variation in mean water level, mean current field, shear wave amplitude, wave setup, and wave runup. We have developed a new method of wave energy spectrum discretization for phase-resolving wave models like FUNWAVE-TVD, which either eliminates the coherent waves at the offshore boundary condition or limits them to a controlled number. Effects of the coherent waves on some nearshore wave processes were probed using simulation experiments with a flat bottom and a longshore uniform sloping beach. The results shed light on the effects of wave coherence on the nearshore wave processes and demonstrate the usefulness of the newly developed wavemaker as a tool for the coastal research community to further assess the hydrodynamics in nearshore environments.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/21/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Qin&nbsp;J&nbsp;Chen</p>\n</div>\n<div
