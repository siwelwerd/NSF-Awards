 "awd_abstract_narration": "Trees are key players in the carbon cycle because they recycle atmospheric carbon dioxide into forms of carbon that living things can use. To be successful, most trees require animals or microbes to provide them with services, e.g., with defense against enemies or to supply them with nutrients. Trees reward these service providers, known as mutualists, with carbon. Tree mutualists thus probably have large impacts on the carbon cycle, but these impacts have rarely been quantified. This research seeks to determine how much carbon from trees is invested in mutualists, where that carbon comes from, and whether that carbon investment changes when mutualisms are disrupted by human-driven changes in the animal fauna. The project will leverage a mutualism between trees and defensive ants in Kenya that is uniquely well-suited to field experiments and landscape modeling, in order to determine how mutualists contribute to the carbon cycle. This research will be communicated to K-12 students throughout the country using a web-based education platform designed to teach biology through active learning.\r\n\r\nSymbiotic ant colonies protect Acacia drepanolobium trees against herbivores in Kenyan savannas in exchange for housing and carbohydrates, but this mutualism is disrupted by the disappearance of megaherbivores and by an invasive ant species. Ant mutualists reduce tree growth and reproduction in the absence of herbivory, but this apparent carbon cost of ants has never been investigated relative to other critical tree carbon sinks, including allocation to roots and microbial mutualists. The proposed work will investigate carbon pools and dynamics in A. drepanolobium in the context of variation in the tree's biotic interactions to discover how mutualists affect tree carbon allocation. Using field experiments to manipulate ant mutualists, megaherbivores, and invasive ants, this research will evaluate how much trees invest in their mutualists relative to tree carbon supply, and how new carbon assimilates are partitioned between mutualists and tree sinks. Carbon allocation will be assessed by measuring biomass, nonstructural carbohydrates, secondary metabolites, mutualist rewards, and by pulse labeling of new assimilates. Because A. drepanolobium is a monodominant tree across large areas of East Africa, these measurements will be important to predicting changes in ecosystem-level carbon storage.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Increasingly, we must also understand how trees respond to multiple stressors in combination, and whether we can accurately predict these responses from studies of individual stressors. For example, invasive species are estimated to cost North America over $26 billion dollars per year by negatively affecting crop and native species. Invasive species have negative impacts on trees that live in complex ecological systems, where trees also experience numerous other stressors, such as herbivory and drought. Most trees engage in positive interactions, known as mutualisms, which enable them to persist in more stressful conditions than they would otherwise be able to withstand.

The savannas are semi-arid, and trees are frequently water-limited during the dry seasons. The tree, <em>Acacia (Vachellia) drepanolobium</em>, is a favorite food of various megaherbivores in the system, including elephants, giraffes, and black rhinoceros, and it employs aggressive ants to defend it against this herbivory. The ants live inside the tree's stems and eat its sugars, and in return the ants attack herbivorous animals by biting them in large numbers, which reduces herbivory on the tree. In addition to drought and herbivory, these trees have recently been suffering from the effects of an invasive ant species, the big-headed ant, <em>Pheidole megacephala</em>.

First, in addition to increasing herbivory on the trees, the invasive ants are having negative impacts on trees by disrupting their roots. Although invasive ants are found on nearly every continent and usually nest in the soil, we know surprisingly little about their effects on vegetation. Our results show that the trees were unable to grow or maintain their roots in the soils where the big-headed ants are nesting, which appears to reduce tree carbon fixation and negatively impact tree carbon budgets and lifetime reproduction. We also found that the negative impacts of the invasive ants on tree growth were exacerbated during droughts, suggesting that invasive ants and drought in combination have more negative effects on tree populations than either stressor would have in isolation. We additionally discovered that herbivory strongly reduces tree carbon budgets in this system, which creates trade-offs: trees can allocate to the growth of stems or to the growth of roots, but not both, in the presence of herbivory. Because stem growth is necessary to escape the heaviest herbivory and the risk of fire, whereas root growth is necessary to uptake sufficient water, these trade-offs also likely have negative impacts on tree populations. Finally, trees allocate a measurable proportion of their total sugars to their defensive ant mutualists, although the cost of the ants in sugars depends on which of several ant species the tree employs.
