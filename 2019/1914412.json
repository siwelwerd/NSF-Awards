 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research activities of Professors Eric D'Hoker, Michael Gutperle, and Per Kraus at the University of California, Los Angeles. \r\n\r\nString theory remains the most promising candidate for the unification of the Standard Model of elementary particles with General Relativity, the theory of gravitational forces, in a framework consistent with the laws of Quantum Mechanics.  Developments in string theory over the past decades have spawned progress in many areas of physics and mathematics, thereby serving the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of new physical laws. Professors D'Hoker, Gutperle, and Kraus aim to deepen the understanding of string theory, quantum gravity, and black-hole physics by exploring new symmetry principles, new connections with pure mathematics, and by performing sophisticated calculations at the frontier of string theory. This project will also have significant broader impacts.  String theory continues to attract and inspire some of the brightest graduate students and postdocs in physics, and Professors D'Hoker, Gutperle, and Kraus will involve graduate students and postdocs in their research while actively mentoring them on their path to becoming professional scientists. Workshops organized with other universities in Southern California will serve to introduce junior physicists at UCLA to the broader community of researchers, while interactions with students during visits to local middle and high schools will promote public outreach. \r\n\r\nAt a more technical level, Professor D'Hoker continues to advance the subject of superstring perturbation theory, its applications to the low-energy effective interactions of supergravity, and its implications for the high-energy behavior of string amplitudes. Professor Gutperle will investigate five-dimensional super-conformal field theories, as well as domain wall, surface, and line operators in conformal field theories utilizing the AdS/CFT correspondence.  Professor Kraus will study conformal field theories in various dimensions, with an emphasis on elucidating structures that have implications for quantum gravity via the AdS/CFT correspondence.  Professors D'Hoker, Gutperle, and Kraus will also use conformal-bootstrap methods to study the properties of the conformal field theory which is holographically dual to Type IIB string theory on AdS3.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe focus of the projects funded by this grant was on string theory,\nquantum gravity, holography and gauge-gravity duality, and\nsuper-symmetric gauge theories at strong coupling. The broader outcomes\nof this project include mentoring graduate students and postdoctoral\nresearchers, collaborating with them on a number of vital parts of these\nprojects, and preparing them for career paths in academia and industry.\n\nOne outcome of this project concerns superstring amplitudes, evaluated\nperturbatively at small string coupling in the loop expansion familiar\nfrom quantum field theory. Specifically, the two-loop superstring\namplitudes with five external massless states were constructed\nexplicitly for the first time for all superstring theories. This result,\nin turn, produced new predictions for the low energy effective\ninteractions that string theory produces in supergravity, thereby\noffering novel insight into the space-time supersymmetry and strong\ncoupling duality properties of string theory. Another outcome concerns\nthe study of Yang-Mills theories with extended supersymmetry at strong\ncoupling, for which an improved expansion was developed near the\nmulti-monopole points. Through this expansion, a novel effective theory\nwas developed for soft supersymmetry breaking that predicts a cascade of\nphase transitions from the pure Coulomb phase to the maximal Higgs phase.\n\nAnother project involved the construction and study of extended objects\nsuch as line and surface defects as well as interfaces and boundaries in\nquantum field theory. Quantum states built out of defects and boundaries\nare ubiquitous in nature and provide new probes with which to study the\ndynamics of the quantum theory. The method used here involves\nholographic duality where quantum field theories are equivalent to\ngravitational systems in higher dimensions. This duality allows for the\nconstruction of novel defects and interfaces in quantum field theories\nand the calculation of quantities such as the entropy of entanglement,\nthat are very difficult to calculate using other methods.\n\nA further line of research involved the use of holographic duality to\nstudy quantum gravity in a novel setting. Quantum gravity is simplest\nto study in spacetimes with infinite volume, since the dynamics\ntypically turns off in a far away region. However, physical laboratories\nhave finite volume, so one ultimately needs to formulate quantum gravity\nwithin a finite region. Progress was made on this problem by\nconsidering the simplified setting of three spacetime dimensions, where\nmuch of the dynamics localizes to the boundary. It was shown how to\nquantize this system and obtain the energy spectrum of excitations and\ntheir interactions. This setup is of further interest due to its\nproposed holographic realization via a certain non-gravitational theory\nin two spacetime dimensions, namely one deformed by the so-call TTbar\ninteraction, which involves the square of the energy density, along with\nother terms. This special interaction has certain soluble properties,\nsuch as a known formula for the energy spectrum. The coefficient of\nthe interaction has been conjectured to be related to the location of\nthe boundary in three-dimensional gravity description. Research\ncarried out in this project established agreement between the energy\nspectra of the gravitational and TTbar theories, in accord with the\nconjectured relation, and enables further comparisons between other\nphysical quantities.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/05/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: EricD'hoker\n"
