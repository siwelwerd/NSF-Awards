 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site award provides funding for the renewal of an outstanding REU site at Indiana University - Purdue University Indianapolis.   The site will recruit undergraduates from across the nation to participate in research topics related to cybersecurity, mobile cloud security, and data security and privacy. The research projects focus on issues related to the use of mobile devices such as smart phones and the secure use of mobile clouds to access, manage, store, and secure digital assets. Mobile cloud security is an area of current interest that is well-suited to undergraduate research productivity. The students will use controlled and competitive test environments to experiment with cyber-attack and defense techniques needed to secure the mobile devices that are pervasive in our society.  This site should help develop a group of computing professionals who can develop the systems of the future that impact society and enhance our quality of life. The REU experience provides students with the foundations and inspiration to pursue computing careers and research in areas that are rapidly evolving and impacting all of our citizens.  \r\n\r\nThis project is led by an outstanding team offering state-of-the art facilities and professional mentors to guide undergraduates in explorations of cutting-edge problems related to mobile cloud security. Students will learn how to use current tools and techniques to solve those problems that have direct impact on people.  The team will use proven strategies to recruit undergraduate students from groups traditionally under-represented in computer science including African American, Hispanic and female students.   The students will participate in research and professional development activities all designed to achieve the goals of retaining and graduating undergraduate students in computer science and engineering, recruiting students from groups traditionally under-represented in computing fields, and increasing recruitment of students into graduate programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
