 "awd_abstract_narration": "There has been a tremendous growth in renewable energy over the past decade, evidenced by the proliferation of thousands of biofuel, wind turbine, and solar panel installations across the country. Since each of these devices has its own individual Supervisory Controls and Data Acquisition (SCADA) communications output, this has also resulted in an explosion of data for renewable energy system operators. The data from a SCADA system can have enormous value for renewable energy system owners, operators, and the greater community. Therefore, the Center for Renewable Energy Advanced Technological Education (CREATE), in collaboration with industry and academic partners, aims to advance the use of SCADA technology for the energy sector.  SCADA technology is of crucial importance to the electric industry to manage the extraordinary growth in renewable energy installations, while also ensuring the security and resilience of our nation's electric grid.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to advance renewable energy education by enabling faculty leaders to integrate SCADA into existing energy technician educational programs. SCADA systems are core technology for the operation of many key industrial processes, including oil and gas refining, food and beverage production, water treatment, and electric power production. SCADA systems allow engineering technicians to control systems in real time, and log data for monitoring of system performance. SCADA data analytics allow for system optimization, preventive maintenance scheduling, and for rapid detection and correction of faults and alarms to prevent or minimize system downtime.  This project will result in the creation of an educational open source SCADA system that will be deployed and shared among participating colleges and universities nationwide. Technician education in SCADA technology will be advanced through a series of professional development workshops for college and university faculty, and SCADA instructional activities will be integrated into existing courses and curricula for undergraduate energy technician education programs. The project will have enormous impact on the renewable energy sector, ultimately benefitting society by providing more reliable and lower cost energy to consumers, while creating a more resilient energy grid and reducing the environmental impact of America's energy sector. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program, which focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n The goal of the CREATE SCADA project was to advance renewable energy education by enabling faculty leaders to integrate Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition into existing energy technician educational programs. \n\n \n\nAn Open Source SCADA Platform was created.  Driver files were created for several of the most common DC/AC inverter manufacturers and energy monitoring platforms.  Multiple operating solar fields are now transmitting to the open-source platform, and the archived data sets are available to colleges and universities as a resource for teaching data analytics using very large data sets.  Roof mounted, ground mounted, and pole mounted systems are represented in the SCADA database.  Several two- and four-year colleges have renewable energy and energy storage devices that are transmitting data to the open source platform, and additional schools are interested in adding to the network in the years ahead.   All of the data is available to users from anywhere, free of charge. \n\n \n\nA draft SCADA Job Task Analysis (JTA) was also completed.  The JTA has been shared with industry representatives through two energy workforce stakeholder meetings.  It has also been distributed to community colleges in the CREATE Energy Center Network, and those participating in the Solar Corps project funded by the U.S. Department of Energy.  The SCADA JTA was used to guide the development of curriculum, resulting in a Survey of SCADA technology course that has been contextualized for the energy sector.  The course is constructed of six modules, that are aligned to the SCADA JTA.  The modules are designed such that they can also be used as stand-alone units that can be incorporated into existing courses, thereby making it easier for schools to integrate SCADA technology into academic programs of study.  The modules have been reviewed by a team of five SCADA subject matter experts (SMEs) to ensure that the curriculum was well aligned with the SCADA JTA. \n\n \n\nA series of new instructional lab activities were created to complement the SCADA curriculum.  These utilized a custom designed bench scale SCADA lab trainer board/kit built from common and affordable off the shelf components that communicates using open source and free software. \n\n \n\nA series of thirty-four instructional videos were produced to accompany the SCADA trainer lab boards, providing a digital resource to view, and review, for mastery of concepts.  The videos are freely available on the CREATE Energy Center\u2019s YouTube channel. \n\n \n\nBoth face to face and online faculty professional development workshops were delivered as part of the project.  Twenty-eight educators representing seventeen U.S. states participated in these continuing education programs.  Participants learned about SCADA applications, tools, equipment, hardware, and software.  As a result of the workshops, 94% of the participants indicated that they planned to increase the incorporation of SCADA concepts and activities in the energy technology courses that they teach.\n\n \n\n@font-face \t{font-family:\"Cambria Math\"; \tpanose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:roman; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face \t{font-family:Calibri; \tpanose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:swiss; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-536859905 -1073732485 9 0 511 0;}@font-face \t{font-family:Times; \tpanose-1:0 0 5 0 0 0 0 2 0 0; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:auto; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-536870145 1342185562 0 0 415 0;}p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal \t{mso-style-unhide:no; \tmso-style-qformat:yes; \tmso-style-parent:\"\"; \tmargin:0in; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:12.0pt; \tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif; \tmso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-language:EN-US;}.MsoChpDefault \t{mso-style-type:export-only; \tmso-default-props:yes; \tfont-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-font-family:DengXian; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:Arial; \tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}div.WordSection1 \t{page:WordSection1;}\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/27/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kenneth A Walz"
