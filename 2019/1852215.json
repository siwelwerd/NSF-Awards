 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues the long-running Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program at DIMACS, the Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey. The program exposes students to a broad range of computer science topics emphasizing the theory and use of algorithms applied in contexts that range from bioinformatics to big data. The program includes projects led by Rutgers faculty from several disciplines, involves graduate students as assistant mentors, and combines with other REU programs that add cultural diversity and an international element through partnership with the DIMATIA center in Prague.\r\n\r\nThe program draws on the traditional strengths of DIMACS in theoretical computer science, mainly focused on algorithms and complexity. Student research spans both theory and applications showcasing algorithms in settings that include, among others, big data analytics, privacy and cybersecurity, bioinformatics, and robotics. The majority of the projects address algorithmic foundations, including projects on complexity, machine learning, coding theory, and analysis of algorithms for streaming and privacy. Additionally, the program leverages DIMACS' position as an interdisciplinary center to involve mentors from various academic departments to offer students varied perspectives and projects whose applications cross disciplines to illustrate the power of computing in a variety of settings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our program nurtures this capacity by exposing REU students to a broad range of CS topics, applied in contexts that range from bioinformatics to big data, but also cognizant of the need for foundational and potentially transformative theory. A particular emphasis of our program is on crossing boundaries?between disciplines, between theory and practice, between academia and industry, and between nations?to solve problems. We achieve this goal by involving mentors from different areas of CS and MS and even different disciplines, by integrating activities with nearby industry partners, by involving graduate students as assistant mentors, and by combining with other REU programs that add cultural diversity and an international element.</p>\n<p>The broader impact of our Research Experiences for Undergraduates program is to inform the students about their future education and career choices and give them the confidence and grounding to pursue and succeed in these choices. Our program enriches students by exposing them to the varied perspectives offered by different cultures, different fields, by theory and application, and by industry and academia. DIMACS is a well-established research center with many scientific activities (seminars, workshops, etc.), open to REU students, and with long-standing relationships with industrial partners. Each year of the program, students visit DIMACS industry partners to gain a broadened view of career possibilities.</p>\n<p>The intellectual merit of the DIMACS REU program stems from the research projects introduced to students by their mentors. Students were invited to participate in other activities at DIMACS, which included workshops, seminars, and research meetings that are part of the broader intellectual life at DIMACS. During the pandemic, the DIMACS REU program was virtual in 2020 and 2021, which allowed us to offer the program to an increased number of students. We had 130 US undergraduate students in our broader DIMACS REU program between 2018 and 2022, 41 of whom were directly funded through this NSF site grant. Since 2018, project research has led to at least 12 publications co-authored by students and their mentors and at least 15 presentations at regional, national, and international conferences. Students were mentored on research topics as varied as complexity in theoretical computer science, algorithmic applications in cancer research, graph theory, algorithmic fairness, robot planning, and bioinformatics.</p>\n<p>Our program also includes an international component, where 6-10 Czech students participate in the REU program at Rutgers and 5 US students work in Prague for the last two weeks of the program. The response of the participating students is overwhelmingly positive, and they all praise the experience of conducting research in another country, where they are mentored by local faculty and they have the chance to attend a research workshop.</p>\n<p>For most student participants in our program, this was their first introduction to a research environment in which they worked on open-ended problems that did not have a clear pathway to a predetermined solution. Most of our participants have gone on to, or are planning on going on to, graduate school. Many of them cited their DIMACS REU experience as a determining factor in their decision and in their later success. The external evaluation of our program concluded that: ?DIMACS students in particular had very strong outcomes, with large majorities remaining interested or gaining interest in CS and math-related fields while strongly agreeing they were able to learn and grow and that their perspective was consistently heard. They frequently said they were ?more interested? in Math or CS fields, that the program helped them think more clearly about career plans, and they would recommend the program to friends.?</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/29/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Lazaros&nbsp;Gallos</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852215/1852215_10588956_1690642696801_DIMACS_REU_2019--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852215/1852215_10588956_1690642696801_DIMACS_REU_2019--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2019 DIMACS REU\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852215/1852215_10588956_1690642696801_DIMACS_REU_2019--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2019 DIMACS REU\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students participating in the 2019 DIMACS REU program</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tamra Carpenter</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lazaros&nbsp;Gallos</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2019 DIMACS REU</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852215/1852215_10588956_1690642754889_DIMACS_REU_2020--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852215/1852215_10588956_1690642754889_DIMACS_REU_2020--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2020 DIMACS REU\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852215/1852215_10588956_1690642754889_DIMACS_REU_2020--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2020 DIMACS REU\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students participating in the online 2020 DIMACS REU program</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Lazaros Gallos</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lazaros&nbsp;Gallos</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2020 DIMACS REU</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852215/1852215_10588956_1690642783546_DIMACS_REU_2021--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852215/1852215_10588956_1690642783546_DIMACS_REU_2021--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2021 DIMACS REU\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852215/1852215_10588956_1690642783546_DIMACS_REU_2021--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2021 DIMACS REU\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students participating in the online 2021 DIMACS REU program</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Lazaros Gallos</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lazaros&nbsp;Gallos</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2021 DIMACS REU</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852215/1852215_10588956_1690642862367_DIMACS_REU_2022--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852215/1852215_10588956_1690642862367_DIMACS_REU_2022--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2022 DIMACS REU\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852215/1852215_10588956_1690642862367_DIMACS_REU_2022--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2022 DIMACS REU\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students participating in the 2022 DIMACS REU program</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Lazaros Gallos</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lazaros&nbsp;Gallos</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2022 DIMACS REU</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
