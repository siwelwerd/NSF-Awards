 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program supports the acquisition of a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) at Millersville University. This research tool enables activities that strengthen the research and teaching abilities at the institution. Millersville University is a public, primarily undergraduate university. In addition, there are many stakeholders interested in accessing the instrument. Developing the next generation of engineers and scientists is paramount to the prosperity of the nation by maintaining our competitive edge in the development of technology and intellectual capital. Providing meaningful experiences at all levels of academia is central to recruiting and retaining talented students in science and engineering. The project connects various aspects of education and community outreach using the SEM.  This project has been coordinated with faculty at nearby Franklin and Marshall College and includes support from local industry, K-12 institutions, and community outreach groups. By offering access to this equipment and providing assistance in using it, the investigators strengthen the ties within this local network, advance scientific inquiry and discovery, support the local economy through business development, develop new pathways for youth to learn about science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines, and draw more students to pursue careers in these areas. Because there is a lack of access, a strong demand, and a detailed plan for implementing these activities at various levels within the local community, it is anticipated that the impact will be felt deeply across the region, and it will result in the advancement of STEM education and opportunities in the area.\r\n \r\nThis award to Millersville University (MU)supports the acquisition of tungsten-filament SEM with energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy capability and provides critical capability in sample analysis and support on-going research projects in materials science, biology, geology, and chemistry, and more. Specific research projects include research in (1) new solid-state metal foams; (2) far from equilibrium processing of novel materials;(3) synthesis of nanoparticles of different shapes and sizes for comparative studies on catalysis; 4) forensic, and systematic botany. MU will provide technical support for the SEM for the expanding research on campus, as well as attracting industrial partners. Outreach and learning activities serve 22 school districts and other educational centers in the area, and the School District of Lancaster, which is comprised of 87% minority students. Outreach activities are planned through the North Museum of Science and the Lancaster Science Factory. Furthermore, K-12 students activities include campus visit during a variety of STEM-related competitions and events, such as the Science Olympiad and the Made in Millersville student research conference. The project also includes service to the broader academic community by joining the Remote Access Instrumentation Network in partnership with Penn State's Center for Nanotechnology Education and Utilization.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
