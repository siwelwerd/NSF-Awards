 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mountainous terrain has a significant impact on local and regional weather conditions.  The flow over mountains is known to enhance precipitation on the upslope sides, and the impact of the air rising to different levels of the atmosphere has a downstream impact on larger-scale weather patterns.  However, many questions about the details remain.  This award provides funding for a researcher and two graduate students to study topics related to atmospheric interactions with mountain topography.  In addition to the training of the next generation of scientists, this award will have a broad societal impact through the potential to improve weather forecasts.\r\n\r\nThe two main thrusts of the work are on improving understanding of: 1) the dynamics and predictability of multi-scale orographic precipitation and 2) mountain waves and their feedback on the synoptic-scale flow.  The orographic precipitation work would be conducted using idealized modeling.  The research team will investigate the relative contributions of dynamics and microphysics toward increasing precipitation by diagnosing those processes in scenarios with and without mountains and cyclones using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) numerical model.  Additional work will be conducted using cases with different background static stabilities, moisture fluxes, and ridge positions.  The orographic precipitation component will also include work on mesoscale predictability as the researchers hypothesize that small perturbations to the large-scale flow will generate large perturbations to the precipitation patterns associated with mesoscale terrain features.  The mountain wave work would use modeling, theory, and observations from prior field campaigns to address how gravity-wave-drag influences nontrivial large-scale flows and under what conditions nonlinear processes strongly regulate the amplitude of mountain waves.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur overall goal is to improve the forecasting and understanding of weather in the mountains.  We examine both precipitation and high winds in mountainous regions as well has how these localized weather systems interact with weather patterns on larger scales.\n\nThe first major focus of this research is on moist airflow over mountains. Heavy precipitation in midlatitude mountain ranges is largely driven by the episodic passage of weather systems.   Previous observational studies have shown a high correlation between the rate that moisture flows toward the mountain and the intensity of the precipitation on the windward slopes.  We confirm a similar quantitative relation holds for a particularly extensive set of observations collected upstream and over the Olympic Mountains of Washington. We also survey previous studies that modeled orographic precipitation using  idealized horizontally uniform upstream flow conditions. Surprisingly, the increase in precipitation intensity with increases in the amount of moisture striking the mountain is far lower in the idealized simulations than that which would be expected based on the observationally derived correlation between incoming moisture and precipitation. (Figure 1)\n\n\nTo explain this discrepancy, we conduct simulations of a low pressure system striking a north-south ridge.  The relationship between moisture-flow and rainfall rate in this ?Cyc+Mtn\" simulation matches that which would be expected from observations (purple circles in Fig. 1).  In contrast, when the conditions upstream of the ridge in the Cyc+Mtn case were used to create idealized horizontally uniform upstream conditions with the same oncoming moist flow, the simulated rainfall rate was much lower (purple triangle in Fig. 1).  Our simulation of the low-pressure system passing by the mountain is shown in Figure 2.\n\n\nFurther analysis of our Cyc+Mtn and associated idealized ?Shear? simulations, show that the idealized case forced by steady horizontally uniform upstream conditions generates an initial artificially large-amplitude wavelike disturbance over the mountain that remains too large even when the simulation reaches a steady state.  This wave is much smaller in the Cyc+Mtn simulation, which properly accounts for the influence of atmospheric conditions over the lee slope.  The difference in the \"mountain wave\" structure accounts for the difference in rainfall rates produced in the more realistic and idealized simulations.\n\n\nThe preceding difference between observations and widely used techniques for the simulation orographic precipitation highlights the risks associated with oversimplifying  conditions when attempting to study specific atmospheric processes in isolation.\n\n\nThe second major focus of this research is on unsaturated airflow over mountains, which can produce mountain waves that exert a drag on the upper level winds, as opposed to surface friction which acts near the ground.  This drag must be estimated in most current global atmospheric models because of their relatively large grid spacing, and such estimates rely heavily on so-called linear theory.  We showed that linear theory can give very inaccurate estimates when the winds increase rapidly with height, as they would below the jet stream.  The difficulty of incorporating nonlinear processes in estimates of such mountain-wave-induced drag provides one (of many) important motivations for current efforts to migrate global weather forecast models to finer grid spacing.\n\n\nIn connection with our second major focus, we also examine the ability of weather forecast models with very fine grid spacing to forecast downslope windstorms that can drive wild fires and produce high-wind damage along the lee slope and at the base of steep mountain barriers.

Our results contrast with some earlier studies suggesting such winds should be relatively easy to forecast because they are forced by relatively predictable large-scale weather patterns and known topographic features.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/23/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dale R Durran"
