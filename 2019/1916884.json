 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project funds student participation in the 36th Quality and Productivity Research Conference, or QPRC, hosted by American University in Washington, DC on June 11-13, 2019. This QPRC has a special theme devoted to the Data Revolution, \"Data and Science Is a Winning Alliance.\" The conference aims to demonstrate and explore the interplay between data and science, and to discuss modern scientific approaches to handling big, multidimensional, unstructured data.  The sessions will address how data and science, the two fundamental sources of knowledge, are leveraging each other to accelerate discoveries and increase quality and productivity.  The program will include a comprehensive discussion of cutting-edge modern methodologies in diverse aspects of data science and current progress made in such computer-intensive fields as stream data mining, machine learning, functional data analysis, image reconstruction, and facial recognition.  Participating statisticians, data scientists, quantitative analysts, and representatives of different branches of industry and government will exchange novel ideas and share experiences in working with modern big data to discover knowledge and applying it in numerous fields. \r\n\r\nPlenary and invited paper sessions at the 36th QPRC are scheduled in the following subjects: machine learning, applied data mining, time series and forecasting, text analytics, data science, cybersecurity, data visualization, big data analytics, statistical process control monitoring, functional data analysis, and spatial data science.  The conference also includes contributed and poster sessions and a technical tour. It is preceded by a one-day course \"Big Data Analytics: Dealing with Structured, Semi-structured, and Unstructured Data.\"  Strong student participation is a vital component of the 36th QPRC. Efforts will be made to broaden participation by recruiting students from under-represented groups and engaging students from numerous universities and graduate programs across the United States. Students are invited to submit contributed and poster presentations and compete for travel scholarships. The conference details are on its web site, https://www.american.edu/cas/qprc/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
