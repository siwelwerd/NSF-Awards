 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of origami-inspired mechanical metamaterials.  These techniques can generate tessellated patterns that augment and enhance common materials.  With the capacity for simultaneously making conventional materials lighter, stronger, and multi-functional, this material design motif has the potential to impact a wide range of technologies in hardware, manufacturing, energy-efficiency, robotics, and aerospace.  This potential can be tapped by embedding carefully designed geometric patterns into materials.  The current unmet challenge for realizing this potential impact is the conspicuous absence of a standard library of metamaterial designs.  This project addresses the challenge by exploring the feasibility of a complete kinematic set and to determine whether the resulting physical properties are suitable for broader engineering applications.  If successful, the metamaterials designed and validated by this effort will lay the foundation for replacing, augmenting, or enhancing machines of all types with mechanical metamaterial-based technology.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project utilizes an artificial intelligence-enhanced optimization scheme to automatically generate mechanical metamaterial designs meeting user-defined target properties.  To generate the proposed set of kinematically-complete mechanical metamaterials the software-based approach to metamaterial design will be required to mesh with empirical validations.  A combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques will be used to guarantee the metamaterial designer routinely generates useful, robust, and high-performing schematics that qualitatively and quantitatively improve as the pipeline for metamaterial design is repeatedly executed.  The core algorithm improves the ability to produce high-impact metamaterial-based technology while taking less time to converge on optimized design schematics. As such, the barrier to market penetration of advanced material technology becomes lower, faster, and is driven by advances in machine learning.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project aims to translate academic research on advanced    materials and manufacturing into commercial technologies.  Like    honeycomb materials common to aerospace, our mechanical metamaterials    use geometric patterning to create lightweight load-bearing structures.     We design  these patterns to enhance or suppress deformation   associated  with buckling, bending, and other types of failure.  The   technical  outcome of this project is the development of a metamaterial   geometry  that's ~50x stronger than comparable lightweight composite   structures  but has negligable added material or manufacturing costs.    We further  manufactured prototypes and demonstrated the anticipated  improvements  with standard  mechanical tests.\n\nCommercially, we discovered the technical advances supported by this  effort are of  high value in the transportation sector, where   lightweight load bearing  panels are used in the construction of   semi-trailers sidewalls and  electric vehicle battery boxes.  The  mechanical metamaterial structures developed in this project are 80%  lighter than the current  industry standard and highly   cost-competitive.  Semi-trailer  manufacturers that integrate our  materials into their  construction benefit by achieving lighter and more   durable design.  Semi-trailer  owners and operators benefit from  our  materials by increasing  their bottom-line profitiability through  fuel  savings and increased  cargo hauling capacity (up to $1Mn/y in increased revenues and savings).\n\nFuture technical and commercial efforts will build on these results   to advance a next-generation lightweight load bearing sandwich panel   that exceeds aerospace-grade capabilities, but remains priced for  non-aerospace  markets.\n\nMultiscale Systems is an  advanced materials manufacturing firm   commercializing applications of  mechanical metamaterial technology for   heavy industry.  Our ability to  generate lighter, stronger, and more   resiliant materials by patterning  complex geometric patterns into   conventional materials creates  substantial value for engineered   products without making chemical or  molecular maniuplations.  The award   directedly and indirectly supported  five full-time jobs for a HUBZone   firm in the advanced manufacturing  sector.
