 "awd_abstract_narration": "While widely known for the diverse dinosaur faunas of the time, the Cretaceous Period is important for more than just the creatures that populate the imagination, museums, and popular culture. Cretaceous climate changes may be the result of numerous disruptions to the carbon cycle, likely due to volcanism. The carbon cycle controls climate change. Past carbon cycle changes resulted in major climate shifts, environmental change, and extinction. By understanding ancient terrestrial carbon cycle perturbations, we can understand the consequences to ongoing disruptions to the carbon cycle. This project will determine if the Cretaceous carbon cycle disruptions resulted in temperature and precipitation changes on land. To achieve these scientific goals, funds will go toward supporting community college, undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students as well as creating educational lab activities. As a Career award, the PI will develop collaborations with other universities, enhance her education activities and integrate these with a strong research program for professional development that will provide a solid base for future research.\r\n\r\nThis project spans the late Aptian to early Albian (approximately 115 to 110 million year ago), and specifically targets carbon isotope excursions associated with ocean anoxic event 1b from 4 localities (Utah, Texas, Spain, and China). The project will generate multiple climate proxies such as: 1) clumped isotope paleothermometry; 2) major element geochemistry to quantify weathering intensity and paleoprecipitation; and 3) carbon isotope data to estimate pCO2. This data will be synthesized to help identify the full range of climate change triggers, feedbacks, and responses during Cretaceous carbon cycle perturbations in continental environments.",

Another feature of the Cretaceous is the periodic episodes of high amounts of organic carbon burial, often interpreted as ?ocean anoxic events.? These represent significant perturbations to the carbon cycle. It has been interpreted that high temperatures increased chemical weathering and input of nutrients to the ocean spurring primary producers that when buried transferred carbon to sediments, lowering CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere. This would then reduce temperatures. The goal of this project was to identify changes in climate near the end of the Aptian stage (~121 to 113 million years ago) of the Cretaceous, a time that followed a hyperthermal and prior to the long-term increase in temperature that culminated in some of the hottest know temperatures in Earth history called the Cretaceous Thermal Maximum (~93.9 mya). The goal of this project was to exam continental sediment archives because this can help us understand how variable temperature changes might occur due to different geography, because changes in precipitation can more easily be determined from terrestrial deposits, and because the widely used paleo-CO<sub>2</sub> proxy require nodules from ancient soils (paleosols). Four locations were targeted: The Cedar Mountain Formation of Utah, the Hensel Formation of Texas, the Escucha Formation of Spain, and The Xinminpu Group of northwest China. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The first goal of this project was to identify a target C-isotope excursion that likely represents a major C-cycle perturbation. In this case the ?C10? carbon isotope excursion, which is a broad positive isotope excursion thought to be related to episodes of increased organic carbon burial. The C10 interval is interpreted from each of the four locations, however, with much difficulty owing to the differences in depositional environment and thus depositional rate. When possible, numerical dates calculated from U-Pb estimates of the mineral zircon or fossil data aided in correlation.</p>\n<p>The second goal was to test the hypothesis that C10 interval represented a cooling period. To do this a recently developed geochemical technique was employed called the ?clumped isotope carbonate paleothermometer.? Using this technique temperatures do decrease across the interpreted C10 interval in Utah and China, though for Utah the lowest temperature occurs after the interpreted C10 interval. In China the lowest temperature (~11?C or 51.8?F) occurs during this positive isotope excursion. In Texas, no major change in temperature was discernable (temperatures averaged 39.7?C or 103.5?F).</p>\n<p>During the most recent interglacial and glacial cycles, drier environments often occurred during colder conditions. To examine if similar responses occurred during a potential cooling event in the Cretaceous (when the planet was not in an Icehouse condition), we utilized geochemical proxies that relates leaching of certain elements from soils during weathering to precipitation. Spatially, Utah and China indicate wetter conditions in those localities relative to modern precipitation rates, while Texas, precipitation rates were drier. This is consistent with the idea that during greenhouse conditions, mid-latitudes were wetter and dry belts, drier. The precipitation rates in three locations decline slightly, but not significantly (given error associated with the estimates).</p>\n<p>Finally, the data collected in this project, allows us to determine paleo-CO2 levels. Special attention must be given to the best preserved paleosol carbonate nodules. After screening, eight from China and one from Texas were utilized.&nbsp; CO<sub>2</sub> estimates range from 42 to 1116 ppmV. Prior to the C10 interval, Chinese samples ranged from 287 to 686 ppmV. During the C10 interval CO<sub>2</sub> levels declined to a calculated low of 47ppmV. This value is unreasonably low (the last glacial maximum CO<sub>2</sub> levels were about ~190 ppmV); however, propagation of error for the CO<sub>2</sub> proxy can be in the hundreds of ppm. The important aspect here is that CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations declined in the C10 interval consistent with other proxies that indicate decreased greenhouse conditions. After the C10 Interval values range from 218 to 1116ppmV from the Chinese samples and the one sample from Texas was 664ppmV.</p>\n<p>A total of fourteen students were supported as part of this project. These students included a range of levels from community college students to one post-doctoral student. Students gained research experience and professional development. &nbsp;A total of four master?s students completed theses related to this project. Of the fourteen students, six came from groups underrepresented in geology broadening the participation of students in geology (this included Latinx students, African American students, a hearing-impaired student, and first-generation college students).
