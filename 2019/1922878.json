ICSE is the flagship conference in the field. The conference is a venue for technical presentations of research results, interactions between academia and industry, and international collaborations. The specific objective of the grant is to increase and broaden participation in mentoring programs such as the Doctoral Symposium, the New Faculty Symposium, and the Student Mentoring Workshop.  The objective is to provide education, training and mentoring and to nurture a globally-aware workforce of research and educators within the US and build the community of researchers in the field of Software Engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
