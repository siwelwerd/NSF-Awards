 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a multidisciplinary conference that brings together participants from three Alaska Native language communities (Tlingit, Haida and Tsimshian) together with Indigenous and non-Indigenous academics to generate data that supports resilience and tracks language viability.  The Native American Languages Act, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1990, recognizes the unique status and value of Native American languages. These three communities have experienced significant environmental and social change, and each has survived; with the lessons from these experiences embedded in languages, offering valuable insight into cultural resilience and the potential to define new research questions. Broader impacts of the conference include increased opportunity to engage underrepresented Alaska Native youth in STEM, the potential to foster new and innovative research collaborations, and the video recordings of conference presentations, which will be publicly available online for broad dissemination. \r\n\r\nThe \"Sharing Our Knowledge\" (SOK) conference provides a venue for interaction between Indigenous language speakers, learners, and scientists from a variety of disciplines, including anthropology, linguistics, ecology, meteorology and hydrology. SOK encourages and documents the use of Indigenous languages throughout the conference, including usage surrounding the wide range of participating disciplines. Attendees are primed to examine concepts in the three languages. These activities are in line with convergent, transdisciplinary approaches underlying other initiatives, including the Big Ideas at the National Science Foundation. Face to face interactions at the conference enable participants to draw on their diverse backgrounds to investigate regional social and environmental issues and inform resilience-based approaches for future planning in regional and other Indigenous communities. The public availability of presentations contributes to the enhancement and improvement of STEM by stimulating Alaska Native language use, as well as document, and disseminate cutting-edge exchanges of information concerning historic, current and future resilience among participating Alaska Indigenous nations in the face of numerous changes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The conference is a unique synthesis of academic presentations and Indigenous ceremony, gathering, and feasting. This synthesis builds a trust between Indigenous communities, language speakers, and researchers that is essential for the maintenance and documentation of endangered languages. The 2022 conference, supported by NSF grant 1907979, was held in Wrangell, Alaska from September 7-11, 2022. Approximately 250 attendees gathered for some 45 different events, covering topics such as the Wrangell dialect of Tlingi</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>;, the oral histories recorded by John Swanton in Sitka in 1904; the terminology and practice of traditional Southeast Alaskan medicine; the history of white-Native conflict in Southeast Alaska; the role of Indigenous stewardship in fisheries; and the history of the Tlingit spear-thrower. The 2022 Conference's theme was ?A Time for Peace? and its keynote was a day-long event devoted to reconciliation with the legacy of the Wrangell Institute, a Native boarding school that participated in the assimilationist project to extirpate Indigenous languages and cultures from Alaska. Scholars, survivors, and tradition bearers all made contributions to this day, which featured panels, film screenings, and a healing ceremony at the site of the former boarding school. </strong><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>The Sharing Our Knowledge conference shows that it is critically important to build a synthesis of traditional and academic gathering practices in order to preserve, document and revitalize endangered languages. Our model is predicated on the idea that the best kind of meeting for scholars and activists in this field is one where </strong><strong>computer projections </strong><strong>share space with songs, and where formal lectures share space on the schedule with storytelling from elders and hands-on demonstrations of craftsmanship. This builds trust across the community/academic divide; this makes it possible for community members to feel comfortable articulating their needs and interests to academics, and for researchers and scientists to learn to ask the right questions of the languages, cultures and ecosystems they are studying. The overall atmosphere?festive, celebratory, informal?creates an important level of comfort that makes it possible to address some of the difficult historical traumas that stand in the way of Indigenous language revitalization and research. We have seen this model also help scientists in other fields build Indigenous community connections: for instance, ecologists studying resource management, and glaciologists studying the history of ice floes in the region.</strong><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>The 2022 conference also hosted the entire student body from Outer Coast, a new post-secondary institution in Sitka, Alaska. The students came not only as attendees but also as conference volunteers. They worked to provide logistical support for the other attendees?from helping to set up Zooms to taking care of elders. This model of volunteer participation by young people builds a sense of shared ownership and creates a strong</strong><strong>er</strong><strong> sense of commitment to scientific and academic proceedings than what might be created by just ?passively? attending a conference. </strong><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>The entire conference proceedings were video recorded by a professional team from the Alaskan public television station KTOO, and have been posted to YouTube on the SOK YouTube Channel. Since October 2022, the conference events have been viewed a total of 1,956 times. Many of the events include the speaking of Indigenous languages, or academic discussion of them. </strong><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>The committee is committed to continuing the legacy of the Sharing Our Knowledge conference. After the successful conclusion of the 2022 conference, the committee selected Sitka </strong><strong>, AK, </strong><strong>as the site of the 2024 conference. This was done to honor the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Sitka Native Education Program (SNEP), a key force in language documentation and cultural revitalization in Southeast Alaska; it was also done with an eye toward presentations on the boarding school history of Sitka, which was an epicenter of the assimilationist movement in Alaska. In this way, SOK hopes to continue to provide a place where scholars and Indigenous communities can meet on terms of mutual respect on the traditional homelands of the Southeast Alaskan Native Nations. The conference will continue to make it possible for language documentation and revitalization to proceed in a spirit of trust between the many stakeholders. </strong><strong></strong></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/28/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Alice&nbsp;Taff</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1907979/1907979_10643520_1687994217525_Warming--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1907979/1907979_10643520_1687994217525_Warming--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Warming of the hands\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1907979/1907979_10643520_1687994217525_Warming--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Warming of the hands\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">At this opening event, local clans welcome their out of town guests with oratory, songs, and food at the 2022 event in Wrangell, Ak, at Chief Shakes Clan house.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tlingit Readers, Inc.</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Alice&nbsp;Taff</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Warming of the hands</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1907979/1907979_10643520_1687993242277_3rdInternationalSpellingBee--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1907979/1907979_10643520_1687993242277_3rdInternationalSpellingBee--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Tlingit Spelling Bee\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1907979/1907979_10643520_1687993242277_3rdInternationalSpellingBee--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Tlingit Spelling Bee\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">In 2019 Inspired by the annual Yup'ik spelling bee, Sharing Our Knowledge conference has held an international Tlingit spelling bee since 2015.
