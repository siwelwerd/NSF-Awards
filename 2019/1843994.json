 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from advancing the application territory of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and 4G/5G/Beyond-5G ecosystems. If successful, the obtained results would directly benefit a large portion of the current 8.4 billion wirelessly \"connected things\" with an estimated $273 billion market. It will facilitate \"always-on, anytime, anywhere\" network services and further help enable many emerging IoT applications (e.g., safe driving, remote healthcare, smart city, wearables). The technology is expected to create new business opportunities for IoT vendors, service providers, and mobile virtual network operators. If successful, it will facilitate evolution from an operator-centric network ecosystem to a user/application-centric ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a software-based solution to enabling dependable, software-defined network services for IoT applications. The objective for Phase I is to provide \"always-on, anytime, anywhere\" network service for billions of IoT devices and applications. Different from the current infrastructure-based solutions (using software-defined networking or network slicing), the proposed technology offers an in-device, SIM-based software solution without infrastructure upgrades or added device hardware. It enables in-SIM visibility to \"black-box\" mobile network operations, performs in-device optimizations using readily available mechanisms, and offers further value-added cloud services for network-wide optimization and management via crowdsourcing. The technology is readily deployable on today's IoT devices (both low-end and high-end) and provides \"must-have\" features for two customer segments (validated through NSF I-Corps interviews) - IoT mobile virtual network operators, and IoT application vendors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

(ii) The prior smartphone solution requires system-level OS privilege (\"root\" in Android and Jailbreak in iOS). To address both issues, MobIQ offers an in-SIM Java applet for the mobile network monitoring. The key premise is&nbsp;that, every IoT device needs a SIM card&nbsp; for mobile network access. The in-SIM solution can thus be used by all IoT devices with mobile network&nbsp;access. Such in-SIM software does not require the root or&nbsp;jailbreak for IoT devices.

Deploying such software inside devices is feasible for some IoT service providers (e.g., gaming phone vendors and wireless cameras for the outdoor targeted advertising), and has been required by one of our customers. Currently MobIQ supports for two IoT applications from our validated customers: (1) Gaming phone vendors: The gaming phones need high probability of &le;100ms end-to-end latency for seamless online gaming experiences. Existing infrastructure or above-IP solutions cannot fully meet this demand. Instead, MobIQ leverages the client-side, full-stack network information to perform the cross-layer optimizations;&nbsp; (2) Outdoor digital targeted advertisers: To&nbsp;maximize the successful ad delivery rate and thus revenue for our customers, the outdoor targeted advertisers&nbsp;should achieve high model detection accuracy (thus high bandwidth) and low ad delivery latency. With the client-side full-stack information, MobIQ holistically balance the accuracy and latency to maximize the successful ad delivery rate.</li>\n<li><strong>Value-Added cloud service</strong>: Beyond optimization in each device, we move further toward the value- added optimization via crowdsourcing. We observe that local optimization does not always result in globally optimal performance/reliability. Instead, by crowdsourcing the information from other devices (that use different bands/technologies/carriers), MobIQ can provide global knowledge and optimize IoT devices.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Field Trials With Potential Customers</strong>: We have started the filed trials with two potential customers, Xiaomi and Vivo. We have customized MobIQ to for Xiaomi and Vivo to optimize Glory of Kings, a multi-player online mobile games with 2M active players per month.
