 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of conserved biological processes require model organisms which share attributes with humans.  Most model organisms are easily grown in the laboratory and enable experimental manipulations.  Over the last forty years, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been instrumental in numerous fundamental advances in genetics, developmental biology, and neurobiology.  However, all of these discoveries come from studies of a single strain in the species.  This limitation is similar to the argument that we can understand all of human biology by the study of a single person in our species.  This project seeks to expand the C. elegans Natural Diversity Resource (CeNDR), which comprises nearly 1000 genetically distinct strains from around the world.  This genetic diversity facilitates discoveries about the evolution of physiological and behavioral traits, including responses to chemical and biotic stresses.  Because humans share many of the same genes and processes as this nematode species, studies using this organism can teach us a great deal about how the human population differs.\r\n\r\nCeNDR has three major goals: (1) Collect, organize, and disseminate wild C. elegans strains; (2) Organize and disseminate whole-genome sequence and variant data for wild strains; and (3) Provide a genetics portal to facilitate mappings and interpretations of results.  This project will address critical improvements to the methodology and technology of each of those goals.  These improvements will enable future discoveries with CeNDR and will enable the planned expansion to include strains, whole-genome data, and mappings for two related nematode species: C. briggsae and C. tropicalis.  This expansion to the Caenorhabditis Natural Diversity Resource (CaeNDR) will build unparalleled new capacity for comparative evolution approaches in nematodes and likely other organisms.  Most research groups do not have the combination of experimental, computational, and statistical training to easily perform studies of natural variation.  This project will make these tools available and usable by research laboratories across diverse model organism communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
