 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Instrumentation Programs. Professor Nikolaus Loening from Lewis and Clark College and colleagues Louis Kuo and Casey Jones are acquiring a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The NMR studies improve understanding of synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate students during the summer research period, in independent study projects during the academic year and as part of final-year undergraduate thesis projects. Collaborations with researchers at Linfield College, Pacific University and high schools are in place. \r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It is especially helpful in studies of how organometallic complexes are used to degrade pesticides and to desulfurize fossil fuels to make them more environmentally friendly as well as for developing and characterizing how compounds such as resveratrol are released from metals which may be relevant for stent design. The spectrometer is also useful for developing surface-supported catalysts for organic synthesis, and for characterizing the structures of venom peptides.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
