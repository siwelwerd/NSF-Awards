 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shale is a fine-grained sedimentary rock composed of softer materials such as clay and organics, as well as stiffer minerals such as quartz, feldspar, pyrite, and carbonates.  It is the most common sedimentary rock on Earth, estimated to represent between 44 and 56 percent of all sedimentary rocks.  Unlike crystalline rocks that tend to fracture under deformation, shales can serve as a seal because they are more pliable in the sense that they can undergo significant deformation without breaking.  However, they are also known to exhibit significant time-dependent deformation behavior, or creep, that is observed across spatial and temporal scales.  The tendency of shale to creep is well correlated with how the softer and stiffer components of this rock share an imposed load.  In addition, the reduction in sample volume during creep suggests that this phenomenon is accommodated by compaction of the pore spaces between the solid grains.  The latter process can lead to significant ground subsidence that often compromises the integrity and sustainability of civil infrastructures.  Using laboratory and numerical modeling techniques, this project will investigate the multiscale creep behavior in shale across space and time.  Laboratory experiments include indentation tests to probe the creep behavior at the nanometer scale, and triaxial tests on cylindrical specimens of rock to investigate creep at the millimeter scale.  The combined laboratory experimentation-numerical simulation activities of the project will involve the participation of undergraduate students through summer research.  A promotional video of the laboratory tests and numerical simulation results will be produced for recruiting graduate students as well as for outreach.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to capture the creep processes in shale at multiple scales in both space and time.  Scale-bridging techniques will be developed linking creep processes at the nanometer, micrometer, and millimeter scales.  Shale will be modeled as a mixture of softer matter (clay, organics) and stiffer matter (quartz, feldspar, pyrite, carbonates) whose creep behavior is described by Viscoplasticity Theory.  A framework developed from a previous NSF project entitled \"Creep in Shale at Submicron Scale\" will be employed to quantify creep of the softer matter from nano-indentation tests and creep of the shale matrix from micro-indentation tests.  Hold periods during nano- and micro-indentation will be timed to fully delineate the expected exponential decay of creep indentation. Validation of the model will be conducted from triaxial creep tests at the millimeter scale.  Indentation creep tests typically last no more than a few minutes, whereas triaxial creep tests last for several hours and even days.  This research will reconcile this very large discrepancy in the time scales for these two experiments.  Throughout the course of testing, the microstructure of the material will be imaged using Transmission X-ray Microscopy (TXM), micro-Computed Tomography (mCT), and conventional Computed Tomography (CT) to delineate the spatial heterogeneity of shale at different scales.  Creep of shale is one of the most intriguing and challenging phenomena in rock engineering because of the highly heterogeneous nature of this material.  The combined experimental-numerical investigation will accommodate heterogeneity and will lead to better understanding and more realistic modeling of creep processes in shale at multiple scales.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It is the most common sedimentary rock on Earth and is of particular interest with respect to hydrocarbon production as both a source and a seal rock. A notable feature of shale is its anisotropic behavior due to the existence of bedding planes resulting from the genesis of the rock. This makes its strength and stiffness different in the bed-parallel and bed-normal directions. Shale is also known to exhibit time-dependent deformation behavior, or creep, which could compromise its performance as a seal rock. This is due to the presence of clay and organic contents in the rock matrix, whose own constitutive properties change with time due to thermal, chemical, hydraulic, and other environmental factors.</p>\n<p>Creep in shale can manifest itself at multiple scales, from nanometer scale to millimeter scale, and beyond. In this project, we investigated the creep responses of an organic-rich Woodford shale sample at the nanometer scale using nano-indentation testing conducted at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The experiments entailed indenting the surface of a small shale sample with a nano-indenter, holding the load on the indenter fixed, and removing the load. The time-dependent indentation when the load was held fixed represents the creep behavior of the sample at the nanometer scale. We also investigated the creep responses of triaxial samples of the same shale at the John A. Blume Earthquake Engineering Center Structures Laboratory at Stanford University. In triaxial creep tests, cylindrical samples of the rock were subjected to different axial and radial stresses, which were held fixed throughout the duration of the tests. Creep deformations in the axial and radial directions were recorded. Figure 1 shows photographs of the nano-indentation and triaxial testing devices. Figure 2 shows the samples that were imaged on micro-CT at the Stanford Nano Shared Facilities. Due to the anisotropic behavior of the rock, both types of tests investigated the creep responses of the samples in the bed-parallel and bed-normal directions. Some of the results are reported in Figures 3 and 4, which show that the shale samples tested also exhibited anisotropic creep behavior.</p>\n<p>In order to link the creep responses of shale at the nanometer scale with those at the millimeter scale, we developed an elasto-viscoplastic constitutive model called Cam-Clay IX, which represents the constitutive response of the material at the micrometer scale, herein denoted as the \"meso-scale.\" The development of this model was necessitated by the fact that nanometer and millimeter scales are six orders of magnitude apart on the metric scale, so an intermediate scale must be introduced to bridge the gap between the two extreme scales. Apart from the difference in the spatial scales, there also exists a gap in the temporal scales since indentation creep tests last no more than 10 minutes whereas triaxial creep tests last several hours or even much longer. By introducing the intermediate scale, we connected the modulus of elasticity and viscosity of the rock inferred from the nano-indentation creep tests with those inferred from the triaxial creep tests, thereby bridging the two extreme scales in both space and time.</p>\n<p>Reference: Liu, Y., Burch, A.C., Bennett, K.C., Abousleiman, Y., Borja, R.I.
