 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides a framework to solicit multi-sector stakeholder values related to decision-making to improve community disaster resilience. It will help decision-makers prioritize resilience strategies by showing them systematically and quantitatively how much value stakeholders will gain from different strategies. This will lead to higher levels of satisfaction among the stakeholders and enable more collaborative decision making in disaster resilience. It will also help decision-makers better communicate the decisions involved in resilience investments with the public and make these investments more transparent. This scientific research contribution thus supports NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and to advance our national welfare. In this case, the benefits will be insights to improve community disaster resilience, which will save lives and reduce economic losses in the future.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to improve collaborative decision making towards more resilient communities through an innovative value-driven framework. To this end, the specific objectives are to: (1) identify and understand multi-sector stakeholder value systems on disaster resilience, (2) systematically aggregate the value systems of multi-sector stakeholders while accounting for social influences, (3) measure the value of alternative disaster resilience decisions to multi-sector stakeholders based on their aggregated value priorities, and (4) inform decision-makers on collaborative decision making in building more resilient communities for wider impact. This research will advance theories and methods in the interdisciplinary disaster literature as well as stakeholder theory with a new paradigm for conceptualizing and measuring the value of resilience decisions to multi-sector stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
