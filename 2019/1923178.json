 "awd_abstract_narration": "From jumping jacks to jumping for joy, the \"body language\" of human movement provides\r\nimportant information about the intentions and emotions of others. Growing evidence suggests\r\nthat we understand others' mental states by internally recreating, or simulating, their external\r\nactions. Yet questions remain about how different brain systems contribute to action simulation,\r\nand whether this process is linked to individual differences in social perception abilities. This\r\nresearch uses electroencephalography (EEG) to examine brain activity associated with action\r\nsimulation during observation of emotional body movements, both in typically developing\r\nindividuals and in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a condition associated with\r\nsocial perception impairments. By testing the link between EEG measures of action simulation\r\nand emotion perception capabilities across a broad sample of individual socio-emotional\r\nfunctioning, these data will provide a rigorous theoretical framework for understanding the\r\nneural basis of emotional action simulation. More broadly, the research may provide new\r\ninsights into the neural origins of social impairments observed in ASD, potentially leading to\r\nimproved diagnoses and therapies. Finally, these activities will promote undergraduate training\r\nin the STEM disciplines by providing authentic research opportunities for students including\r\nwomen and underrepresented minorities.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will examine the relation between perceptual and motor circuits in\r\nemotion simulation. In a previous EEG study, the investigators found distinct neural markers\r\nassociated with the observation of emotional and emotionally-neutral actions. Emotional actions\r\nelicited a reduction of cortical \"mu\" alpha rhythms (9-12 Hz) linked to perceptual aspects of\r\naction simulation, but neutral actions produced enhanced beta-band oscillations (14-20 Hz)\r\nassociated with motor planning and response inhibition. Both effects were attenuated in a nonclinical\r\nsample of individuals reporting greater autistic tendencies, suggesting these neural\r\nmarkers are sensitive to individual differences in social-emotional traits. The proposed research\r\nwill investigate the contribution of motor circuits to mu-alpha suppression for emotional actions\r\nby comparing action execution with observed emotional action and varying the familiarity and\r\nease of simulating observed emotional actions. Examination of individuals with ASD will\r\ndistinguish how mu and beta band activity relate to individual differences in emotional\r\nprocessing, allowing assessment of whether neurodevelopmental disruptions of sensorimotor\r\nsystems play a role in emotion simulation deficits. Collectively, these studies will provide\r\nimportant insights into the relations between EEG measures, action simulation processes, and\r\nemotion perception.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Also, very few studies looked at mu-alpha suppression for doing and viewing actions within the same participants. All of these issues made it difficult to say for sure that mu-alpha suppression really reflected action simulation. Also, because many studies used emotionally-neutral movements (like a hand opening and closing), another question was whether AO mu-alpha suppression would be visible for bodily expressions of emotion, the processing of which is impaired in ASD.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">To examine these questions, we performed experiments measuring mu-alpha suppression in over a hundred participants while they viewed videos of whole-body movements that could be either neutral (like marching in place) or emotional (like shaking a fist in anger).

This creates an experience of watching a moving person, but without any other body shape information. We could compare these PLDs of meaningful body movements (Coherent condition) to randomized versions of the same movements, keeping all the motion the same but destroying the sense of body movement (Scrambled condition).

However, during the time we were running the study, new data cleaning approaches were developed by other researchers.
