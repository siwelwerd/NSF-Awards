 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact / commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation-Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to enhance the well-being and productivity of commercially raised chickens in our food supply chain.   The poultry industry is highly competitive, and poultry has become one of the most efficient animal proteins to produce.  Billions of birds are grown in the United States each year and most are raised by independent farmers in cooperation with larger producers.  This PFI project is aimed at providing non-invasive, continuous monitoring of chicken flocks to alert the farmer to problems in a timely manner and aid the farmer in assessing the welfare and needs of his flocks.  The end result is expected to be healthier and better-cared for birds as well as improved farm productivity.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project makes it possible to use machine learning to monitor audio environments, in this case chicken farms, without needing extensive labeled training data.  The approaches typically used for audio machine learning require extensive labeled training sample sets and tuning.  However, humans can become familiar with the sounds in a particular situation, and notice when something occurs that does not belong, without significant training.  By using algorithms that learn the structure of sounds in an environment and learn the typical variation of those sounds, the methods used in the proposed project can act similarly to a human listener to notice significant changes (anomalies) in a soundscape on a farm.  The anomalies are characterized by severity and can be brought to the attention of a farmer or researchers who can choose to label or ignore the new sound.  Labeled sounds can then be used to automatically label future anomalies.  This project will deploy listening devices into multiple commercial chicken farms, collect continuous audio recordings and metadata, and use the collected data to improve the performance and usefulness of the systems for monitoring the chickens' welfare and their environment.  This listening method is non-invasive and causes no stress to the animals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOne important way that farmers monitor the welfare of chickens is by listening to the flock.  However, with many other responsibilities, they cannot listen to chickens all the time.  The focus of this research was to develop an automatic methodology for monitoring poultry production using simple audio hardware. In order to be practical for use on farms, the monitoring system should be very simple to operate, adapt to new locations and circumstances automatically, and be robust to environmental conditions.  Each farm is different, and conditions change continually over the course of a flock; thus, pretraining models is problematic.  Furthermore, a large amount of data is produced but it is not labeled&mdash;most machine-learned models require many labeled examples.  This project enabled large strides forward in understanding the problems of dealing with large-scale unlabeled data.  This includes evaluating data in the absence of labels and finding ways to label data efficiently.\n\nTo acquire audio, small, portable recording systems were developed and deployed in multiple chicken farms.  These systems continuously record audio from multiple areas of each chicken house for the entire life of the flock.  The processing system then learns the \"normal sounds\" of flock, much as a farmer would, and reports the extent to which observed sounds deviated from normal.  This is accomplished by using sparse signal modeling techniques to learn structure in the audio signals and then building statistical models of the normal occurrence of the structural elements.  To the extent that observed sounds differ from the constructed models, they are labeled as anomalous. \n\nIn addition to the anomaly detection, having specific detectors for chicken vocalizations, some types of machine sounds, and sounds associated with chicken activity (such as pecking the water nipples) is very useful.  The training of such detectors requires a large amount of labeled data (examples) from diverse circumstances.  To facilitate this, automated methods to pre-label data based automatic segmentation and clustering were developed.  Using these methods, a large amount of labeled data was produced, particularly for young chickens, where deviations in performance can have a large impact on the long-term viability of a flock.\n\nWe have implemented several approaches to doing cough and chirp detection using the data that has been labeled. Sleep quality was assessed based on chirp detection during the nighttime hours. And models that detect chicken activity level in quiet and in the presence of noise were developed.  Preliminary models for detecting the types of chicken vocalizations (such as distress calls) and the severity of coughing and snick sounds were also developed. \n\nThe resulting systems can detect anomalous behavior and provide valuable feedback to the farmer as to the state of the birds on a continual basis.  A major motivation for those in the livestock industry is to maximize health and welfare of livestock (e.g., poultry).  By providing the innovative methods described herein, we hope to be able to provide a means for farmers to know, and to assure the public, that their animals are treated humanely and continually monitored. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/11/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David V Anderson"
