 "awd_abstract_narration": "In July 2018, the Carr Fire burned nearly 230,000 acres, including the area surrounding the Iron Mountain Superfund Site where mine-impacted drainage is diverted into the Spring Creek Reservoir. Microbes alter the water and sediment chemistry in the reservoir and change the quality of the water flowing downstream. This year, rain falling on the burn scar during the wet season is expected to cause rapid erosion and deposit extra sediment into the lake. This project will investigate how contaminated sediments are deposited in the lakes, and how microbes transform sediment, pore water, and reservoir water. Project personnel will examine inflowing sediments, microbial communities from the sediment, as well as water quality in the reservoir following storm events in the 2018/2019 season. Results will show how microbial activity changes sediment chemistry and water quality in the Spring Creek Reservoir and provide insights into similar burned over areas and mine-impacted soils. Mining activities in the Western USA has resulted in thousands of miles of streams impacted by acid mine discharge, and widespread contamination of soils by mine and smelter operations.  Discharge of contaminated water and sediment from the Iron Mountain mine has historically impacted the upper Sacramento River, an important drinking water source and salmon spawning stream. The results of this project will help mine managers, local and regional environmental planners and reservoir managers understand the movement and fate of remobilized sediments, and to plan for the effects of wildfire on the vegetation and reclamation infrastructure that help to stabilize contaminated soils.  \r\n\r\nThe Iron Mountain Superfund Site contains the remnants of several abandoned mines, and Spring Creek drains part of this area with the Spring Creek Debris Dam and reservoir (SCR) capturing discharge before it enters the Keswick Reservoir and Sacramento River. In July 2018, the Carr Fire burned most of the Spring Creek watershed, and thus, sedimentation is expected to be high during the 2018/19 rainy season. The influx of sediment provides an opportunity to investigate how microbial communities colonize and transform sediment and pore waters in an acid mine drainage-influenced lake. Prior research in the SCR suggests that microbial communities reduce iron and sulfate in pore waters during high reservoir levels, and that iron and sulfide oxidize when water levels are low, producing acidity and mobilizing metals.  The proposed research will characterize sediment influx, how microbial communities develop within the new sediment, and how microbial activity changes pore water chemistry. The research team will sample and analyze the sediments and pore and surface water 8 times from November 2018 to 2019. Analyses will include mineralogy; iron, sulfur, oxygen, and pH of the water; and molecular analyses of the microbial communities. This research will provide fundamental insights into environmental biogeochemistry in acid mine drainage-contaminated environments and provide guidance for managing the water quality in the SCR.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
