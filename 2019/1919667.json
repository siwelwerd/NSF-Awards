 "awd_abstract_narration": "This 11 public university collaboration in Virginia develops ACCORD, an innovative research computing cyberinstrument to support the storage, access, and usage of sensitive data for researchers at participating institutions across the State. Beyond simply securing research data, the ACCORD cyberinstrument provides customizable secured research environments that can be integrated into each institution's workflows and security models to assure compliance with relevant laws and regulations applicable to specific data types. Through ACCORD, researchers across the State of Virginia have access to new research computing capabilities not previously possible (or not easily accessible), enabling them to undertake projects that require complex protection of sensitive data. In addition to enabling new research, ACCORD advances important dimensions of research such as reproducibility and data accountability. ACCORD is also a new model for collaboration, providing a common platform for researchers at multiple institutions and in different disciplines to securely share data and analytics.\r\n\r\nIn addition to driving exciting scientific discoveries with strong societal impact, the Virginia ACCORD program prioritizes research training and education in data security and privacy for students and researchers across the State. The Virginia ACCORD Consortium comprises universities of different sizes and missions, including minority-serving and non-PhD granting institutions, and is an effective platform for outreach and broadening participation to underrepresented and underserved communities. Lessons learned from the ACCORD's new model of collaboration and sharing compute resources are also being disseminated to other research computing consortia and communities across the U.S.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

ACCORD's operational model is built around balancing security, especially data protection, with accessibility. In addition to providing secure research computing resources and services, the project also resulted in a set of policies that enable researchers external to UVA to access and use ACCORD.\n\n\nThe team achieved its mission of providing secure research computing services supporting researchers at UVA, across the State of Virginia, and outside of Virginia. The project led to the development of a policy framework for sharing sensitive research data between institutions, the deployment of an advanced system stack into production service, and the establishment of a user community.\n\n\nKey outcomes of the project include:\n\n\n1. ACCORD cyberinstrument: The PI team successfully built and deployed the ACCORD secure computing system at UVA. ACCORD's key components include: (1) an onboarding process that determines up front the user's security posture, responsibilities, and access to the system, (2) a container-based computing environment that provisions resources and applications per the user request, and (3) hardware resources.
