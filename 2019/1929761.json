 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for offsetting registration and travel expenses to enable 15 graduate students to attend the 2019 Titanium USA conference, September 22-24 in Mobile, Alabama.. The attending students will participate in the conference by giving technical papers, and participating in a poster session to display their research, and attending technical sessions. The funding opportunity will be broadly announced, affording students ample notice and time to apply. Applications will be reviewed by committee, and he support provided will cover the student registration as well as travel expenses.\r\n\r\nThe support will provide 15 selected students with the opportunity to participate in the preeminent titanium industry research conference in the US. Student participation at national manufacturing conferences is crucial to expanding the manufacturing research base in the US. Students obtain unique experiences and interactions with academic and industry researchers, and are motivated by the opportunity to present their own work. Participation at conference also gives them the opportunity to learn about the latest research results in their area, and to explore interest in new areas of titanium manufacturing. Additionally, exposure to research from others helps to instill a good foundational understanding of the scientific method, which will serve them well throughout their careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
