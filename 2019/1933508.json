 "awd_abstract_narration": "The BUGCAT conference (Binghamton University Graduate Conference in Algebra and Topology) is a yearly conference at Binghamton University, that has been running since 2008. It is aimed primarily at the graduate students and recent PhDs in Algebra, Topology, and related areas of mathematics. The current grant will support the conference for the next three years, starting with BUGCAT 2019 which will be held from November 2-3, 2019. The conference website is https://www2.math.binghamton.edu/p/bugcat/start.\r\n\r\nConference participation is an irreplaceable component in the development of young mathematicians. It is especially helpful if a conference is run at the level appropriate for graduates students so that they can both understand the various ideas and trends and present their own research. This is especially important for the members of underrepresented  groups: they are often more prone to being unduly intimidated by high-level research conferences. The BUGCAT conference is run for the graduate students, by the graduate students, with a diverse group of organizers. It strives to provide an inclusive environment for young researchers in Algebra, Topology, and related fields. These are some of the traditional areas of strength at Binghamton University, with a large number of local graduate student participants and organizers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
