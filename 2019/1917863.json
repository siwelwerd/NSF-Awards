 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the Undergraduate Knot Theory Conference 2019, held at the University of Washington Bothell on July 19-21, 2019. Knot theory is a field very amenable to research by undergraduates; a variety of REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) programs in mathematics have a knot theory component.  Moreover, many faculty members would like to involve students in undergraduate research in knot theory. This conference will bring together experts in knot theory with undergraduates who are either currently participating in knot theory REUs, undergraduates who have participated in knot theory research, current graduate students who participated as undergraduates in knot theory research, and perhaps most importantly, faculty who either have involved undergraduates in knot theory research or who would like to involve undergraduates.\r\n\r\nThis conference provides an opportunity for students to experience a mathematics research conference specifically designed for and directed toward them. As a centerpiece, the conference features a collective problem session to give participants numerous ideas for future research directions. Moreover, the conference will establish a supportive network of students and faculty with an interest in knot theory research, thus furthering the involvement of students in the field of mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe conference URL is https://sites.google.com/view/unknot-iv/home\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
