This year the event will take place in Beijing, China in mid-July. The purpose is to facilitate technical exchange of information and research conversations/collaborations, as well as advances in the field made possible by these interactions. Mechanisms are specified to ensure participation of under-represented groups.\r\n\r\nThe benefits are the education, training and mentoring received by the participants. The international nature of this conference helps develop a globally-aware workforce of research and educators within the US and helps build the community of researchers in the field of Software Engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
