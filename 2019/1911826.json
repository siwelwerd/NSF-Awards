 "awd_abstract_narration": "Social interactions during early life can have large impacts on the development of behavioral patterns, cognitive abilities and the brain. Research in humans has found correlations between early experiences and cognitive-behavioral traits. This project will test these relationships using manipulative experiments with swordtail fish. Previous research in fish has determined that a particular kind of stressful social interaction known as sexual conflict (where males and females disagree over mating rates) can lead to an increase in female brain size. Meanwhile, other research has suggested that having to navigate different kinds of social interactions (also known as social complexity) may result in enhanced cognitive capabilities. The research will test these two competing hypotheses by controlling social conditions during rearing in a fish system that exhibits social complexity and sexual conflict. There are three different types of swordtail males, which represent different levels of sexual conflict towards females (high, low or intermediate sexual conflict). By raising female swordtails in social environments that vary in the type of males present, researchers can quantify how sexual conflict and social complexity shape adult behaviors (including anxiety, aggression and sociability), cognition (learning abilities), and determine which brain regions grow or diminish in response to different social experiences.  This research will have broader impacts that affect both local and national students through the investigator's efforts to incorporate her research into local high school outreach program and the Freshman Research Initiative course at the University of Texas, and through student-initiated national media products (YouTube) on this research.\r\n\r\nSexual conflict, the mismatch in optimal mating rates between the sexes, is ubiquitous across animals. While the morphological consequences of this struggle are well-studied, less is known about the behavioral and cognitive consequences of sexual conflict. In this study, the investigator will experimentally examine the developmental effects of sexual conflict in the swordtail fish (Xiphophorus nigrensis), which has three alternative male phenotypes that represent different levels of sexual conflict towards females: courting males (low conflict), coercive males (high conflict), and males who both court and coerce (mixed conflict). Female swordtails will be raised from birth to early adulthood in one of five social environments that vary in levels of both sexual conflict and social complexity.  At adulthood, females will partake in a broad range of assays to determine how social experiences shape behavioral and cognitive traits. These assays evaluate anxiety, sociability and exploratory tendencies as well as associative learning, cognitive flexibility and social cognition capabilities.  Female brains will be examined to determine how social environment influences the development of distinct brain regions and receptor distribution of candidate social pathways including isotocin and synaptic plasticity markers. The results of this experiment will identify how the social environment influences the development of behavioral tendencies, as well as directly test competing hypotheses for enhanced cognition and brain development (sexual conflict versus social complexity). It will also identify which brain regions (focusing on the social decision-making network) undergo differential development in response to specific social interactions associated with conflict and complexity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We overcame the difficulty of isolating specific social interactions from other developmental forces by conducting manipulative rearing experiments with swordtail fish. We took advantage of the diverse range of behavioral phenotypes found in male swordtails to quantity how specific social interactions shape the development of a wide range of female traits. We raised female swordtails from birth to adulthood in five uniquely different social rearing treatments that varied by social conflict, complexity, and variability. We found these different social experiences resulted in predictable differences in a comprehensive suite of traits including stress response, stress coping styles, boldness and aggression attributes, cognitive performances across domains, and neurogenomic pathways.\n\n\nIntellectual Merit: We found that the presence of social conflict specifically high degrees of sexual harassment from males towards females led to developmental changes in female stress response, stress coping styles, and social cognition capabilities. Female swordtails raised with the highest degree of sexual conflict had higher stress responses (released more cortisol in response to acute stressors). They also had uniquely different stress coping styles (a predictable relationship between stress response, boldness, and cognitive flexibility) than females from other social rearing groups. Females from the highest conflict environment developed along a continuum of traditional stress coping styles ranging from proactive types (bolder, low stress response, low cognitive flexibility) to reactive types (shyer, high stress response and high cognitive flexibility). Interestingly, these females from the harshest social environment were the only rearing environment to demonstrate high levels of social cognition. Social cognition is an advanced form of cognition that requires one to identify individuals, remember their actions, and react towards them in adaptive ways. We used fish animations with novel male phenotypes behaving in different ways (harassing vs neutral) to test female social cognition. Females raised with the highest rates of sexual coercion were the only treatment group able to demonstrate recognition and adaptive responses towards these novel males. These females outperformed other females who were raised in more socially complex or variable environments that included males who both harassed and courted them. These results provided the first direct empirical test of multiple theories for cognitive development and provide strong support for harsh environments having a more formative role in shaping social cognitive than socially complex or variable environments.\n\n\nComplex and more variable social environments led to the development of females that were bolder but less aggressive than females raised in simpler social environments with only a single type of male. We found that females raised in socially complex and variable environments were surprisingly less adept at social cognition and spatial cognition tasks than females from simpler or more harsh environments. We identified a trade-off across cognitive domains that might explain this pattern. Examining females across all social rearing treatments, we found a negative correlation between performance in a cognitive flexibility task and performance in the social cognition task. This trade-off identified in our developmental experiments was also consistent with patterns emerging from species comparative research. We examined cognitive flexibility and spatial learning across 4 species that are close swordtail relatives and found that females from more socially complex species were better at cognitive flexibility tasks and worse at spatial cognition tasks than females from species with simpler (and more harsh) social interactions.\n\n\nLastly, we examined the neurogenomic response of females reared in these different social environments following the social cognition assay and identified that females engaged in different neurogenomic pathways based upon their social rearing experience. The whole brain transcriptomic profiles (the suites of genes that are transcribed while females approached a novel social cognition task) differed significantly between females raised in complex conditions relative to those raised in simpler social worlds. Furthermore, we found that the neurogenomic profiles also differ based upon when individuals experience these social interactions. We compared the neurogenomic profiles of females raised from birth relative to females who entered these treatments as adults and found very different engagement of stress pathways, boldness pathways, cognition and epigenetic pathways based on lifestage.\n\n\nBroader Impacts: This research significantly impacted the career paths of emerging scientists at different levels. Hundreds of undergraduate freshmen students at UT received their first taste of hands-on scientific research by working on elements of this research project through the Freshman Research Initiative (FRI). Furthermore, hundreds of upperclassmen UT undergraduates began scoring, analyzing, and writing about this this research as part of PI Cummings Principles of Animal Behavior course. At least 30 undergraduates were further inspired to become undergraduate researchers in the Cummings lab and be directly involved in conducting the multitude of experiments this research spanned. In addition, three PhD students and two postdocs furthered their careers by working intimately on this research.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/18/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MollyCummings\n"
