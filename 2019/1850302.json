 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) by engaging in hands-on field experience, laboratory/project-based entrepreneurship tasks and mentorship experiences.\r\n\r\nMorehouse College will engage 36 students from underrepresented groups in grades 6 through 10 in a 3-year STEM technology program that will include a four-week summer program, hands-on field experience, and Saturday academy during the academic year. The program utilizes a project-based framework designed to provide underrepresented minority students with challenging technological learning experiences. Specifically, the project will expose students to innovation and creativity in STEM disciplines within the context of real-world problem-solving scenarios utilizing entrepreneurial concepts in to promote academic success in middle school and high school and prepare students academically to attend a college or university. The goals of the project are: 1) Increase student awareness and knowledge of educational opportunities and STEM careers. 2) Increase student knowledge, skills and practices represented in STEM and/ or STEM workforce.  3) Increase broadening participation of underrepresented populations in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis project is a collaboration of the Division of Science & Mathematics and the Morehouse College Entrepreneurship Center with local school districts and local industry partners. The project is a global model for higher education and industry collaborations with programs that connect education with student leadership development, and community-focused resources. This project provides: (1) supplemental STEM education; 2) hands-on laboratory project-based entrepreneurial experiences; 3) role models from academia and industry; and 4) parental involvement.  The research questions will address the following: (a) What factors and key experiences effectively promote awareness of STEM careers, motivation to pursue a STEM career, and persistence in undertaking education pathways to those careers, particularly among students from underrepresented populations? (b) In what roles and in what ways do parents, mentors, caregivers, and other community members motivate students to become aware of, interested in, and prepared for STEM careers?  Research questions will be answered with both descriptive statistics and outcome analysis. Qualitative and quantitative measures will be used. Techniques will include surveys, interviews, focus groups, document analysis, and measures of participation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Students identified a problem in their community regarding sound and used innovative tools to develop demos and prototypes to address the issue (e.g., hearing device for those who are deaf or hearing impaired). During a subsequent summer program, students discovered how careers in STEM can be fulfilling, as professionals work to solve problems in the natural world and universe. Students applied Design Process to COVID-19 during the Innovation component in an effort to develop prototypes that would allow students to return to school in the Fall. Students also studied the Implications of COVID-19 on the Black Community and developed an online museum to share their findings. The following semester they studied the Chemistry of Baking and contributed to a collaborative cookbook featuring custom cookies that resulted from student research of dietary restrictions in their families and health disparities in Black communities at large.&nbsp; For their next project, they examined conversations and controversies surrounding climate justice, climate change, and sustainability. They investigated these phenomena with a focus on single-use plastics and their impacts on vulnerable populations. Students produced news segments about single use plastics in the context of the community dependency on plastics and solutions to reduce or eliminate this dependency. Finally, they explored the importance of everyone having access to clean drinking water and sanitation and the STEM skills associated with the water filtration process.&nbsp; Students learned about the challenge of being able to access clean drinking water, how communities with limited access to clean water navigate collecting water, as well as different career pathways in the industry through participation in a field trip and interactions with industry professionals.&nbsp; Students were able to apply their water filtration skills in a real-world situation on their field trip.</p>\n<p>The working team for this project was composed of Morehouse faculty from STEM departments, Center for Teacher Preparation and Leadership center, along with an Academic Advisor Specialist and 6-12th grade STEM faculty from the local school districts.&nbsp; This group met two to three times per month and developed curriculum for the iSTEM-Xe program that took into consideration pre-college faculty understanding of their students? current competencies as well as Morehouse faculty understanding of the students? competencies that are critical for success in STEM careers.&nbsp; This group?s ongoing collaboration and regular project working meetings made it possible to quickly shift the implementation of the program to a virtual format in response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Of note, there was 100% retention during the first year of the virtual implementation (Summer 2020, Fall 2020, Spring 2021) and 97.3% retention through the fourth session of virtual implementation (Summer 2020, Fall 2020, Spring 2021, Summer 2021) which suggests that the shift to virtual programing was successfully implemented.</p>\n<p>The iSTEM-Xe project was designed to increase the number of underrepresented individuals in STEM careers.&nbsp; Morehouse College is an independent, fully accredited, historically Black, liberal arts college for men and is a pioneer in the preparation of young Black males to assume leadership in higher education, science, and government.
