 "awd_abstract_narration": "The tenth Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on the Physics and Chemistry of Microfluidics will be held from June 16th through June 21st, 2019 at the Regal Riverside Hotel in Hong Kong, China. The meeting will involve participants from all research sectors including academia, industry, and the federal government. This conference will offer a unique forum and intimate professional setting for the exchange of new ideas, presentation and discussion of unpublished results, speculative discussions, and opportunities for new interdisciplinary collaborations among attendees. This project will fund participation of women, underrepresented minorities, and early career researchers (graduate students, postdocs, and early career scientists), in the meeting. Funds will be utilized to offset registration fees for these participants.\r\n\r\nThe meeting provides a unique intellectual experience in which scientific researchers from many different disciplines come together in an intimate forum to discuss research and forge partnerships that are critical to the health and growth of our highly multidisciplinary field. The meeting will have topics that represent the latest advances in the field of microfluidics and nano-fluidics. Topics that will be discussed in invited oral and poster sessions include chemical and pharmaceutical synthesis, quantitative biology and biophysics, energy and the environment, electro-kinetic separations, complex and multiphase flows, systems biology, synthetic biology, additive manufacturing, precision medicine, and organoids on a chip. These topics have broad fundamental and applied scientific impact. Young scientists, including graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and young faculty, are invited to present their latest work during several poster sessions at the conference. The poster sessions have been dynamic and interactive and are an integral part of the research presentations. A student led Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) will also be held the weekend before the start of the GRC at the same location. The GRS is a two-day seminar that brings together graduate students, post-docs, and other early career scientists with comparable levels of experience to exchange new data and ideas.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
