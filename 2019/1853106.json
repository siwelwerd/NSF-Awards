 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to reduce the cost of formulating laundry detergents by 30-50% through the development of a single detergent chemical that replaces the need for numerous chemicals in existing detergent formulations. Commercialization of the proposed dual-function detergent molecule eliminates the need for chemicals commonly used to maintain the function in hard water conditions. Reduction of the amount and number of chemicals needed in a detergent formulation will enable production of 25% more concentrated detergent products, reducing packaging costs and enabling easier formulation of single-dose tablets. The technology offsets the carbon footprint of detergent chemical production by using plant-based starting materials instead of the current petroleum-based products, which currently dominate the industry. Additionally, reduction in the amount of chemicals used in detergents reduces environmental impact to water resources and wildlife. \r\n\t\r\nThis SBIR Phase II proposes to further develop a bi-functional surfactant chemical for laundry detergent applications, including (1) identification of a best performing surfactant for commercialization, (2) development of a scaled synthesis process using a high-throughput automated reactor system, and (3) demonstration of the performance of the material in laundry detergent formulations and measure the cleaning performance of generated formulations. The technology will reduce the cost of laundry detergent formulations by eliminating the need for chelating agents, which are used to mitigate the negative effects of hard water common in cleaning applications. The bi-functional surfactant molecules take the role of both a surfactant and a chelating agent, thereby enabling more concentrated detergents, especially for formulators of plant-based, environmentally-friendly detergents. The technical objectives direct development of the new detergent molecules through iterative design and testing of detergent structures, resulting in identification of a first to market product, as well as reaction engineering and optimization to direct efficient design of the process technology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Initial project work built on oleo-furan sulfonate (OFS) surfactants previously developed by Sironix, which are fully biorenewable, plant-based alternatives to petrochemical-based surfactants with improved function for a number of cleaning and detergency applications (Image 1). Phase 1 work sought to test a variety of alternative aromatic organic compounds in place of furan in the acylation reaction to produce Sironix?s surfactant precursors, including compounds that would allow for less expensive feedstock use, such as furfural and furfuryl alcohol, or compounds that may provide unique surfactant performance, such as pyrrole. Results from these tests indicate furans have a unique and fortuitous reactivity that allow for acylation with plant oil-based fatty acids without degrading the furan ring structure; all other aromatic compounds were found to preferentially degrade or produce resins instead of producing surfactant precursors.</p>\n<p>Throughout the remainder of Phase I project work, a unique chemical process known as hydroxyalkylation was refined and, for the first time, applied to the production of new dianionic OFS surfactants (Image 2). Project work also explored the properties of these new surfactants in comparison to their petroleum-based counterparts currently being produced on the commercial scale. Similar to OFS surfactants previously developed by Sironix, the advantages provided by the dianionic plant-based surfactants in these application studies, including improvements in hard water and cold-water stability, provided validation for a competitive market advantage in consumer products such as laundry detergents. These findings helped further elucidate target markets where Sironix can demonstrate a value advantage to product developers both in application performance and in providing biobased ingredients consumers are increasingly requesting to improve sustainable practices as a part of their lifestyle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Work in the second phase of project work explored how OFS surfactant properties can be altered by changing the feedstocks the surfactants are sourced from, namely the type of natural oils and the resulting carbon content incorporated into the production process (Image 3). The results from this study expanded knowledge of structure-function relationships for this new class of surfactants, which was formerly unexplored. Two conclusions were derived from this work, (1) production of OFS surfactants from variable plant oil feedstocks is achievable, increasing supply chain diversity, and (2) the optimal surfactant structure from an application performance standpoint was selected as the focus for production process refinement and scaling; the preferred surfactant structures would utilize coconut oil as the fatty aldehyde feedstock. With these results in hand, the focus of project work shifted to screening chemical reaction conditions for a scalable OFS surfactant production process. A critical aspect of the reaction process and the primary focus of reaction screening for Phase II project work was catalyst selection, which impacts key parameters of the reaction process including how much of the feedstocks are converted to product, the temperature and pressures needed to facilitate the reaction, as well as the ability of the process to yield the intended product and avoid unwanted or even detrimental byproducts.</p>\n<p>The final project work concluding Phase II research involved the construction of and reaction screening on a custom design flow reactor to transition from the previously collected batch process results. The flow reactor was designed with programmable temperature adjustments, variable pressure settings, adjustable reagent flow rates, and automated sampling to allow for high-throughput reaction condition screening. The focus of this work was to expand knowledge of the hydroxyalkylation reaction facilitated in a continuous process, for which there was no literature precedence, and tune reaction conditions to optimize product yield and facilitate catalyst reuse. With the conclusion of project work, we have identified solvent-free, industrially relevant conditions for the production of surfactant intermediates from sustainably sourced plant materials. This constitutes the first known flow process featuring this reaction pathway for surfactant preparation, and concludes a demonstration of this surfactant production technology at sufficient scale to produce sample quantities for potential customers and to proceed with work toward manufacturing. As a result of this project?s work, Sironix can approach contract manufacturers with a prototype continuous flow process that can be modified to produce surfactant precursor on the pilot scale.
