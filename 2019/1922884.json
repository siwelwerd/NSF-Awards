 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is funding to partially support a Doctoral Research Consortium (workshop) of about 20 promising graduate students along with a panel of 6 distinguished researchers from academia and industry; in accordance with CISE policy, the award will support just the 9 students from U.S.-based educational institutions in addition to the panelists.  This 2-day event will take place on May 4-5 in conjunction with the ACM 2019 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2019) sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Human-Computer Interaction (SIGCHI), which will be held May 4-9 in Glasgow, UK.  This will be the first time that CHI has taken place in the UK and it will be hosted at the Scottish Event Campus in Glasgow.  The annual CHI conferences are the leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of human-computer interaction (HCI) research and practice, and they are attended by more than 3,000 HCI professionals from around the world.  Research reports published in the CHI Conference Proceedings and the CHI Extended Abstracts are heavily-refereed and widely cited; they are among the most scientifically respected and impactful research publications in the field of HCI.  More information about this year's conference, whose theme is \"Weaving the Threads of CHI,\" is available online at https://chi2019.acm.org/.  The annual CHI doctoral consortia traditionally bring together the best of the next generation of HCI researchers, allowing them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development.  Applications are encouraged from all doctoral students whose research is HCI-related, regardless of the fields in which they are earning their degrees.  To increase the broad impact of the event, the organizers are committed to diversity.  Due to timing issues, the student participants for 2019 have already been selected; there are a total of 20 students (approximately 10 females and 10 males) who represent a wide range of topic areas and backgrounds; in addition, no more than two students will be from any given institution.\r\n\r\nThe CHI Doctoral Consortium is a research-focused meeting that has taken place annually at the CHI conference since 1986, and has helped to launch the careers of many outstanding HCI researchers.  Goals of the workshop include building a cohort group of new researchers who will have a network of colleagues spread out across the world, guiding the work of new researchers by having experts in the field give them advice, and making it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend their research conference.  This year's DC will once again adopt the successful schedule implemented in 2017 and 2018, where the group breaks into clusters of 3-4 students paired with one faculty panelist.  Each student participant will have a time slot of approximately 20 minutes in which to make a formal presentation about his or her doctoral research and to receive feedback both from the faculty panelist and the other student participants.  The feedback will be constructive and geared to help the students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other HCI research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  Follow up activities, including two poster sessions, are planned during the technical program of the conference, and the students' work will be published in the CHI 2019 Extended Abstracts.  SIGCHI's conference management committee will evaluate the doctoral research consortium, and the results will be made available to the organizers of future consortia.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
