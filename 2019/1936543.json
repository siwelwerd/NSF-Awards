The conference focuses on recent developments in analysis, especially in the areas of applied analysis, approximation theory, potential theory, and complex analysis. \r\n\r\nA number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to participate in this conference. This award gives early-career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, and others an opportunity to participate in the conference. The organizing committee will strive to advertise this widely through a number of different activities. More information will be made available at http://mwaa.math.iupui.edu/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
