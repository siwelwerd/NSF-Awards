 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cyclical variations in environmental conditions, like tides or seasons, comprise a common theme in nature. Living organisms must cope with repetitive arrivals of unfavorable conditions for survival. Therefore species around the world are under evolutionary pressure to schedule their \"life cycles\" or \"life histories\" to fit the environmental cycle regimes within which they reside. Recent climate change has shifted historical cyclical patterns in many ecosystems, such as season length, resulting in mismatches between life histories and the ideal environmental conditions of plants and animals, to the detriment of population persistence and ecological stability.  Adaptive evolution offers a mechanism that may buffer these mismatches. Accumulating evidence of shifts in life history schedules from around the world shows us that much remains to be done to understand how life histories are \"fit\" to environmental cycles, and to changes in cycles, despite their everyday familiarity.  Testing theoretical ideas with data and experiments is essential. Marine coastal habitats are subject to conspicuous cycles occurring at multiple time scales, such as diel, tidal, lunar, seasonal, and multi-annual fluctuations. Populations of the intertidal crustacean Tigriopus californicus occupy rocky shore across the entire eastern Pacific coastline in upper tidepools that are periodically wave-swept at high tide at varying intervals. This project develops mathematical models to uncover fundamental rules of life history variation and adaptation in regularly varying environments, and tests hypotheses across Tigriopus californicus populations experiencing varying tidal disturbances using efficient and highly replicated field collections and manipulative experiments in the lab. Beyond producing broadly applicable theory and abundant open-access data, the investigators engage with local Makah Tribe students near field sites for sampling and natural history studies to enhance STEM education in an underserved rural community. Furthermore, the project expands the nation?s scientific capacity by training undergraduate and graduate students in experimental design, theoretical modelling in population ecology and life history evolution, and data analysis.\r\n\r\nHow natural populations persist in variable environments has been a long-standing question in ecology and evolution. In particular, cyclical variability is common in nature, and many species show predictable life history strategies that follow cycles in nature (e.g. phenology). However, a general conceptual framework is lacking for how adaptation to cycles occurs and how the scaling of life histories to fluctuations buffers changes in the environment. Marine environments fluctuate predictably across a range of temporal scales, such as tidal and seasonal, and provide unique opportunities to study population persistence and evolution in cyclical environments. A general mathematical framework is developed that explores life history optimization in the context of cyclically varying environments. The marine intertidal copepod Tigriopus californcus is ideal for testing model predictions and motivating extensions. Many isolated populations can be sampled entirely in the field, and the short timescale of tide cycles, short generation times, and ease of frequent sampling will provide a dense dataset of eco-evolutionary patterns in response to natural disturbance regimes. Pilot studies have established experimental populations in the laboratory, and have proven that Tigriopus californcus is amenable to careful manipulations of simulated disturbance frequency (both cyclical and stochastic) that seamlessly translate to the model framework. The combination of modelling, field parameterization, and experimental investigation of life histories in cyclical and stochastic environments is a novel and holistic approach to the question of life history diversity within an environment. Finally, a general understanding of evolutionary mechanisms in cyclical environments can improve predictions of the fate of populations when natural cycles are perturbed, which is expected across many ecosystems due to climate change.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
