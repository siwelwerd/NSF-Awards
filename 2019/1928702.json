 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This project investigates the mechanical integrity of a new breed of multifunctional ceramic composites with advanced properties such as low density, high strength, and high thermal stability. Potential applications for these novel materials include porous membranes for separation processes, heterogeneous solid catalysts, corrosion-resistant coatings, insulation system parts, and low carbon footprint concrete alternatives. This research formulates new design rules for damage-tolerant novel ceramic materials and new standards for quality assessment of material components. The research activities provide training for undergraduate and graduate students in nanomaterials science, advanced mechanics, and nanotechnology. This research supports the organization of high school science outreach workshops in collaboration will local high schools to promote the recruitment and retention of underrepresented groups into science and engineering disciplines.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: This project investigates the premature failure of advanced aluminosilicate nanocomposites due to prolonged exposure to low-level repetitive loadings. This is an important issue as early failure usually results in shortened service lifetimes and increased maintenance costs of components. Using cutting-edge nanoscale depth-sensing methods, this research seeks to generate new microstructure-performance relationships. The knowledge generated could lead to new materials design rules and thus accelerate the insertion of aluminosilicate nanohybrids in science and engineering applications. The research rests on a strong partnership between industry (Anton Paar) and academia (Northwestern University) leading to a joint academia-industry workshop focused on advances in surface mechanical characterization. This research contributes to a skilled and diverse workforce through research internship opportunities for undergraduate students and training opportunities for graduate students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Fatigue is pervasive accounting for 90% of service failures due to mechanical causes. The research goal is to understand the influence of porosity and heterogeneity on the fatigue behavior of geopolymer composites reinforced with nanofibers or nanoparticles. Geopolymers or aluminosilicate materials are amorphous alkali-bonded ceramics that are synthesized at low temperatures by dissolving an aluminosilicate source in an alkali-silicate solution. Understanding their fatigue performance is very crucial.&nbsp; In turn, a fundamental understanding of fatigue phenomena at the nanoscale and microscale will result in reduced maintenance costs, better structural integrity, and increased service lifetimes of structural components made of geopolymer nanocomposites.</p>\n<p>Intellectual Merit:</p>\n<p>We measured the fatigue response of geopolymer composites using cyclic indentation. A monotonic decrease of the initial yield strength was observed as a function of the number of cycles.&nbsp;Compared to homogeneous materials, a higher decrease in the initial strength is observed for metakaolin-based potassium geopolymer. Furthermore, the presence of carbon nanofibers (CNF) increases the heterogeneity of the strength response and of the fatigue response. For 0.1 wt% CNF, a higher&nbsp;relative decrease in the initial yield strength is observed compared to pure geopolymer. For 0.5 wt% CNF, the relative decrease in the initial yield strength is more modest and the strength vs. number of cycles curve converges.</p>\n<p>We investigated the influence of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) on the structure and properties of geopolymers. We found that multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) template the structure of geopolymers at the nanoscale. They fill micropores and bridge microcracks. Geopolymer nanoparticles growth is observed along the walls of MWCNTs, and a reduction in grain size is observed when the frction of MWCNTs increases. MWCNTs preserve the amorphous structure of geopolymers and promote a denser structure.&nbsp;Our testing shows that MWCNTs lead to an overall decrease in porosity, along with a drastic change in pore size distribution from a single dominant peak to a lowered diffusive peak.</p>\n<p>Broader Impacts:</p>\n<p>The project supported the purchase of a Micromeritics Autopore IV 9600 mercury intrusion porosimeter for pore structure characterization of materials from 3 nm up to 500 microns.</p>\n<p>We organized two Anton Paar- Northwestern workshops on Materials Surface Characterization in Oct 2020 and Oct 2021. The ultimate goal was to highlight groundbreaking research in the area of nanoscale material characterization. The first workshop in 2020 featured five keynote speakers from Northwestern University and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and drew 37 participants from 26 universities. The second workshop in 2021 featured 8 speakers from Northwestern University, Texas A&amp;M University, Anton Paar, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the University of Texas at Austin, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. There were 38 registrants and 26 attendees.</p>\n<p>We organized two High school science outreach workshops in September 2022 and October 2022. Both workshops were organized jointly with the Chicago Bulls College Prep. Each workshop drew 25-30 students.
