 "awd_abstract_narration": "Animal movement behaviors fundamentally influence the dynamics of populations and the interactions of species. Consequently, understanding animal movement is crucial to understanding ecological processes such as the growth and decline of wildlife populations and the spread of disease. Recent advances in remote sensing, GIS, and other technologies and in methods of analyzing data have greatly increased scientists' biological understanding of animal movement behavior. Similarly, recent advances in mathematical modeling and analysis have greatly increased scientists' theoretical insight about what movement strategies would optimize the fitness of ideal animals in variable landscapes. However, those two directions of research have mostly developed independently. This applied mathematics project will help build a bridge between mathematical and biological aspects of animal movement in dynamic landscapes.  This bridge will strengthen understanding of how different types of animal movement behavior influence the performance and persistence of species and the outcomes of species interactions. The mathematical models will be informed by empirical data from animal tracking studies (especially those involving movement by deer, caribou, and similar animals). \r\n\r\nThis project will draw on a variety of modeling frameworks (e.g., partial differential equations, partial integro-differential equations, integro-difference equations) to build mathematical representations of animal movements in dynamic landscapes. The research will use models and mathematical analysis to explore why many species seem to use similar movement strategies to search for resources and how those search strategies depend on landscape types. These efforts will provide insight into how landscape dynamics such as the spatial and temporal distributions of resources drive individual movement behavior, and how movement then produces the population level distribution patterns characteristic of different species. By focusing on the question of how animals use perceptual information to inform movement behaviors, these studies will provide insights into how population patterns such as home range residency, migration, or nomadism might evolve. The project will feature the development of new kinds of models and of the new mathematics required for their analysis, such as movement models that incorporate cognition (e.g., switching between dispersal modes based on information that might be nonlocal in origin). The analysis of the new models will lead to advances in the theory of partial differential equations and integro-difference equations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe general goal of this project was to develop and use mathematical models to advance scientific understanding of animal movement.  The background motivation was to improve our understanding of dispersing populations, which is relevant in contexts such as conservation or managing biological invasions.  We already have a good understanding of what movement patterns will evolve in situations where the environment varies in space but not in time, and all individuals move according to a single set of rules.   However, real environments often vary in time as well as space, often seasonally. Furthermore, recent advances in satellite tracking of animals and related technologies show that animals may move in different ways depending on whether they are seeking resources or exploiting resources they have found, or on their stage of life.  The specific goals of the project were to extend recent advances on optimal movement in simple models to more realistic existing models, look for new phenomena that could arise in existing models with some more realistic features, and develop new movement models that incorporated additional realistic features.\n\nOne way to define optimal dispersal is to think of movement patterns as strategies and to use ideas motivated by game theory to decide which strategies will win out in the long run.  Suppose that an environment is static in time but varies in space, and a population has a local growth rate that depends on location and population density and is reduced by crowding. We can define the reproductive fitness of individuals at any given location and density by the per capita population growth rate in their immediate vicinity. In that case, many simple models predict that the winning strategies are those that lead to a population distribution where fitness is equalized at all locations when the population is at equilibrium. This corresponds to the population completely exploiting all resources but not overexploiting them. The technical term for this is an \"ideal free\" distribution. To extend known results on optimality for static environments to the seasonal case, we had to develop the idea of fitness of an individual in terms of the path that an individual takes through the course of year, that is, its migration route.  We did that in the contexts of time periodic continuous time models and discrete time models with two seasons. We were then able to define ideal free distributions in seasonal models, and to show that movement that leading to them is optimal in the sense that if a population can achieve an ideal free distribution, then it can resist invasion by other populations which cannot do that.  Extending results on optimality to the more realistic seasonal case required a number of new mathematical ideas and results. \n\nIn some cases, we found that more realistic models had features that are not present in simpler models. In an environment that is static in time but variable in space, in the case that all individuals are considered to be identical, and the only possible type of movement is random diffusion, it is known that slower diffusion gives an advantage over faster diffusion in two species competition.  We found that this is not the case for models where adults and juveniles can move differently, provided the regions most favorable for adults and juveniles are not the same.

Those last results required some technical mathematical innovations that may be of more general interest.\n\nWith William Fagan and members of his lab we constructed models where populations can switch between search and exploitative modes of movement.   We examined the effectiveness of different cues for switching, including the resource density, its variation in space or time, and memory. We were able to detect some patterns related to the spatial and temporal variations in resources.   In collaboration with Elie Gurarie, who was in Dr. Fagan\u2019s lab at the time, we looked studied how the use of memory together with current information can allow a population to initiate and sustain a migration.   We have found that in some models with resources which vary in space and time, some sort of information that is nonlocal in space and time is needed for optimal movement.  Memory, at either the individual or social level, is one possible mechanism for obtaining and preserving such information.\n\nIn addition to the studies that fit into one or more of the areas described previously, we also wrote papers on models for movement of plankton in a water column and models with dispersal on environmental gradients and an Allee effect (where a population has to be sufficiently large to grow). \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/25/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: George C Cosner"
