Preference will be given to supporting graduate students, postdoc, and junior faculty participants. The winter school will feature lectures from leading scientists, and will address current challenges in theoretical and experimental condensed matter physics, discussing new ideas and future research directions, and will enable networking and future collaborations among the participants.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
