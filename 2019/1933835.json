Winston Salem State University will organize the 3rd NOBCChE Collaborative Conference to be held on April 9-10, 2020 at Hampton University. Undergraduate and graduate students from six institutions will attend this two-day conference to present their research and build a network of support by interacting with faculty and industry representative.  \r\n\r\nNOBCChE is the National Organization for the Professional Advancements of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers, a professional organization dedicated to assisting black and other minority students and professionals in fully realizing their potential in academic, professional, and entrepreneurial pursuits in chemistry, chemical engineering, and allied fields. This conference will facilitate the creation of networks of underrepresented students and faculty members; offer technical and professional development opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students; generate potential collaborative research opportunities for faculty; and build long-term trustworthy relationships. This conference will build on and strengthen these relationships through frequent interactions, face-to-face encounters, and a thorough understanding of the uniqueness of each of the institutions - Auburn University, Hampton University, Jackson State University, Ohio State University, University of Pittsburgh, and Winston-Salem State University.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The 2020 conference at Hampton University was to host the 1<sup>st</sup> Annual NOBCChE Collaborative Poster Competition for undergraduate and graduate students. These yearly meetings have fostered relationships formed with the Collaborative through frequent interaction, face-to-face encounters, and through understanding the uniqueness of each institution, its campus, departments, faculty, and students.
