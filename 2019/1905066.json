 "awd_abstract_narration": "Semiconductors are key to many technological applications including energy conversion, telecommunications, and light emitting devices. Unfortunately, many semiconductors contain toxic elements, such as lead or arsenic, while others contain relatively scarce elements or elements that are found only in specific regions on the Earth. With the support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry, Professor Javier Vela at Iowa State University investigates Earth-abundant semiconductors that could have useful properties for the generation of electricity from varied sources, ranging from sunlight to waste heat recycling.  In addition to improving sustainability, this project aims to broaden participation by recruiting and training the next generation of highly qualified and diverse scientists. Internships for students from a Historically Black College and University (HBCU) and a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI), and participation in the Iowa State University's Science Bound and Preparing Future Faculty programs help advance basic research and education while addressing major societal challenges.\r\n\r\nThe scientific objectives of this grant are to develop the colloidal synthesis of NaBiE2 (E=S, Se) semiconductors, unveil the surface chemistry of NaBiE2 nanoparticles, and investigate structure-property relationships of NaBiE2 semiconductors and their devices. Synergy between spectroscopy and computations enables direct observation of the lowest energy superstructures that result from the mixed cation sites in the rock salt lattice. By unlocking a new class of low cost and environmentally friendly ternary semiconductors, this research leads to vertical improvements in the fundamental understanding and practical application of these compounds. This understanding helps advance the chemical knowledge of nanoscopic structures, their surface chemistry, and functionalization. In this way, this research promotes sustainability through transformative approaches to nanomaterials synthesis using Earth-abundant elements.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
