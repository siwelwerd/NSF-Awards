 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal brings together a group of atmospheric chemistry researchers from universities, government laboratories, and private research institutes, to promote discussion of information and ideas on topics of contemporary interest in atmospheric science through the internationally respected Gordon Research Conference. The meeting will be held July 28-August 2, 2019 in Sunday River, Maine and will include scientists and students from both national and international institutions.\r\n\r\nThe theme of this year's conference is \"New Science in Air Quality and Climate from Charney to AR6.\" The broader impacts of the symposium derive from the exchange of ideas that help to focus the research community on the most pressing questions, as well as provide an opportunity for young scientists to meet, network, and exchange ideas with leaders in the atmospheric chemistry and related sciences.  Presentations will address state-of-the-science topics related to the focus themes of the conference, including atmospheric chemistry and climate, air pollution and health, fundamental multiphase kinetics and mechanisms, chemical transport modeling, remote sensing, and cutting-edge instrument development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
