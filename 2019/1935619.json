 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is a Molybdenum Disulfide Oil Water Separator (MDSOS) which, resembling a sponge, is a porous material designed to absorb oil while simultaneously repelling water due to its superhydrophobic properties. Unlike common methods of oil treatment/removal, such as burning and the use of dispersants, the use of the Molybdenum Disulfide sponges mitigates the environmental effects of these common methods.  The implementation of the system can be low-cost and have high durability in varying aquatic conditions. The current laboratory prototype is suitable for small-scale contaminations with markets relevant to those that transport or handle oil in aquatic regions, such as boat owners and marinas. The design of MDSOS permits adjustability in fabrication specific to the oil of desired absorption, allowing compatibility with any type of oil.  MDSOS could potentially be part of remediation efforts for large-scale oil spills.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project further develops a platform of superhydrophobic and superoleophilic molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) sponge technology to improve oil-water separation as well as other industrial applications. The platform has unique combination of material properties and process advantages. This merit comes from the combined attributes of; (1) low materials cost and weight due to their extremely small thickness (ultimately down to a single layer of atoms) and (2) their facile chemical synthesis which does not require cost-demanding equipment/process. Thus, the technology platform can potentially be applied to perform environmental bioremediation, oil spill cleaning, and oily wastewater treatment.  The project primarily enables the customer discovery  to validate potential customer segments and product-market fit.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
