 "awd_abstract_narration": "1927418 (Fortunato) 1927425 (Vespignani). Humans live in an increasingly connected world. And data on networks that capture connections of transportation, trade, health, and communication are increasingly available. These data offer scientists a chance to tackle some of society's greatest problems, such as infectious disease, fake news, natural disasters, cyber-attacks, and health care. However, advances in network science rely on improved mathematical and theoretical approaches to properly model complex systems with multiple, interdependent network layers. To address this, AccelNet-MultiNet aims to link international expertise and provide formal infrastructure for joint US-Europe scientific discovery in the field of multilevel, multilayer networks. This network of networks will result in new methods and models to address societal challenges and the next generation of networks science leaders.\r\n\r\nThe scientific agenda of this AccelNet project focuses on two promising areas in network science: (1) theory and methodology, specifically temporality, embeddings in vector space, information-richness, reaction-diffusion processes; and (2) applications, including characterizing and modeling the societal multiplex, multilayer and multi-omics biological network analysis, resilience management during biological threats. A key feature of AccelNet-MultiNet?s suite of training and collaboration tools will be an intensive Fellows program. These 40 graduate students and postdoctoral researchers will participate in a year-long webinar series open to the larger scientific community, annual large-scale collaborative problem-solving activities (Collabathons), and a semester-long immersive exchange program. In addition, international leader meetings will bring together partners and additional experts to set the agenda for the future of the multilayer, multilevel networks field. These will result in Future Directions Research reports outlining research priorities, strategies, and shared educational vision in the field. An International Communication Competency training toolkit will be developed to help scholars build basic skills for successful cross-cultural, cross-national collaborations. Materials will be made publicly available through a web-based portal, including the training toolkit, community-developed reports, publications, webinar talks, and shared data sets. \r\n\r\nThe Accelerating Research through International Network-to-Network Collaborations (AccelNet) program is designed to accelerate the process of scientific discovery and prepare the next generation of U.S. researchers for multiteam international collaborations.  The AccelNet program supports strategic linkages among U.S. research networks and complementary networks abroad that will leverage research and educational resources to tackle grand scientific challenges that require significant coordinated international efforts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
