 "awd_abstract_narration": "Problems in which elastic structures interact with a surrounding fluid can be found throughout the natural world and in engineering. Such fluid structure interaction (FSI) problems include the flying of birds, the swimming of fish, and blood flow through the heart and blood vessels.  A particularly important class of FSI problems are those at small spatial scales. The biophysics of cell biological processes is a very important example of this. In such FSI problems, the fluid can be treated as a very viscous fluid (Stokes fluid). This project will study FSI problems in a Stokes fluid. The mathematical equations describing FSI problems are generally difficult to study mathematically, but the relative simplicity of the equations of Stokes fluids makes possible a detailed mathematical study of this class of FSI problems. The research program is divided into two parts. In the first, we study the dynamics of membranes in a Stokes fluid. Such models are often used to describe the dynamics of the cell membrane. In the second, we study the dynamics of filaments in Stokes flow. Such models are often used to describe the dynamics of flagella of microorganisms and sperm. A detailed mathematical study of such FSI problems will lead to a better understanding of FSI problems in general and also to the development of efficient computational algorithms in the simulation of such problems. This award will also provide support for the involvement of undergraduate and graduate students in the research.\r\n\r\nFluid structure interaction (FSI) problems in which an elastic structure interacts with the surrounding fluid abound in science and engineering and are studied intensively by computational methods by many authors. Despite their importance, the governing partial differential equations and the numerical methods for such problems are not well-understood from an analytical standpoint. In this research, we focus on a set of canonical FSI problems in which the elastic structures interact with a fluid obeying the Stokes equations. The project consists of two parts. In the first, we will study the problem of co-dimension one elastic interfaces immersed in Stokes flow. Building upon previous work by Mori and collaborators on the well-posedness of the 1D elastic structure/2D Stokes flow problem (Peskin problem), we shall extend the well-posedness theory to more general and related problems including the problem of a 2D elastic surface in 3D Stokes flow. We shall also develop a convergence theory for boundary integral methods for such problems and initiate a study to extend these results to the convergence analysis of fluid-grid based methods. The second part concerns slender body theory, which deals with the dynamics of thin filaments in 3D Stokes flow. We have recently succeeded in providing the first mathematical justification of slender body approximation, which we shall leverage to further our analysis and develop new computational methods for slender body computation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This award funded seven summer research opportunities for undergraduates; they gained exposure to research in computational mathematics, including deciphering journal articles, writing scripts to gather data and to form conjectures, proof writing, creation of figures to tell a story, and communication of results in written and live formats. This required a sustained group effort, so they deliberately reflected on the value of persistence, vulnerability, listening, inclusion, and avoiding the trap of imposter syndrome. At least three of these former students are now pursuing graduate work, in mathematics, physics and computer science, respectively. <br /><br />The main scientific goal of the project was in the study of microscopic fluid flows, an area with increasingly important biological and industrial applications: for example, to inkjet printing and cell division. Many important microfluid flows are influenced by the presence of immersed thin fibers, such as bacterial cilia. These fibers can move, deform, and interact with each other through the fluid medium. In computer simulations, it is convenient to describe these hairlike objects via their one-dimensional centerlines; physically, however, the fibers interact with the fluid through a distribution of forces over the two-dimensional surfaces surrounding their three-dimensional volumes. Modelers and computational scientists face a tradeoff between faithful representations of the true physics of the problem and the convenience and simplicity of a one-dimensional formulation. <br />The scientific goal of this project, more specifically, was to examine a classical, widely used, one-dimensional method known as <em>slender body theory</em> (SBT), to assess its accuracy in the frequently occurring case where two fiber surfaces approach each other, and to possibly offer an improved method. We developed a novel numerical method to solve a three-dimensional, physically accurate version of the problem. Our method accurately reflects the physics of the three-dimensional problem, but it is much slower than SBT. We compared the two methods and found that the SBT approximation performs well on isolated sections of the fiber; the two converge to the same answer as the fiber's radius shrinks, and the error is proportional to the 1.7-th power of the fiber radius. In contrast, in regions of near contact, the two methods converge to different answers as the fiber radius shrinks, suggesting that extreme caution is appropriate when using SBT in this setting. <br /><br />Our novel numerical method was slow primarily because of the computational expense of evaluating many surface integrals. This inspired another sub-project in the area of numerical integration, that is, the problem of finding the area under a curve using a small number of measurements of the curve's height. While this is an ancient problem and there are standard methods that work well in many situations, our fluids problem involved the solution of <em>nearly singular integrals</em>, whose evaluation is still an active research area. In these problems, we are trying to find the area under a curve that appears to have a tall, narrow spike, although upon zooming in we would find that the tip of the spike is smooth. An example is the function <em>y = 1/(h^2 + x^2)</em> where <em>h</em> is small. A function like this will have a singularity, such as a division by zero, at a value of <em>x</em> that lies very close to the real line in the complex plane. Given knowledge of the location of the singularity, we can choose where to sample the height measurements to find the area efficiently. We surveyed the existing methods of this kind and proposed several new ones, which in some cases are better than those previously known according to a suite of tests. While all of these problems concern one-dimensional integrals, we also showed how they can be combined to efficiently evaluate the nearly singular surface integrals that arise in viscous fluid flow on the two-dimensional surface of a thin fiber. <br /><br />We disseminated our findings via journal articles (one of them published under an open accessmodel) and by presentations at conferences. In addition, we created new teaching materials for a unit on Chebyshev polynomial methods for a course on numerical linear algebra, freely available on the PI's Macalester College website. In the future, we hope to build on these results to create a hybridization of classical SBT with our three-dimensional method, combining the speed of the former with the accuracy of the latter.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/26/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: William&nbsp;H&nbsp;Mitchell</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1907796/1907796_10615324_1694444935783_forcefunction--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1907796/1907796_10615324_1694444935783_forcefunction--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"A nearly self-intersecting fiber with imposed forces\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1907796/1907796_10615324_1694444935783_forcefunction--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"A nearly self-intersecting fiber with imposed forces\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A thin fiber that nearly intersects itself provides a test case to compare our computational method to the classical slender body theory approximation.
