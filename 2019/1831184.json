 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from the fact that it builds on the trend to make IT infrastructure consumable as a service and unlocks this potential for network functions. In deploying the Stateless Network Functions as a Service solution, cloud providers, enterprises, and internet service providers are able to launch network functions, such as firewalls and load balancers, on demand, and the Stateless platform automates the management of these functions.  With cloud traffic expected to quadruple over the next several years (according to Cisco), a rapid growth in number of devices (with the Internet of Things emerging), and an ever-increasing complexity and scale of security threats, this project will provide operators with the agility to quickly and easily deploy infrastructure to keep up with these trends and threats.  In doing so, society will experience more reliable networked applications with reduced data breaches.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project provides the research and development needed to realize the vision of a network function operating system.  Whereas the Phase I project established technical feasibility by demonstrating the technology that decouples network functions state from processing can be turned into a product and integrated into a production environment, the Phase II project will approach three new research directions that will support a complete platform.  (i) Network service chaining:  While not a new concept, it is one that has proven to be challenging with virtual appliances.  This project will add support to the Stateless platform to connect network functions into chains, elastically scale chains, and provide quality of service of the whole chain.  (ii) Observability:  This project will introduce the ability to abstract away the details when appropriate or peel away the layers of abstraction as needed, providing operators with a simple solution they have full control over.  (iii) Software development kit:  This project will introduce both the application programming interfaces as well as the isolation mechanisms to allow third parties, whether other vendors or data center operators, to introduce new network functionality based on the Stateless platform.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This enables cloud service providers with opportunities to increase revenue, while decreasing both capital and operational expenses.\nThe intellectual merit outcome of this SBIR project includes advances in the underlying fundamental architecture in three dimensions.  First, it enabled network service function chaining into the system through the development of additional network functions and system support for launching and configuring chains.

This project has introduced capabilities such that these users are now unimpeded by lack of technical background in network management and removes the need for them to hire teams of engineers just to get an infrastructure up and running.  Further, this project provided key underlying capabilities that enabled the launching of two products - the Stateless Software Router and the Cloud Connect Service - which are seeing adoption by both enterprises and service providers.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/03/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Murad Kablan"
