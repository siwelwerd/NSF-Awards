 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this 5-year Faculty Development in the Space Sciences (FDSS) project is to enable a new faculty hire in the space sciences at Arizona State University (ASU).  ASU is an ideal university in which to invest in geospace sciences and space physics due to its large and diverse student population and its emphasis on interdisciplinary research.  Building on ASU's foundation and leadership in providing inclusive education to all qualified students, and capitalizing on the mathematical, statistical, astrophysics, geoscience, and engineering research strengths already present, the new faculty hire will implement an interdisciplinary space physics program.  The new appointee is expected to have expertise in space  plasma and ionospheric dynamics, the physics of the solar wind, and/or the general heliophysics environment and its response to solar events.  The hire will be selected on strong research performance, commitment to teaching and mentoring, and the potential for collaboration, and identified through a broad search.  Theorists, numerical modelers, instrument builders, and observers would all be considered. \r\n\r\nThis 5-year FDSS project will enable the new faculty hire at ASU, in collaboration with the existing faculty there, to drive advances in space physics research and foster a steady output of PhD graduates capable of becoming future leaders.  The new courses and curriculum to be developed by the new faculty will reach ASU's diverse student community, which is reflective of the future U.S. population, helping to improve representation of underserved groups in STEM.  ASU has a strong commitment to serve students from non-traditional backgrounds (returning students, first generation students, and veteran students).  The presence of a strong space physics emphasis at ASU will --- in addition to training a new generation space physics leaders --- enable the institution to further engage the public.  The new faculty hire will incorporate space  physics into existing 3-D theater shows at ASU and add a new exhibit to their free public gallery.  Increasing ASU's capacity to reach K-12 students with engaging content will strengthen the first-generation student pipeline.  At the undergraduate level, through mentoring programs such as Sundial, ASU has significantly increased retention for STEM majors (especially for first-generation students).  The new faculty hire will provide an opportunity to increase underrepresented groups in the faculty.  The research and EPO agenda of this 5-year FDSS project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
