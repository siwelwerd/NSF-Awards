 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project examines the role of pollution monitoring in water and seafood on public perceptions of information and risk following petrochemical spills. This project provide new insights into coastal community risk perceptions following the recent petrochemical spills from the Deer Park fire (Houston, Texas) and barge collision in Galveston Bay, Texas. At present, the ecological and societal impacts of both disturbances are not fully known. However, concern remains for the exposure of aquatic biota to oil-derived hydrocarbons and flame retardant chemicals, and likely human health effects upon their consumption. This project addresses these concerns in the following ways: First, the levels of pollutants are monitored in water, shellfish and fish from Galveston Bay. Pollutant levels are measured once per month, over a 1 year duration. Second, coastal community risk perceptions or concerns for adverse health effects are assessed using health questionnaires. Third, information on pollutant levels in water and biota are compared to acceptable regulatory limits, and used to inform local community leaders of sea food consumption and recreational threats. Ultimately, the findings of this research will provide insights into coastal community risk perceptions immediately following man-made disturbances, and help to develop a risk communication framework that provides both immediate and follow-up analysis of environmental quality. This grant supports the NSF HDBE program's mission to understand human-environment interactions and their responses to man-made disasters.\r\n \r\nThis project uses mass spectrometry to measure the levels of oil-derived hydrocarbons and flame retardants in the waters and biota of Galveston Bay, Texas. Water samples will be taken monthly along a transect of Galveston Bay, and biota samples will be obtained from Texas Parks and Wildlife Department as part of their monthly surveys of Galveston Bay. The biota samples collected will include oysters and fish commonly consumed as seafood by coastal communities. Social well-being will be assessed using an online survey disseminated to residents of communities in the Galveston Bay area, including those affected by the Deer Park fire and barge oil spill. Survey responses will measure social well-being as individual physical and mental health, risk perceptions, and protective action. The results of research will be communicated to coastal community stakeholders by partnering with the Galveston Bay Foundation. Results will comprise temporal trends of pollutant levels measured in water, shellfish and fish from Galveston Bay, and a risk assessment of whether pollutant levels are above or below established regulatory levels.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This event released large quantities of oil-derived hydrocarbons and flame-retardant surfactants (or aqueous film forming foams or AFFFs) into the local environment.&nbsp;The fire at Deer Park is estimated to have released ~2.64 million liters of oil-contaminated water and ~5.7-18.9 million liters of AFFFs into the surface waters of Galveston Bay. The large magnitude of this disturbance impacted the local and national economy due to a partial closure of adjacent waterways of the Houston Ship Channel (HSC), with an estimated economic impact of $0.5 &ndash; $1 billion. At the time, the ecological impact of the fire and AFFFs release was not fully known. In addition, it was not known to what extent local (coastal) communities were impacted by concerns over loss of ecosystem infrastructures (such as fisheries and recreational activities), and/or concerns for negative health impacts due to environmental pollution.

Surface waters from Galveston Bay were sampled along a transect from the entrance to the Houston Ship Channel (Morgan&rsquo;s Point), and then on to the northern Gulf of Mexico (just off Pelican Island). Alongside water sampling, shellfish and fish samples were also opportunistically collected from various randomized sites across Galveston Bay (on April, May, June, October, and November 2019). The species selected for analysis support valuable commercial and recreational fisheries in the bay. Analysis of PFAS body-burdens included the commercially important fish and shellfish species: red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), gafftopsail catfish (Bagre marinus), spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus), and the Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica). PFAS body-burden was quantified in the skin-free muscle (edible portion) and liver of fish, or mantle/gill tissue of oysters. The measured body-burdens of select PFAS in shellfish and fish allowed comparison with regulatory limits and enabled the putative assessment of likely human exposures given the consumption of seafood from the bay. In total, 67 water samples were collected, and 109 oysters, 43 gafftopsail catfish, 78 spotted seatrout, and 62 red drum.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We measured the levels of up to twelve EPA priority PFAS in surface waters and biota from March - November 2019. PFAS levels in surface waters showed mean total levels in March and April 2019 (i.e., immediately following the fire) to be from 4x - ~300x higher than those measured in the subsequent months. PFOS (perfluorooctanesulfonic acid) was the most abundant PFAS congener measured at &gt;66% of total PFAS. Maximal PFOS levels exceeded the State of Texas' water regulatory limit of 0.6 &micro;g/L in 3% of the samples analyzed in March and April 2019. PFOS was also the most prominent congener (&gt;66% of total PFAS) measured in Eastern oysters, red drum, gafftopsail catfish, and spotted seatrout. A statistically significant elevation of PFOS body-burdens was measured in oysters and spotted seatrout in April and May 2019, respectively. A seafood consumption risk assessment involving the calculation of a Hazard Ratio suggested an advisory of 1-2 meals/week for gafftopsail catfish and red drum, and 2 meals/week for spotted seatrout to be protective for human exposure to PFOS.
