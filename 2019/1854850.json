 "awd_abstract_narration": "Science policy requires a firm understanding of the impact of funding on the quantity and quality of research outputs produced by university scientists. This project will examine the impact of recent declines in state support for public universities on scientific research output. Since the Great Recession, several states cut appropriations to higher education, and nineteen states have not restored funding to 2008 levels. Yet few studies have examined the relationship between federal and non-federal research funding, and none have investigated the relationship between state funding for higher education and research output. In addition, researchers have debated whether there are diminishing returns to science funding. Diminishing returns occur when each additional dollar of funding results in fewer publications and citations. The results of this research will allow policymakers to make informed decisions about the allocation of scarce funding resources to higher education at the state and federal levels.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will examine the effect of changes in support for higher education funding to examine the returns to science funding in terms of publications and citations across science and social science disciplines. First, the project will use new data that links publications, citations and grants to individual faculty members at research universities to model the returns to scale of science funding across several disciplines. Variation across these fields will shed light on the returns to scale in science funding. Second, the project will examine whether state funding of higher education is a substitute or complement for federal research funding in the production of research output measured by publications and citations. If state funding is a complement for federal research funding, one would expect that federal research dollars would fall in states that experienced budget cuts. Third, the project will use individual level data on scientists and state budget shocks to higher education funding to examine the impact of faculty mobility on the research productivity of sending and receiving institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nA primary concern for science policy and scholars who study it is understanding the impacts of government funding on the production of new scientific knowledge. This project links data on the number of university faculty, scientific publications, citations to those publications, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers at universities, and the magnitude of federal and non-federal funding from multiple sources to investigate several important dimensions of the relationship between funding and knowledge production. The major goals of the project are to: (1) examine the distribution of these variables across universities and over time, comparing across seven varied disciplines, (2) investigate the impact of shocks to state funding of public universities on the mobility of faculty and their impact on knowledge production, (3) better understand the role of postdoctoral scholars within the scientific research enterprise, and (4) determine whether and how large are economies of scale in the production of scientific knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of the data set created as part of this project is ongoing. To date, it has led to a number of valuable insights. Extending our previous work on academic chemistry, we have shown that publications have continued to increase relative to inputs since 2009 and that this trend of \"rising productivity\" is present across a range of disciplines that includes Biomedicine, Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, Computer Science, Economics, Electrical Engineering, and Psychology. We have also documented a strong positive association between funding levels and publication rates. While we cannot be certain that greater funding causes more publications, at a minimum it suggests that funding is being allocated to more productive researchers. Studying postdoctoral researchers, we have documented that there is a strong association between postdocs and the publication output independent of other inputs to the scientific process, confirming their importance as a component of the scientific workforce. Looking at team size we have documented an unintended consequence of team-size, showing that students who complete their degrees while employed on projects pursued by larger teams have worse career outcomes. Finally, we are among the first scholars to look in detail at the factors influencing the mobility of faculty within academia and between academic and non-academic appointments. While this work remains preliminary, our data reveal that academic mobility is overall quite low, and varies considerably over timerising in the first few years of appointment and then declining. We have also documented a tendency for positive selection into mobility  with more productive scholars more likely to move than less productive ones.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/01/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JoshuaLRosenbloom\n"
