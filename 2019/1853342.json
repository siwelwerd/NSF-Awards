 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will use mathematical and computational analysis to understand patterns of activity in hormone-secreting endocrine and cardiac cells. Numerous cells in the body are electrically active. They produce electrical impulses, and these impulses through which nerve cells code and transmit information, endocrine cells secrete hormones, and muscle cells initiate contraction. Understanding the electrical activity of these cells is fundamental to understanding their behavior. This is, no easy task, since the electrical activity is mediated by ion flow through several types of ion channels in the cell membrane interacting in nonlinear ways through the membrane potential. Adding to this complexity, there are numerous intracellular signaling molecules acting on some of these channels and modifying their behavior. This project focuses on oscillations in the membrane potential of insulin-secreting cells of the pancreas, stress-hormone-secreting pituitary cells, and cells of the cardiac ventricles. These oscillations can be beneficial or pathological, depending on the cell type. One objective of this project is to understand why the oscillations happen and, in the case that they are pathological, to determine how they can be terminated. Another objective is to train undergraduate and graduate students in the theory and application of sophisticated mathematical techniques that are directly applicable to biological systems. This training is facilitated through the interaction with several experimental labs.\r\n\r\nThe variables that describe an electrically excitable cell often vary on significantly different times scales. Some variables adapt quickly to changes in the cell's membrane potential, while others adapt more slowly. In such cases, oscillations in the membrane potential can occur at the level of the subsystem of fast variables, or at the level of the slow subsystem, or at some intermediate level that involves variables from both subsystems. To understand the basis of the oscillations, system variables should be partitioned in an appropriate way, facilitating the use of geometric singular perturbation analysis, or fast/slow analysis. This project employs fast/slow analysis in the examination of bursting oscillations in pituitary corticotrophs and pancreatic beta-cells, and pathological early after depolarizations (EADs) in ventricular myocytes.  The former drive the secretion of hormones, while the latter can lead to, at the tissue level, ventricular tachycardia. The fast/slow analysis of the different models will uncover the mechanisms through which modulators of cell behavior, such as corticosteroids or glucose or hypokalemia, act to move the cell among distinct behaviors, some rhythmic and some not. It will also be used to understand the effects of different stimulus frequencies on EAD production in ventricular myocytes, which normally receive periodic stimulation from the sinoatrial node in situ. This project is supported by both Division of Mathematical Sciences/Mathematical Biology and Molecular and Cellular Biology/Cellular Dynamics and Function programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

All three are characterized by electrical excitability, in which the cell's function is driven by electrical impulses, also called action potentials. In this report, the project's impact on all three systems is described.</p>\n<p>The electrically excitable cell types that make up the heart, called cardiomyocytes, produce long electrical impulses (Fig. 1A) that are responsible for the contraction of heart tissue that pumps blood through the heart. In some cases, these cells can have even longer impulses due to small oscillations that occur at the action potential plateau (Fig. 1B). The extended impulses can cause discoordination of the muscle contractions, and inefficient pumping of blood. These so-called <em>early afterdepolarizations</em>&nbsp;(EADs) can cause sudden death, and are therefore of great clinical importance.&nbsp; In this project, we used existing mathematical models of cardiomyocyte electrical activity to demonstrate that the EADs are due to a mathematical structure called <em>canards</em>, and that the behaviors shown in experimental studies of EADs can all be explained in terms of the canards. The canards are due to twists in the slow manifold that the trajectory follows during the plateau of the action potential (Fig. 2). We also demonstrated that EADs generated through the release of calcium from intracellular stores can also be explained in terms of canards. Thus, whether a purely electrical phenomenon or one involving calcium release, the dynamic mechanism is the same. This finding brings together and unifies experimental results that had been thought previously to be contradictory, but that actually point to a common dynamic mechanism brought about through different biological processes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The endocrine pituitary cells secrete hormones that regulate reproduction, milk production, growth of tissue, and the response to stress, among other important functions. These electrically active cells can produce bursts of activity that evoke hormone secretion, and in fact when the cells are in their activated state this is what occurs (Fig. 3). We studied the electrical activity of one type of pituitary cell, the corticotroph, which secretes adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) when activated by hypothalamic factors. The ACTH is an important part of the stress response. Using mathematical modeling, combined with experimental data from a collaborating lab, we provided an explanation for why corticotrophs from chronically stressed animals are so much more active than those of unstressed animals. We also used fast/slow analysis to demonstrate the dynamic mechanism for this unusual burst mechanism (Fig. 4). This mechanism relies on the stochastic opening of the BK type of ion channel. Without this, the model cell produces impulses, but not bursts of impulses.</p>\n<p>The beta-cells of pancreatic islets of Langerhans are the insulin secreting cells of the body. Death or disfuction of these cells is a major factor in diabetes. One very interesting result from this project involves the manner in which the beta cells respond to increases in glucose from one stimulatory level to another. At a stimulatory glucose level, the beta-cells produce bursting activity. At a higher level, the fraction of the time that the cell is in an active phase of spiking versus a silent phase (called the <em>plateau fraction</em>)&nbsp; is increased. This is illustrated using two different mathematical models in Fig. 5A,B. When the plateau fraction is higher, more insulin is secreted. In this way, the cell responds to changes in the blood glucose level with an appropriate change in insulin secretion. For decades now the identity of the ion channel responsible for packaging spikes into bursts has been explored theoretically and experimentally. We resolved this decades-long question with a study that applied fast/slow analysis to demonstrate that if the K(ATP) ion channel drives the bursting, then the nucleotide ratio ATP/ADP should oscillate in such a way that the peak and nadir is the same regardless of the glucose level (Fig. 5C,D). We call this <em>nucleotide invariance</em>. Here, ADP is adenosine diphosphate and ATP is adenosine triphosphate, the latter being the product of glucose metabolism within the beta-cell. By collaborating with an experimental lab, we demonstrated that nucleotide invariance indeed occurs in beta-cells exposed to different stimulatory glucose levels. We therefore demonstrated, in a non-invasive way, that negative feedback through electrical current provided by K(ATP) ion channels drives slow bursting oscillations in beta-cells. At the same time, our study overturned decades-long dogma that the ATP/ADP level should always increase with an increase in the glucose level. Instead, we found that it is constant over all glucose levels at which the cells are bursting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These three subprojects were intradisciplinary in nature, and all included graduate student researchers. Two of those students have graduated and are now working as scientists in the private sector, and one is continuing her doctoral research.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/31/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Richard&nbsp;Bertram</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1853342/1853342_10603435_1693507552536_twisted_manifold--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1853342/1853342_10603435_1693507552536_twisted_manifold--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"CANARDS\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1853342/1853342_10603435_1693507552536_twisted_manifold--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"CANARDS\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Canards are due to a twisted slow manifold.
