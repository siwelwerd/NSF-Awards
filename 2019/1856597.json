 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Elizabeth Stone, of Stony Brook University, along with colleagues from the University of Chicago, Stony Brook University, Oxford University and the University of Munich will undertake archaeological research to study the degree of continuity in domestic life at the site of Ur, located in southern Iraq, as the city was transformed from the imperial capital in the late third millennium to one of many small city states in the early second millennium B.C.E.  Interpretations of Mesopotamian society, heavily influenced by the written record, have often interpreted the earlier level where the archaeological record is dominated by public buildings, as a very top down society, with some suggesting that much of the population were comparable to chattle slaves.  However, the subsequent period is best known for its domestic areas which have yielded private letters and contracts and testify to considerable agency on the part of the larger population.  This project aims to recover comparable data from domestic areas dating to both both periods to determine whether or not the differences in the current written record reflect real changes in society or the effect of differences in site formation. The research will provide basic insight into factors which underlie the rise and often subsequent decline of complex societies.\r\n\r\nThese funds will be used to support the third and last season of work at the site. The uppermost architectural in Area 3 was owned by a general and indicates considerable construction investment.  However the architecture in the overlying level incorporates few courses of baked brick and exhibits some of the narrowest walls and room widths known from the earlier excavations at Ur. The goal is to obtain a sequence of architectural, artifactual, faunal and floral data that can be compared with the contemporary data which can be compared between time periods.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOutcomes from 2019 Field Season at Ur\n\n Recovery of ceramics, objects, plant and animal remains from domestic levels dating to the early Isin-Larsa period and Ur III times.  The ceramics provided the chronological control, the plant and animal remains are currently under analysis.  Kathryn Twiss (Stony Brook University) is analyzing the faunal remains and Michael Charles (Oxford University) is analyzing the floral remains.  \nCuneiform documents indicate that the owner of the large house excavated in Area 3 was owned by General Abusim.  We do not know the name of the owner of the much less elaborate house excavated in Area 4, but in spite of the lack of investment in architecture and limited objects from that area, a group of school tablets show that the owner paid for his son(s) to be educated.\nSynergistic activities:  Emily Harris from the University of Pennsylvania joined our project and conducted a survey of Ur.  Adelheid Otto from Munich University conducted her own excavations on the south mound in the house of Sin-nada, administrator of the Ningal Temple.  Like Abusim, he was an important citizen, but lived a century earlier.\nOnce the analyses of the plant and animal remains are complete, we will be able to assess differences in wealth and diet over both space and time for all three excavation areas.\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/24/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Elizabeth C Stone"
