 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from bringing AI-driven decision making to the fingertips of anyone who can use Excel. In particular, through Excel Macros, this product enables the following capabilities: Predictive Analytics, What-If Scenario Analysis, and Optimized Decision Recommendations. This enables teams of all sizes and capabilities to utilize data-driven decision making without the need for expensive infrastructure or highly skilled data scientists.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to bring together Graphical Model driven prediction and optimization to solve generic reinforcement learning. This will be an important innovation since a decision-making framework that uses Graphical Models as the substrate to solve generic reinforcement learning / AI problems at scale is non-existent and very challenging. To this end, the innovation is twofold: in efficiently representing Excel data as Graphical Models, and in the data substrate to compute over Graphical Models in a scalable and seamless manner, on a single machine (e.g. a laptop), as well as multiple machines.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In particular, based on the team\u2019s 100+ customer discovery interviews, the manual and time-consuming nature of the negotiation planning process results in purchasing managers failing to realize significant cost savings during vendor negotiations due to a lack of data-driven insights for informed negotiation decisions.\n\n\nTechnical Feasibility\nDuring Phase I, we primarily tested the feasibility and accuracy of our graphical model approach for prediction.
