 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current theories of language use assume that by sharing ideas in conversation, people develop shared knowledge. This assumption, however, is largely untested and there is good reason to think that it is wrong. The investigator's preliminary studies asked a basic question with fundamental implications:  Do speakers and listeners each walk away from a conversation with the same idea about what was said? The answer is no. Speakers are much more likely to remember what was said than the person who was listening. The proposed work takes as a starting point these asymmetries in memory for conversations in order to generate novel predictions regarding the interplay between memory and language use in conversation. Anticipated findings will provide insight into when conversational partners are likely to have similar memories for what was said, and when their memories are likely to differ. The resulting discoveries could change basic recommendations for how to engage in a successful conversation, both in high stakes settings (business negotiations, dispute mediation, first dates), but also in day-to-day life. The findings may also guide expectations about what humans are likely to remember based on conversations with devices such as \"Alexa,\" in turn providing insights for device design and human-technology interactions. Potential implications for pedagogy include recommendations for improving communication in teacher-student interactions and in group projects. \r\n\r\nThis proposal develops and tests the predictions of a theoretical view of shared conversational knowledge that offers a radical departure from current views and makes competing predictions. A series of 10 experiments tests the hypothesis that following conversation, partners will retain predictably different memories of the conversation. As a result, despite their shared experience of conversing, partners will have a different perspective on what was said, influencing future decisions and interactions in predictable ways. The work will also provide insights into mechanisms of language processing in ecologically valid settings. Broader impacts include  opportunities for graduate students, undergraduate students, and high school students to conduct independent research projects. Special efforts are made to recruit students from under-represented groups. All de-identified data generated by this research will be made publicly available on the internet. In sum, the work has the potential to advance understanding of psychological and linguistic processes, advance computer dialog systems, and offer insights into pedagogical research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This work draws on insights from the fields of cognitive psychology and psycholinguistics, to understand how aspects of language use that might create confusions in the middle of a conversation linger to shape what you remember later on. It has been known for many years that our ability to accurately recall the details of conversation is limited, but little is known about why conversational recall is so limited.

This question was addressed through a series of empirical and theoretical projects. I developed the theoretical proposal that having a successful conversation requires representing both what you know that is relevant to the topic at hand, separately from what you estimate that your conversational partner might know that is relevant to the topic at hand (Heller &amp; Brown-Schmidt, 2023). This is what allows us to, for example, make guesses about who in the office might know the best place to get a sandwich on a Friday afternoon. It is these&nbsp;<em>estimates&nbsp;</em>about what other people know (but that you do not) that allows you to find that person who is likely to know where to get a sandwich and ask them. Asking and answering questions also turns out to impact what you are likely to remember later on. We made the novel discovery that people tend to remember best the&nbsp;<em>answers&nbsp;</em>to the questions they ask, and remember least well the questions they are&nbsp;<em>asked&nbsp;</em>(Evans &amp; Brown-Schmidt, 2023). In the sandwich example, this means that you would be most likely to remember the recommendation you got for a sandwich shop, and least likely to remember what your conversational partner asked you next.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(2)&nbsp;This research used detailed analyses of conversation in a series of experiments to understand the factors that shape conversation memory. We affirmed prior findings that memory for conversation was limited but generally accurate, further, we found that taking notes immediately after a conversation supports your ability to accurately recall the details later on (Brown-Schmidt, et al., 2023). We found that when speakers are disfluent, for example pausing and saying 'um', this makes conversation&nbsp;<em>more&nbsp;</em>memorable (Diachek &amp; Brown-Schmidt, 2023). These findings and several other published papers show that we&nbsp;<em>can&nbsp;</em>predict what aspects of conversation will be remembered. Further, this work makes a concrete suggestion: If being able to accurately recall the details of a conversation is important, writing down what was said immediately afterwards is likely to create the most accurate documentation of what was said, and to boost your ability to independently recall what was said days later.</p>\n<p>(3) All de-identified data collected on this award was shared on the Open Science Framework, which is a public repository for scientific data.
