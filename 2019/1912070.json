 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The project at the University of the District of Columbia (UDC) will establish the Logistics and International Trade (LIT) Analytics Center, foster research, and conduct outreach to the broader DC community. This is a collaborative project between the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and the School of Business and Public Administration. Undergraduate students are involved in the project as researchers. \r\n\r\nThe project will enhance logistics, supply chain and global trade related knowledge, and analytical skills of UDC engineering and business students to respond to emerging supply chain management, international trade analytics, and global business issues. Specific objectives of the project are to:(1) develop an innovative STEM-Business focused LIT minor degree program; (2) enrich the undergraduate student and faculty research experiences within the LIT curriculum through creation of an interdisciplinary summer research program; and (3) increase the enrollment and retention rate of UDC students across business and STEM programs by engaging students in the LIT program through outreach to local high schools and the UDC community college, as well by offering an optional China study abroad program. This suite of activities will empower and transform students as leaders in the 21st Century workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
