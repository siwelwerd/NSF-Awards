 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine warming of the continental shelf of the northeast US and determine the relationship to warm core rings from the Gulf Stream. Historical observations from several sources including the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) Pioneer Array will be analyzed to determine the connection between shelf warming and warm core rings. A field campaign will include observations from autonomous underwater vehicles equipped with sensors to observe the dynamic processes that govern the warm and saline intrusions of water. The results will yield insights into how and why warming events occur on the continental shelf. The trend in warming on the New England shelf has implications for regional climate and local commercial fisheries. The project includes collaboration with the Commercial Fisheries Association and communication of research results to local fishing communities. \r\n\r\nThis project will use field observations and analyses of historical data to examine process known to drive exchange between the shelf and warm core rings on the Northeast U.S. continental shelf and the relationship to recent warming on the shelf and slope region. The study will focus on the pycnocline salinity maximum and Gulf Stream warm core rings. The field work, which will take place during two cruises (in 2020 and 2021) will employ autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) equipped with sensors to profile velocity, temperature, salinity, microstructure, turbidity, chlorophyll, fluorescence, and colored dissolved organic matter. The observations will be used to produce three-dimensional maps of one or more saline intrusions and to distinguish between the relative importance of double diffusive and turbulent dynamics in the pycnocline salinity maximum.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Adrienne also participated in research cruises onboard &nbsp;R/V Neil Armstrong and R/V Endeavor, collaborating with WHOI on the Salinity intrusion study. Adrienne gave multiple lectures in local schools, undergraduate and graduate student meetings and at Ocean Sciences, 2020. She has published 4 first-authored papers, 4 co-authored papers and multiple datasets during her PhD and working on 3+ follow-up manuscripts. She is currently employed at WHOI as a postdoctoral scientist.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project investigated the recent changes in the shelf-slope sea of the Northwest Atlantic. Using over four decades of Gulf Stream warm core ring census data, we created a GIS-based census of over 1000 warm core rings, which we systematically analyzed. We summarize some of those results below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>First, our extensive analysis of Gulf Stream meandering and ring evolution over four decades, conducted at a synoptic level every 2-3 days per week, revealed a &lsquo;regime-shift&rsquo; in the annual warm core ring formation around the turn of the century. The rate of annual warm core ring formation nearly doubled, increasing from 18 per year to 33 per year (Gangopadhyay et al. 2020). Second, &nbsp;we observed several asymmetries in the formation of warm and cold core eddies on seasonal and interannual timescales. These include: (i) while warm core rings exhibited a regime-shift, cold core ring formation did not; (ii) Before 2000, there were more cold core rings formed, but this pattern reversed after 2000 (Figure 2, Silver et al. 2021; image 1). We also identified a seasonal asymmetry in ring formation, with more cold rings forming during winter-spring, while more warm rings forming during summer and fall (Figure 3, Silver et al. 2021; Image 4).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In our third investigation, we explored the geographical asymmetry of ring formation, specifically focusing on the east and west of the New England Seamount Chains (NESC). We employed survival analysis techniques, revealing intriguing insights. Notably, rings formed in zone 2 (70-65W) exhibited the highest survival probability, and those originating east of the seamounts, even when crossing them, tended to have longer lifespans exceeding 150 days (Figure 3, Silva et al. 2020; Image 6). This work has been followed up by Nicholas Porter, a master&rsquo;s student, partially funded in this grant, who characterized the 129 rings that crossed/interacted with the seamounts between 1980 and 2019.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Moving forward, we delved into the path, size and structure of the 1000+ rings aiming to understand and document their spatial variations. Our analysis led to two significant discoveries (Silver et al., 2022). Firstly, we observed that warm core rings tend to follow a specific corridor, known as the &lsquo;Ring Corridor&rsquo; situated between 65 and 70W (Figure 2, Silver et al. 2022; Image 2). Secondly, a notable asymmetry emerged in the vertical structure of the rings to the east and west of the NESC. The smaller and shallower rings to the west of the NESC result from a lesser-known process referred to as &lsquo;aneurysm&rsquo;, while the rings to the east of the NESC are formed through the well-established &lsquo;pinch-off&rsquo; process (Figure 9, Silver et al., 2022; Image 3). This discovery and associated paper received recognition from the Editor of JGR-Ocean. Please see <a href=\"https://eos.org/editor-highlights/two-kinds-of-warm-core-rings-emanate-from-the-gulf-stream\">https://eos.org/editor-highlights/two-kinds-of-warm-core-rings-emanate-from-the-gulf-stream</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In our final investigation, we established a link between the proximity of warm core rings and the Salinity maximum intrusion process across the shelfbreak. The Salinity intrusions in the shelf were significantly correlated with the warm core rings situated near the shelfbreak on the slope side, spanning seasonal time-scale both before and after the ring formation regime-shift in 2000. (See Figure 5, Silver et al., 2023, Image 4).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One other student, Grace Jensen has been partially supported on this grant. Grace has just completed creating a census for cold core rings using GIS, mirroring the methodology used by Dr. Adrienne Silver for the warm core rings.

Using over four decades of Gulf Stream warm core ring census data, we created a GIS-based census of over 1000 warm core rings, which we systematically analyzed. We summarize some of those results below.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, our extensive analysis of Gulf Stream meandering and ring evolution over four decades, conducted at a synoptic level every 2-3 days per week, revealed a regime-shift in the annual warm core ring formation around the turn of the century. The rate of annual warm core ring formation nearly doubled, increasing from 18 per year to 33 per year (Gangopadhyay et al. 2020). Second, we observed several asymmetries in the formation of warm and cold core eddies on seasonal and interannual timescales. These include: (i) while warm core rings exhibited a regime-shift, cold core ring formation did not; (ii) Before 2000, there were more cold core rings formed, but this pattern reversed after 2000 (Figure 2, Silver et al. 2021; image 1). We also identified a seasonal asymmetry in ring formation, with more cold rings forming during winter-spring, while more warm rings forming during summer and fall (Figure 3, Silver et al. 2021; Image 4).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn our third investigation, we explored the geographical asymmetry of ring formation, specifically focusing on the east and west of the New England Seamount Chains (NESC). We employed survival analysis techniques, revealing intriguing insights. Notably, rings formed in zone 2 (70-65W) exhibited the highest survival probability, and those originating east of the seamounts, even when crossing them, tended to have longer lifespans exceeding 150 days (Figure 3, Silva et al. 2020; Image 6). This work has been followed up by Nicholas Porter, a masters student, partially funded in this grant, who characterized the 129 rings that crossed/interacted with the seamounts between 1980 and 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nMoving forward, we delved into the path, size and structure of the 1000+ rings aiming to understand and document their spatial variations. Our analysis led to two significant discoveries (Silver et al., 2022). Firstly, we observed that warm core rings tend to follow a specific corridor, known as the Ring Corridor situated between 65 and 70W (Figure 2, Silver et al. 2022; Image 2). Secondly, a notable asymmetry emerged in the vertical structure of the rings to the east and west of the NESC. The smaller and shallower rings to the west of the NESC result from a lesser-known process referred to as aneurysm, while the rings to the east of the NESC are formed through the well-established pinch-off process (Figure 9, Silver et al., 2022; Image 3). This discovery and associated paper received recognition from the Editor of JGR-Ocean.
