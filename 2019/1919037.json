 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Research Partnerships (PFI-RP) project is in making technologies available to improve manufacturing of powder-based products in a variety of industries, including pharmaceutical. These industries are increasingly dealing with fine powders, desirable because they improve product performance. Unfortunately, fine powder-based products pose significant difficulties in manufacturing and cause product failures due to their intrinsic poor processability and tendency to form large lumps. The innovation comes through scientific understanding of why fine powders behave poorly, and determining how their surfaces could be modified via novel mechanical processes to drastically and predictively improve their behavior.  Significant commercial impact is expected from shorter drug product development times and reduced pharmaceutical product failures, as well as from increased profits in manufacturing tablet-based drug products. Societal impact comes from making available higher quality medicines to patients at lower costs. It will have a positive impact on the professional development of students participating in the project, through training in cutting-edge research, innovation and entrepreneurship. In addition, the proposed science teacher training will impact K-12 participants from school districts with large underrepresented minority populations. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project will fundamentally advance understanding of how fine powders behave and why they lead to significant manufacturing challenges. The Intellectual merit of the project stems from physics-based models explaining why fine smooth particles, as well as rough particles (less than third the diameter of human hair), flow and pack poorly. However, when they are nano-rough, i.e., having surface asperities 500 times smaller than the diameter of human hair, they flow and pack significantly better. The understanding and development of mechanical processes to economically create nano-rough surfaces offer commercialization opportunities for the pharmaceutical industry. These include benefits from novel fine engineered drug powders flowing as well as those 5-10 times their size, and development of fine excipients that outperform their larger commercial counterparts in flow, packing, and tablet forming capability. The proposed novel advanced models should also help design the powders and their blends that form the building blocks of pharmaceutical products, such as tablets and capsules. If successful, these models will eliminate excessive time and material-consuming experimentation that increases manufacturing costs. Associated simulations will enable computer-assisted design of tablets, leading to better and cheaper drug products.  Additional intellectual merit of the project is through the participation of students with industry partners and mentors while engaging in research targeted for commercialization.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These industries must deal with fine powders, which are desirable because they improve powder-based product performance. Unfortunately, they pose significant difficulties in manufacturing and cause product failures due to their intrinsic poor processability and tendency to form large lumps. Consequently, these fine powders require granulation, which is a process to enlarge them via wet or dry processing. However, doing so adds three to five extra processing steps, leading to extra time in product development, and higher costs.&nbsp; Granulation also requires the use of filler materials, called excipients, resulting in larger tablets, which are not preferred by the patients. Our approach involves enhancing flowability of fine drug, as well as excipient powders, through solventless mechanical surface modification, also called dry coating. The intellectual property and innovative outcomes of this project stem from development of enhanced scientific understanding of why fine powder smaller than third the diameter of human hair behave poorly, how their surfaces could be modified via novel mechanical processes, and how they drastically and predictively improve not just the surface modified constituent properties but also their blends, formulations and products.</p>\n<p>Project leveraged discussions with the industry partners as well as over 100 interviews conducted during the iCorps Teams session to refine our research strategy. That enabled expanding the original scope, targeting greatly improved pharmaceutical excipients, to include developing models and technologies for developing better formulations, and broader IP generation. First major outcome employed physics-based, experimentally validated models to explain why fine pharmaceutical powders flow and pack poorly and how mechanically, yet economically, changing their surfaces to be \"nano-rough\" could significantly improve powders flow and packing of these powders (Figure: Enhanced Flowability). Second major outcome of this work was the development of novel fine engineered excipient powders that flow like those 5-10 times their size, yet outperforming their larger commercial counterparts in flow, packing, and tablet forming capability; leading to securing of one core IP (US1,0751,288) while forming a basis of two additional ones filed using an NSF Allowable Patent Expenses (APEX) supplement. &nbsp;Third major outcome was to demonstrate that the practitioners need not be concerned about using hydrophobic silica for dry coating, due to the worry of making their hydrophobic drugs more hydrophobic, hence even less soluble and bioavailable. This novel work showed that even hydrophobic silica coating can enhance drug dissolution rate (Figure:&nbsp;Enhanced Drug Dissolution). Fourth major outcome was concerning reduced fine powder lumping, i.e., agglomeration, due to dry coating. We discovered that measuring natural state of lumping of the powders can be a primary indicator of their flowability; lower the extent of lumping, better the flowability (Figure: Agglomeration and Flowability). That provides industry practitioners with a material sparing test at initial development stage. This work is covered in several papers and formed a basis of recently granted patent (US12,076,440). Fifth major outcome is discovery of synergistic property enhancement via transfer of silica form a minority dry component of the formulation during blending. That led to more uniform distribution of components leading to better drug content uniformity as well as greatly enhanced flowability. All this was achieved even at a much reduced use of silica, as low as 0.012 wt% making this outcome highly significant and commercially relevant (FIgure: Improved Content Uniformity and Flowability). &nbsp;Sixth major outcome involved development of a mixture model for predicting tabletability of a mixture from those of individual components.&nbsp; This image (Figure: Mixture Model) shows one successful example, where the experimental tabletability (open squares) of a ternary mixture matches well with the predicted tabletability (red line), based on tabletability profiles of the three constituting powders (green dashed lines). An equation was developed that can be used to quantitatively describe tabletability of powders.&nbsp; Based on this equation, a model was developed that can be used to predict tabletability of mixtures from those of individual powders.</p>\n<p>Another major outcome was filing of two non-provisional patent applications by making judicious use of the NSF-APEX supplemental funding. One of those has been granted (US12,076,440) and the second one is pending. Project has broader outcomes and impacts by forming a basis for establishing an NSF funded and industry supported IUCRC, called the Center for Integrated Material Science and Engineering of Pharmaceutical Products (CIMSEPP) having dozen+ fee-paying members (Figure: NSF-IUCRC). That has created additional opportunities for adoption of our IP and outcomes. Last, the project trained over a dozen undergraduate and six doctoral students; five of those have already graduated and are employed in pharmaceutical industry.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/11/2024<br>\nModified by: Rajesh&nbsp;N&nbsp;Dave</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1919037/1919037_10626683_1731011360451_Outcomes_2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1919037/1919037_10626683_1731011360451_Outcomes_2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Enhanced Drug Dissolution\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1919037/1919037_10626683_1731011360451_Outcomes_2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Enhanced Drug Dissolution\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Even hydrophobic silica can enhance drug dissolution due to reduced drug powder agglomeration</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sangah Kim</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Rajesh&nbsp;N&nbsp;Dave\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Enhanced Drug Dissolution</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1919037/1919037_10626683_1731010906499_Outcomes_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1919037/1919037_10626683_1731010906499_Outcomes_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Enhanced Flow\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1919037/1919037_10626683_1731010906499_Outcomes_1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Enhanced Flow\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Enhanced flow after dry coating.
