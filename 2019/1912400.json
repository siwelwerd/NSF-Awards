 "awd_abstract_narration": "Implementation Projects in the Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate program provide support to design, implement, study and assess comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the numbers of students and the quality of their preparation by strengthening science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and research. This implementation project at Dillard University provides a multilayered approach to broaden opportunities for African-American students to succeed in STEM majors. The focus of the project is on retaining and graduating students in STEM fields and preparing them for graduate school or the workforce. The project is guided and informed by an on-going evaluation, as well as by internal and external advisory committees.\r\n\r\nThe project has the goals to: increase the number of students applying to Dillard with STEM as their intended majors, and increase the number of students retained year-to-year through deliberate on-ramping and monitoring of students' course progression; improve preparation of STEM majors through curriculum redesign and technology-infused coursework; and strengthen Dillard's research and workforce development efforts  and further develop research experiences for undergraduate STEM students. To achieve these goals, the project will utilize innovative strategies to recruit high school students with STEM interests; provide a bridge program to on-ramp incoming freshman students with STEM major aspirations; redesign gateway courses and enhance existing student supports to retain STEM majors; and provide research and workforce development opportunities for both STEM faculty and students. These holistic approaches will demonstrate a reliable performance model for small colleges and universities that are concerned about recruiting, retaining, and preparing undergraduate STEM majors for the next step.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
