This multi-institutional partnership between Georgia Tech and the institutions in the Atlanta University Center (Morehouse College, Clark Atlanta University, Spelman College) fosters the nation's interests in creating a highly-trained, diverse workforce in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). The primary objectives of this Site are to: (1) provide high quality research experiences, in combination with a series of professional development activities, for cohorts of visiting undergraduate researchers, (2) motivate and prepare talented undergraduates to pursue, and succeed in, graduate studies, (3) assemble a cadre of participants that reflects the diversity of the U.S. population, (4) attract students from institutions that have limited research activities, (5) continue engagement of the participants beyond the summer program when they return to their home institutions, and (6) nurture collaborations in research and instruction between the four institutions in the consortium. Other components of the site include team-building activities, regular group meetings, a research seminar series, a workshop series (e.g., focused on ethics, presentation skills, and graduate opportunities), undergraduate research symposia, and field trips to industrial and government laboratories.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS:  Undergraduate participants in the Georgia Tech - Atlanta University Center Research Experiences for Undergraduate (REU) site are paired with a faculty mentor and research group aligned with her/his physics interests. Summer research projects are selected from an array of possibilities ranging from atomic physics to condensed matter physics; from physics of living systems to astrophysics and computational physics. The Site aims to enhance interactions between Georgia Tech and the institutions in the Atlanta University Center and thereby increases the capacity for research at those predominantly undergraduate, minority-serving institutions. The Site is carefully structured to interweave high-quality research experiences, mentoring, and community building between the REU participants in order to provide students with a rich, supportive growth experience. Students who complete this summer experience are well-equipped with invaluable skillsets (hard and soft), an enhanced perspective, and a permanent set of mentors to aid in pursuit of their STEM careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Success of that goal was achieved in part by nurturing and supporting a partnership with the Atlanta University Center Consortium (AUCC), specifically Clark Atlanta University, Morehouse College, and Spelman College. The grant period included two no-cost extensions to compensate for reduced activity during the COVID years of 2020 and 2021.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p>\r\n<p>Thirty-six participants attended in the Georgia Tech Physics REU program: 2019 (12); 2020 (3); 2021 (10); and 2022 (11).&nbsp; The program was fully virtual in 2020 and primarily virtual in 2021 due to COVID. To ensure full engagement, selected participants were carefully matched with research groups working in their area of interest, with an effort made to provide them with their first or second choice listed on their applications. Participants received a $5000 stipend, free housing in Georgia Tech dormitories, and $500 to cover travel expenses.</p>\r\n<p>Each incoming REU cohort participated in ten weeks of intense immersive research led by a faculty advisor and in most cases, a trained graduate or postdoctoral mentor. The start of the each Summer focused on on-boarding, building community, and establishing research momentum.&nbsp; These goals are achieved in part by an overnight retreat with students from other REU programs in the College of Sciences at Georgia Tech, where in addition to team building activities, participants presented one-minute overviews of their planned research. Throughout the summer, REU participants attended a weekly Frontiers in Physics bag lunch seminar series and professional development workshops, which included training in research ethics, scientific writing, and delivering scientific presentations. In-person REU cohorts visited Oakridge National Laboratory where they toured the facilities, learned about ongoing research, and were introduced to the numerous professional opportunities available at National Laboratories.&nbsp; Starting in 2021, students attended a weekly Monday Mentoring Meet-Up with PI Curtis. Each student described their ongoing research efforts and plans for the following week. These meet-ups served as venues for students to learn about physics research beyond their projects, to practice communicating science, and to build supportive relationships with their peers.&nbsp; To help deal with COVID isolation and remote work, in 2021 integrated online working sessions with a former REU student and continuing AUCC research student called &ldquo;Mellow Hours with Tre&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>To synthesize the summer research experience, students worked with their advisors and graduate mentors to organize their research outcomes into a scientific poster, an oral presentation, and a research report. Students presented their posters and oral presentations at an end-of-the summer GT College of Science REU Research Symposium. Research topics ranged widely including Physics of Living Systems, ultracold atoms, gravitational astrophysics, graphene, robotics, cardiac dynamics, and multi-messenger astrophysics. An overview of the program and past projects is available here: <a href=\"https://physicsreu.gatech.edu/\">https://physicsreu.gatech.edu/</a></p>\r\n<p>A sizable fraction of the REU participants (16) continued their research at Georgia Tech for one or more semesters beyond the REU summer. Many participants are co-authors on peer-reviewed manuscripts&nbsp; and/or presented research at regional and national conferences, including the American Society of Physics (APS) March Meeting.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p>\r\n<p>In keeping with the NSF REU program&rsquo;s goal of involving undergraduates from non-research-intensive institutions, 62% of applicants came from the less-research-intensive institutions (defined as levels below R1 or &ldquo;highest&rdquo; in the Carnegie classification); of these, we prioritized candidates from lower-research environments, so our program participants ended up overwhelmingly (67% and 60%) from less-research-intensive institutions (below R1 and R2). Also in alignment with the NSF goals of broadening participation in STEM, this REU program focused on providing research opportunities to qualified minority and female students. This was achieved in part by partnering with the AUCC. The working relationship deepened ties through collaborative student recruitment with AUCC faculty, funded post-REU research opportunities for AUCC students, and focused efforts to identify other meaningful programming to bridge the institutions and strengthen the environment and opportunities for physicists and engineers in Georgia. Interactions resulted in a seminar exchange series with Clark Atlanta University, collaboration with a Morehouse graduate (and GT REU alum) to identify opportunities to initiate programming in the AUCC, hosting a Spelman professor for a summer of research at Georgia Tech, and the initiation of a Black Student Physics Group based at Georgia Tech that includes several AUCC REU alums.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;A final measure of the Broader Impacts is the continued education and participation of REU participants in STEM professions. In this grant&rsquo;s cohort,&nbsp; over 70% of the participants pursued a career in STEM, including 48% that continued with graduate degrees in Physics or Engineering disciplines.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/09/2025<br>\nModified by: Jennifer&nbsp;Curtis</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1852519/1852519_10592932_1741575320904_2022_Georgia_Tech_Physics_REU_Joshua_Graves_and_Laura_Cadonati--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1852519/1852519_10592932_1741575320904_2022_Georgia_Tech_Physics_REU_Joshua_Graves_and_Laura_Cadonati--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Joshua \"Jay\" Graves and his faculty advisor at Georgia Tech Physics REU Poster Symposium\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1852519/1852519_10592932_1741575320904_2022_Georgia_Tech_Physics_REU_Joshua_Graves_and_Laura_Cadonati--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Joshua \"Jay\" Graves and his faculty advisor at Georgia Tech Physics REU Poster Symposium\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Joshua \"Jay\" Graves and his faculty advisor at Georgia Tech Physics REU Poster Symposium in Summer 2022.
