 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2019, Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology.  The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase participation in groups underrepresented in biology. This fellowship will examine how shifts in coral reef biodiversity and productivity impact the natural resiliency of atoll islands to sea level rise.  Atoll reefs and islands are linked such that islands are composed entirely of sand and rubble that is derived from the nearshore reef.  Atoll reef-islands are highly significant as they provide the only habitable land in certain regions of the Pacific, and the loss of these islands is directly tied to cultural identity. It is widely recognized among indigenous and underrepresented communities that there is a need for culturally relevant applications of scientific and environmental processes. To broaden participation of Pacific Island peoples in Biology the fellow will partner with local educators in Hawaii to develop K-12 curriculum for communities with a high native Hawaiian population.  Furthermore the University of Hawaii at Hilo is a minority serving institution and provides an excellent setting for the fellow to mentor undergraduate students in all aspects of the research project.\r\n\r\nThis fellowship will elucidate the bio-geological linkages that enable or limit island resiliency within Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument in the context of future sea level rise and other environmental stressors.  Long-term photographic survey data (2012-2019) will be used for photogrammetric 3D reconstruction of nearshore coral communities.  3D reconstructions of each reef study site will be used to characterize temporal and spatial shifts in reef composition, coral health, and 3D architectural complexity. Reef community composition will be compared to atoll reef-island sediments to identify key island building species and their relative abundance on modern reefs.  Reef framework productivity (sediment rates) and erosion will be quantified from 3D reconstructions to assess sediment availability for island building and maintenance. An improved understanding of how coral reefs respond to environmental stressors will guide efforts within Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, and across Pacific Island nations aimed at protecting low lying atoll islands and islanders.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
