 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact and commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer\r\n(STTR) Phase I project is to empower providers with the unprecedented ability to treat patients\r\nwith chronic inflammatory skin disease effectively and at a lower cost. Today, primary care\r\nphysicians often refer patients with these conditions to dermatologists for the initial diagnosis\r\nand multiple follow-up appointments, especially when patients are prescribed high cost, high\r\ntouch therapies like biologics or procedures, such as phototherapy. By introducing this\r\nautomated severity scoring system, these providers will have the expertise of dermatologists at\r\ntheir fingertips, giving them the ability to assess disease severity and provide systemic\r\ntreatments previously available only through specialists. It will also establish more objective\r\nassessments, evaluating patient progress to adjust dosage and treatments as necessary. For\r\npharmaceutical companies, the ability to have non-specialists make these severity assessments\r\nduring clinical trials reduces expensive and restrictive staffing requirements. Less expensive trials can\r\nhelp expedite new drugs to market. This innovation will enhance scientific and technological\r\nunderstanding by applying known machine learning techniques in a novel manner to solve a\r\ndifficult visual problem.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will prototype a clinical tool\r\nthat can assess images of a chronic skin inflammation, determine its severity, and suggest\r\ntreatment. This system will be able to guide users with minimal training through the image\r\ncollection process, determine if the information is sufficient, and request additional information if\r\nrequired via novel machine learning techniques. Currently, clinicians trying to assess the\r\nseverity of chronic inflammatory skin diseases rely on a series of estimations and manual\r\nweighted averages, a time consuming and biased process. This Phase I research will explore\r\nwhat information is necessary for an algorithm to determine the severity of a psoriasis case. It\r\nwill determine if it is possible for a machine to guide an imager through imaging regions of\r\ninterest at higher detail, rather than the entire body at large. It will also explore how quickly and\r\npractically such a calculation can be performed. The end goal of the project is a working\r\nprototype that can consistently score a few psoriasis cases and serve as a proof of concept for\r\nexpansion of the prototype in future work.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
