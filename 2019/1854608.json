 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the Bloomington Geometry Workshop taking place at Indiana University on April 5-7, 2019. The workshop will promote interaction and scientific cooperation among mathematicians engaged in cutting-edge research in geometry and related areas. The workshop emphasizes the training and professional development of graduate students and other young researchers. Such experiences are critical to the development of young mathematicians, new members of a workforce that will help the nation address the technological challenges of the 21st century. The workshop will also encourage participation of members of groups that are under-represented in mathematics, helping to diversify the ranks of those participating in research in mathematics and related disciplines. \r\n\r\nThe workshop employs a format that strongly encourages both formal and informal interaction among students, postdoctoral associates, and more established mathematicians. The workshop organizers will videotape all presentations and post them publicly with links from the conference webpage. Young researchers will be encouraged to produce and display posters during the meeting. More information about the workshop can be found at http://www.indiana.edu/~bgw/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
