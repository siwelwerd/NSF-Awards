 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gravitation Waves (GW) have recently been detected with LIGO/VIRGO and high energy neutrino events by  IceCube. The era of monitoring this emission in two  of the three (electromagnetic is the third) \"windows\"  is now open. The All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN)  uses robotically operated telescopes at globally distributed observing sites to survey the visible sky on faster than a daily cadence and is ideal for discovering, identifying and monitoring  electromagnetic emission and in turn trigger observation across the electromagnetic spectrum. The coordination of monitoring these events in two or more \"windows\" will lead to identifying the objects and understanding the high energy physical processes giving rise to these events. The ASAS-SN program will continue to provide critical training for the next generation time-domain astronomers and postdocs by their participation in the research sponsored by this grant. A \"Citizen Science\" project will be undertaken to classify the 1,000,000 variable stars present in the ASAS-SN data.  An ASAS-AN inspired planetarium show will be developed initially for the OSU Planetarium and later, distributed to other planetaria.   \r\n \r\nThis grant supports the operation of the ASAS-SN survey.  With robotically controlled telescopes distributed in both hemispheres it maps the visible sky on a daily basis, making it ideal for the study of variable optical phenomena such as Galactic novae, galactic transients, Supernovae, variable stars. The data is made available to the astronomical community and the public shortly after observation.  It has  already accumulated data over several years and will continue with its present operations.  With the detection of Gravitational Waves by LIGO/VIRGO and high energy neutrinos by IceCube, and followed by ASAS-SN's detecting, and localizing the electromagnetic counterpart and distributing its location to the astronomical community, ASAS-SN will make an invaluable contribution to obtaining the multiwavelength data needed to interpret the physical mechanisms giving rise to events in several \"windows\" and will lead to their understanding. \r\n\r\nThis project advances the goals of the NSF Windows on the Universe Big-Idea.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nExperiments such as LIGO/VIRGO, Fermi/Swift, and IceCube/SuperK survey the entire sky for gravitational waves, &gamma;-rays, and neutrinos, respectively. They are key components of a new age of multi-messenger astrophysics. An essential counterpart to the huge investments made in these projects is the all-sky capacity to rapidly search for and identify optical counterparts to multi-messenger experiments. \n\nThis grant funded the multi-messenger and multi-wavelength efforts of the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN).   ASAS-SN is the first optical sky survey that montiors the entire sky nightly using 20 telecopes at 4 sites around the world.  The results from this grant are broad, but include following-up gravitational wave detects from LIGO of neutron star mergers in the optical, following-up extremely high energy nutrinos detected at the south pole with IceCube, and measuring the time delay between the optical and gamma-ray emission from Fermi for blazars. \n\nPerhaps the most exciting result from this grant was the discovery of the first really promising candidate for a repeating partial tidal distruption of a star.  Invesitgations are still ongoing, but our best picture of this system, ASASSN-14ko, is an evolved star on a eccentirc 115-day orbit close to a supermassive black hole that once per orbit get material torn from its surface leading to a luminous flare. \n\n \n\nhttps://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/2021/01/uh-graduate-student-discovers-long-sought-old-faithful-active-galaxy/\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/28/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Benjamin Shappee"
