SPAWC is one of the flagship annual conferences of the IEEE Signal Processing Society and will be celebrating its 20th anniversary in 2019. SPAWC is devoted to dissemination of advances in signal processing for wireless communications, networking, and information theory. The workshop's Organizing Committee and Technical Program Committee, which change from year to year, comprise eminent scientists from around the world working at the intersection of communications, signal processing and information theory. SPAWC offers a unique format for dissemination of ideas by mixing keynotes with poster presentations, making participation more interactive than many other conferences. It is a small (usually 150-250 participants every year) but very focused conference, which affords deeper interactions among the participants. Papers submitted to SPAWC are peer-reviewed and accepted papers are published as a proceedings volume and digitally archived on IEEE Xplore.\r\n\r\nStudent activities include a best student paper contest, luncheons with keynote speakers, and mentoring opportunities for underrepresented groups. The students supported on this travel award will have ample opportunities to network with their peers, mentors, and eminent researchers in this field, and will provide testimonials on the outcomes of this activity at the end of the workshop.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
