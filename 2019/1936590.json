 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ever since the introduction of oxygen into the atmosphere by photosynthetic organisms, about 2.7 billion years ago, activated forms of oxygen (called reactive oxygen) have been the unwelcome companions of aerobic life. Although currently used by plant and animal cells as important signaling molecules, these activated forms of oxygen could be highly toxic to cells and tissues and cause oxidative injury (oxidative stress). The long-term goal of this project, led by Ron Mittler and Rajeev Azad of the University of North Texas and Rachel Nechushtai of Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Israel, is to determine how cells monitor their intracellular levels of reactive oxygen and prevent its toxicity. In particular, the project will highlight an unknown aspect of the regulation of reactive oxygen in plant and animal cells, namely the use of iron-sulfur clusters by a newly discovered group of proteins to monitor reactive oxygen levels and regulate cellular metabolism and other vital processes. Results obtained from this study could lead to the development of new and novel approaches to enhance the tolerance of crops to important stresses such as drought and heat or delay senescence. In addition, the proposed study could identify novel plant-based compounds and proteins that mitigate oxidative stress, aging and different diseases such as cancer and diabetes. The PIs will train a number of graduate and undergraduate students and partner with a local education center and museum to provide outreach to K-12 students.\r\n\r\nThe PIs will investigate the role of a novel class of Fe-S proteins, NEET proteins, in maintaining ROS homeostasis in plant and animal cells. In light of their unique cluster features, it is hypothesized that NEET proteins use their redox-active labile clusters to sense ROS levels in cells and regulate different pathways that alter cellular metabolism. The Specific Aims of the project are: 1. Perform a comparative signaling and regulatory network analysis of plant and animal cells with altered level and/or function of NEET proteins. 2. Identify the NEET interactome network of plant and animal cells. 3. Determine the dynamics of NEET protein localization/ function in cells and conduct genetic complementation studies of NEET proteins between mammalian and plant cells. Using a combination of functional genetics, proteomics, advanced imaging, RNA-Seq and network analysis approaches, a mechanistic understanding of ROS/redox sensing/regulation in cells will be pursued. The mechanisms identified through this proposed NSF-BSF collaboration will be further compared between different kingdoms: plant - studied through the NSF part, and animal - studied through the BSF part of this project, to obtain an evolutionary perspective of ROS/redox sensing/regulation in cells.\r\n\r\nThis collaborative US/Israel project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the Israeli Binational Science Foundation.",

Although required for aerobic life, oxygen can, and do, lead to the production of dangerous compounds called reactive oxygen species. In the presence of iron, that is also highly important for the proper function of cells, these reactive oxygen species can be further activated and cause an uncontrolled process of cell death. So, how do cells keep using oxygen and iron without suffering damage? This question is especially important for our understanding of how plants and crops can resist adverse environmental conditions, such as drought and heat stresses, or pathogens, as well as for our understanding of how diseases such as diabetes, neurodegeneration and cancer develop. In our project we focused on the role of a newly discovered group of proteins that are conserved from bacteria to man, called NEET proteins. We used two different experimental systems, whole plants and mammalian cells in culture, and used a combination of experimental tools and methods to determine the function of NEET proteins in these biological systems. We found that NEET proteins are highly important for keeping a healthy balance in cells between reactive oxygen species and iron, and that in their absence this balance is disrupted and cells become sick and die. We also found that enhancing the levels of NEET proteins can improve cellular growth and resistance to reactive oxygen species, but that this process can also support cancer cell proliferation. A tight balance is therefore needed to maintain the level of NEET proteins in cells. Too low a level and cells will die, but too high a level and cells can start proliferating in an uncontrolled manner. Although for the latter to occur additional genes must be mutated, it is not recommended to simply amplify the level of NEET proteins because if additional mutations will occur the path to rapidly proliferating cells will be hasten. In plants on the other hands enhancing the level of NEET proteins promoted growth and protected cells from different stresses, suggesting that this strategy could be used to fortify crops against the damaging effects of different stresses. In summary, our study reveal that NEET proteins could be used to enhance the tolerance of plants to different stresses. In addition, it highlighted the possibility of using designer drugs that target specific parts of NEET proteins (their metabolic heart) to treat diabetes, cancer or neurodegeneration, as well as use NEET proteins as valuable markers in medicine (<em>e.g.,</em> for cancer). Further studies of NEET proteins are of course needed to harness the full potential of this highly important and newly discovered class of proteins that play such an ancient and central role in cell metabolism, signaling and defense.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/02/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ron&nbsp;Mittler</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1936590/1936590_10445379_1599069128323_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1936590/1936590_10445379_1599069128323_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"The NEET family\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1936590/1936590_10445379_1599069128323_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"The NEET family\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The NEET protein family is shown.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Mittler and Nechushtai</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ron&nbsp;Mittler</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">The NEET family</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
