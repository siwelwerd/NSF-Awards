 "awd_abstract_narration": "Blue collar jobs are being replaced with \"new-collar\" jobs that use technology to solve multidisciplinary problems. Building on prior accomplishments supported by federal funding under the Department of Labor's Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training program, this project focuses the new-collar field of mechatronics, which combines mechanical, electronic, and computer technologies.  Mechatronics technicians work with 3D printers, electromechanical systems, robotic devices, and other technologies to contribute to sectors ranging from agriculture and advanced manufacturing to renewable energy and telecommunications.  The project will implement the Siemens Mechatronic Systems curriculum to develop a stackable, industry-recognized certification program and an Associate of Science degree. The Siemens curriculum uses a systems approach to mechatronics education that emphasizes how multiple technologies coexist and interact. This approach helps students learn how to troubleshoot, maintain, and operate an entire automated system, rather than just individual components.  As a result, students who complete the mechatronics certification and/or degree will be prepared for well-paying jobs in growing industries, thus contributing to the US skilled technical workforce and economy.\r\n\r\nThis project has four goals:  1) redevelop the curriculum to realign the current Advanced Manufacturing Mechatronics Certificate with the Siemens Mechatronics Level 1 Certification; 2) provide professional development and training for College faculty to earn Siemens Level 1 Mechatronics Instructor certification; 3) investigate the program enhancements needed to implement Siemens Level 2 certification at a later date; 4) raise interest in and awareness of an advanced manufacturing career involving mechatronics in the local area. The project will leverage the work of other NSF Advanced Technological Education (ATE) projects to build low cost mechatronics training kits and will disseminate the curriculum and materials it develops to the ATE community. As traditional manufacturing becomes more automated and dependent on computers, the need for technicians with advanced problem-solving skills is increasing. This project will contribute to educating this next generation of skilled technical workers.   This project is funded by the NSF ATE program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWith this award, the MCC Mechatronics team, with the help of our business and industry partners, transformed how we teach Mechatronics at Manchester Community College. We were able to meet all our major goals of the project and build a solid foundation for the future of the Advanced Manufacturing and Mechatronics program at MCC.\n\nOur first goal was curriculum development.  We started with building the low-cost mechatronics trainer developed by Tim Callinan at Anne Arundel CC and Collaborate ATE project.   We recreated one of the low cost mechatronics trainers and reviewed all the content and resources previously developed.  The trainer was designed very well, but it was too big for our labs.  We were also focusing on mapping our content to the nationally recognized NC3 Mechatronics certification, so smaller, more focused trainers were better for our program.\n\nWe made some iterations to the Low-Cost Mechatronics trainer and focused on the topics of our PLC and Motor Control course ADMT 120 that mapped to the NC3 Mechatronics PLC certification.  We made 12 of the low-cost PLC trainers and the associated labs and curriculum.  These tools were used in the ADMT 120 class in the Fall of 2021.  We made some updates and built another 12 trainers to test in a Running Start high school class at Spark Academy in the Spring of 2022.  \n\nDuring the Summer of 2022 we designed a prototype of a low-cost electronics trainer for the ADMT 118 course, Fundamental of Electronics for Manufacturing.   We redesigned all labs and content to support this new trainer.  We built 24 of these new low-cost Electronics trainer and implemented them in the Fall of 2022 at MCC.  The class was successful, and we built another 30 of these trainers to implement at Spark Academy in their Running Start Electrical Fundamentals class in the Spring 2023. \n\nOur second goal was professional development.  Over the duration of the grant, two professors were certified to teach five of the NC3 certifications in mechatronics.  We aligned our curriculum with the nationally recognized NC3 Mechatronics certification.  The content focuses on the FESTO hardware, but it is relevant to any industrial mechatronics equipment.   These certifications were offered to both MCC students and Early College HS students in the Fall of 2022. \n\nOver the summer we offered teacher training to all the high school teachers as well as new adjuncts at the college.  We worked with CAST to provide a basic understanding of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) so the syllabus, labs, and content we created were accessible to all students. \n\nOur third goal was to increase awareness of career pathways in Advanced Manufacturing and Mechatronics.  We leveraged the low-cost PLC and Electronics trainers we designed and fabricated with this award and gave them to some of the local high schools.  We designed dual credit classes they could not offer before because they did not have the hardware, curriculum, or experience in topics like basic AC/DC electronics and PLC.   These trainers also increased how many students were exposed to these advanced manufacturing and mechatronics topics.  These courses and lab brought the advanced topics down to a level they could touch, feel, and understand. \n\nWe also had our first Mechatronics Awareness workshop in the Fall of 2022.  We focused on guidance counselors, principals, CTE teachers and CTE directors.  These educators got a chance to see five of the Advanced Manufacturing and Mechatronics classrooms at MCC.  They participated in hands on demonstrations in each lab.  The workshop culminated with a good discussion on Mechatronics and what kind of student would be successful in a Mechatronics program. \n\nWe presented our Low-Cost PLC trainer at the International Manufacturing Technology Show (IMTS) in 2022 with ARMI (Advanced Regenerative Manufacturing Institute).  We also presented all our work at the NSF ATE PI Conference in 2022.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/21/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel R Larochelle"
