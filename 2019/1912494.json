 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will explore the creation and motion of many-particle quantum states using ultra-cold atoms trapped in focused laser beams. When these atoms are placed into highly-excited (Rydberg) atomic states, they interact with each other strongly, rapidly leading to a situation in which many atoms are interconnected in a very fundamental way (so-called \"quantum entanglement).  Subsequent evolution and decoherence (removal of the entanglement) of atomic states will be studied. Efficient production of multi-particle entangled states will impact fundamental physics investigations and advance quantum-enhanced measurement techniques.  This research will also inform emerging technological applications of quantum computation and communication, quantum sensors for navigation and magnetometry, and atomic clocks.\r\n \r\nThe experiments feature an array of individual atoms and atomic ensembles cooled to microKelvin temperatures, each confined by a strongly focused laser beam. The frequency of the trapping field is chosen such that confinement is state-insensitive with respect to ground and Rydberg atomic levels. This approach allows for controlled evolution of strongly-interacting atoms, permitting generation of multi-atom entangled states on the timescale of tens of microseconds and allowing for second-scale entanglement storage within ground hyperfine manifolds. Methods of creating and controlling highly-entangled states and their applications to quantum-limited metrology will be explored.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
