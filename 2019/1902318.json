 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past decade, rapid advances have been made in 3D technologies, including 3D printing, 3D scanning, and 3D graphics programming. As a result, the workforce increasingly needs technicians with skills in 3D technologies and the education of these technicians is increasingly important for maintaining the Nation's skilled technical workforce. However, a gap often exists between classroom instruction related to 3D technologies and the current skills required in industry. To help narrow this gap, Mountain View College in Texas will work closely with industry to develop a curriculum that provides relevant instruction in current 3D technology areas. The project partners will design courses that align with the knowledge and skills valued by experts in the field. To this end, instruction about 3D technologies will be integrated into courses across technician disciplines at the institution. Mountain View College is a Hispanic-serving institution with a long history of advancing the education of underserved student groups.  As a result, this project has the potential to not only improve the skills of the entry-level workforce to meet regional and national employment needs, but also to broaden participation in the skilled technical workforce.\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of the project is to provide educational experiences that enable students to leave college with highly-marketable and valuable skills in 3D technologies, ready to enter the technician workforce. To achieve this goal, the project will: 1) perform a gap analysis to uncover mismatches between course content and industry needs; 2) develop interdisciplinary modules on topics in 3D printing, scanning, and modeling that address identified gaps, and implement the modules within courses across multiple disciplines; 3) develop and implement a capstone course on 3D technologies and their application; 4) organize and host bi-annual workshops for faculty professional development and a 3D Technology Conference to share project findings; and 5) use results and best practices from these activities to design and propose a new industry-endorsed 3D technology certificate program at the institution. The project team will collaborate with local and regional industry professionals to identify areas for optimal implementation of content and hands-on learning with 3D technologies into existing coursework. The new capstone course will provide cohesive, progressively complex learning and hands-on experiences with 3D technologies, culminating in student capstone projects that feature 3D technology. The approach may augment partnerships between higher education, research, and industry across the region and pave the way for other two-year institutions to expand and enhance their instruction on 3D technologies. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe last decade has seen critical advances in 3D sensing, display, modeling, programming, and manufacturing technologies. Expiration of major patents in 3D printing helped small companies, schools, and individuals to own and experience affordable 3D printers and scanners. Extensive use of 3D sensors (e.g., IMU) in mobile phones, dramatically reduced the cost of the 3D sensors affordable. There exist many open-source 3D modeling and programming platforms that made the development of interactive 3D content, including AR and VR.\n\n\nThese positive changes have a great potential to change both the working and living environment dramatically, similar to the internet, if well-educated and applied. Unfortunately, our survey results show that both the students and educators are mostly considering mature 3D technologies still as emerging technologies. This misconception can lead to a serious shortage of quality graduates in many competitive industries, including creative functional designs, interactive 3D-content production, and novel virtual-physical production processes. Currently,it is difficult to find formal classes that systematically educate the working principles, diverse applications, and value of inter-disciplinary integration of 3D technologies.\n\n\nIn this project, we have performed three sets of a consecutive survey wherein the questionnaires are re-designed and detailed by reflecting previous survey results. By integrating rich survey results from students, educators, and industry, we could conclude the following:\n\n\n(1)3D workshops are essential to help educators and students understand the social and industrial impact of 3D technologies, motivating them to update curricula and plan project-based learning.\n\n\n(2) Both students, faculty, and VP-staff feel the need to create a formal class(es) to teach 3D technologies. Many students prefer 3-credit classes to learn working principles and creative applications.\n\n\n(3) Many students believe that 3D technology may become agateway to STEM careers.\n\n\n(4) Both students and educators consider 3D technology as a great tool for inter-disciplinary project and project-based learning\n\n\nFrom (3) and (4), students think that learning 3D technologies help them to become competitive in the job market. At the same time, they think thatthey are motivated to learn other subjects by learning 3D technologies. This indirect impact of learning 3D technology should not be well-reflected in future curriculum design.\n\n\nNSF grant greatly helped us to build a multi-disciplinary team and infrastructure to better educate 3D technologies. We plan to expand our 3D workshop and experiment with new 3D classes soon. Furthermore, we would like to be helped to test run novel education frameworks such as \"Techno-Entrepreneurship\" and \"Art-Engineering Design for Manufacturing\".\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/17/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: UichungCho\n"
