 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program provides support to design, implement, study and assess efforts to increase the numbers of students and the quality of their preparation by strengthening science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and research. This project at Howard University provides a strategic approach to infuse courses and research with interactive, human-centered computing elements to engage and excite students about computer science with the goal to increase the number of computer science graduates. Undergraduate students are involved in this project as researchers. \r\n\r\nThis one-year pilot project seeks to redesign the Introduction to Game Design course and Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction course in the computer science undergraduate curriculum with learning modules in mixed reality, including virtual reality and augmented reality; along with user experience design and fundamentals of human-computer interaction.  These courses will give students exposure to interactive computing elements using active, project-based learning.  The project will study the efficacy of this intervention using qualitative and quantitative measures. The project will be guided by formative and summative evaluation.\r\n\r\nThis project is co-funded by the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
