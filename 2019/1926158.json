 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rising carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, global climate change, and the sustainability of the Earth's biosphere are of great societal concern. This is true in the Arctic Ocean as it is widely viewed as one of the most sensitive regions on Earth to climate change. Understanding the carbon cycle and its underlying control mechanisms is necessary to predict how carbon flux in the Arctic Ocean will change, as well as feedbacks to the larger climate system. This project will measure components of the carbonate system to understand ocean acidification in the western Arctic Ocean through collaboration with the Chinese National Arctic Research Expedition (CHINARE) cruises along a transect from the Bering Strait to high latitude basins. The investigator will collect high resolution inorganic carbon data during summer 2020. These data, supplemented by a subset of data collected in 2019 and 2021 by CHINARE collaborators, will be used to understand the mechanisms controlling carbon cycle and fluxes and ocean acidification in the western Arctic Ocean and the changes that have occurred in recent decades. Continued data collection and data synthesis are important to understand major environmental and climate-related changes in the marine carbonate system in the Arctic Ocean. This research will enhance the infrastructure of ocean carbon research and general science education through teaching undergraduate and graduate courses at the University of Delaware. In addition, it will enhance international collaboration and public awareness of climate change and environmental issues through public outreach activities. \r\n\r\nObserving and understanding the mechanisms controlling the carbon cycle in the Arctic Ocean is necessary to predict future conditions and feedbacks to climate change. This study will test the hypothesis that high biological production and low partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) are limited to the Chukchi shelf and the sea-ice melt edge and that ice-free basin areas are characterized by high pCO2, low pH, and low carbonate saturation state. A comparison of the new data with those collected between 2008 and 2018 during CHINARE, as well as other historical data, will be used to test the hypothesis that the expansion of the basin area to north characterized by increasingly higher pCO2 and lower pH is due to the earlier timing and longer summer warming, reduced buffer capacity, and increased pCO2 in the atmosphere. Finally, water column data collected in 2020 together with earlier data will be used to test the hypothesis that the expansion of ocean acidification from subsurface to deeper depths and to higher latitudes is primarily caused by the increased input of the Pacific Winter Water into the subsurface basin driven by rapid environment change such as sea-ice retreat.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Warming has resulted in earlier onset of sea-ice retreat with a smaller sea-ice extent, thinner ice sheet, and a longer ice-free period. This change has consequently affected carbonate chemistry such as increasing CO<sub>2</sub> sink and resulting in ocean acidification in the Arctic Ocean. Our recent studies demonstrated that while the western Arctic Ocean basin areas are not a large CO<sub>2</sub> sink due to strong stratification and shallow surface mixed layer during the summertime, the surface water CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure (<em>p</em>CO<sub>2</sub>) has increased at a rate twice that of the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> increase (reported in a paper in a high impact journal <em>Nature Climate Change</em> first-authored by a graduate student, Ouyang et al., 2020). An accompany paper further illustrate that sea surface pH has decreased 3-4 times faster than the rate predicted from acidification due solely to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> increase in a paper published in a high impact journal <em>Science</em> (Qi et al., 2022). This is a combined effect of a decreased ocean CO<sub>2</sub> buffer capacity and an increased CO<sub>2</sub> and pH seasonality. However, because of the longer sea-ice free period and the expansion of the sea-sea free area further north, the overall CO<sub>2</sub> sink capacity in the basin is still increasing and the trend is predicted to continue for the next decade (Ouyang et al. 2022). In stark contrast, while the Chukchi Sea is a strong and increasing CO<sub>2</sub> sink, its surface water <em>p</em>CO<sub>2</sub> has not increased, and pH has not decreased due to a high and increasing biological removal of CO<sub>2</sub> there. As a result steady sea surface <em>p</em>CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and an increasing atmospheric <em>p</em>CO<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub> sink capacity has increased rapidly in the Chukchi Sea (Ouyang et al. 2022).</p>\n<p>Sea ice loss has profound implications for Arctic primary production, however, the role of sea ice distribution and melt history on the seasonal evolution of net community production (NCP) is under-documented. Based on underway observations of D(O<sub>2</sub>/Ar) and sea surface <em>p</em>CO<sub>2</sub> in the western Arctic Ocean during the summers of 2016 and 2018, data collected by a previous project supported by the same NSF-Arctic Natural Science Program, a paper published in <em>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</em> in 2021 (the current funding period) observed high NCP on the Chukchi Shelf and much lower values in the Canada Basin, attributable to the heterogeneity of ice conditions, water circulation, and nutrient supply. The observations present a complete view of the western Arctic summer evolution of NCP and CO<sub>2</sub> uptake, through the stages of pre-melt, ongoing melt, and post-melt. They also demonstrate that accounting for local sea ice history (in addition to wind history) is crucial for estimating NCP from D(O<sub>2</sub>/Ar) observation, extending the possible application from open ocean to other world?s ice-influenced waters. The paper was first-authored by graduate student Ouyang in the Cai lab in the University of Delaware (see Ouyang et al. 2021).</p>\n<p><span>Broader of impacts: (1) Trained a team of next general scientists for ocean carbon cycle research.
