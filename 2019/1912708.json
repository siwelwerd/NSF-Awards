 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gamma-rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation. Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe and can be used to test fundamental physics. The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory, located on the slopes of the Sierra Negra in Mexico, is a ground-based facility designed with unique capabilities to observe very high energy gamma-rays. This award supports scientists at the University of Maryland College Park in their leadership roles in the operation of the observatory and in the scientific analysis of the HAWC data. The group will continue activities to optimize the sensitivity of the observatory and pursue scientific research on transient gamma-ray sources and newly discovered very high energy sources. This award will allow the group to continue and expand their outreach efforts, which include outreach to the Hispanic-American community with bi-lingual products related to HAWC. \r\n\r\nWith its large instantaneous field of view and continuous operations HAWC surveys two-thirds of the sky every day.  The University of Maryland group will continue their study of transient sources with HAWC as part of a multi-messenger and multi-wavelength campaign.  They will also continue their work producing maps and conducting surveys to reveal new high energy gamma-ray sources.  In addition, they will continue to lead the effort to exploit the novel water Cherenkov detection technique to improve the sensitivity of HAWC.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The UMD group has played a key role in the development of the newest reconstruction reprocessing pass (Pass 5) for all of the HAWC data. We were responsible new algorithm developments leading to higher sensitivity at both low and high energies.

The improvement is most significant for large events and large zenith angles. The right plot shows the improvement in angular resolution again showing a large improvement for large events and large zenith angles.\n\n\nFigure 3 shows the HAWC all-sky map using Pass 5, revealing emission all along the Galactic plane, as well as the blazars Mrk 421 and Mrk 501, and, for the first time in HAWC, the radio galaxy M87, which is now seen at 6. The data shown are from 2321 days of HAWC operation. This represents the one of the deepest wide-field survey of the northern sky at TeV energies, with 100 sources above 5 detected. This is 40 more than in the 1523-day data set published in the 3HWC catalog using Pass 4 reconstruction. With this better reconstruction and higher sensitivity, the challenge becomes disentangling point sources, extended sources, and diffuse background in order to do more science: make an improved measurement of the truly diffuse emission, resolve previously confused sources, and extract physics from these sources by better correlating their morphology with structures seen in other wavelengths (radio through gamma rays) and constrain models of emission with improved spectral measurements.\n\n\nIn addition, we are working on incorporating the outriggers in our reconstruction which will be Pass 6.
