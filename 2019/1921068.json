Preference will be given to supporting members of underrepresented groups and first-time participants, especially emerging scientists: students, postdocs, and junior faculty. The workshop will bring together scientists from both the hard- and soft-condensed matter fields that are working on quantum and classical nonequilibrium driven systems. This cross-disciplinary workshop is the first of its kind, and it seeks to facilitate cross-pollination between the fields, and will feature extensive discussion sessions, which will feed back into reshaping the weekly schedule. It is expected to lead to fruitful collaborations and new insights on both the theoretical as well as on the experimental front.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
