 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports travel costs for key speakers, moderators and scientific committee members to participate in the Stanford Symposium to Accelerate Progress in AI in Healthcare, taking place September 18-19, 2019.  These participants are research leaders on applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare, who will provide fresh thinking across a range of topic areas addressing AI in healthcare from leaders in science and industry. Each presentation will be followed by a facilitated panel discussion among researchers from diverse research environments and disciplines.  Compared to AI research in industries such as transportation, retail and defense, AI research targeting gains in healthcare quality and efficiency is currently underdeveloped. The symposium's goal is to accelerate near term scientific progress in forms of AI that improve clinical diagnosis, treatment selection and treatment activity in order to improve the performance of US healthcare. This activity is expected to facilitate progress toward a computer-assisted, rapid learning healthcare system that can potentially eliminate the gap between current and optimal efficiency and quality of care. In addition, the symposium will catalyze new collaborations between researchers, industry leaders and influencers and thereby accelerate real world testing and scaling.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
