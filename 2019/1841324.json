 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference 'Topological and Rigorous Computational Methods for High Dimensional Dynamics' is to be held on April 1 - April 30, 2019\r\nin Centre des Recherches Mathematiques (CRM), Canada. The revolution of computational and data driven science is well underway. However, mathematically rigorous frameworks for processing the output of this science is lagging.  This is of serious concern since these same computational and data driven techniques are having immediate impacts on the private and social sectors of society. It is essential that within the new generation of mathematicians there are researchers capable of addressing these issues.  Through the tutorials, junior researchers will be introduced to rapidly developing concepts, techniques, and computational tools designed to address these challenges. Through the workshop lectures they will be made aware of the latest developments in the field.\r\nOf equal importance is that their presence will allow them to interact with leaders in the field, to begin to develop connections with researchers from across the world, and ideally to begin research projects that lay the foundations of new techniques for rigorous understanding of the complex nonlinear systems of interest today and in the future.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide support for junior researchers from the USA to participate in a month long special program at the Centre des Recherches Mathematiques (CRM) entitled Topological and Rigorous Computational Methods for High Dimensional Dynamics.  The activities will take place from  April 1 - April 30, 2019 and consist of tutorials, workshops, and time for collaboration.  The research activities of the CRM program focus on two topics.  The first theme is how to effectively and rigorously identify invariant structures in infinite dimensional dynamical systems, for example those generated by partial differential equations. The second theme is how to extract robust information from poorly resolved dynamical systems, for example when only partial or coarse data is available.\r\n\r\nConference website: \r\nhttp://www.crm.math.ca/crm50/en/activities/2019-activities/topological-and-rigorous-computational-methods-for-high-dimensional-dynamics/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
