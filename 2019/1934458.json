 "awd_abstract_narration": "How does bedrock break down into soil?  This question is of wide interest because bedrock fracturing influences landslide hazards, the global carbon cycle, and the supply of nutrients to soils and streams.  This project's main goal is to understand how the weathering of a single type of common mineral - biotite, which expands as it weathers - drives bedrock fracturing.  This will test a longstanding hypothesis that bedrock fracturing is mainly driven by biotite weathering.\r\n\r\nThis work will tackle this question through a combination of numerical modeling, field observations, and laboratory measurements.  At the center of this project is the development of a novel and powerful numerical model for bedrock fracturing.  It will be used to investigate several fundamental questions: How does the development of fractures depend on biotite characteristics like size, orientation, and abundance?  Under what conditions is biotite weathering the dominant driver of bedrock fracturing?  To test the model predictions, new measurements of biotite and fracture characteristics will be conducted at two field sites, one where biotite weathering is thought to dominate rock fracture (the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory, Puerto Rico), and one where the effects of biotite weathering are expected to be less important (the Southern Sierra Nevada Critical Zone Observatory, California).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe central goal of this project was to investigate the sensitivity of rock fracturing to mineral weathering.  The importance of this topic is underscored by the central role that rock fracturing plays in landslide hazards, Earth's climate, the growth of mountains, and the supply of nutrients to soils and streams.  This work was motivated by a longstanding hypothesis that posits that rock fracturing is dominantly controlled by weathering of iron-bearing minerals like biotite, which expand as they weather and exert stresses on the surrounding rock.  If true, this would have important implications for the sensitivity of topography and ecosystems to climate change and tectonics.\n\n \n\nTo test this hypothesis, we conducted work on two fronts.  First, we developed a novel numerical model to calculate the progressive weakening of rock under stresses generated by biotite weathering.  With this model, we quantified the influence of biotite abundance and orientation on the development of bedrock damage.  These simulations showed that biotite weathering can be the dominant driver rock fracturing under certain lithologic, topographic, and regional stress conditions, consistent with the hypothesis motivating this work.\n\n \n\nSecond, we measured biotite and microfracture characteristics in biotite-rich rocks from the Southern Sierra and Luquillo Critical Zone Observatories.  These measurements were made with microanalytical techniques including backscattered electron imaging and energy dispersive spectroscopy.  This provided new measurements of microfracture populations around biotite grains in igneous rocks.  An additional practical outcome of this work was the development of a new open-source methodology for analyzing microscale images of rock, which facilitates the rapid, automated mapping of mineralogy and microfractures , and which has the potential to benefit future studies.\n\n \n\nThis project supported the studies of three PhD students (Xianda Shen and Tingting Xu at Georgia Tech and Miles Reed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison).  In addition, this project supported the growth of the research programs for three faculty (Chloe Arson at Georgia Tech, Ken Ferrier at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and Nicole West at Central Michigan University).  By the time of the project end date, two student-led papers had been published (Shen et al., 2019 and Xu et al., 2022) and more manuscripts are in preparation for publication.
