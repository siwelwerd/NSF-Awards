 "awd_abstract_narration": "Helping people, teams, and organizations achieve important goals may be one of the most effective ways to increase productivity and promote human progress. To achieve their goals, many organizations employ financial incentives or game elements, such as points, levels, and badges, to motivate employees to become more productive. This project develops a theoretical foundation and computational tools for designing better incentive structures to help people achieve their goals. The project connects the crucial challenges of goal achievement studied in psychology to the computational methods from artificial intelligence that can be used to solve them. By bridging this gap the project provides a new way for artificial intelligence to communicate with people and empowers them to overcome the motivational obstacles and cognitive limitations that might otherwise prevent them from making good decisions. \r\n\r\nAt the heart of this project is a mathematical theory for optimizing incentive structures to help people make better decisions in complex, partially unknown environments. This theory is used as the basis for two cognitive prostheses that leverage artificial intelligence and gamification to help people achieve their goals: an intelligent to-do list gamification system that helps people become more productive and procrastinate less and an app that reinforces good habits. Field experiments are used to evaluate whether these cognitive prostheses are effective in the real world, working towards the development of intelligent systems that can aid people in setting and achieving their goals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Moreover, we showed that our general approach can be successfully applied wide range of decision problems; for each decision problem it was applied to, it automatically discovered and successfully taught the resource-rational decision strategy for that specific decision problem. We found that students learning behavior and learning outcomes in digital learning environments can be significantly improved by incentivizing each learning activity by a number of points that reflect how much the student will learn from that activity. We found that optimal gamification can help people overcome motivational obstacles to enacting desired health behaviors, suggesting that optimal gamification could be a promising theoretical framework for supporting behavior change.
