 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polymeric coatings have been part of the fabric of human life for decades. As we move forward, the coatings will need to be functional yet minimal, safe and environmentally responsible. To meet these challenges, we need to understand the fundamental principles behind any deposition process so that it could be harnessed to develop new coatings and to improve upon existing ones. It is this idea that is the driving force behind the conception of the instrument with all its unique capabilities. Manhattan College is a primarily undergraduate institution with an emphasis on providing a well-rounded education. Therefore, a core objective of the project will be to use the instrument as a vehicle to its students the scientific and engineering concepts underlying the deposition process, to train them and give them the opportunity to work with professors and scientists on cutting-edge research projects, and to put them on the path of discovery so that they may be prepared to solve technological problems of the future. Another key objective of the project is to leverage the instrument to create meaningful opportunities for outreach to the public at large.  Specifically, our goal is to educate parents and school teachers from the Bronx and surrounding communities about the operation and applications of the instrument so that they may use it as a platform to inspire greater numbers of students to pursue careers in STEM fields.\r\n  \r\nThis project focuses on the development of an instrument at Manhattan College to study the application of polymer thin films on substrates by the technique of initiated Chemical Vapor Deposition (iCVD). The instrument will contain the following novel capabilities that are not currently available in an off-the-shelf iCVD instrument a) in situ characterization of the polymer films by infrared spectroscopy during the deposition process, by embedding an Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) crystal in the stage of the chamber b) polymer deposition by thermal as well as photo-initiation, by providing a slot for illumination inside the deposition chamber c) feeding monomers using a carrier gas, which would be an important step in the scale-up of the iCVD technique for commercial applications d) polymer deposition under a wide range of pressures, from vacuum to positive pressure, which would enable polymerization of monomers that have thus far been outside the scope of the technique. Finally, the instrument will be designed so as to be used in conjunction with a gas analyzer to study low-temperature, photocatalytic properties of materials. The proposed instrument would be capable of simultaneously supporting a variety of interdisciplinary research projects, which would make it a valuable addition to the research infrastructure of a primarily undergraduate institution like Manhattan College.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
