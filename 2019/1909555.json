 "awd_abstract_narration": "Today, successfully tackling many urgent challenges in\r\nsocio-economically critical domains (such as sustainability, public\r\nhealth, and biology) requires obtaining a deeper understanding of causal\r\nrelationships and interactions among a diverse spectrum of entities from\r\nhigh-dimensional data. For example, the emergence and propagation of an\r\nepidemic involves a causally complex interplay of entities, including\r\nindividuals and their social-interactions, physical short-range and\r\nlong-range networks of mobility, and intervention decisions (such as\r\nschool closures or restrictions on mobility) by decision makers. With\r\nthe aim of filling this important hole and enabling applications and\r\nservices with significant economic and public health impact, the project carries\r\nout research on causally-aware data-driven science and engineering,\r\nincluding data-supported causal analysis. The project also  contributes\r\nto workforce growth, provides an excellent context for doctoral,\r\nmaster's, and undergraduate level research and teaching. Future\r\nresearchers that have the skills in both data analysis and management\r\nare being trained and students are being introduced to career pathways\r\nthrough their participation in research, publications, and partnerships\r\nwith domain experts.\r\n\r\nIn this project, the research team hypothesizes that data analysis provides\r\nopportunities for identifying relationships that can potentially be\r\ncausal. They further hypothesize that data can be used for strengthening\r\nand weakening causal assumptions, and for pruning relationships that are\r\ncertainly not causal.  To validate and leverage these hypotheses, they\r\nintroduce the novel concepts of 'plausible causality' (p-causality) and\r\n'plausibly causal (p-causal) relationships'  and they develop\r\ntechniques to (i) discover p-causal interactions and relationships, (ii)\r\nmaintain these p-casual relationships in systems where causality itself\r\nevolves over time, and (iii) use discovered p-causal relationships to\r\nsupport efficient and effective data analytics to study complex, dynamic\r\nsystems. In particular, they develop new models to capture\r\ncontext-sensitive plausibly causal (p-causal) relationships in complex,\r\ndynamic systems and design novel and scalable causally-aware\r\ndata analysis algorithms that leverage known or hypothesized p-causal\r\nrelationships among entities within different and potentially evolving\r\ncontexts to deal with data sparsity, imprecision, and noise.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
