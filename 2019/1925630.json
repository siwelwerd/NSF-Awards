 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the U.S., the number of Latinx students completing engineering degrees as compared to their growing representation in the population is disproportionately low.  Latinx is the gender-neutral term used in lieu of Latino or Latina, refers to individuals who identify with Latin American culture or race.  Major factors affecting Latinx? success include the everyday experiences where students fear being judged by the negative stereotypes associated with their identity and feeling at risk to conform to these stereotypes.  These negative experiences are known as stereotype threats and have been largely understudied among the Latinx population.  Stereotype threats, are one behavior that leads to negative campus climate, especially among minority students who come from historically marginalized populations.  The climate in which Latinx experience college likely has a direct effect on both the learning and social outcomes of these students.  Nevertheless, the nature and effect of stereotype threats on Latinx students' success and persistence in engineering programs are wholly understudied.  Considering the growing initiatives to open access and improve academic preparation of minorities, stereotype threats represent major barriers for Latinx students in pursuing an engineering degree.  This project investigates how stereotype threats affect Latinx students' performance and persistence in engineering programs.  \r\nThis project brings together an interdisciplinary collaboration between faculty in engineering and education across two institutions: Iowa State University, a Predominately White Institution, and the University of Texas at San Antonio, a Hispanic-Serving Institution.  Through the use of focus groups,  surveys , and mock engineering examinations, the researchers are targeting three research goals : (1) identify the gender and ethnic stereotypes that Latinx students experience in undergraduate engineering programs and identify the coping mechanisms students adopt to address these stereotype threats; (2) identify the effects of stereotype threats on student success (i.e. solving engineering problems); and, (3) identify the effects of stereotype threats on persistence indicators (i.e., self-efficacy, institutional affiliation, and psychological well-being).  This project has an important impact on broadening participation of Latinx students in engineering, as results will inform engineering educators and help justify efforts on creating a more inclusive and supportive campus climate for all learners.  As a result, this research supports the development of a diverse and well-equipped engineering workforce and provides a method for institutions to assess their progress toward equity in the learning environment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
