In a precursor to devastating flying swarms, flightless nymphs form hopper bands that march along the ground in a common direction, often through agricultural regions, causing significant damage to crops that can result in food insecurity for local communities. Hopper bands take on a variety of morphologies that range from streaming columns to planar fronts, see primary image attached. Hopper band morphology appears to serve ecological functions for the collective group, namely foraging and migration, but the mechanisms that give rise to these collective behaviors are not well understood. This project has contributed to our understanding of how an individual&rsquo;s behavioral response to social and environment cues (that is the microscopic description) leads to these morphologies (that is the macroscopic observables). Furthering this connection can inform development of more efficient and effective strategies for controlling and disrupting harmful swarms. Moreover, results from this project may contribute more broadly to understanding collective behavior in other ecological (livestock herds, fish schools) and human (crowd control, traffic) contexts.\n<div class=\"column\"><br />The primary research outcomes from this project are contained in two publications [1, 2].

An ABM provides an immediate connection to observable biology, allowing incorporation of individual behaviors derived directly from data. A continuum PDE model allows global characterization of collective behavior via bifurcation analysis of steady states and stability theory. By investigating both in tandem one can infer individual mechanisms based on resulting collective behavior, as we have done in [1].
