 "awd_abstract_narration": "Very dim galaxies challenge our understanding of how all galaxies formed. This project will construct a telescope optimized for studying such galaxies. It will use several refracting telescopes to form the equivalent of one larger telescope. This telescope will be used to study the outskirts of our Milky Way galaxy and other galaxies. The telescope will also be used to search for Earth-like and even sub-Earth-mass planets around nearby stars. It will be made available to educators and for public outreach. The project will develop, implement and promote a new software infrastructure that allows access to the telescope array to be allocated on either a per-hour or per-observation basis. Credits for access to the telescope array will be distributed to researchers, educators, and public outreach institutions.\r\n\r\nRecent developments indicate that (1) ultra-low-surface-brightness galaxies pose a significant challenge to galaxy formation and evolution scenarios and (2) telescope arrays built from off-the-shelf refracting telescopes are ideally suited to identifying and studying these galaxies. Further, due to rapidly developing commercial CMOS technology, very large-format (150 Mega-Pixel), very rapid-read-time (less than one second), very low-read-noise (less than one electron) CMOS cameras are just now becoming available. This project will exploit these developments by building a high-performance telescope array, located in the Southern Hemisphere, to obtain deep images of regions of the sky at an unprecedentedly rapid cadence of 60 seconds. The low-surface-brightness sensitivity of the array will enable studying the very outer regions of the Milky Way, LMC, SMC, and other nearby galaxies and detecting ultra-diffuse galaxies in nearby clusters and in the field. The rapid cadence of the array will enable detecting transiting Earth-like planets in the habitable zones of white dwarfs and studying microlensing signatures of Earth- and sub-Earth-mass extra-solar planets and asteroids toward the Galactic bulge. This project has a high potential to yield unexpected discoveries.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "The Condor Array Telescope is an example of a new type of astronomical telescope known as an \"array telescope.\"  Condor combines six off-the-shelf 180-mm-diameter apochromatic refracting telescopes with six off-the-shelf CMOS cameras to produce a high-performance astronomical instrument.  Condor is optimized for measuring extremely faint, low-brightness features and for monitoring brightnesses of stars at a rapid cadence.\nThe primary outcomes of the project are as follows:\n1. We built a high-performance array telescope using off-the-shelf apochromatic refracting telescopes and off-the-shelf CMOS camera, and we deployed the telescope to a very dark site in the southwest corner of New Mexico.\n2.  We developed the scheduling, control, and acquisition software necessary to efficiently operate the instrument.\n3.  We obtained the commissioning and calibration observations necessary to demonstrate performance of and calibrate the instrument.\n4.  We developed the processing pipeline software necessary to prepare raw images obtained with the instrument for scientific analysis.  Highlights of the processing pipeline include an ability to perform accurate astrometric calibrations over the wide field of view of the telescope and to accurately flatten and subtract background from images obtained with the telescope, which is crucial for measuring extremely faint, low-brightness features. \n5.  We published the results of our performance and calibration observations.\n6.  We obtained preliminary science observations.\n7.  We submitted results of our preliminary science observations for publication.  Highlights of the preliminary science observations include obtaining the deepest images ever of extremely faint, low-brightness features of a nearby galaxy surrounded by the remnants of a disrupted dwarf galaxy and discovering the first example ever of a second shell of ionized gas surrounding a dwarf nova.  We have also obtained observations seeking to discover Earth-like planets in the habitable zones of white dwarfs, observations seeking to discover intergalactic novae in nearby galaxy clusters, observations seeking to discover Planet 9, and observations imaging ionized gas in nearby galaxy groups and clusters.\n8.  We put in place an infrastructure to share access to Condor observations with faculty and students at traditionally underserved institutions, and we have so far recruited at least one user at such an institution.\n9.  We put in place an infrastructure to disseminate data acquired by Condor, including both raw and processed data.\nThe primary objective of the project was to demonstrate the feasibility of building array telescopes using the off-the-shelf telescopes and off-the-shelf CMOS cameras.  Based on our efforts, we conclude that the feasibility is demonstrated.  The telescopes and cameras work as expected; the software infrastructure is in place, including the control and acquisition software and the processing and analysis software; and the telescope has produced (and will continue to produce) scientifically exciting and important discoveries and results.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/24/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kenneth M Lanzetta"
