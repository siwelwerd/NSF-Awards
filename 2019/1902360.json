 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the conference series \"The Annual Geometry Festival,\" which is held in rotation at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Maryland, the University of North Carolina, the State University of New York at Stony Brook, Duke University, New York University's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, and Princeton University. The next meeting of the Annual Geometry Festival will take place at the University of Maryland from Friday April 5 to Sunday April 7, 2019. The Geometry Festivals aim to expose and explain the major recent accomplishments as well as the outstanding problems in a broadly construed field to a diverse audience of interested students and faculty, to foster their interaction and to advance knowledge and discoveries. The goal of the series is to help provide: (a) A more widely trained community of geometers, able to integrate divergent approaches; (b) A more diverse mathematical workforce; (c) A more rapid integration of younger geometers into areas of current research; (d) Enhancement of interaction and collaboration among researchers in different areas of geometry.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe speakers at the upcoming Geometry Festival at the University of Maryland will discuss their work in the following fields: partial differential equations and numerical analysis, algebraic geometry, spectral geometry, geometric and harmonic analysis, dynamical systems and mathematical physics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
