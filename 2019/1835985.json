 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will create a network of graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and clinical fellows to participate in a continuing convergence education program through educational workshops that will increase the convergence education at the interface of the physical and mathematical sciences and biology among these young researchers. The Institute for Advanced Study will organize and run 3-5 topically focused, mentored meetings a year with talks by each of the attendees and time for extensive discussions. The purpose to be served by the creation of such a Convergence Education Network is to develop and support a strong and continuing convergence education program for these researchers, who will form a network of scientists that combines a unique set of multidisciplinary abilities and perspectives that will enable them to approach important questions in cancer biology and physics in novel ways and through the development of new tools and technologies. \r\n\r\nThe creation of a Cancer Convergence Educational Network will provide a mechanism for direct feedback from diverse members of the cancer research community to improve existing research; will foster new collaborations born by the proximity of scientists from a range of backgrounds that may lead to new original research efforts; will offer professional connections for trainees seeking post-doctoral or professional positions, and will promote the development of a new field with new practitioners who will approach important questions in cancer biology and develop research in physics in an original fashion with significant impact, leveraging a novel partnership among government, private philanthropy, and private industry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
