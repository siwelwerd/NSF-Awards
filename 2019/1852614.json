 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Arctic is experiencing dramatic changes that are impacting land and ocean environments in the north and in regions that include the entirety of the US, Europe and Scandinavia. Changes in the Arctic are even being felt in tropical regions through increased drought frequency and the intensity of water shortages.  These changes are continuing to occur at faster and faster rates and are recognized and amplified by the shrinking of the Arctic's sea ice, the thawing of permafrost and ancient carbon emissions into the atmosphere, declining terrestrial snow pack, shrub encroachment of the tundra, and more frequent and prolonged Arctic Vortex blasts of cold air and snow into the US, Europe and Scandinavia. One of the most important changes that is central to the entirety of Arctic change is how the water cycle is behaving now, how it interacts with sea ice and how weather events dictate transport of Arctic moisture and air into the lower latitudes and how low latitude moisture is transferred into the Arctic, dictating precipitation patterns and the delivery of freshwater around the north.  However, understanding how the Arctic water cycle is behaving over the entire calendar year, including during polar night with measurements and observations directly in the Arctic Basin during winter has been tremendously difficult as the region at times is almost as remote and inhospitable as the dark side of the moon.  The goal of this project is to test, measure and develop a completely new understanding of the real-time behavior of the Arctic water cycle continuously during 1.5 years as part of a major Arctic climate initiative involving land-based stations in coordination with simultaneous measurements aboard the Polarstern icebreaker.  \r\nThese coordinated, real-time measurements will take place as the icebreaker drifts during fall, winter, spring and summer from the eastern Arctic, across the North Pole, along the east coast of Greenland and into the Barents Sea region. This project will take continuous measurements of water vapor and precipitation chemistry from Thule Air Base and Station Nord in Greenland and will be coordinated with measurements being taken on the ship and from other land-based stations in the Arctic.  This simultaneous data will be used in new visualization packages to display, share and observe how sea ice, atmospheric transport patterns, and weather patterns are dictating the distribution of water vapor and precipitation throughout the Arctic and into North America, Europe, Scandinavia and Eurasia. This project has several broader impacts, outreach and educational outcomes. By coordinating the measurements with the MOSAiC drift mission, it will contribute to the collective wisdom and understanding of the Arctic System, helping to develop a more holistic understanding of it?s behavior over an entire year, including the most unresolved period, polar night & winter.  The project also aims to educate students in classrooms during the observation period of what is discovered, including real-time depictions of water vapor and precipitation chemistry as storm systems develop and then propagate across the Arctic Basin and from the Arctic Basin into North America and Europe and from Europe and North America into the Arctic. The project includes training a postdoctoral scientist whereby she/he will become familiar with cutting edge technology and she/he will have opportunities to explore new venues of study by working with like-generation scientists from many of the Artic countries including partners from Germany, Sweden, Finland and Denmark.  The project also aims to develop a new set of Arctic Water Cycle and Arctic Change lectures to be offered through UArctic (http://education.uarctic.org/studies/courses) and posted for public access. These lectures will also be made available to the global community including the US, Finnish, Swedish, German, Danish and Norwegian societies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur MOSAiC project participated in one of the most extensive studies of the Arctic System in modern history.  This international program of research involved over 500 scientists and students, over 15 countries and was based in part on the use of the Polarstern icebreaker as the center piece research platform.  The Polarstern was frozen into the Arctic N of Eurasia and allowed to drift through the Arctic while attached to a very large ice flow, a path and approach similar to the Fram mission lead by F Nansen in the early 1900?s. \n\nOur research program is dedicated to studying the behaviour of the Arctic?s water cycle, one of the paramount properties of our plant.  The water cycle is of great concern today as the wet regions are getting wetter, the dry areas are getting drier.  The consequences of these changes are seen in greater flooding, stronger hurricanes, massive wildfires and longer droughts.  These new conditions are  affecting all facets of crop and livestock production, and thus food security for entire nations.\n\nOur program of research was part of the larger effort aimed at understanding the interactions between the Arctic?s atmosphere-sea ice and ocean using chemical forensics of water vapor, seawater, snow and rain. Our measurements were conducted using the Arctic Water Isotope Network (AWIN) with common, continuous measurements of water vapor and precipitation isotopes (chemical forensics) at the Polarstern and at the same time at land-based stations (2 in Alaska, 2 in Greenland, one on Svalbard, Norway, and at Pallas Finland).  This configuration allowed us to track the traits of moisture coming into the Arctic, how it circulates within the Arctic and how it leaves the Arctic, throughout the entire MOSAiC mission period from October 2019-July 2020. \n\nThis continuous monitoring provides us with an ability to compare how the chemical finger prints of water vapor and precipitation vary at all our stations simultaneously, hour by hour.  This high frequency, continuous set of measurements is immensely important as the distribution, thickness, and patterns of sea ice are constantly changing, as are the wind patterns that transport storm systems and moisture into, within and out of the Arctic.\n\nWe have discovered three main behaviours of the Arctic?s water cycle during MOSAiC: a) The chemical finger prints of moisture transport into the Arctic are distinct along 4 main Arctic storm tracks; b) Evaporation from the Arctic imparts a unique chemical fingerprinting on water vapor and precipitation differently depending on sea ice conditions and depending upon the seawater temperatures.  And the chemical fingerprints of water vapor and precipitation are dependent upon whether it is autumn, winter, spring or summer; c) major atmospheric weather patterns; El Nino like events, called the Arctic Oscillation (low or high) are manifested across the Arctic Basin in divergent water vapor and precipitation chemical finger prints.\n\nOur findings have been published as part of several large overview papers and presented at national and international meetings so that we can inform others what we have learned about the Arctic.  And, our discoveries have been used in the classrooms and shared with students in our colleges and universities.\n\nIn summary: Our project has revealed the distinct fingerprinting of the Arctic?s water cycle throughout the year and the nuisances of its behaviour that is controlled in large part by the types and the distributions of sea ice across the Artic Basin and weather patterns that move moisture into, within and out of the Arctic.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/08/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey M Welker"
