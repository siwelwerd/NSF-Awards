 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This research explores the synthesis, structure, and properties of a new class of ceramics, i.e. compounds composed of metallic and non-metallic elements. Ceramic single crystal materials, where the atomic arrangement is the same throughout the bulk sample, are desirable because of their unique properties. Unfortunately, they are usually difficult to fabricate, requiring specialized equipment and very high temperatures. This project explores a novel solid-state method for growing a single crystal ceramic, starting from a mixture of two different ceramic compositions. The potential exists for the discovery of ceramic crystals with new and interesting properties for next generation structural and electronic applications.  Furthermore, the reverse process, i.e., changing from a single material to two distinct materials can be exploited to create composite materials that are microscopic mixtures of either different ceramics, or a metal and a ceramic. The scale and interconnectivity of these mixtures can be tailored to modify the overall physical properties. Students are undergoing training in advanced techniques encompassing both experimental and computational materials science. They will typically find employment in high tech industries or government/industrial laboratories. Associated outreach activities are directed towards encouraging K-12 students to pursue careers in science and engineering, with a particular emphasis on underrepresented groups. These efforts include the creation of bilingual educational modules, as well as participation in programs such as:  1) Materials Camps for high school students and teachers, 2) CHOICES (Charting Horizons and Opportunities In Careers in Engineering and Science), which is aimed at middle school girls, and 3) STAR (Students That Are Ready), which targets economically and academically disadvantaged and/or at-risk 8th to 12th grade students.  \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS:  Entropy-stabilized oxides are complex ceramics that are stable only above a certain critical temperature. To date, this material class has received little prior attention from the research community. Recently a new type of transformation was observed whereby bulk single crystal growth was induced by solid state synthesis, starting with a two-phase, polycrystalline precursor. Conversely, the eutectoid-like transformation of these materials when annealed below the critical temperature yields novel two-phase morphologies. The project combines experiment and an informatics-based modelling approach to seek a fundamental understanding of the transformation mechanisms. In particular, the research aims to identify the materials' parameters that together with the initial microstructure, define the morphological and textural evolution of the resultant structure. Graduate students and undergraduates are being trained in state-of-the art high temperature materials synthesis and characterization techniques, as well as modelling of nucleation and growth processes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The experimental component of this program involved the synthesis of a so-called entropy-stabilized ceramic (ESC), namely cobalt dititanate, that is stable at high temperatures and the characterization of the associated kinetics and microstructures. Cobalt dititanate is of technological interest as it belongs to a class of compounds having many diverse uses, such as thermal insulation and photocatalysts. More specifically, starting from a patterned substrate, we created a propagating product front that consumed the original reactants and then estimated the speed of this front. Moreover, by monitoring the amount of product phase produced, we have been able to characterize further the kinetics of the transformation, thereby providing additional insights into the mechanisms involved. These insights have been furthered by electron microscopic studies of the microstructures of the reactant and product phases that revealed important crystal orientation information. The complementary modeling component of this program utilizes computer simulation to describe atomic motion and subsequent reactions in polycrystalline systems. In particular, we extended a methodology to simulate reaction-diffusion processes at phase boundaries and were then able to determine how important kinetic parameters dictate the evolution of the reaction producing the product phase microstructure. These modeling studies were augmented with analytical work that elucidated the underlying mechanisms. The intellectual merit of this work is that we have identified critical processes and reaction parameters to form an ESC. The broader impacts of the work include outreach to the community in the form of an ASM Materials Camp at Lehigh University and a data science boot camp, the latter used to inculcate important machine learning skills in the next generation of researchers.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/22/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JeffreyMRickman\n"
