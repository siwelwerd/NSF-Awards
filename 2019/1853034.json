 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide the $4B/year cover lens market an economically viable material for the upcoming form-factor it must address: foldable displays. While this market size currently represents displays that employ rigid LCD or OLED technologies, major handset manufacturers are looking to move to highly differentiated form-factors such as foldable phones to gain market share in the competitive flagship smartphone tier. To do so, the entire display module must be foldable and one of the last components to allow for this behavior is the cover lens. Foldable displays therefore must eliminate hard, brittle materials such as glass and utilize materials with the same excellent scratch-resistant properties of glass, but with the flexibility and durability under folding of polymers. This project develops a novel polysulfide thermoset for this application.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop the first low-cost, high-performance foldable cover lens technology using polysulfide thermosetting polymer films. Currently, the amorphous polysulfide thermosets can yield the excellent optical properties and folding durability required for application in foldable display technologies. However, these materials are as of yet unable to meet the strict hardness requirement set by manufacturers looking to replace rigid glass cover lenses. In this work, the expansion of the polysulfide thermoset family of materials will be undertaken to introduce chemical and physical modifications which allow for the resultant thermosetting films to possess the requisite hardness. The resultant resin materials will then be converted using standard wet-film extrusion and curing tools commonly found in the printing industry, allowing for cost-competitive production of the resulting films.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In order to achieve this, Ares Materials focused on:</p>\n<p>- Obtaining a Marten's Hardness above 193</p>\n<p>- Obtaning a conversion rate for manufacturing &gt; 3m/min</p>\n<p>- Withstanding accelerated aging of 500hrs at 60C with 90%RH</p>\n<p>- Improving the formulation in order to pass&nbsp;200k cycles in the dynamic bending (R = 2 mm) test</p>\n<p>- Developing a baseline process and chemistry that would enable scale-up processes with mass production partners</p>\n<p>All this goals, without compromising the excelent optical properties that our chemistries offer in the first place.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During this project, the accelerated aging and scale up were the main challenges that Ares had to overcome.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For accelerated aging, the&nbsp;improvement was focused on the root-cause analysis of the hydrolysis in the damp heat environment. Even though acrylates in the formulation contain the ester groups that are susceptible to hydrolysis in theory, a short internal aging study on acrylate homopolymers revealed that the homopolymer made of the acrylate monomers used in the Pylux formulation can survive 60/90 accelerated aging test, but when the other component added to the formulation will not. Therefore, the primary suspect inthe hydrolisis was identified. The strategy was to introduce steric hindrance to reduce the rate of hydrolysis. This not only did not impact the film?s flexibility but improved the performance in the 60/90 accelerated aging test. Studies that elucidated the effects of antioxidant and anti-hydrolysis additives were executed, and the best candidates and their appropriate loadings in the resin were identified. These efforts have led us to the latest formulation that has the optical properties meeting the specs at the end of 500 hours of 60/90 accelerated aging and passes our internal standard.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On the other hand, for the mass production compatibility, the initial formulations were not compatible with our partner?s light source. The Photoinitiator we were originally using was designed using our in-house lamp, however, in our partner?s site, the lamp?s main output was different.</p>\n<p>The result was a poorly cured material that, while passing the optical and mechanical properties, was lacking on the 500hrs accelerated aging at 60C/90RH since the optical Haze would rapidly increase just after 48hrs. Ares modified the resin by tunning the type and amount of photoinitiator that reacts ad a broather range of wavelengths. After adding the photoinitiator we ran dose tests in order to keep the properties the client needed. After changing the PI, Ares was able to coat a 500m x 600mm roll with toll manufacturing partner. The samples passed the accelerated aging tests by keeping the haze and yellow index below 1%. Also, Ares performed an additive tuning enabling a faster coating of the material in the mass production facility. After the additive tunning, 7 m/s was achieved, and Ares Materials will run an additional test to confirm full curing at 10 m/s.</p>\n<p>We are currently confirming the production volumes required by our two initial commercial prospects ( one each in Japan and US), as well as product presentation and supply chain partners. Ares has already secured large volume chemical providers for all the required components of the approved formulations. We have made test runs with a toll manufacturer in Japan to scale our process to 500mm and 1.5m width rolls. Substantial effort has been geared towards making the formulation stable and repeatable when using production-rated equipment.&nbsp; Both commercial prospects are testing products from these facilities for their mass production processes.</p>\n<p>Another substantial effort was directed toward validating the compatibility with equipment that is used during the roll post-production.
