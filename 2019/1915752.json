 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for participation in the conference \"Operator Algebras in the Twenty-first Century\" held March 30-31, 2019 at the Department of Mathematics, University of Pennsylvania. The conference focuses on recent developments in analysis, especially in the field of operator algebras and its applications in physics. The conference aims to facilitate both the growth of the operator algebras field per se, as well as to inform non-specialists of the power of these methods for addressing questions outside of this field. Several distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference. This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, and researchers without other sources of funding an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference. \r\n\r\nOperator algebras provide a powerful perspective on problems throughout mathematics. This meeting will review some of the many accomplishments in this field, especially as related to the work of Richard V. Kadison, and their relationships to problems of current interest in mathematics and mathematical physics.  Topics include: relations with topological quantum field theory, advances in condensed matter physics, the Kadison-Singer conjecture, and elaboration of the non-commutative geometry paradigm, which places operator algebras at the center of problems in fields from geometry, to mathematical physics, to analytic number theory and beyond.\r\n \r\nMore information is available at the conference web site\r\nhttps://www.math.upenn.edu/~deturck/kadison-conference/index.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
