 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sea water has lots of marine bacteria. So, how do animals (sea urchins) that live in sea water protect themselves against infections?  Answers to this question apply to successful management of marine populations and productive aquaculture.  The sea urchin immune system lacks important aspects that are present in humans. For example, sea urchins do not produce antibodies. Instead, they express a family of anti-pathogen proteins called Transformer proteins (they change shape!).  At least one of the Transformer proteins acts very broadly, and can bind to bacteria, fungi, and other pathogens. This is very different from one antibody that binds only one target.  The hypothesis is that each Transformer protein has a slightly different repertoire of targets, which gives sea urchins great flexibility to protect themselves against pathogens with similar, different, or overlapping targets.  Because of the large variety of slightly different Transformer proteins, their complex anti-pathogen activities are likely essential for sea urchins to survive.  This project integrates research with education in the following manner. Artistic illustrations of science are effective for communicating science to the general public.  An Introductory Biology course will be designed and taught specifically for fine arts majors by faculty in Biology and the Arts.  Artist/scientist collaborations can improve whether people learn and understand important concepts in science, which will aid in science literacy.  Furthermore, improved science understanding by environmental policy students could have impacts on official government policy. \r\n\r\nSea urchins have a complex and robust anti-pathogen innate immune system comprised, in part, of SpTransformer (SpTrf; formerly Sp185/333) proteins.  The recombinant (r)SpTrf-E1 protein binds to Vibrio and yeast but not to Bacillus.  It binds LPS, beta-1,3-glucan, and flagellin, but not peptidoglycan.  rSpTrf-E1 is intrinsically disordered and transforms to alpha-helical in the presence of anionic targets such as PO4 groups.  The investigators predict that other versions of SpTrf proteins act similarly but recognize different but overlapping targets.  They will attempt to define the binding sites for rSpTrf-E1, define the targets bound by other rSpTrf proteins, determine whether other rSpTrf proteins undergo conformational transformation like (r)SpTrf-E1, and test the anti-pathogen activities of other SpTrf proteins in vitro and in vivo.  Outcomes are expected to clarify the binding and structural characteristics of the SpTrf proteins and their activities in host defense, providing a unique example of immunological adaptations by a basal deuterostome.  Art to illustrate science is an effective way for communicating science to the general public.  However, art students generally do not learn much in standard introductory science courses.  Hence, an Introductory Biology course will be designed and taught specifically for fine arts majors by faculty in Biology and the Arts.  The art inspiration will be the science learned from lectures, discussions, and contact with scientists.  Outcomes will highlight opportunities for artist/scientist collaborations such as improved data illustration, and for environmental science policy students to learn about important concepts in science, which may have impacts on official government policy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nSea water normally has a high concentration of marine bacteria, yet it is not well understood how marine invertebrates, such as sea urchins, protect themselves against infections and survive in the marine microbial soup. Answers to this question apply to success in management of marine populations for maintaining healthy marine ecosystems such as the kelp forests along the west coast. Kelp forests harbor a diverse community of organisms that includes abalone, fish, and sea otters among many other types of animals. Although the structure of kelp forests protects the shoreline by reducing wave impacts that may lead to shoreline changes during storms, kelp forests can also be altered by the sizes of local sea urchin populations because their favorite food is kelp. Investigations of their diseases that impacts directly their population sizes can result in understanding the changes in the structure of their marine habitat. Therefore, understanding the sea urchin immune system relates directly to their abilities to survive diseases both in nature and in aquaculture facilities. Sea urchin survival is directly associated with the success of aquaculture farm businesses, and reduces or eliminates the collection of wild animals with direct implications to ecosystem structure near the coastline. We know that the sea urchin immune system lacks many components and functions that are present in vertebrates including humans. For example, sea urchins do not produce antibodies, but instead, they express many proteins that are all generally similar but are also a little different and are called Transformer proteins (the proteins can transform their shape!). Transformer proteins stick to germs, or pathogens, that can infect sea urchins. When they stick to pathogens, they alert the immune cells in sea urchins that the pathogens are present and need to be eaten and destroyed. We know that one of the Transformer proteins can stick to several different types of pathogens, such as bacteria and fungi. This is very different from a single antibody in a person that binds to only a single pathogen. When the Transformer proteins bind to pathogens, they change their shape so that they also bind to the immune cells, which is the signal for those cells to eat and remove the infecting pathogens. We propose that when the pathogens have been removed, the remaining Transformer proteins bind to each other and then they bind to the immune cells, and are also removed. When the Transformer proteins bind to each other rather than to a pathogen, this is the signal for the immune cells stop making more Transformer proteins. The result is that the immune response is turned off, which is essential and just as important as turning on the immune response. Because each of the slightly different Transformer proteins may have a slightly different set of pathogens to which they can bind, the result is that immune system in sea urchins is very effective in protecting the animal against a wide range of potential pathogens in sea water. The effectiveness of the sea urchin immune system, that includes the essential anti-pathogen functions of the Transformer proteins, is demonstrated by most sea urchins that remain healthy in the sea water soup of microbes. These results relate directly to many types of sea urchins that survive to an estimated age of up to 100 years, and that they have inhabited the earth for an estimated 300 million years.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/27/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: L CourtneySmith\n"
