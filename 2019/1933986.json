 "awd_abstract_narration": "Natural or human-made activities that occur immediately above, on, or within the Earth impact humans and the physical environment over different time and spatial scales. Earth sciences offer information and approaches to understand, manage, and respond to those impacts. The long-term mission of the Board on Earth Sciences and Resources (BESR) to coordinate the Earth science issues of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM). The Board identifies opportunities to advance basic research and understanding of Earth processes for policy decisions, to report on applications of Earth sciences to important societal issues, and to address the overall health of research and education programs related to Earth sciences. By developing interdisciplinary activities aimed toward understanding how fundamental processes within the terrestrial system interact, the Board enables sharing and exchange of information among government agencies and entities; private, professional, non-governmental, and academic organizations; and the general public to continue raising the profile of science and increase public scientific literacy. Specific impacts following from the consensus study reports and other activities may include language that is input to congressional legislation, changes that are made to agency programs, organization, or priorities; information that is shared by professional or trade organizations through social media platforms, and news coverage of scientific issues.\r\n\r\nThe Board on Earth Sciences and Resources (BESR) is the focal point for Earth science activities at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM). The Board develops and oversees consensus studies and other activities that provide independent, objective scientific and technical information to the Earth science community, policy and decision makers in government, non-governmental organizations, the private sector, and the public. The Board manages a range of projects to advise the nation, advance dialogue, and connect thought and research leaders on a range of challenges with fundamental Earth science components. Through a variety of engagement platforms, products, and communication tools, the Board provides a unique and trusted interface among the Earth science research community, many stakeholders, and those in policy- and decision-making roles. This award enables the Board to conduct activities that develop and share Earth science information to inform and advise policy- and decision-making at multiple levels, across the nation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
