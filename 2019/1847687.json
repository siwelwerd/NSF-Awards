 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multiple Scales of Nitrogen Cycle in Oxygen Minimum Zones \r\n\r\nThe nitrogen cycle in the ocean is key to ocean productivity, carbon storage, and emissions of nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas, to the atmosphere. The chemical processes that connect nitrogen species in the ocean are sensitive to the amount of oxygen dissolved in seawater. These reactions become more intense within oxygen minimum zones ?areas of the ocean with little or no dissolved oxygen. Oxygen minimum zones are affected by currents that range in scale from hundreds to less than few kilometers. These currents create microhabitats where nitrogen cycling and nitrous oxide emissions are higher. This project investigates the interaction between small-scale ocean circulation, oxygen availability, and the nitrogen cycle. It uses a series of increasingly finer-scale numerical simulations of the Pacific Ocean, where two of the largest oxygen minimum zones are found. These simulations provide information about nitrogen transformations and nitrous oxide emissions on timescales from less than one year to several decades, and spatial scales from a few kilometers to the basin scale. This research will increase our ability to simulate and predict ocean responses to natural and human disturbances, with implications for society. The educational component of the project establishes a series of ocean-going chemical oceanography activities for approximately 100 undergraduate students at the University of California at Los Angeles each year. The field trips involve half-day cruises in the Santa Monica Bay, where students sample a variety of biogeochemical properties. Observations collected during the field trips will be used as a resource in classroom activities and student research projects. The field trips and educational materials offer opportunities to explore cutting-edge questions in ocean biogeochemistry, increase student interest in ocean sciences and access to research, and enhance student learning and self-efficacy, ultimately promoting retention in oceanography and STEM.\r\n\r\nOxygen minimum zones host major nitrogen transformations, including denitrification, anammox, and nitrous oxide production, which are essential for biogeochemistry and climate. These reactions are strongly partitioned along oxygen gradients in the suboxic range, making them sensitive to ventilation and chemical heterogeneity driven by variable ocean currents. However, the nature of this sensitivity is poorly understood. The objective of this project is to test the hypothesis that physical circulation at scales from tens of kilometers (mesoscale) to less than one kilometer (submesoscale) is critical in shaping these nitrogen cycle transformations. To test the hypothesis and investigate its implications, we will optimize a new model of the nitrogen cycle against a range of recent observations, and implement it in a realistic three-dimensional hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model. We will adopt a nesting strategy to downscale a Pacific-wide historical simulation to a series of regional domains at resolutions down to few kilometers or less, resolving the oxygen minimum zone boundaries and their fine-scale variability. By analyzing these model solutions, we will: (1) constrain the sensitivity of the microbial nitrogen cycle to oxygen, ventilation, and chemical heterogeneity; (2) in light of this sensitivity, quantify the role of mesoscale and submesoscale processes in shaping nitrogen transformations and transport across oxygen minimum zone boundaries; and (3) investigate the response of the nitrogen cycle to climate variability, in particular fixed-nitrogen losses and nitrous oxide emissions to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
