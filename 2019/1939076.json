 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since the dawn of computing, the world has tracked system performance. Yet, computer system performance data is still primarily siloed by benchmark, system, or system component. The thesis of this work is that most modern computing systems (and their corresponding performance) share a common ancestry. Moreover, this project marks the first scientific effort to catalog the lineage of computer system performance over time, namely, iLORE. iLORE will enable knowledge discovery and further understanding of the impact of computing innovations on transformative technologies, the knowledge-based economy, and societal change.\r\n\r\niLORE is an online, public repository enabling anyone to study correlations between computer system evolution and other transformative changes in the social and scientific disciplines. In this project, iLORE is being used to: 1) determine the influence of historical, transformative computer system performance designs on current technologies; 2) identify the confluence of innovation in computer system performance that led to the creation of knowledge-based economies (e.g., new industries such as cloud computing services); and 3) explore the juxtaposition of computer system performance evolution and societal phenomenon (e.g., decreases of women in computing since the 1970's, events surrounding the Arab spring since 2010).\r\n\r\nThe project involves faculty, graduate students, and more than a dozen undergraduates including 50% women and 20% from underrepresented groups. The investigators are mentoring undergraduate and graduate students year-round to create an inclusive, experiential learning environment that encourages risk taking and rewards contributors. All students are given opportunities to attend and present their research findings at highly selective international conferences. Research findings are also integrated in coursework taught by the researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
