 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project takes several forms.  The basic product enables new hands-on undergraduate instruction in advanced x-ray methods for use in development of electrical energy storage and catalysis systems. Next, upgraded versions of this product will open a new market for use of these x-ray methods in industrial quality control and expand the market for the same methods in specialized research in academia and national labs.  Likely applications include quality control for lithium-ion-battery components, research into catalysts and electrocatalysts in the clean energy sector, and rapid screening of engineered nanophases for many applications spanning from clean energy to consumer products.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed project addresses the core problem posed by the absence of entry-level capability for the advanced x-ray method known as x-ray absorption fine structure, or XAFS.  Here, by entry level, we mean suitable in cost and performance for use in undergraduate education in advanced instructional laboratories in chemistry, physics, chemical engineering and materials science, or similarly suitable for use in certain applications in industry and academia where very high access but relatively low technical capability is required.  We will build on existing prototype capabilities to develop miniaturized benchtop XAFS capability capable of attaching to an existing x-ray diffraction source.  Effort will include testing of different optical and detector components and work to decrease background scattering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
