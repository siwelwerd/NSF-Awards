The grant will support the following on-site requisite work:\r\n1)\tEvaluate existing vessels on Lake Tanganyika and their suitability for use as drilling ship, evaluate existing marine shipyards and their capabilities (dry dock, etc.) to modify vessels on the lake, and to develop a budget for these activities;\r\n2)\tEvaluate on-and off-shore housing for scientists and drillers and sites for a core laboratory;\r\n3)\tEvaluate smaller vessels and work boats on the lake to determine their suitability to serve as personnel and crew transport vessels, and determine costs for these;\r\n4)\tIdentify local contractors for fuel supply, personnel transport, food, banking, and other services, and obtain costsfor those services;\r\n5)\tObtain up-to-date information on research and drilling permitting procedures for Tanganyika.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
