 "awd_abstract_narration": "Humans evolved very large brains relative to their body size, with a remarkable enrichment of neurons in the cerebral cortex. Extensive efforts in anthropology have focused on delineating the adaptive pressures that led to these changes during human evolution. However, the genetic changes underlying human brain expansion have not been fully explored. This project will test hypotheses about human brain evolution by studying the impact of human genetic variation on brain development using experimental models. This research has broad implications for understanding what makes the human brain unique at the cellular and molecular levels, with translational value for medical treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders. During this research, undergraduate students pursuing careers in STEM will be mentored and trained in molecular biology and bioinformatics techniques in the laboratory. Research findings will be used as 1) an educational tool for spreading knowledge about human evolution and genetics with the general public, K-12 students, and undergraduate students, as well as 2) a motivational platform for the young, future women scientists in the Females Excelling More in Mathematics, Engineering and Science (FEMMES) Program. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research takes a multi-disciplinary approach to investigate how human evolutionary history has shaped the molecular and physiological mechanisms of human brain expansion. In the laboratory, human and non-human primate neural cells will be studied to explore how genetic variation evolved in humans to shape the developing brain. This project uses a combination of gene editing, RNA sequencing, and immunohistochemistry to determine the functional role of human-specific genetic sequence during brain development that corresponds to changes in brain size. These findings will advance the understanding of the molecular evolution of the human brain.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Research in anthropology has helped delineate the adaptive pressures on brain expansion during our evolution. However, the genetics underlying human brain expansion, favored by natural selection, have not been well-explored. Prime candidates for the evolution of human brain expansion are genes that are unique to humans, disrupted in neurodevelopmental disorders, and expressed in neural progenitor cells (NPCs)?the cells that build the brain by determining the number of neurons. In this study, we investigate the function of candidate NBPF genes, which have expanded in number in primate genomes and exceptionally in the human genome (Figure 1). This project experimentally tests hypotheses about human molecular origins by investigating the impact of human-specific genes on the development of the human cerebral cortex as well as establish a functional model for studying brain evolution.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human and chimpanzee&nbsp;<em>in vitro</em>&nbsp;brain organoids?3D structures differentiated from stem cells that mimic&nbsp;<em>in vivo</em>&nbsp;brains?provide an unprecedented opportunity to generate functional data on how human-specific genetic changes shape the developing brain. Here, we used a two-step strategy to investigate the genetics of human cortical expansion: 1) gene editing to evaluate the effect of rapidly evolved human-specific genes in human brain organoids, and 2) genetic introduction of human genes into chimpanzee organoids to identify developmental mechanisms that determine cortex size.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Expression of NBPF proteins has changed throughout primate evolution, resulting in novel expression of human NBPF proteins in NPCs. In this study, we found that NBPF proteins localize to the cytoplasm in human NPCs and show peak expression at microtubules during cell division (Figure 2). Compared to human NPCs, chimpanzee NPCs express very low levels of NBPF protein. We found evidence that NBPF proteins interact with each other, as well as other proteins that are important for cytoskeleton dynamics and communication with the extracellular matrix in human NPCs (Figure 3). Disruption to these aspects of cell biology during brain development can lead to clinical microcephaly (abnormally small brain).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Dynamic balance between NPC proliferation and differentiation informs neuronal identity and number. To investigate the role of human-specific&nbsp;NBPF&nbsp;in brain development, we used CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing to deplete the expression of&nbsp;NBPF protein&nbsp;in NPCs. Using human brain organoid models, we observed a significant decrease in the number of proliferating cells, resulting in smaller organoids (Figure 4). In addition, NPCs in NBPF-depleted organoids started to differentiate to neurons earlier than control organoids, which acts to reduce the number of total neurons. Altogether, our findings support the hypothesis that NBPFs in human brain development influence NPC activity that is important to build a human brain.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Findings from this work have important implications for addressing interdisciplinary questions about human brain evolution as well as the role of NBPF proteins in neurodevelopmental disorders.
