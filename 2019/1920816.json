 "awd_abstract_narration": "A request is made to fund Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) for R/V Roger Revelle, a 273? general purpose Global vessel. The ship is owned by Navy and operated by Scripps Institution of Oceanography as part of the US Academic Research Fleet (ARF). The ship supports multidisciplinary oceanographic research in all the world?s ocean basins. \r\n\r\nIn 2018, REVELLE completed 262 days, 181 (69%) of which were for NSF. In 2019, Revelle is currently scheduled with 86 days, 72 (84%) of which are for NSF. The reason there are so few days is that Revelle plans to spend most of the year in drydock undergoing a mid-life refit. Much of the equipment proposed here would be installed during this period.\r\n\r\nThe prioritized SSSE request includes the following:\r\n\r\nScience refrigeration machinery \t$197,492\r\nIntercom & dial telephone\t$411,854\r\nPublic address system\t$239,030\r\nWide throat sheaves \t$121,069\r\nReduce fan noise on deck\t$143,109\r\nWork boat outboard engines\t$16,240\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t$1,128,794\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project supported the acquisition of shipboard equipment used aboard oceanographic research vessels that conduct research and education projects sponsored by the National Science Foundation.  Four specific items were supported by this award: 1) three wide-mouth sheaves for mooring and other overboarding operations aboard R/V Roger Revelle, Sally Ride and the UNOLS-NSF West Coast Winch Pool; 2) replacement outboard engines for the work boat aboard Roger Revelle; 3) Generator room fan machinery aboard Roger Revelle; and 4) scientific refrigeration machinery aboard Roger Revelle.\n\nIntellectual merit:  The engineering design and equipment funded under this grant significantly enhance the safety and utility of the infrastructure for sea-going research.  This project contributes to advancing the safety and utility of NSF-supported oceanographic research vessels by ensuring that ships in the US Academic Research Fleet are designed, equipped and maintained at a high level of safety such that they are fit to handle the perils imposed by ocean expeditionary science missions. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project is amplified by the combined merit of research projects undertaken aboard NSF-supported ships.  Sustaining the capability of research vessels by continuous improvement is fundamental to the success of the US oceanographic research enterprise, enabling a broad range of discovery in the earth and life sciences.\n\nAt Scripps and throughout the U.S. oceanographic research community, the observation, measurement, and collection of samples and data are accomplished on a global scale by operations aboard seagoing research vessels.  Research vessels in the Academic Research Fleet have played a critical role in the exploration of our planet, and continue to contribute significantly to the US ocean research effort.  Shipboard research offers the transformative potential to understand global change and monitor the health of ocean ecosystems on which human well-being may ultimately depend.   \n\nBroader impacts:  The spectrum of research projects enabled by these improvements to NSF-supported research vessels collectively achieves far-reaching broader impacts through the enhancement of infrastructure that is critical to the promotion of training and learning, increasing the participation of underrepresented groups in research, advancing scientific and technological understanding and informing policy making for the benefit of society. \n\nFor example, research and research training are fundamental elements of the SIO mission that benefit significantly from the proposed improvements.  Since 1903, Scripps has awarded more than 1,500 PhD and MS degrees to women and men from more than 47 countries.  Our alumni include a college president, five college deans, 21 academic directors, 234 tenure-track professors at 93 universities in 19 countries, and 142 research scientists at 32 universities in 12 countries.  In the five-year period ending in 2018, 1,029 graduate students, 747 undergraduate students, and 32 K-12 and college educators obtained first-hand experience at sea aboard SIO-operated research vessels.  Practical experience aboard research vessels is a cornerstone of SIO\u2019s exemplary research training program, and this experience has contributed to the Institution\u2019s success in producing outstanding new research scientists.  As shared-use resources for the U.S. oceanographic research community, SIO-operated vessels host scientists from throughout the country, and contribute similarly to the education and training missions of other institutions.\n\nAs a charter member of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS), SIO is actively involved in coordinating research vessel operations with scientists and funding agencies so that our capabilities can best meet current and anticipated research needs of the entire community.  SIO is committed to providing the best possible access to the sea to the broad U.S. research community.  The improvements carried out during the course of this grant ensure that NSF-supported research vessels continue to serve the U.S. scientific community by safely, capably and efficiently carrying out our mission to advance our understanding of the oceans, climate, and Earth.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/27/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bruce Appelgate"
