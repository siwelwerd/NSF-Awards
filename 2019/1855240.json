 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemical Synthesis program of the NSF Division of Chemistry is supporting the research of Professor Timothy Lash at Illinois State University to explore the synthesis, characterization, and reactivity of compounds that resemble a class of molecules called \"porphyrins\". Porphyrins possess many valuable properties and have applications in material science, catalysis and medicine. They also have an impressive array of functions in nature that range from oxygen transportation to photosynthesis. Porphyrins contain 4 nitrogen atoms, and related systems, called carbaporphyrins, have a carbon atom in place of one of the nitrogens. These molecules often have properties that complement those of naturally occurring porphyrins. The supported work is leading to efficient routes to novel carbaporphyrins and related systems that have unique reactivity and spectroscopic properties. Access to new classes of porphyrin analogues are improving our understanding of fundamental chemistry concepts such as aromaticity, a fundamental concept in chemistry which can lead to the enhanced stability of molecules. Furthermore, these types of structures commonly form stable complexes with palladium, rhodium and other important metal catalysts. Professor Lash and his students are studying applications of these molecules in the preparation of fine chemicals, as these derivatives modify the catalytic activity of bound metals. In addition, related compounds are being explored for use as photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy. These projects are not only providing an excellent environment for training undergraduates and Master's level graduate students in the field of organic synthesis, they are also exposing these students to the multidisciplinary nature of modern scientific research.\r\n\r\nIn this research, synthetic routes to new porphyrin-like systems, including phenaliporphyrins, quiniporphyrins and carbachlorins, are being developed. Further application of the \"3 + 1\" variant of the MacDonald reaction is providing structures that incorporate phenalene, quinoline and numerous related heterocyclic units. The competition between aromatic hydroxyporphyrinoids and nonaromatic keto-tautomers can be particularly insightful, and these processes are being probed using spectroscopic techniques. True chlorins are widely studied, in part because they show the potential for applications as photosensitizers. Carbachlorins, which contain a carbocyclic ring in place of one of the pyrrole units, are generally more stable than the parent tetrapyrrolic structures and may have equally useful properties. However, carbachlorins have been little studied to date, and the development of new routes to these dihydroporphyrinoids will be of significant value. The introduction of fused aromatic rings onto carbaporphyrin structures offers the opportunity to further modify the properties of these compounds, and a new methodology to prepare carbaporphyrins with fused naphthalene, anthracene and related structural units is being developed. This approach is also being applied to be synthesis of larger dimeric systems that are expected to exhibit strong electronic interactions upon protonation. Hence, these investigations are revealing important new porphyrinoid systems and will have a major impact in the field of Porphyrin Chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

They are virtually ubiquitous in nature, including heme, the red pigment in blood, and the chlorophylls, the green photosynthetic pigments in plants, and this has led to them being described as the &ldquo;pigments of life&rdquo;. Porphyrins possess many valuable characteristics and have found many diverse applications, ranging from medicine (e.g., as photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy (PDT)) to catalysis and material science. Furthermore, porphyrins have robust properties arising in part from the nonbenzenoid aromatic character imbued by their electronic structures. Given the remarkable properties of this system, related structures have been targeted for investigation. By modifying the porphyrin framework, questions about the origin of porphyrinoid aromaticity can be addressed and unique metalated derivatives can be prepared. In our studies, modifications to these structures have been investigated, including core modification, ring fusion, alkylation and reduction. Combinations of these factors leads to further profound and often insightful changes. Carbaporphyrins, structures that replace one or more of the interior nitrogen atoms with carbon, range from fully aromatic structures to nonaromatic or even antiaromatic species. Benziporphyrins, which have a six-membered ring subunit derived from benzene, are nonaromatic but the presence of an internal OH group led to an isomerization to give a highly unusual antiaromatic structure. Carbaporphyrins form metalated derivatives with many catalytically active metals such as palladium. In an attempt to form palladium complexes of tropiporphyrins, analogues that have seven-membered carbocyclic rings, a remarkable ring contraction was observed that produced palladium(II) benziporphyrins. New examples of porphyrin-like structures can be obtained by introducing new cyclic subunits using a &lsquo;3 + 1&rsquo; strategy where a dialdehyde is reacted with a tripyrrolic intermediate. A quinolizone dialdehyde was used to prepare a new class of porphyrinoids named &ldquo;oxyquinoliziniporphyrins&rdquo;. The structures have intermediary properties between fully aromatic carbaporphyrins and nonaromatic benziporphyrins and therefore provide valuable insights. These novel system readily formed organometallic derivatives with nickel(II) and palladium(II) salts. Chlorins, a reduced form of porphyrin found in chlorophylls, have strong absorptions in the red that can find applications in the development of photosensitizers for PDT. A strategy was developed to prepare chlorin analogues of carbaporphyrins. Initially, chlorin-type structures with embedded azulene rings were prepared. Azulene introduces a fused seven-membered ring, but this underwent a ring contraction in the presence of peroxides to give benzene-fused carbachlorins and, as anticipated, these derivatives gave strong long wavelength absorptions between 676 and 684 nm. Another strategy for modifying the porphyrin framework is to introduce a second core modification. Examples of telluracarbaporphyrins (structures with a carbon and a tellurium atom within the core) were prepared and this system proved to be prone to air oxidation. The presence of a large tellurium atom resulted in severe distortion of the macrocycle, but the system retained strong aromatic properties. Remarkably, the structure could still accommodate a palladium(II) cation to form a stable organometallic complex. Alkylation of the carbaporphyrin core was accomplished by direct alkylation or by directed synthesis using tripyrrane intermediates with N-methyl substituents. The presence of internal alkyl groups altered the coordination chemistry for these structures. In addition, incorporation of palladium(II) led to migration of N-alkyl substituents onto the internal carbon atom. The resulting complexes relocate the pi-electron pathway enabling extended conjugation. Carbaporphyrins with fused benzene, naphthalene and anthracene units were prepared, alkylated with methyl iodide and reacted with palladium(II) acetate. The resulting complexes possessed 22, 26 and 30 pi electron circuits, all of which fulfill the criteria for aromaticity. However, an unexpected trend was observed where the degree of aromaticity decreased with increasing pi-conjugation. This type of result demonstrates that much remains to be learned about these intriguing structures. This was further illustrated for a series of porphyrin analogues with fused tropone units. In these structures nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy gave seemingly contradictory results as the observed signals for the internal protons indicated increased aromatic character, whereas the inner protons gave values suggesting a significant reduction is these properties. Further investigations are in progress to better assess these results. Overall, substantial progress has been made on the synthesis, reactivity and spectroscopic properties of new porphyrin-like systems that may lead to applications in the future. These studies have allowed many undergraduate students to be trained to work in the area of synthetic organic chemistry and three MS theses were completed with support from this grant.
