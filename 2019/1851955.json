 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is jointly funded by the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites program in the SBE Directorate and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). It has both scientific and societal benefits and integrates research with education. The REU in the study of Disparities in the Criminal Justice System (DCJS) at the University of South Carolina brings together an academically gifted and diverse group of students to work on innovative projects with graduate students and faculty to learn the research process and produce publishable products from the findings. The projects focus on how race/ethnicity, class, and gender shape the involvement of juveniles or adults in criminal offending, and how these factors are connected to decisions made within the criminal justice system, including the implementation of policies meant to address crime.  They also examine how and why these disparities are occurring and the impact on individuals, families, and communities. Given the small percentage of minority students currently pursuing graduate degrees and entering the criminology field, increasing the diversity of students in academe adds new perspectives to research and contributes to the types of research questions being asked in the discipline. The knowledge and skills acquired from the research experience is beneficial both for students considering graduate school and those who plan to become lawyers, practitioners, and policymakers.\r\n \r\n The DCJS-REU site provides an opportunity for undergraduate students to learn about research in their field of interest, develop their academic and research skills, and expose them to the possibility of pursuing a graduate degree. The team-based structure of the program, as well as the planned academic and social activities, are designed to foster long-term working relationships between faculty and students. The main objective of this REU site is to provide program participants with opportunities to ask compelling research questions and recognize how studies can inform our understanding of crime and criminal justice system policies. The five explicit aims are: (1) to target for participation underrepresented undergraduate students; (2) to expose students to the research process through mentoring from faculty; (3) to offer students opportunities to learn how to disseminate research findings; (4) to enhance learning and skill development through discipline-specific training, university workshops, and interactions with criminal justice professionals; and (5) to successfully prepare students to apply to and attend graduate programs in criminology/criminal justice or related fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The DCJS-REU site provided an opportunity for students to learn about the research in their field of interest, develop their academic and research skills, and exposed them to the possibility of pursuing a graduate degree. The 26 undergraduate students selected to participate in the DCJS-REU program came from different parts of the country and comprised a diverse group of students (i.e., 50% first generation, 69% female, 31% African American, 23% Hispanic). They brought unique perspectives and lived-experiences to each other and what was being studied as part of their team projects. Increasing the diversity of the pool of students and potential graduate students studying crime in the United States led to important advances in understanding and addressing the crime problem in the United States. Different research questions were asked and answered by individuals who are currently underrepresented in the criminology and criminal justice field or related fields (e.g, sociology, psychology). DCJS-REU participants focused on a wide range of issues including homicides by law enforcement, death row individuals, incarcerated mothers, domestic violence victims, firearm violence, courts and decision-making, and allocation of funding for law enforcement. They learned about the research process first hand by working on team projects and being mentored by faculty members and graduate students. REU participants demonstrated increased confidence in their research skills and knowledge at the end of the 10-week summer program. Students increased their confidence pre- and post- REU in writing literature reviews (36% increased to 96%), reviewing relevant literature (44% to 100%), crafting research questions (48% to 96%), measuring theoretical concepts (28% to 71%), Selecting study samples (48% to 100%), and presenting their research (56% to 92%). REU participants were also more confident in terms of using library resources (84% increased to 100%), avoiding plagiarism (80% to 96%), distinguishing between qualitative and quantitative methods (68% to 96%), identifying ethical issues (80% to 96%), and writing a research paper (64% to 83%). The perspectives of underrepresented individuals are important to understanding crime and the criminal justice system, yet this is lacking in our field given the small number of individuals of color pursuing graduate degrees and entering academia. One objective of the DCJS-REU site was to successfully prepare students to apply and attend graduate programs in criminology or related fields. Pre- and post-REU program surveys of participants on their future plans on specific educational objectives after completion of their undergraduate degrees found an increase in plans to obtain a PhD degree in criminology and criminal justice (44% increased to 68%). The plans of students remained unchanged or decreased, however, for other educational objectives including pursuing a Masters degree in criminology (56% vs. 55%), a Masters degree (44% vs. 23%) or PhD degree in a different field (36% vs. 31%), and obtaining a Law degree (28% vs. 23%). Of those REU participants who have graduated with an undergraduate degree (14 students of the 26), 50% are currently pursuing graduate degrees (i.e., MA/MS, PhD, Law) in either Sociology/Criminology, Criminal Jusice, Law and Psychology, School Psychology, Counseling Psychology, or Law. In total, they have received funding support of approximately $875,000. Pre- and post-REU program survey results of students' plans for future employment indicated an increase in the reporting of pursuing a research position (56% increase to 76%) and in pursuing a criminal justice professional position (44% to 64%), and a slight increase in the reporting of pursuing a government position (42% increase to 45%). There was however, a slight decrease in plans to pursue an academic or university position (58% to 55%). The knowledge and skills acquired from the DCJS-REU research experience contributed to students' understanding of the value behind evidence based practices, which is important for those considering graduate school and academe or research, but also to those who become criminal justice professionals.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/27/2023<br>\nModified by: Barbara&nbsp;Koons-Witt</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
