 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF award will primarily support students and Post-Doctoral researchers travel to  IMCS 2020 conference.  The International Meeting on Chemical Sensors (IMCS) will be held on Montreal May 10-14th 2020.  This meeting will be the 18th in the series of international meetings that were initiated in 1983 in Fukuoka, Japan. The IMCS meetings are interdisciplinary covering all aspects of chemical and biosensors for gases, vapors and liquids.  Sensor technology is widely applied to human medical diagnostics and health and fitness monitoring. The demand for environment sensing and development of sensor technology to determine the effects on human and animal health are critically important. In addition, with recent developments in changing weather patterns, and the impact of green-house gases and their adverse effects on the environment. We anticipate sweeping changes to the application of sensors to medicine, air quality monitoring, food safety and water quality in the near future. \r\n\r\nThe objective of the International Meeting on Chemical Sensors (IMCS) held on Montreal May 10-14th 2020 is to bring researchers together at all levels (MS/PhD/undergraduate students, post-docs, early career, and senior researchers) from diverse field to present and discuss new development and cutting-edge tools related to all aspects of chemical sensing technology. In particular: (1) to provide an opportunity to new and established researchers in their fields to develop collaborations across disciplines, (2) to facilitate networking and career-building opportunities for the younger researchers, and (3) to enhance participation of women and under-represented minority groups in this field. This conference in particular will be of great benefit due to the interdisciplinary nature of chemical and biosensing. Bringing the scientists and engineers together for a four day meeting under beautiful surroundings in Montreal, it will foster interactions amongst Chemical Engineers, Bioengineers, Chemists, Electrical Engineers, Mechanical Engineers, Materials Scientists, Computer Engineers and business involved in sensor and sensor related technology. The conference provides opportunity for young scientists and engineers to build their careers, by interacting in person with colleagues, including more senior researchers.  The meeting is strive to promote diversity of participants of students and post-doctoral researchers. In providing travel support, priority will be given to women, young researches and underrepresented minorities, who might not be able to attend for financial reasons. The past participants at IMCS have come from these different disciplines and from over 35 countries around the world. The plan for the meeting includes four plenary talks, approximately 40 invited talks, in addition to oral papers and posters. Speakers will be selected from submitted abstracts. The IMCS meeting will be advertised through ACS publications, ECS publications and mailing lists in addition to web pages for the meeting program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
