 "awd_abstract_narration": "Integration is widely discussed in the context of immigration, yet there have been few studies that explore precisely what integration means to both immigrants and the long-term, native residents. Even less studied is what integration means within rural communities, since immigration rates to these communities typically are not large enough to constitute sites that would be generalizable. In exploring a context  where small, rural communities experience relatively high rates of immigration, this research examines the activities and services that both natives and immigrants incorporate into their communities for integration and analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of those strategies. Data about how both native residents and immigrants identify integration and the best methods to achieve it will advance anthropological science and assist policymakers, social service agencies, and other groups dealing with the effects of immigration into rural areas at local, national, and international levels. Project data and outcomes have the potential to inform and strengthen policies related to immigration.\r\n \r\nThis research involves two three-month-long periods of anthropological fieldwork over three years and takes place in villages within six different rural areas. These villages vary in terms of economic base, population size, history of immigration, and percentage of immigrant population allowing for comparable contexts. The size and social structure of the villages allows for the use of snowball technique to solicit participants, leading to a high percentage of the population being interviewed through both individual and focus group conversations. The research team also conducts participant observation in social interaction venues. Resulting data is analyzed using Grounded Theory and Discourse Analysis methodologies, and outcomes include public presentations, conference papers, publications, and reports to U.S. and Arctic governments.  Results from this research will be useful for people living in small, rural communities, both within and outside the Arctic as they integrate immigrants into their villages.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
