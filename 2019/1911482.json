 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part I\r\nEntry level math courses in college often form a roadblock for STEM-intended students, particularly when students do not test directly into Calculus when they enter college. This is certainly true at The University of Texas at Arlington (UTA), an access-oriented university, and remains a challenge faced by universities across the country. Calculus is the first mathematics course in all natural science degree plans at UTA; however, Algebra or Precalculus are common mathematics entry points for STEM-intended majors especially those who begin their major through nontraditional pathways. In spring of 2018, 48% of all UTA undergraduate students entered UTA as transfer students, and 42% of all UTA undergraduates were first generation students. Given these statistics, and the fact that the proposed work will directly affect ~1000 students per semester at UTA taking College Algebra and Precalculus, this project will have an enormous impact on a diverse population of at-risk students who aspire to graduate with a STEM degree, but are also largely unaware of opportunities in the geosciences. We will recast College Algebra concepts in the context of societally relevant Earth Science themes without changing the content of the current course. In this way, we will empower beginning STEM students by placing abstract mathematical concepts in a scientific context at a critical transition which constitutes statistically a major stumbling block for many of STEM-intended majors. This is a new strategic partnership, as the geosciences incorporate research methods from across all of STEM and are therefore likely to be relatable to a broad range of STEM-intended students. At the same time, it will expose students early in their college experience to geoscience as a potential major or career. Success of the project will be determined by monitoring D-F-W rates of this course, evaluate students? perceptions of the geosciences and confidence in mathematics, and tracking students through declaration of their major and beyond. We will test the transferability of this model by implementing it in the Precalculus course at UTA during the second year of this continuing project and using the College Algebra redesign in the equivalent course at Tarrant County College in Fort Worth, Texas to gauge its effectiveness and transferability across institutions.\r\n\r\nPart II\r\nAt The University of Texas at Arlington (UTA), mathematics courses leading to Calculus constitute a major obstruction to success for alarming numbers of STEM-intended majors. This fact reflects a challenge faced by universities across the country. Our goals are to (1) improve success of intended STEM majors at UTA in mathematics courses that lead to Calculus, courses taken primarily by STEM-intended majors, but yielding D-F-Withdraw rates >60%, and (2) introduce first and second year students to the geosciences and related career pathways before they decide on a major, thereby increasing the number and diversity of students who choose to major in the geosciences. We will do this by first modifying College Algebra by integrating geoscience concepts into the mathematics curriculum and lab components, reaching approximately 1,000 students per semester at UTA. Video presentations featuring current research of faculty, students, and geoscientists in industry and related fields will motivate a societally relevant Earth Science theme and delineate how a particular algebraic skill is essential for his/her research or job. Concepts introduced in these videos will be developed and incorporated into homework assignments, challenge problems, and lab exercises involving problem-solving activities that synthesize mathematical concepts and apply the concepts to problems related to the Earth Science theme. In this way, the mathematical abstraction will be connected with geoscience content crossing the fields of geophysics, environmental geochemistry, hydrogeology and oceanography. This is a strategic partnership, as the geosciences incorporate research methods from across all of STEM and are therefore likely to be relatable to a broad range of STEM-intended students. This collaboration will empower beginning STEM students by placing abstract mathematical concepts in a scientific context at a critical transition, which constitutes statistically a major stumbling block for many STEM-intended majors. At the same time, it will expose students early in their college experience to geoscience as a potential major or career. This project is possible by building upon a new partnership between the School of Earth Science at The Ohio State University and Mathematics at UTA. Success of the project will be determined by monitoring D-F-W rates of this course, evaluate students? perceptions of the geosciences and confidence in mathematics, and tracking students through declaration of their major and beyond. We will test the transferability of this model by implementing it in the Precalculus course at UTA during the second year of this continuing project and using the College Algebra redesign in the equivalent course at Tarrant County College in Fort Worth, Texas to gauge its effectiveness and transferability across institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nIn 2019, The Ohio State University (OSU) and the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) received a GP-IMPACT collaborative award entitled \"Integrating Geoscience to Engage Majors with Mathematics: iGEM2.\" It constituted a collaboration between geoscientists at OSU and mathematicians at UTA to 1) improve success of intended STEM majors at UTA in mathematics courses that lead to Calculus and 2) introduce beginning STEM-intended students at UTA to the geosciences and related career pathways before they decide on a major, thereby increasing the number and diversity of students who choose a major in the geosciences.\n\n\nDeveloping curriculum that integrates geoscience research into mathematics Undergraduate students often find prerequisite introductory mathematics courses to be a barrier to STEM majors such as the geosciences. Through this partnership between Earth scientists and mathematicians, we created modified problem sets, lab exercises, and educational videos for two introductory mathematics courses (undergraduate College Algebra and Precalculus) offered at UTA, a large, urban, Hispanic-serving R1 public university. Existing content from these introductory mathematics courses was modified to include how Earth scientists use and apply the mathematical concepts. By exposing STEM-intended majors to geoscience applications of mathematical concepts in these mathematics courses taken during a critical transition point in their undergraduate careers, the project aimed to improve students' success in the courses, simultaneously increasing their math self-efficacy and improving their perceptions of geosciences.\n\n\nAssessment of the curricular modifications using pre-course and post-course surveys that measured student attitudes toward mathematics, self-efficacy in mathematics, attitudes toward science, perceptions of geosciences, and knowledge about science and geoscience jobs showed subtle improvements in student awareness for the geosciences. Results from College Algebra student survey responses indicated that most students, particularly underrepresented students, value careers that have potential to help people, society, and the environment. The surveyed students care little about working outdoors, and know little about what a career in geoscience entails. These results were reported in the peer-reviewed journal Communications Earth & Environment where we argued that better informing students about the altruistic potential of geoscience careers would be an effective strategy to broaden recruitment.\n\n\nInstructors of the mathematics courses with the curricular modifications reported a high level of collaborative learning when students engaged in the geoscience problem solving labs in class and the natural fit of the embedded homeworks and labs. Student performance did not decline in the courses with the modified curriculum, however, due to unforeseen changes implemented to the mathematics courses during the study period which included the COVID-19 pandemic, the study methodology did not allow for attributing gains in student success in these mathematics courses to the changes in the curricular materials developed and implemented in this project.\n\n\nWhile the project was not able to attribute significant patterns in students choosing to change their major to the inclusion of geoscience themes in the applied mathematics problems, insight was gained into how these mathematics courses impacted students' choice of major. Of the student participants in the precalculus course with matched pre-course and post-course surveys, a theme in their free-responses arose indicating that students were not likely to consider changing their major after taking the precalculus course unless they encountered a great deal of the struggle in the course. That is, it was negative experiences in the course that were more likely to impact them to make a change in their major, rather than a positive experience with the course content.\n\n\nSummary: Project iGEM2 created innovative curricular materials that meaningfully incorporate geoscience contexts into college mathematics courses that lead to calculus, allowing for STEM-intended majors to gain exposure to geoscience concepts while building their mathematics knowledge. The process of creating these materials induced the development of an inventive interdisciplinary collaboration between mathematicians and geoscientists.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ElizabethGriffith\n"
