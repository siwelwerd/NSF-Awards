 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) program will support the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need at the Community College of Baltimore County (CCBC) Essex and Catonsville campuses. This project aims to award a total of 250 semester-long scholarships, to at least 50 academically talented STEM undergraduates with financial need. The objectives are to: a) recruit, enroll, graduate and/or transfer increased numbers of students in targeted STEM associate degree programs; (b) develop a community of students and faculty with related interests, and create a support system that will encourage social and academic interaction through teambuilding exercises, study groups, and research projects; and (c) strengthen ties with local industry and four-year institutions to ease transfer from CCBC students into the workplace and/or further education.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to generate new knowledge about the role of math acceleration on associate degree completion, transfer, and baccalaureate degree attainment of STEM students. It is guided by scholarly literature about student success that emphasizes the role of a faculty mentor to provide academic and professional advising for each awardee. The targeted degree programs include Math, Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Science, Geospatial Applications, Engineering and Computer Science.  Scholar selection criteria and faculty mentors in these programs have been identified, along with plans for the successful transfer of awardees to four-year institutions or the workplace. Awardees will work with the Growth Sector firm to secure an optional internship provided by business, government, or academic research partners. A half-time Student Support Specialist will provide wrap-around services including referral to other resources. Recruitment efforts focus on high school students in Baltimore County Public Schools and currently enrolled CCBC students in their mathematics and introductory science courses. The project encourages awardees to transfer to a four-year institution for a baccalaureate degree in one of the identified fields by designating up to 20 percent of the scholarship funds to follow students who have earned an associate degree or 45 credits from CCBC when they transfer.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
