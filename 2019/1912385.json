 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. This project at Spelman College will transform the organic lab curriculum by providing a learning experience that fosters science identity in black women. This curriculum will provide guided inquiry experiments supplemented by culturally relevant activities and instructional materials to engage, motivate, and improve student outcomes related to identity development processes and academic performance. \r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this project is to improve the academic performance of students while simultaneously empowering and affirming their role as scientists. The specific aims are to: 1) revise the first semester organic chemistry laboratory by developing and implementing guided inquiry modules that contain culturally relevant instructional materials, 2) characterize the impact of the modules on students beliefs about science, beliefs about their role as a scientist, their motivation to study chemistry, and their mastery of experimental techniques and concepts and 3) assess the implementation of the modules based on faculty and student feedback. The modules will be developed by a faculty working group consisting of organic chemistry and social science faculty. This project will impact over 350 students from Spelman College and the materials developed from the project will allow for adaptation beyond Spelman. The findings from this work will contribute to the understanding of diversity initiatives in STEM and serve as an inclusive curricular model to prepare women and minorities that go on to graduate school or the STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
