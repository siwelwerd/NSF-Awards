 "awd_abstract_narration": "The inaugural Association for Computing Machinery Symposium on Computer Science and Law (ACM CSLAW-19) will be held in October 2019, in New York City. By launching efforts in this nascent field of study, the symposium will have impact on a broad range of societal issues, ranging from online security and privacy to Internet platform regulation to digital intellectual property protection.  This award provides full or partial support for approximately 20 students to attend the symposium.  A subcommittee of the symposium program committee will select a diverse group of students for travel support, based on applications in which students explain their interest in Computer Science and Law and the ways in which they expect the symposium to further their educational and professional development, and advisors address the quality of the students' work and the reason that travel support is needed for attendance.\r\n\r\nThe scope of the ACM CSLAW-19 symposium includes: Security, privacy, encryption, and surveillance; Cyber espionage, cyber war, and cyber diplomacy; Cyber crime, cyber law enforcement, and digital forensics; Freedom of expression online (or the lack thereof); Online market structure, platform monopolies, and antitrust law; Online government services; Digital intellectual property; Legal informatics; Automation of legal reasoning and legal services; Fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics (FATE) in machine learning and data mining; Methodological compatibility and incompatibility between the discipline of computer science and the discipline of law; Educational imperatives and existing educational programs in Computer Science and Law.  The main expected outcome of the symposium is a comprehensive report on the findings of break-out-group discussions.  The report will explicate a rich agenda for research, practice, education, and fostering the interdisciplinary area of Computer Science and Law and make concrete suggestions about how the research community, ACM, funding agencies, universities, the technology industry, and other interested institutions can help advance this agenda.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
