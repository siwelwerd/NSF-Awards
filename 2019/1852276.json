 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the California Academy of Sciences, located in San Francisco, CA, will support the training of 10 students for 9 weeks during the summers of 2019? 2021. Research will primarily be conducted at the Academy and at local field sites in Sonoma County, CA. The Academy's Institute for Biodiversity Science and Sustainability is a research hub focused on understanding the natural world and finding solutions to sustaining it. The institution houses world-class natural history research collections, along with modern day technology and genomics tools needed to study these specimens. Participants of the Summer Systematics Institute will begin the summer with fieldwork and immersive workshops, before returning to the Academy to be paired with mentors, who are curators in the Institute, to work on original research projects and attend seminars which provide tools in the field of systematics and phylogenetics. The summer culminates with writing a scientific abstract and a popular science article, and giving an oral presentation to the community in in end-of-program symposium. Students apply through an online application system and will be recruited from universities and community colleges across the country. Applicants identify potential mentors during the application process, and applications are competitively reviewed by advisors who make the final selection of participants. \r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how biodiversity-focused research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at local symposia and scientific conferences. \r\n\r\nA common web-based assessment tool used by all REU Site programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program is available by visiting https://www.calacademy.org/summer-systematics-institute, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Lauren Esposito at lesposito@calacademy.org) or the co-PI (Dr. Rebecca Johnson at rjohnson@calacademy.org).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

During this period, we received over 2,000 applications from exceptionally qualified undergraduate students from across the country. Each intern worked 1:1 with a mentor scientist from the Academy on a research project that focused on biodiversity science. These projects were presented at the conclusion of each summer in a research symposium open to the entire Academy community and streamed live on YouTube for friends, families, and supporters. Many of the interns continued their research, some of which resulted in presentations at scientific conferences, publications in peer-reviewed journals, awards, and other recognition for the quality of the original research.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>During the program, our interns participated in our Summer Systematics Institute (SSI), a program for undergraduate trainees established at the Academy in 1995. The goal of SSI is to integrate the greatest strengths of a public-facing natural history museum? informal science education on the public floor, public scientific communication, and world-class research?&ne; to train the next generation of museum scientist?the 21st Century Scientist. This training includes a range of science communication skill development, from informal science education on the museum?s public floor and in the field to popular science writing and science-focused social media. To develop biodiversity science skills, interns took part in lectures on systematic biology, toured research facilities and scientific collections, learned field techniques, and participated in community-building social activities? all while working on projects designed to facilitate introduction to a problem in biodiversity science and organisms to be studied, and collecting and analyzing data.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Mentor-mentee relationships are developed throughout the program on many levels, early on as supervisor-supervisee, but later evolving so that mentor and intern become collaborators on a specific research project. The SSI philosophy is one that promotes \"ownership\" of the developing project. Given that each undergraduate becomes the world authority on the subject, the relationship between mentor and mentee is a collaboration that exists between professional colleagues. This reinforces in the interns this crucial sense of ownership and agency and adds valuable perspective on the worth of their work to the scientific community in general, as evidenced by this quote from one of our participants: ?This experience affirmed my interest in doing research overall and in my chosen focus organism, in addition to giving me significantly more confidence in my ability to be a successful scientist.?</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>This project also contributed significantly to the scientific record. Over the four-year program, our interns gave sixteen presentations at scientific meetings, and eight of those won conference awards for best presentation. Research results from the projects started each summer have also been published in many discipline-based and general scientific journals, various popular outlets, and web-based publications. Online interviews and recordings of our research symposium posted on the Academy?s YouTube channel have collectively been viewed nearly 10,000 times over the past 4 years.&nbsp; Finally, our participants are continuing in their scientific paths. Of our 40 participants, 16 have already entered graduate school in a STEM discipline or another professional post-graduate training program (i.e. medical school, teaching credential), and another 10 entered the STEM workforce directly following graduation, with many more yet to have graduated.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Another goal of the program is to empower future scientific leaders, not only to do stellar science but to apply that research to solve the world?s most pressing problems. With global threats to biodiversity, and growing interest in the origins and diversification of life, phylogenetic systematics and evolutionary biology have become critical components of undergraduate education. Since 1996, when the Academy first received NSF funding for the SSI, we have played an important role in this education. Elements of the program that focus on cohort-building among peers, and confidence in research workspaces aim to create a stronger sense of agency and community for our mentees, as evidenced by the following participant comments: ?I gained a deeper understanding of my role in society as a scientist and the necessity for being involved in my community.? ?A major boost in self assuredness in my ability to be a scientist.?</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/26/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Lauren&nbsp;Esposito</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852276/1852276_10592513_1687812672979_IMG_5758--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852276/1852276_10592513_1687812672979_IMG_5758--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Birding\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852276/1852276_10592513_1687812672979_IMG_5758--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Birding\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">California Academy of Sciences interns conducting fieldwork to look at birds in Point Reyes National Seashore.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">California Academy of Sciences</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lauren&nbsp;Esposito</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Birding</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852276/1852276_10592513_1687811798350_IMG_4944--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852276/1852276_10592513_1687811798350_IMG_4944--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Public Programs\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852276/1852276_10592513_1687811798350_IMG_4944--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Public Programs\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">California Academy of Sciences REU interns speaking to public visitors about their research.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">California Academy of Sciences</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lauren&nbsp;Esposito</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Public Programs</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852276/1852276_10592513_1687812893063_IMG_8552--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852276/1852276_10592513_1687812893063_IMG_8552--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Interns Tidepooling\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852276/1852276_10592513_1687812893063_IMG_8552--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Interns Tidepooling\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Summer interns tide-pooling near Pescadero during the 2020 COVID pandemic.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">California Academy of Sciences</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lauren&nbsp;Esposito</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Interns Tidepooling</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852276/1852276_10592513_1687812987413_IMG_4663--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852276/1852276_10592513_1687812987413_IMG_4663--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2019 Summer Systematics Institute Interns\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852276/1852276_10592513_1687812987413_IMG_4663--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2019 Summer Systematics Institute Interns\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Summer interns at a site visit to the Bodega Bay Marine Lab in 2019.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">California Academy of Sciences</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lauren&nbsp;Esposito</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2019 Summer Systematics Institute Interns</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
