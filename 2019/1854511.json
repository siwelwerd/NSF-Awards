 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Basin of the Congo river is home to the second largest rainforest in the world, which sustains a growing population and an abundance of plant and animal species.  Despite its size, population, and importance as a biodiversity hotspots, the rainforest is not well represented in the climate research literature, particularly compared to the larger but less populous Amazon rainforest.  In particular, recent short-term Amazon droughts have drawn worldwide attention to the vulnerability of tropical forests, but the Congo Basin has been in drought for several decades.  The Congo Basin receives less rainfall than the Amazon, and paleoclimate data suggests that it has experienced dramatic forest loss during previous dry periods.  The importance and potential vulnerability of the Congo rainforest thus motivate further study of the mechanisms which regulate climate and rainfall in the region.\r\n\r\nWork performed here seeks to determine the causes of the rainfall deficits in the region, in particular the extent to which they are driven by increases in the sea surface temperature (SST) of the adjacent oceans.  Near-equatorial SST changes can affect continental precipitation through their effects on the large-scale atmospheric overturning circulations known as Walker cells. The research team will test the hypothesis that the drought is primarily due to SST increases in the Indian and Western Pacific oceans, which result in an intensified and westward-shifted Walker cell, which in turn induces subsidence over the Congo and reduces moisture transport into it. \r\n\r\nThe research is conducted using a combination of observational data and model simulations. The team will take advantage of a rain gauge-based precipitation dataset for the Congo and surrounding regions from 1921 to 2014, compiled by one of the PIs under previous NSF support.  Model simulations are performed using a fully-coupled atmosphere-ocean climate model, an atmosphere-only model with prescribed SSTs, and a \"pacemaker\" configuration in which SST is specified over a particular ocean region (say, the equatorial Indian ocean), but the coupled model determines its own SST outside the region.\r\n\r\nThe work has broader impacts due to the importance and vulnerability of the Congo Basin rainforest, as noted above.  A particular concern is that the SST increases in the Indian and Western Pacific Oceans may be due to anthropogenic greenhouse warming, in which case the rainfall reductions are unlikely to reverse. Results are communicated to African climate communities and non-profit organizations for use in climate impact assessments and the formulation of adaptation strategies.  In addition, the project provides support and training to two graduate students and one undergraduate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n      The Congo Basin is meteorological unique in several ways. A very important one is the strong spatial variability of rainfall, which is high on both seasonal and annual time scales. The reason appears to be the overall thermal and dynamic instability of the atmosphere over the Congo Basin, so that rainfall is easily and randomly triggered. The result is a lack of spatial teleconnections, which are very high elsewhere in Africa. Another factor might be the large impact of topography on the rainfall regime. A consequence of that is the nocturnal rainfall maximum over much of the Congo Basin.\n\n\n Another unusual characteristic is the intensity of the storm systems, with most rainfall being associated with Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCSs). They are generally more intense during the September-to-November rainy season than during the March-to-May rainy season. Hotspots in the development of the MCS activity affecting the Congo Basin include Lake Victoria, the lee of the Great Rift Valley and Mount Cameroon.\n\n\n The factors governing the development of MCSs are different from those governing the amount of rainfall. For example, over the Congo MCSs have become steadily more intense in both the MAM and SON seasons over the period 1983 to 2015, despite thedownward trends in rainfall in the region during the MAM season. The factors governing rainfall variability have been difficult to identify, but the Walker circulation appears to be a major one. The Southern Hemisphere, which affects the Tropical Easterly Jet, also appears to play a role.\n\n\n A study of two wet periods, 2016--2020 and 1979-93, concluded that the factors responsible were different for the two periods. The earlier one was associated with changes in the Walker circulation, moisture flux and flux divergence, and Pacific sea-surface temperatures. These did not seem to play a role in the second wet period, which was associated with an increase in Convective Available Potential Energy and in total column water vapor. This could be related to the general warming of the oceans.\n\n\n The changes in the Walker circulation over the Congo appeared to be primarily a response the SST changes in the equatorial Indian Ocean, suggesting that Indian Ocean SSTs modulate rainfall in the Congo Basin. In recent years, however, the Pacific Walker circulation has played an increasing role. This may enhance the predictability of rainfall over the Congo.\n\n\n A problem in truly understanding the meteorology of the Congo Basin is the question of the reliability of satellite and reanalysis products used to study the region. Their use is critical because the region is nearly devoid of surface meteorological measurements. We examined the reliability of nine satellite products and five reanalysis products.
