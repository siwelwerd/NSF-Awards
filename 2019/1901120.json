 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the travel and local expenses of early-career US-based mathematicians attending the international conference \"Equivariant Topology and Derived Algebra (ETDA)\" to be held from July 29 to August 2, 2019 at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. These mathematical research areas have seen a dramatic expansion in recent years and have attracted increased interest at an international level, especially amongst young researchers, who are taking these fields in new directions. The direct impact of this funding will be to augment the training and career development of approximately twenty junior US researchers, who will gain the opportunity to participate in a major conference in Europe. A secondary impact is to further develop collaboration between emerging research groups in algebraic topology, derived algebra, and derived algebraic geometry in the US and Europe. \r\n\r\nThe conference topics are centered on the areas of equivariant stable homotopy theory, derived commutative algebra, and derived algebraic geometry. The conference program features invited talks on all three areas by leading researchers and time for contributed talks, with a focus on young researchers. The conference will be an ideal venue for results and new questions arising from recent research progress to be announced and discussed. It will also provide a place to reinforce the networks of connections between mathematicians and add junior researchers as new nodes. Moreover, the particular topic of equivariant symmetric monoidal structures, together with the derived algebra that realizes those structures, is experiencing rapid development and will be a focal point of the conference talks. The conference website is: https://sites.google.com/view/etda2019/home\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
