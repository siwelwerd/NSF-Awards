 "awd_abstract_narration": "STEM teachers are remarkable collaborators within their schools, sharing their insights and best practices, and developing lessons and curricula that challenge their students. That's what great teachers do.  Online interaction among teachers in our digital world, however, is largely episodic and sometimes, in the case of social media platforms, all too brief.  Our project will develop and facilitate an interactive learning community and collegial network for STEM teacher leaders and aspiring teacher leaders.  \r\n\r\nOur STEM Teacher Leadership Network (STEMTLnet) builds on past work for NSF and will allow teacher leaders to access and benefit from a trusted community that provides up to date resources related to leadership, mentoring, classroom innovations and interventions as well as content and pedagogical knowledge across broad STEM topics. Teacher leaders will benefit from a support system, engaging those from their own and other leadership programs.  Leaders will benefit by having a forum to share queries, requests for advice, and by providing expertise.  Aspiring and newly recognized teachers will learn from and with those having more experience. This interactive community for teacher leaders will serve multiple teacher leadership communities, including, but not limited to: (a) Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching (PAEMST), as well as the Presidential Awards for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring (PAESMEM); (b) Principal investigators and participants in NSF's Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program and teacher leaders developed through multiple NSF Math and Science Partnership projects; and (c) Fellows and recipients of multiple other programs, including: Albert Einstein Fellowship program, Knowles Science Teaching Fellowships, Math for America Teacher Fellowship Program, Fulbright Distinguished Awards in Teaching Program, STEM Teachers of the Year, NSTA/NCTM STEM Ambassadors program, and alumni of the National Academies Teacher Advisory Council.\r\n\r\nAlthough our primary audience will be Presidential Awardees, our vision is inclusive, and we will invite those who are, or have been, part of any of the above programs as they have much to offer.  We envision this interactive professional learning community as a place where teacher-leaders share with each other their paths to leadership; their emerging capacity to influence school, district, state and national policy for positive change; their challenges, strategies, lessons learned, resources, and the impact they have had. The multi-modal network will facilitate cross-talk between groups, while also providing the possibility for leaders of particular programs to create groups for their own constituents. Research and evaluation will inform the field of the potential benefits of an online community to promote, facilitate, and support teacher leadership of many kinds.  In addition, we will study the benefits accrued to a particular subgroup that of PAEMST awardees.\r\n\r\nThis award comports with NSF Strategic Goal 1: Expand knowledge in science, engineering, and learning; and NSF Strategic Goal 2:  Advance the capability of the Nation to meet current and future challenges.\r\n\r\nFunding for this project is provided by the Excellence Awards in Science and Engineering program and the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It also included teacher leaders recognized by the Albert Einstein Fellowship Program, the Knowles Science Teaching Fellowship Program, the State Department of Education's Teacher of the Year, NSTA/NCTM STEM Ambassadors Program and the National Academies Teacher Advisory Council. In addition, STEMTLnet.org successfully engaged aspiring teacher leaders, researchers interested in teacher leadership, K-12 administrators and higher education faculty who provide pre-service and in-service training to teachers in this vibrant learning community.

These multiple modes of interaction were valuable throughout the project, but perhaps most critically during COVID when teacher leaders, often working from home, were able to connect and learn from colleagues across the country as to how to transform their classrooms to online or hybrid formats.

The 25 featured themes were related to the following four topics - STEM Teacher Leadership, Innovations in STEM Teaching and Learning, Diversity, Equity and Social Justice, and Technology, Remote Learning and Support of Students During COVID. Each theme included an introductory blog, an interactive webinar, a collection of resources related to the theme, breakout sessions, an interactive two-week discussion, and a synthesis document that offered recommendations for teacher leaders, administrators, researchers and policy makers. The webinars, presented by a mix of teacher leaders, researchers and professional developers, provided a forum for knowledge sharing across diverse communities with multiple perspectives. Attendees found these events to be of value and they were well attended (with an average of 173 people coming to either the live webinar event or viewing the recording). Popular webinar topics included \"Race, Equity, and Mathematics Education,\" \"Connecting Mathematics and Science through Literature and Storytelling,\" \"Integrating Computer Science and Computational Thinking,\" \"Partnering Culturally Responsive Teaching and Place-based Science Education,\" \"Integrating Emerging Technologies into Teaching and Practice,\" and \"Leading without Leaving the Classroom.\"</p>\n<p>Members reported that participating in STEMTLnet.org enabled them to feel a part of a professional learning community, to become aware of new opportunities and events that propelled and enhanced their teacher leadership roles, to find resources and ideas that improved their STEM teaching, and to participate in a positive professional development experience.</p>\n<p>Finally, the project conducted research on the effects of the Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching (PAEMST) on teacher leadership trajectories.
