 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: \r\nScience, technology, and engineering careers are becoming increasingly dependent on a breadth of knowledge that spans multiple disciplines. This Research Experience for Undergraduates and Teachers at Penn State University addresses this need for multi-disciplinary breadth by engaging a highly diverse group of 10 students and two teachers in cross-disciplinary research in nanoscale physics and materials. Students and teachers will learn and apply cutting-edge scientific techniques and experience the challenges and rewards of working in a collaborative, interdisciplinary research environment. Undergraduate students will also participate in career development activities focused on fortifying the non-technical skills necessary for success in scientific research, including scientific communication and skills for building mentor-mentee relationships. Activities include scientific seminars, professional networking events, outreach activities, and participation in a national conference.  Teachers will gain materials science knowledge and transfer their experiences back to their students, influencing them and their community through the development of teaching resources with their peers and Penn State faculty. This research experience aims to inspire and prepare students of all ages to pursue careers in science and engineering, with specific goals to increase representation in science from underrepresented groups, including minorities and women. Most students from this program matriculate to graduate programs in science and engineering or begin careers in science disciplines.\r\n \r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: \r\nThis Research Experience for Undergraduates and Teachers in nanoscale physics and materials emphasizes the investigation, creation and/or manipulation of novel nanostructures and low dimensional materials in order to understand and harness their electrical, optical, magnetic or quantum mechanical properties. Students will participate in 10 weeks of mentored research in projects ranging from the fundamental study of novel physics in topologically active thin films, nanoparticles, few-layered and 2D materials, to the design, testing and application of these materials in devices. Teachers participate in a similar 6-week research project coupled with education-themed scientific workshops. Through their research, students and teachers will have the opportunity to be trained on state-of-the-art materials synthesis and characterization equipment. Complementing their research, students also participate in career development activities aimed at preparing them for and exposing them to scientific research in nanoscale physics and materials.  The culmination of their research experiences will be to present their work at a cross-disciplinary undergraduate research symposium at Penn State and some will travel to present their findings at a national conference.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The REU impact was further broadened by inviting 29 Penn State Physics supported by the Penn State Physics Department and other faculty-funds to join the program and serve as 'hosts' to the visiting students. This diverse group of students was mentored by top researchers on independent research projects, attended weekly seminars, participated in professional development workshops related to scientific communication, engaged in public outreach, and participated in a summers-end symposium with researchers from across Penn State summer research programs.

Teachers gained material science knowledge which they transferred to classroom activities through their development of take-home resources in collaboration with their peers, Penn State faculty and their research groups.

REU research resulted in 16 publications and 22 national or local conference presentations which were produced with undergraduate and teacher researchers who participated in this program, with 14 more publications by our broader community of host students. 80% of graduated NSF funded REU students from 2019-2023 began graduate or professional school in science and engineering another 10% started STEM careers.</p>\n<p>This REU and RET site also provided a broader impact to the institutional and local communities.
