Initially, this research focused on advancing the approximation theory of mixed Holder functions using techniques related to Haar Wavelets or, equivalently, by linear combinations of indicator functions of dyadic boxes, see Figure 1. We established a randomized approximation result for mixed Holder functions based on linear combinations of indicator functions of dyadic boxes in arbitrary dimensions.&nbsp; Subsequently, this research branched out to several topics, three of which are described in the following. First, we considered an image recovery problem using rotational and translational invariants involving the discrete Fourier Transform. In particular, suppose a large noisy measurement with randomly rotated and translated instances of a target image is given, see Figure 2. We consider the low-signal-to-noise regime, where it is difficult to estimate the locations and orientations of the target images in the measurement. Using an approach based on autocorrelation analysis and invariant features, we demonstrated that image recovery is possible regardless of the noise level. Second, we considered a common variable problem on graphs involving graph Laplacian Eigenfunctions. Informally speaking, we say that a function on the vertices of a graph is smooth if the function values at adjacent vertices are similar, see Figure 3. More precisely, the smoothness of a function on the vertices of a graph can be quantified using a graph Laplacian quadratic form. We established a theorem that explains how to find the smoothest function on a collection of graphs defined on a common vertex set but with different edge sets. Third, we developed a novel fast algorithm for expanding digitized L by L images in the disk harmonics (Dirichlet Laplacian Eigenfunctions). These functions are orthonormal and ordered by frequency and thus provide a low pass filter for functions on the unit disk, see Figure 4. Moreover, this basis is steerable and provides fast radial convolutions. Our method, called the Fast Disk Harmonics Transform, runs in O(L log L) operations and provides precise accuracy guarantees.</p>\n<p><br />Additionally, this project included mentoring undergraduate student researchers. Six undergraduate students were mentored on math research projects, which resulted in three journal publications (two joint papers with undergraduate students and one solo paper by an undergraduate student).&nbsp;Undergraduate math research fosters problem-solving and communication skills, preparing students for mathematical roles in academia, government, and industry.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/31/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Nicholas&nbsp;F&nbsp;Marshall</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1903015/1903015_10595313_1690830623528_fig04--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1903015/1903015_10595313_1690830623528_fig04--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1903015/1903015_10595313_1690830623528_fig04--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 4.
