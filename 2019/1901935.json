 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arthropod parasites (specifically, insects and their relatives) are responsible for economically critical issues in human health, wildlife conservation, and livestock productivity.  Because natural history collections are permanent repositories for past and present parasite specimens, these collections and their data can help address these significant societal challenges in human and animal health and safety.  Natural history collections often contain specimens and ancillary materials that are completely unknown to the broader community, yet represent irreplaceable knowledge about organismal habitats, distributions, and parasite-host associations.  Further, these collections yield information that can be used to model ecological processes and changes in species distributions, predict the future spread of human and animal disease, update taxonomy, and help identify under-represented parasite groups in urgent need of sampling and threatened parasite diversity in need of conservation.  This project will provide digital records (i.e., specimen label data and images) of invaluable arthropod parasite collections to make research-ready baseline data accessible online, catalyzing new research and education initiatives.  These newly digitized data will have immediate and long-lasting benefits for our understanding of organismal associations, biodiversity, and beyond.  \r\n\r\nThe Terrestrial Parasite Tracker Thematic Collection Network (TPT-TCN) will digitize over one million arthropod specimens representing species that are significant parasites and disease vectors of vertebrates in the United States.  This digitization effort will integrate millions of vertebrate host records with vector and disease monitoring data shared by state and federal agency collaborators, creating a novel foundation for integrative, long-term research.  This project is a collaboration of taxonomists and curators from vertebrate and invertebrate collections, as well as epidemiologists, ecologists, data-scientists, and biodiversity informatics specialists.  This reach is further extended by the 26 collaborating research collections and other initiatives.  This project will empower ongoing citizen science and public awareness campaigns with the tools to understand distribution changes of arthropod vectors and associated diseases due to environmental change and global movement.  Public education initiatives include partnering with natural history museums to educate the public about parasites via science-focused lectures, exhibits, summer youth programs, informal presentations, and developing new online educational resources for teachers in underserved communities.  All specimen images generated by this project will be used for the development of a rapid identification tool for parasites which will be made accessible through the internet and smartphone apps and shared with iDigBio (idigbio.org).  The TPT-TCN will also develop and implement undergraduate teaching modules focused on data held in natural history collections.  These modules will be disseminated to academic institutions across the United States and made available online.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe overarching Terrestrial Parasite Tracker project involved the transcription of specimen label data from ~1.2+ million arthropod parasites specimens from 22 museum collections across North America. The main goal of this project was to make parasite data available to researchers and the public through the aggregation of data from all participating museum collections. The mobilization and aggregation of these data from many different museum collections created new knowledge about host-parasite associations, geographic distributions, and will help in identifying and studying the vectors for wildlife and human diseases well into the future. Specific digitization goals for the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel Universitys (ANSDU) team included (1) digitizing the Field Museum parasitic louse collection on long term loan to the ANSDU, (2) digitizing data from louse specimens in the ANSDU Entomology collection, (3) transferring an existing database for over 6000 vials of frozen ethanol preserved ectoparasite specimens to the Arctos database platform, which will serve these data publicly and (4) high quality imaging of hundreds of ectoparasite specimens. The broader impacts of this project were numerous. First, we trained several Drexel University students including one Ph.D. student, one BS/MS students, and two BS students in parasitological methods and imaging specimens. We also trained one visiting Ph.D. student who was working on parasites for her dissertation project. All these students were trained in using the projects Macropod imaging system used to capture detailed images of small organisms. We have used parasite images generated on the Macropod, by students and the project technician, in a variety of public outreach activities including Members Night and in the development of exhibits at the museum. For example, one recently developed in house exhibit entitled Conversations with Birds featured a video about our work on avian ectoparasites and work that we were doing for this project. The PI also spoke about our work on bird parasites in various public venues. Lastly, a graduate student trainee and the PI published a catalog of type specimens (the specimens used to define a species in a scientific description) housed in the Field Museum louse collection, which will be useful for colleagues searching for specimens for their research.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/15/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JasonWeckstein\n"
