 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) Site at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (UTC) is focused on data analytics in smart cities and harnesses the city of Chattanooga's emergence as a pioneer in urban renewal and smart city design. Chattanooga is internationally recognized as one of the most innovative smart US cities, partly because of the contributions of UTC and Chattanooga's locally owned electric distribution and communication provider, Electric Power Board, which has deployed 10Gbps Internet service to over 180,000 households and businesses, allowing for more effective transportation systems; improved energy efficiency; and smart urban development. The project is novel in leveraging several select Hamilton County career-themed Future Ready Institutes (FRIs) to provide authentic research experiences in smart city development for 30 high school STEM educators (10/year) who teach in these FRIs. For 6 weeks each summer, participants work with research mentors from varied disciplines who are conducting smart-cities focused projects: electric vehicle charging, green motors, drones, land use management, power consumption, and pavement design. Smart city innovations have a significant impact on infrastructure, transportation, manufacturing, and the health of their communities. Participants will work with the STEM standards that are exemplified in the engineering fundamentals underlying their research experiences and embed them into the design of Project-Based Learning (PBL) modules allowing students to look into potential careers as engineers and the impact they could make on their city and region. The project's delivery and derived benefits in the promotion of science and feeding the pipeline of qualified and diverse future engineers and scientists are enhanced through industry partnerships, involvement of student organizations including chapters of the Society of Women in Engineering (SWE) and the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), and dissemination of findings to a wider audience via the web, publications and symposiums participation.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project include: (1) Increase high school teachers' research skills and practical knowledge of engineering principles related to smart city design and development. (2) Provide teachers with relevant skills and knowledge on Project-Based Learning (PBL) design and implementation. (3) Create a pipeline that will result in increased numbers of well-prepared high school students that will potentially feed into STEM related college disciplines. (4) Broaden underrepresented groups' STEM participation in underlying disciplines related to smart cities. RET participants will develop 9-week PBL modules that will be designed based on the Buck Institute for Education's seven PBL design principles for instructors. Professional development will provide opportunities for teachers to attend conferences and training sessions focused on STEM education best practices, national standards, PBL, and engineering design/critical thinking instruction. During the academic year, the project team will visit the classroom in order to provide feedback and support for implementation. The PBL curriculum modules developed by participants will focus on incorporating their research experience with their respective FRI theme and grade-level STEM concepts to meet the high school standards associated with their courses. These PBL modules will demonstrate for students the real work of engineers while educating them on the STEM fundamentals required to succeed in their current coursework. Through ongoing professional development that takes place across the entire FRI system, each FRI teacher will have the opportunity to learn from teacher participants and be a part of the curriculum's dissemination. Increased participation with local and regional industry will allow the FRIs to further leverage these partnerships, allowing for more on-campus visits, virtual discussions, and in-class experiences for students. The RET Site will also foster and strengthen a long-term partnership between UTC, Hamilton County Schools, and industry partners and has a specific target on reaching underrepresented minorities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis outcomes report pertains to a National Science Foundation (NSF) Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) Site at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, College of Engineering and Computer Science (CECS). The project is titled Engineering and Data Analytics in Smart Cities. Over three years, this project served 29 teachers a majority of whom came from Hamilton County Schools (HCS) and HCS Future Ready Institutes (FRI), while the rest came from Marion County and from area private schools.\r\n\n\nThe project fulfilled its stated objectives via 16 authentic and diverse research projects (mostly 2 teachers per project) conducted in a holistic environment with a summer component that is focused on teacher research, training and planning activities, and an academic-year component that is focused on classroom implementation and teacher professional development. During the summer teachers acquired content knowledge as well as skills such as programming, CAD drawing,  etc. needed for their research, designed their RET-funded project-based-learning (PBL) lessons with training and coaching, attended presentations by academics and industry representatives, and presented their work to their cohort and the college in a mini symposium. During the academic year, teachers implemented their PBL lesson in classrooms and hosted RET professors and university students, and industry visitors to participate and to answer student questions. \r\n\n\nProducts from this project included (i) 16 integrated PBL lesson plans aligned to TN state and 21st Century Standards for their respective subjects as well as integrating math and English standards (ii) 16 posters presented by teachers at two well-attended public events at UTC, namely UTC Spring Research and Arts Conference (formerly known as ReSEARCH Dialogues) and CECS Technology Symposium with one poster also presented at (ii) published technical conference papers (Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), American Society for Civil Engineers (ASCE), American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM), and two conference posters about mentorship under RETs at the Black Doctoral Conference and NSF EEC Grantee Conference (iii) Cross-school student collaboration including a student research poster symposium with over 20 posters from over 40 students. Students selected several environmental issues they care about to research and investigate applicability of machine learning in solving these issues.\r\n\n\nThe research subjects included, among others, comparative analysis of rooftop solar versus utility scale solar in electrical power distribution networks; machine learning for pavement design defects; storm water runoff and microplastics research, design of prothesis for finger rehabilitation; the application of six sigma methods in studying student dropout rates; and use of arrays of raspberry pi cores in real-time simulation of electrical power distribution networks. The project inspired student lessons financed from this grant including (i) building simple circuits and performing voltage and power calculations (ii) building pavements designs from chocolate and crackers (aggregates) and comparing their strength or maximum load before breaking (iii) mitigating negative impact of storm water runoff by building planters in the school to replace grey concrete area, installing rainwater collection barrels and creating their own T-shirt designs, making and wearing them to promote recycling (iv) building a topographical map of Chattanooga area (v) presenting student business plans to a successful local businessman for critique and feedback in a format similar to a popular tv program named Shark Tank.\r\n\n\nThe impact of the project reached hundreds of students including underserved minority and rural students and resulted in (i) increasing knowledge in subject areas via lessons inspired by the teachers experience (ii) providing opportunities to communicate with and relate to a highly representative set of college students and student club members, and professors; (iii) increasing their (and their teachers) awareness of future careers (iv) sponsoring PBL activities that include a community service component such as fixing a pothole or replacing grey areas (concrete) with green areas (planters). Connections and activities with many teachers continue beyond their cohorts year of participation. Several teachers are actively transferring their PBLs to fellow teachers who have not been a part of the RET for an even broader impact on teachers and students as well as reaching out seeking community partner (UTC) component of their PBLs. In addition, several teachers continue their connection with RET professors for opportunities to expand on their research so that they can disseminate their findings in professional conferences. \r\n\n\nThe RET project forged new and continued existing relations and collaborations with education stakeholder in the area starting with strengthening the Universitys partnership with Hamilton County school district and starting and maintaining collaborations with one of the largest community partners, the Public Education Foundation (PEF), who offered the RET participating teachers digital fabrication training with over 20 hours of continued education; the PIs continue to engage PEF to pursue opportunities to empower students and teachers. In addition, the PI is now on the advisory board for neighboring state public charter school system invited by an RET participant who moved to that system.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/26/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RagaAhmed\n"
