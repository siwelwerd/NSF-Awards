 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to develop three co-located bristlecone pine proxies to address three very different and key fundamental aspects of Holocene climate that include precipitation variability, temperature variability, and volcanism.  Long proxy records of these three variables can be used to both drive and evaluate general circulation models thereby providing a testing ground for further understanding of Holocene climate dynamics.  The goal of this project is to significantly improve the evaluation of Holocene-scale paleoclimatic change in western North America.\r\n\r\nThe potential Broader Impacts include developing a dataset of new measurements and analyses of Holocene climate, participation and support of students in the project, development of new educational exhibits at the Arizona's Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research (LTRR) which sees over 10,000 individuals per year (including K-12, University students, and the public), and recruiting and working with minority students through the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans (SACNAS) via Western Washington University.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We undertook an extensive fieldwork collection in the White Mountains of California, both at the lower forest border site of Methuselah Walk for moisture-sensitive trees, and at the upper treeline site of Sheep Mountain for temperature-sensitive trees. CBS Sunday Morning television show followed us in the field for two days, filmed us sampling, and interviewed the PIs. This was broadcast to a national television audience of over 5.5 million viewers.</p>\n<p>Because of this collection we now have a much larger data set to work with. We also have a longer calibration period from which to compare growth and recorded meteorological data. The emphasis was on both updating the most recent years from living tree cores and strengthening parts of the existing chronologies that needed more samples. Both of these goals were successful.</p>\n<p>Previously, at the upper treeline a low-sample-size \"gap\" in the chronology existed centered around a major event (frost ring) probably linked to a major volcanic eruption with global climatic effects. This caused damage in the year 2036 BCE and the wood eroded around this ring and it has been difficult spanning this period. In previous collections only one treeline sample from the White Mountains spanned this interval. We specifically targeted this interval in the 2021 fieldwork campaign and were able to collect samples from three additional trees for this period, thus confirming the dating and effectively eliminating the \"gap\".</p>\n<p>We were also able to accomplish the important work of updating the Methuselah Walk lower forest border chronology through the growing season of 2021. Notably, the 2021 ring was \"missing\" (not formed due to adverse growing conditions) in ten out of the thirteen samples that we examined. This is an important result as it helps put current drought conditions into a muti-millennial perspective.</p>\n<p>By analyzing modern meteorological station data from the White Mountains of California we learned that beginning in the 2nd half of the 20th century temperatures increased and precipitation decreased. This has occurred at both the upper and lower forest border. The greatest warming was seen in minimum temperature particularly in the summer and fall with an increase in mean temperature since the first half of the 20th century of 1.3 deg. C and 1.4 deg. C respectively at the upper forest border. Precipitation amounts have decreased since 1950 CE, primarily in winter (snowpack) and more so at upper treeline. The upper forest border location received over 46 mm more winter precipitation on average per year in the interval prior to 1950 CE than in the latter period, a nearly 18% decrease. At the lower forest border the same pattern held, with a 16.4 mm decrease in winter precipitation (11%). The combination of decreased winter precipitation and increasing growing season temperatures has likely changed the way tree growth and climate interact and put the survival of many ancient lower forest border trees under increasing risk.</p>\n<p>Along the road of discovery our project has enabled other significant outcomes. We have:</p>\n<p>1. Completely re-worked of the long lower forest border Methuselah Walk ring-width chronology.&nbsp; This has involved adding and measuring new samples, both from our collections and from the University of Arizona Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research (LTRR) archive. We have also fixed dating errors to improve and make the measured chronology more accurate.</p>\n<p>2. Discovered, through annual radiocarbon dating, a strong solar proton event (SPE) in an undated floating bristlecone sample. Besides the obvious importance of dating this extreme event in terms of solar physics, this result should lead to an of the extension of the bristlecone chronology.</p>\n<p>3. By measuring ring maximum latewood density from upper treeline samples we are gaining insights on how to improve the accuracy of temperature reconstructions.</p>\n<p>4. We have compiled a \"master\" frost-ring record significantly lengthening and improving the BCE portion of the record. Frost rings are annual rings with damaged cells due to freezing events during the growing season.</p>\n<p>5. Developed a Common Era blue-ring chronology. Blue rings are identified by staining thin sections taken from samples. They identify years with short and cool growing seasons which leads to reduced (or interrupted) lignification of tree cell walls. We identified 19 years with high blue ring occurrence over the past 1400 years indicating unusual cool conditions in these years. Sixteen of the 19 years identified can be linked to volcanic activity and associated cool conditions significant enough to affect tree-ring formation in western North America.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/01/2023<br>\nModified by: Matthew&nbsp;Salzer</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1902625/1902625_10629735_1701464003248_IMG_0688--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1902625/1902625_10629735_1701464003248_IMG_0688--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Sheep Mountain Remnant Wood and Young BCP\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1902625/1902625_10629735_1701464003248_IMG_0688--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Sheep Mountain Remnant Wood and Young BCP\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Young bristlecone have moved into the \"ghost forest\" zone with mid-Holocene aged remnant wood.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Grant Elliott</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Matthew&nbsp;Salzer\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Sheep Mountain Remnant Wood and Young BCP</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1902625/1902625_10629735_1701463552157_IMG_0719--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1902625/1902625_10629735_1701463552157_IMG_0719--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Lower Forest Border Zone\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1902625/1902625_10629735_1701463552157_IMG_0719--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Lower Forest Border Zone\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">CBS Sunday Morning filming bristlecone pine fieldwork in Schulman Grove (Methuselah Walk Area) White Mountains California</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Grant Elliott</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Matthew&nbsp;Salzer\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Lower Forest Border Zone</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1902625/1902625_10629735_1701463680310_IMG_0670--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1902625/1902625_10629735_1701463680310_IMG_0670--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Patriarch Tree\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1902625/1902625_10629735_1701463680310_IMG_0670--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Patriarch Tree\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Large bristlecone referred to as the Patriarch Tree in the White Mountains of California.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Grant Elliott</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Matthew&nbsp;Salzer\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Patriarch Tree</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1902625/1902625_10629735_1701464156206_IMG_0738--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1902625/1902625_10629735_1701464156206_IMG_0738--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Patriarch Grove Interview\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1902625/1902625_10629735_1701464156206_IMG_0738--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Patriarch Grove Interview\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">CBS Sunday Morning interview in Patriarch Grove</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Grant Elliott</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Matthew&nbsp;Salzer\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Patriarch Grove Interview</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1902625/1902625_10629735_1701462630377_BCP2021_Shp21_021--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1902625/1902625_10629735_1701462630377_BCP2021_Shp21_021--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Sheep Mountain Remnant Wood\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1902625/1902625_10629735_1701462630377_BCP2021_Shp21_021--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Sheep Mountain Remnant Wood\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Sampling at the \"ghost forest\" of the upper treeline zone in the White Mountains of California</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Charlotte Pearson</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Matthew&nbsp;Salzer\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Sheep Mountain Remnant Wood</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
