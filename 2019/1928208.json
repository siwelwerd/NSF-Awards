 "awd_abstract_narration": "The EarthCube effort aims to transform the way that geosciences research is done by encouraging researchers and technologists to work together to share data and scientific outcomes and to harness the data revolution. The EarthCube Office (ECO) is responsible for developing and spreading tools that make it easier for geoscientists to share their data. This office is also responsible for supporting EarthCube's core organizational and governance units including: the Leadership Council, Technology & Architecture Committee, Science Committee, Council of Data Facilities, as well as others. ECO manages EarthCube's business operations and community engagement, including its online presence. The broader impacts of this project include outreach to geoscientists, supporting science education, and management of the Annual Meeting. In addition, EarthCube will help to make the products of scientific research more openly available. ECO will strive for full transparency in operations and will look to the community for input on needed service evolution.\r\n\r\nThe EarthCube Office provides organizational support to EarthCube, and facilitates developing and sharing scientific resources through two activities: facilitation of EarthCube governance and data discovery and access. As part of the data discovery and access task, the ECO will collect relevant cyberinfrastructure and tools in the GeoCODES Registry, and increase awareness and exposure to these resources. As part of facilitation of EarthCube governance, the ECO will provide continuity to the existing EarthCube community while looking toward the future to expand EarthCube's reach across geosciences disciplines. Fundamental work includes designing outreach and education activities for researchers interested in acquiring the skills needed to ensure their data practices are Findable Accessible Interoperable Reusable (FAIR) and beyond. ECO will offer pertinent data science guidance and support to EC projects, to help them apply the latest machine learning, data mining, big data analytics and other tools to their research. Increasing development and access to technology innovations, and nurturing a community of technically-savvy and engaged geoscientists will build capacity in the geoscience research ecosystem. This will include opportunities for scientists who might not otherwise interact with EarthCube. This project is jointly supported by the Directorate for Geosciences and the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
