 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to enable widespread adoption of 3D-printing of high-performance, high-temperature polymers via a desktop-scale, low-cost printing platform.  Existing 3D printers capable of processing performance polymers have special power requirements, large footprint, and are cost prohibitive due to their required high-temperature printing environments. This project's novel printer design enables printing these performance polymers at a desktop-scale and price, therefore bridging the gap between scale, cost, and material performance. The mechanical properties of parts printed with the developed machine are equivalent to those printed with commercial industrial-scale systems. Example use cases include the deployment of printers where a large printer may be infeasible and in providing redundancy in manufacturing for faster, more agile production of parts. This printer will be able to fabricate stronger products than existing desktop scale 3D printers and allows these parts to be designed for applications in new environments.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project further develops a desktop-scale 3D-printer designed to print high-performance plastics. Performance plastics offer higher strength parts that are functional in high-temperature or and/or corrosive environments. However, the fabrication of performance plastics via fused filament fabrication (FFF) 3D-printing requires processing in a high-temperature environment to prevent deformation of printed parts and to improve parts' mechanical properties. This project develops a FFF embodiment that features an inverted architecture, in conjunction with a special heating chamber, to maintain a sufficiently high-temperature environment for processing high-performance plastics. Since the design exploits natural convection currents to selectively achieve high temperatures in the build area, this FFF embodiment does not require large heaters or cooling units for the mechatronic elements, thus reducing the cost and power requirements when compared to current solutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This solution cost in excess of $200,000 and did not provide users the opportunity to change process parameters or use custom materials. To address this perceived market gap, the team created a desktop-scale and low-cost 3D printer capable of processing high-temperature polymers. Joined by an industrial advisor from a global polymer company, the team attended the ICorps program as part of the 2019 Summer cohort in Denver, CO. The team conducted 108 total interviews during the iCorps training period (70 in person, 10 via video-conference, and 28 via phone). The team interviewed R&amp;D segments within small, medium, and large companies in the aerospace, medical devices, automotive, defense, consumer product, and additive manufacturing (AM) service bureau industries. The team identified the automotive market as a space with demand for bespoke parts made from high-performance light-weight materials that currently uses existing AM technologies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The interviews provided the team within insight into the core needs of the AM industry, which have been formulated as a 'AM market hierarchy of needs':</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Machine Reliability</li>\n<li>Part Reliability</li>\n<li>Material Performance</li>\n<li>Process Qualification</li>\n<li>Volume Production / Mass Customization.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Customer interviews revealed that the AM equipment market was rapidly becoming crowded, and customers did not express significant demand for lowering the cost of entry of high-performance 3D printed polymer parts.

The team identified the medical device industry as one that has expressed interest in the use of AM for on-site production of custom components made from high-temperature (e.g., autoclavable), high-performance polymers. The team expanded their original invention to incorporate a novel post-process technique that results in parts with increased strength and hierarchical surface porosity. The imparted surface porosity makes printed parts suitable for bone in-growth. This has led to exploration of new venture related to 3D printed custom bone (e.g., spinal) implants.</p>\n<p>In addition to the above findings, the program resulted in several broader impacts. The iCorps experience provided considerable professional development opportunities for three Ph.D. students, the PI, and the industry partner. The PhD students gained experience in navigating professional work places, conducting customer interviews, and value from stepping away from the lab and seeing the potential impact of their research. The PI was trained about Lean Startup methodology and has since incorporated elements of the methods in his Additive Manufacturing course, the Department of Mechanical Engineering's senior design courses, and in a new interdisciplinary studio-based product design course.
