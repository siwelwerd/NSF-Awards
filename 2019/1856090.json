 "awd_abstract_narration": "Innovation in science and technology is often the province of teams. As knowledge becomes ever more specialized, teams can tackle complex problems requiring insight from multiple domains. However, teams made up of diverse experts often struggle to combine knowledge effectively. In fact, research shows that while promising in theory, in practice, diverse teams often fail to realize their potential. Diverse teams are crucial to society. We are on the cusp of major breakthroughs in fields like artificial intelligence and brain science that require diverse expertise. These breakthroughs require large public expenditures in teams of scientists working in these fields. How can we identify the ''safe bets'' and ''risky propositions''? Which mixes distinguish mediocre teams from the teams whose work will fuel decades of important discoveries? These are the questions we seek to answer. \r\n\r\nWe develop methods for characterizing scientific expertise and markers of productive collaboration among scientists based on machine-learning analysis of the full text of the papers they have written. Previous work relies on structural markers, and has yet to peer into the ideas themselves. Applying recent developments in text analytics machine learning, the full text of publications and patents is used to characterize expertise and diversity in ways that otherwise would not be possible. These advances have scientific and practical value. Practically speaking, we need a better way to predict which teams are most likely to be productive, and invest in them. Beyond this application, being able to predict diverse teams most likely to succeed will help to address societal challenges involving teams in other contexts as well, such as healthcare, disaster response, cybersecurity, and the military.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Specifically, we used Doc2Vec, to map inventors? networks over time and examine the text of their output and created the Patent Similarity Dataset. Patent Similarity Dataset provides approximately 640 million precalculated similarity scores, as well as the code and computed vectors required to calculate further pairwise similarities. These similarity scores provide insight into the degree of similarity in the linguistic content of patent pairs. Because patent text consists largely of a description of the claimed technology and specific claim language, patent similarity scores can be thought of as providing insight into the similarity of the inventions that are claimed in the documents. Once computed, these scores can be used to assess innovation and patent policy in a variety of novel ways. Code is provided in accompanying scripts to assist researchers in obtaining the dataset, joining it with other available patent data, and using it in their research (Whalen et al., 2020).</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.2; text-align: justify; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">second</span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> intellectual merit of the project was the unpacking of the role of diversity in science and the conditions under which diversity is most likely to result in individual and team success.

We used natural language processing to estimate areas of expertise of each inventor and develop measures of expertise diversity and divergent ideation. Results showed that collaborations exhibiting a high degree of expertise diversity produce more impactful products, while collaborations exhibiting a low degree of expertise diversity are more likely to collaborate again. Further, collaborations exhibiting a high degree of expertise diversity and a low-to-moderate degree of divergent ideation were most likely to create the highest impact inventions, but they were less likely to sustain their collaboration (Whalen et al., 2023).</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.2; text-align: justify; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Finally, the <em><strong>Safe Bets and Risky Propositions</strong></em> project addressed the following dimensions of </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">broader impact</span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">. </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">First</span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">, the project can benefit the scientific community by helping them to make informed decisions on forming teams, including especially those from minority populations, so as to enable them to have more productive careers.&nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Second</span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">, the data and code produced during this project is available online and the metrics developed and refined were disseminated in publications. </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Third</span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">, the project supported the research program of a promising junior female scholar and new co-PI working on scientific innovation and advanced the training of two interdisciplinary non-white female Ph.D. students in two Ph.D. programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.2; text-align: justify; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">References&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-a3fe2237-7fff-a3d4-5856-c5fb72530411\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; text-indent: -27pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; padding: 0pt 0pt 0pt 27pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Whalen, R., Lungeanu, A., DeChurch, L., &amp; Contractor, N.
