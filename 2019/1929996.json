 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians by supporting the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need. Over four years, the project will provide one-year scholarships to at least 120 low-income, academically talented students who are pursuing Associate of Applied Science degrees, with majors in Computer Technology/Network Systems Management, Industrial Technology, or Engineering Technology. The project incorporates an innovative variable scholarship amount that aims to cover each Scholar's entire unmet need. In addition, it includes a loan-to-own laptop technology model with wireless connectivity to provide Scholars with access to internet service and high-quality computers with virtual reality capabilities. By supporting more students to stay in college full time, this project expects to increase student retention, improve degree-completion rates, and increase the number of technical education students who transfer to four-year institutions. Thus, this project directly supports national policy goals to improve post-secondary education attainment, while advancing knowledge by addressing research questions concerning the impact of the \"digital divide\" on student success. \r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this project is to increase the STEM degree completion of low income, high achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. The project builds on work from a prior S-STEM grant, which established a comprehensive student support structure that has proven successful in increasing retention and success among underrepresented groups in STEM fields. This project will expand the existing support model to include providing Scholars with laptops that have virtual reality capability, as well as faculty mentors, customized virtual student support, and social media connections. It is expected that resources and supports provided by the project will close the digital divide for diverse scholars and advance students' knowledge of STEM careers and the skilled technical workplace. An external evaluator will provide formative and summative feedback. Project dissemination plans include news releases, social media messaging, conference publications, and publications in peer-reviewed journals. The project is funded by the NSF's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low income, academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low income students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
