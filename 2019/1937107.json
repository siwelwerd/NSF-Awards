 "awd_abstract_narration": "Significant issues in U.S. healthcare delivery persist despite advances in medicine, technologies, health policies, regulations, and resources. U.S. has the greatest medical science in the world, that is unable to provide consistent, affordable care for all citizens. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) attributes more than 100,000 deaths a year to preventable medical errors, resulting from system lapses that fail to deliver well-established standards of practice. Quality, safety, and coordination issues suggest that barriers to transforming U.S. healthcare are complex system engineering problems. Efforts to share information across healthcare systems has many unaddressed barriers. This planning grant is driven by a vision of an Engineering Research Center for Health Care Transformation (ERC-HCT) focused on reengineering delivery of healthcare through a multi-pronged approach that integrates information technology, systems engineering, social sciences, medical science, and health informatics. The primary aim is to advance the science for reengineering U.S. health care delivery from today's costly, inconsistent provider-centric system to a better coordinated person-centered care system. This vision, guided by medical professionals, industry partners, and behavioral scientists, will create care improvements and sustainable, scalable integrated delivery models. The Planning Grant will engage partners to develop a common, deeper understanding of barriers and opportunities afforded by today's technologies as a basis for clarifying strategies and shaping the management structure of the proposed Engineering Research Center.\r\n\r\nThis planning grant brings together a diverse team of researchers from the University of South Carolina, Clemson University, Claflin, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, and the PRISMA Health System, to develop a common, deeper understanding of barriers and opportunities afforded by today?s technologies.  ERC-HCT will bring together expertise and research that generally functions in silos, eluding significant progress in system-level transformation. While most funded healthcare translational research supports evidence-based medicine, the proposed ERC-HCT fills a gap by addressing healthcare delivery optimization at a system level, a stubbornly intractable challenge. We will focus on advancing the fundamental sciences essential to address four key research thrusts: care coordination, clinical decision support, population health management, and personalized health. Sciences to be addressed include artificial intelligence, data science, biomedicine, health IT, complex system engineering, and human-computer interaction.  Research will inform healthcare practice, payment, public policy, and provide a rich innovation ecosystem to prepare future leaders and attract new innovative researchers to partner universities, contributing to sustainability. As stakeholders work toward solutions, we anticipate that their views will coalesce around realistic possibilities and pathways forward for achieving the vision for a better engineered, patient-centered healthcare delivery system.  The planning grant activities will focus on engaging these stakeholders to establish leadership, determine a governance structure for the ERC, and develop detailed strategies and action plans to sustain convergence across multiple ongoing research and testbed projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n The main purpose of the Planning Grant was to develop a competitive transdisciplinary, multi-institutional proposal for an Engineering Research Center for Health Care Transformation (ERC-HCT) with a focus on the science of healthcare delivery at the intersection of technology,  engineering, and medicine. Problems of fragmentation in the U.S. healthcare delivery system have been identified as major contributors to escalating costs, medical errors, duplication of services, and suboptimal patient outcomes. These inefficiencies have persisted for decades despite advances in medical science, technologies, health policies, regulation, and resources. This complex systems problem calls for transdisciplinary, convergent research. \n\n\n The vision is a Research Center focused on healthcare delivery transformation through a dynamic, team-based system engineering and design science research approach that is problem driven, iterative, and scalable. We envision a transdisciplinary innovation ecosystem that addresses problems iteratively, spanning the continuum from ideation, to concept, piloting, refinement, and sustainability, with feedback loops that allow outcomes to inform continuous improvement, new research, and evidence-based decision making. The primary aim is to significantly advance the science for reengineering U.S. health care delivery from today?s costly, inconsistent provider-centric system to a better coordinated person-centered care system. To achieve this aim, we proposed to focus on advancing the translation of digital technologies essential to address four key research thrusts: care coordination, clinical decision support, population health management, and personalized health. Essential sciences include artificial intelligence, data science, biomedicine, health IT, complex system engineering, and human-computer interaction. This vision, guided by medical professionals, industry partners, and behavioral scientists, will lead to scientific advancements in the translation of key technologies for transforming healthcare delivery and scientifically validated, sustainable, and scalable models of integrated care systems.  \n\n\nSpecific objectives of the Planning Grant were to: \n 1. Advance team convergence/team formation. \n2. Develop strategies for integrating four ERC foundational components. \n3. Align strategies with national, regional, and local priorities for healthcare transformation. \n4. Refine research strategies and action plans (including clarifying the role of testbeds). \n5. Establish governing and management structures for ERC-HCT. \n6. Work with the stakeholder community to build buy-in and establish priorities. \n7. Submit a competitive Preliminary Proposal for the 2020 Gen-4 Engineering Research Center Program Solicitation (NSF 20-553) and to secure an invite to submit a full proposal. \n\n\n\n\n\n The Planning Grant was led by the University of South Carolina College of Engineering and Computing in partnership with Clemson University College of Engineering, University of Kentucky Healthcare and Regional Extension Center, Johns Hopkins University College of Medicine, Claflin University, and Benedict College. It succeeded in developing a diverse, multidisciplinary research team spanning engineering, computing, healthcare, public health, and social sciences. Healthcare partners included major health systems, public health agencies, and other healthcare institutions and vendors. The research plan was mapped out and illustrated in the required Gen-4 ERC graphic. \n\n\n\n The Planning Grant research team submitted a Preliminary Proposal for the NSF 20-553 Gen-4 Engineering Research solicitation as planned. NSF reported a total of 188 preliminary proposals submitted and unfortunately ours was not one of the select few invited to submit a full proposal. However, the research team restructured our proposal to submit for an NSF South Carolina EPSCOR grant. We also plan to resubmit a revised Preliminary Proposal for the next Gen-4 ERC cycle and to pursue alternative funding options. \n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/10/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Elizabeth A Regan"
