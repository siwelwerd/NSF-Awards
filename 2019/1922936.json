This CDP incorporates a well integrated plan for research and education, and biomechanical characteristics to predict viability in the early-stage embryo. The broadly construed aims include: a) hardware development, b) software development, c) scientific experimentation, d) curricular enhancement, e) educational outreach, and f) science policy: This CDP  will produce new hardware and software technology to investigate and fundamental questions about changes to the Aphysical properties of the embryo in the moments and hours following fertilization and early development, as well as use that technology to answer some such questions. Together with my collaborators, I will perform the first-in-human studies necessary to validate the relevance and significance of this methodology to address questions regarding fertility that are of broad interest to developmental biologists. In view of recent evidence of the predictive power of imaging-based markers for assessing the viability of embryos, the results of this CDP will likely transform the clinical practice of fertility treatments like in-vitro fertilization.",
