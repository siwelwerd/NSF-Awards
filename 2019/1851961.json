 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the Morton Arboretum, located in Lisle, IL, will support the training of 8 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2019- 2021. Research focuses on the use of trees as model systems to gain a broad understanding of evolution, ecology, conservation, and management in natural and built environments.  The Center for Tree Science (CTS) researchers will guide students through the scientific process using an integrative approach, where different scientific fields are combined on a focal topic (trees, in this case) to conduct solution-based science. This REU will foster intellectual development, critical thinking, independence, self-confidence, and perseverance that will benefit students as they pursue a career in any field. Field trips, science communication training, and networking events with regional REU sites are highlights of the program. Students present their results at a research symposium. Applications are recruited nationally, through listservs and job boards. Applications are encouraged from NSF-recognized under-represented minority (URM) students both locally and nationally, students from colleges where research opportunities are limited, and outstanding beginning students (first and second year).\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that a total of 24 students, primarily URM students, students from limited-research institutions, and beginning students, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will go on to present their work at national scientific conferences. Successful projects can be continued the following year through fellowships offered by the Center for Tree Science.\r\n\r\nA common web-based assessment tool used by all REU Site programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program is available by visiting http://www.mortonarb.org/reu, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Chuck Cannon at ccannon@mortonarb.org) or the co-PI (Dr. Silvia Alvarez-Clare at salvarezclare@mortonarb.org).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
