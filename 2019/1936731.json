 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF Convergence Accelerator supports team-based, multidisciplinary efforts that address challenges of national importance and show potential for deliverables in the near future. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact and potential societal benefit of this Convergence Accelerator Phase I project is to create tools that will make it easier for anyone, including non-programmers, to contribute to an open knowledge network, which is a nonproprietary, shared knowledge infrastructure that facilitates searches and queries of all publicly available data. An overarching thrust of NSF?s 2019 Convergence Accelerator program is to create an open knowledge network (OKN) and this specific project?s efforts have the potential to improve the development of knowledge networks in any topical domain. The project effort will build upon the team's existing research to enhance a programming tool that will allow people without programming expertise to acquire and use large, complex datasets from the web, so that anyone can contribute to an open knowledge network and help create a shared resource of broad value. \r\n\r\nThe motivation for the project is the need for researchers, decision-makers, and the public to have access to more thorough and current data, focusing first on data relevant to the broad fields of sociology, public policy, and economics. The project seeks to create tools so that social scientists can enrich an existing OKN containing government datasets with the dynamic view of the world presented by website data. This project will produce programming tools that allow social scientists (or any researcher) to create ontologies and link datasets without extensive programming training. To create a truly open OKN - that can be extended by untrained consumers, data providers, and other non-coders - requires highly learnable programming techniques. This project expands the team's prior advances in the field of learnable programming to build an OKN interface around cutting-edge technologies that merge programming languages, human-computer interaction, and programming-by-demonstration. Concretely, using the tool this project will develop a user will be able to encounter a target dataset on a website, the tool will demonstrate how to collect a small sample of the data, show the user how to annotate the data with its ontology (connections to other terms and ideas), then based on the user's input, the tool will write the program to extract the next trillion data points from the website and enter them into the OKN.  The team also envisions that the tool can then suggest other datasets that may be appropriate to link, and the user can enter into a conversation with the tool to refine one or more linked scripts. The research team will build on their existing partnerships to ensure usability best practices for a range of target audiences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis work identified the key data programming obstacles that prevent non-technical domain experts from taking advantage of the insights present in the data available on the web.  In keeping with the C-Accel Phase I process, our work focused on formal need-finding research.  Via formative studies, insight distillation, and prototyping, we identified the key \"programming gaps\" that stand between non-technical users--like social scientists--and the answers that the Open Knowledge Network (OKN) can give them.\n\n\nFormative interviews: Our top priority was to recruit interviewees from a diversity of fields, and with a diversity of training in data programming.  Our final pool of expert interviewees included non-profit research managers, public health department epidemiologists, academic geographers, criminologists, sociologists, and lawyers. Two of the most surprising insights included: Lack of control over dataset design frustrates and hobbles users of pre-existing datasets. (2) Collecting suitable datasets is the hardest task, but building trust in a dataset is very difficult too.\n\n\nLarge-scale survey: The insights from the interviews (1) influenced our early prototyping; and (2) allowed us to design the next stage of our formative research, a large-scale survey of data scientists that we conducted in Spring 2020.\n\n\nProgramming Gaps: Together, the interviews and our survey yielded critical guidance for the design of our extensible OKN, from high-level takeaways about where to focus our efforts to low-level feedback about user interface details.  The most useful outcome of our Phase I investigation was to distill four \"programming gaps,\" which are any tasks that a non-coder user wants to tackle but cannot complete with available programming tools.  \n\n\nGap 1: Dataset Collection, Especially Web Scraping.  Experts across many domains have identified websites as a key source of large, rich, ecologically valid datasets.  Across academia, industry, and government, workers are reaching exciting new outcomes by combining established data sources&mdash;e.g., censuses and surveys&mdash;with new, dynamic and real-time data sources, especially web sources, but only when they can hire programmers to write the data collection programs.\n\n\nGap 2: Dataset Integration.  The current dataset integration process involves a mix of manual data augmentation and spreadsheet programming. For non-coders, this state of the art is convoluted and inaccessible especially when integrating messier data. \n\n\nGap 3: Data Quality Assurance.  The need for data QA support may surprise some readers, but many teams in our formative studies revealed that this task alone was responsible for more than half of their time. Automating the QA process is critical for static datasets, but even more so for continuously updated web data.\n\n\nGap 4: Dataset Visualization with Dashboards.  The ultimate purpose of a knowledge graph is to enable the analysis of data. We learned that many stakeholders perform data analysis through dashboards that aggregate charts, maps, and other visualizations of the dataset. To support exploring the dataset, dashboards include interactive panels that control filtering and focusing.  \n\n\nPrototyping.  We augmented our formal need-finding and formative work with hands-on prototyping of tools to bridge these gaps, focused especially on interfaces for Gap 1 (see https://helena-lang.org/) and Gap 4 (see https://falx.cs.washington.edu/).  Both of these prototyping efforts have produced follow-up research that continues to produce new program synthesis and new user interaction model innovations.\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/10/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rastislav Bodik"
