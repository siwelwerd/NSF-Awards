 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding how new species are maintained is a major goal of evolutionary biology. When similar species live in different habitats, natural selection may produce different specializations for each species. In North America, there are several species of small birds known as chickadees. Some chickadee species live in warmer climates, others live in colder ones. When their ranges overlap, the different species can hybridize with one another. The goal of the research is to understand whether hybrid chickadees have less efficient metabolisms and reduced survival when compared with non-hybrid chickadees. If hybrids have low survival this may help maintain separate species. Members of the public will be critical parts of the project. They will help collect data on survival by monitoring backyard bird feeders. In addition, the research team will work with University of Colorado Science Discovery to create educational materials for K-12 classrooms. These materials will explore relevant topics in evolution, physiology and genetics. \r\n\r\nThis research has three aims. The first is to understand patterns of genetic divergence and gene flow between Black-capped and Carolina chickadees. The second is to measure differences in metabolism, body composition and gene expression in these chickadees and their hybrids. The third is to relate the data from the first two aims to fitness and survival. To meet these aims, the research will sample chickadees from populations spanning three latitudinal gradients. Among other data types, the work will combine whole genome sequence data and whole organism performance data with data gathered by the public on over-winter feeding rates to develop an integrated model of how local adaptation contributes to speciation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
