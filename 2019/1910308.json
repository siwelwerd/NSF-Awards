 "awd_abstract_narration": "Autonomous robots can contribute to many real-world applications, such as emergency response and search-and-rescue.  For some applications, however, the cost of deploying large robots may be too high, and small robots are preferred. A common issue with such small robots is navigating reliably in the presence of uncertainty. Current robot modeling and control approaches cannot capture the intricacies imposed by the effect of uncertainty at small scales. In addition, the small size restricts sensor and computational payloads, which limit the robot's perceptual and control capabilities. This project introduces a data-driven modeling framework to quantify and exploit uncertainty via control for reliable navigation of small robots. The project enables undergraduate students to become involved in research, and capitalizes on the student diversity at UC Riverside, a Hispanic-serving Institution, to broaden participation of under-represented groups.\r\n \r\nThis project investigates the mechanisms that uncertainties in robot-environment interactions affect robot behavior. Small robot motion is more stochastic since errors at the actuators and uncertain interactions with the environment amplify errors in pose. The goal is to introduce a platform-agnostic, data-driven modeling framework to quantify uncertainty and subsequently exploit it via control for reliable robot navigation under uncertainty. The specific aims are to: 1) extract dynamics using limited data for modeling uncertain systems; 2) synthesize uncertainty-aware model-based controllers based on derived reduced-order models; and 3) test and validate theoretical analysis and derived models and control algorithms with aerial, ground, and marine robots. Spectral methods are used to extract spatio-temporal dynamics and to quantify uncertainty. A model-reference adaptive control scheme utilizes extracted dynamics and uncertainty for reliable robot navigation. While the basic principles developed in this research are grounded on small robots, this project's findings may generalize to larger robots with limited sensing and noisy actuation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe goal of this project was to develop data-driven modeling strategies that can quantify uncertainty, be exploited for control, and be applied to various different robotic platforms. Towards this goal, the specific aims were to estimate system dynamics from limited data, developing uncertainty aware model-based controllers using the obtained dynamics models, and to test and validate the proposed strategies on aerial, ground, and marine robots. Over the course of the project, our group developed the Knowledge Based Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (KNODE) data-driven system identification framework. KNODE can faithfully represent a systems complex dynamics by blending a mechanistic, first-principles model with a Neural ODE model. Our preliminary results showed that KNODE has the ability to learn predictive models for a wide range of dynamical systems of varying complexity. KNODE performs well when predicting the learned system dynamics outside of the training data set and when extrapolating the dynamics of the system beyond the time window of the training data set. As such, KNODE provides a universal learning framework for extracting good predictive models for a wide range of nonlinear dynamical systems from data, even when the physics are poorly modeled or understood. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding upon these preliminary results, we showed how KNODE can be used to learn swarming strategies for a team of robots, to solve a deformable image registration problem where the objective is to find spatial correspondences between images, and be employed in model time-varying spatiotemporal processes in an adaptive sampling problem. In addition, we also used KNODE to generate accurate dynamic models for use with model predictive controllers. Specifically, we showed how poorly modeled dynamics and/or unmodeled disturbances can significantly impact a vehicles ability to follow desired trajectories. Using KNODE to augment a first principles vehicle dynamics model, we show how our KNODE enhanced model outperforms state-of-the-art GP models and is able to generalize beyond the training data. Lastly, preliminary results show that our novel KNODE-MPC framework can be leveraged to improve the vehicles overall closed-loop performance.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/07/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: M.
