 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2019, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways.  Many animals must cope with seasonal changes in their environment. Most snowshoe hares, for example, molt from brown to white to maintain camouflage against snowy backgrounds in winter. As with many seasonal traits, the timing of these molts is critical. Hares that change color too early or too late are mis-matched to their environment and easily seen by predators. As climate change leads to warmer winters and shorter periods of snow cover, snowshoe hares must adapt their molt timing. Otherwise, populations will decline due to increased predation. To better understand seasonal adaptation, this project will use DNA sequencing of extensive archived tissue samples of snowshoe hares to determine which parts of the genome are associated with adaptation to the environment and affect molt timing. This research addresses fundamental questions in evolutionary biology while also assisting conservation efforts: knowing which genes are important for adaptation will be helpful in identifying which populations of snowshoe hares can adapt to shorter winters and which populations are at risk of disappearing. Outreach events will highlight the research.\r\n\r\nThe archived tissue samples are sourced from a broad network of museum specimens, scientists, trappers, and other stakeholders. These georeferenced samples come from populations of hares from across North America which experience a wide range of environmental conditions and vary in their molt timing. The fellow will combine two approaches to investigate the genetics of adaptation in hares. Landscape genomics will be used to relate DNA sequence data (from exome sequencing) to climactic and environmental variables. Then, divergence mapping will be used on two populations with significant population- and individual-level variation in molt timing to zero in on the regions of the genome that affect seasonal changes in color. Based on this research, the fellow will develop outreach events which will advance the public understanding of science and demonstrate the relevance of evolutionary biology to wildlife and conservation. First, the fellow will create a mobile museum exhibit on snowshoe hares geared to schoolchildren. This exhibit will include video lessons recorded by the fellow such that it can be shared with schools in remote communities.  Second, the fellow will connect the general public with scientists through a series of informal public presentations and discussions at local microbreweries.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In some cases, prey species may change their coloring to better match their changing environment. This is the case for snowshoe hares and white-tailed jackrabbits (a type of hare), two ecologically important prey species in North America. In summer months, hares are brown. During the winter, some populations molt and change their coats to be white to better hide in the snow. Populations of hares in warmer areas without snow, however, do not change color and remain brown all year long. Thus, hares face two &ldquo;choices&rdquo; related to seasonal camouflage. First, they must choose the right color to be in the winter: white in snowy areas, brown in warm areas. Second, if they change color, they must do so at the right time: a hare that molts to white before the snow falls, or that changes back to brown before the snow melts, will not be camouflaged. For hares, camouflage is crucial: mismatched hares are more likely to be eaten by predators. As such, hares could be severely impacted by climate change, which is leading to changes in snow across North America. Though effects can vary locally, the general trend is to less snow and shorter snow seasons. Hares will need to adapt to match these new snow seasons, or they may face increased predation that could lead to population declines or local extinctions. This could destabilize food webs, as hares are important prey species for many predators.

Then, using projections of future environmental conditions due to climate change, we predicted what color jackrabbits should be 60 years in the future. We used these predictions to identify populations that are at risk in the future: namely, populations that are currently winter-white but will need to be winter-brown in the future. We already knew which genes were responsible for making white-tailed jackrabbits winter-white or winter-brown. Next, we used genomic sequencing of white-tailed jackrabbits from multiple states to better understand how these and other genes varied across the United States. We found that white tailed-jackrabbit populations are genetically well-connected, which should facilitate their ability to quickly adapt to changing snow conditions. Further, the frequencies of the winter-white and winter-brown alleles were related to environmental conditions, including snow cover, across the white-tailed jackrabbit range. Finally, we combined our ecological and genetic knowledge into evolutionary simulations. We simulated thousands of populations of white-tailed jackrabbits to understand whether they could adapt to the changes in snow cover that are predicted to occur due to climate change.
