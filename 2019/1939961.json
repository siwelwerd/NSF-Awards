For over 10 years, NOCS has been a forum for innovative research in networks-on-chip (NoC) architectures. The event is dedicated to interdisciplinary research on on-chip, package-scale, chip-to-chip, and data center rack-scale communication technology, architecture, design methods, applications and systems, the NOCS 2019 will bring together scientists and engineers, as well as the best and brightest of the PhD candidates, working on NoC innovations and applications from inter-related research communities, including discrete optimization and algorithms, computer architecture, networking, circuits and systems, packaging, embedded systems, and design automation. The goal of NOCS 2019 and this travel grant is to advance the science of network design by bringing together researchers from across the computer engineering community and to foster cross disciplinary approaches that address shared research challenges. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis travel grant will enable career development and learning opportunities for US-based and/or US citizen graduate students. Attending the NOCS conference could significantly contribute to the career path of students interested in system-level and network design challenges. Students have the opportunity to discuss leading edge research with world-class researchers in science of network design, as well as help them establish connections and mentoring relationships that will serve them well during their research careers. This project aims at increasing the participation of students from underrepresented groups and those from smaller institutions of education and provide them with equal opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
