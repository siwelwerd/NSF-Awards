 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lake Erie College (LEC) and The Nature Conservancy (TNC) have partnered to engage in regional research and educational opportunities.  A part of this partnership involves renovating a building on TNC's Grand River Campus at Morgan Swamp to serve as a hub for research, professional development offerings for STEM teachers, and educational opportunities for students and community members.  The region in which this facility, the Lake Erie College Research and Educational Center (LECREC), will reside faces under-funded and under-performing school districts, particularly in the STEM fields, as well as low levels of environmental awareness and literacy amongst community members.  We intend to provide the space and resources to address these needs, to support the development of local research collaborations, and to encourage future generations of scientifically literate and aware individuals.  In addition, activities conducted at this site can serve as models for other areas of the country suffering from similar challenges in STEM education.\r\n\r\nTo inform the development of the LECREC, LEC and TNC a planning conference designed to gather information that highlights the needs of regional constituents will be conducted and a strategic plan will be developed to address those needs.  There is currently little interaction between educational, research, industrial, community, and government organizations in the region.   To that end, the focus of this conference will be to assemble representatives from each category to facilitate communication between groups, understand the needs for the LECREC of each group, and foster collaboration between groups to better serve the region to ultimately produce a strategic plan to guide the renovation planning of the existing building to meet those needs.  The strategic plan will be distributed to school districts, community organizations, industries and government organizations throughout the region by LEC and TNC public relations channels.  In addition, the strategic plan, subsequent updates to the renovation process, and activities offered at the Grand River Campus will be publically available at www.lec.edu/tnc in order to provide continued collaboration and sharing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOn March 2-3 2020, Lake Erie College (LEC) hosted a planning conference at the Lodge at Geneva-on-the-Lake.  The purpose of this conference was to bring constituents from five identified groups together to establish the Northeast Ohio Natural and Environmental Science Think Tank (NEONESTT).  Job one for this new group was to discuss the development of a unique educational and research facility to serve the region's established needs.  This facility is proposed to be created in an existing structure on The Nature Conservancy (TNC) held Grand River Campus in Ashtabula County.  The building requires substantial renovation, allowing for the constituents to have a say and a stake in the design and implementation process.  Representatives from each group - K-12 education, higher education, government organizations, industry, and non-government organizations/citizen - worked first within their group to identify needs specific to each constituent group and then as a member of mixed groups to identify needs for the facility and benefits to the region.    The general themes for regional benefit from the mixed group exercises focused on improving regional education, regional economies and tourism, transparency and community involvement, environmental awareness, and environmental and individual health.\n\nAdditionally, all participants were asked to reflect and identify means by which they could individually contribute to bringing the vision of the space to fruition.  Participants from each constituent group volunteered to take on various roles, with the most frequent being (1) serving on a board or committee,  (2) curriculum development, (3) grant writing, and (4) research, and (5) building collaboration across constituent groups.  This information has allowed representatives from LEC and TNC to form a steering committee to help inform the renovation and usage of the facility as well as beginning to identify subcommittees that will aid in the renovation process.  Currently identified subcommittee goals, based on participant feedback, are grant writing, K-12 curriculum development, research focused on understanding and sustaining the regional ecosystems, and collaboration/promotion. \n\nThe Appreciative Inquiry approach was used to guide idea development, gather data, and help participants identify how they will be able to continue to participate in NEONESTT beyond this initial conference. This method focuses on positive building of ideas rather than identifying weaknesses that need to be overcome.  As a result, participants were focused on what could be accomplished through this project without negative feedback on ideas.  This positive organizational approach provided for the collection of both quantitative and qualitative data.  Data regarding 1) the capacity of constituents to communicate and form partnerships, 2) a detailed list of organizations, and 3) corresponding benefits specific to that organization along with benefits to entire community were collected.  In addition, a description of what can result from successful collaboration, aligned partnerships, and innovative, creative community/group efforts was created. A list of committed stakeholders was established.\n\nThis conference successfully framed the needs and benefits of the renovation project through ongoing NEONESTT collaborations.  The overall result was that 43 of the 60 participants (72 percent) listed at least one way in which they would like to help as part of NEONESTT moving forward with at least one representative from each constituent group.  Of those 43, 17 (40 percent) listed multiple ways in which they would be willing to serve as part of NEONESTT post-conference.  This suggests that our regional constituents have a strong interest in seeing this project completed.  Further, these results indicate that the Appreciative Inquiry approach created the desired positive environment and that most participants felt engaged and heard as they are willing to continue.  As such, the NEONESTT planning conference was viewed as a success and may serve as a model for similar projects in the future.  Comprehensive data can be found at www.lec.edu/NEONESTT for public reference.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/05/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Johnathan Tedesco"
