 "awd_abstract_narration": "NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis award supports theoretical and computational research and education in granular and soft-matter materials. Granular and soft-matter materials are ubiquitous in nature and every day life.  One such class of materials is dry granular materials, which includes powders, seeds, grains, sand, and gravel.  Another class are classified among soft-matter materials, and generally consist of particles suspended in fluids. These include: emulsions consisting of droplets of one fluid suspended in a second fluid, such as mayonnaise, vinaigrettes, and homogenized milk; foams consisting of bubbles of gas suspended in a fluid, such as shaving cream, soap bubbles, and whipped cream; and suspensions consisting of solid particles suspended in a fluid, such as ketchup, mustard, and paint.  These materials are important for a wide variety of technologies and industrial processes, from the processing of pharmaceuticals and foods, to transportation of seeds and grains, to materials fabrication.  \r\n\r\nAt the simplest level of abstraction, one may think of these materials as consisting of large particles, for which thermal fluctuations are negligible, that interact only when they come into contact with each other, in which case they repel.  Yet despite this seeming simplicity, surprisingly complex behavior may emerge, in particular a transition from a flowing liquid-like state to a rigid but disordered solid state, as either the particle packing density or applied stress is varied.  This is known as the \"jamming transition.\"  In this project, computer simulations will be used to investigate the nature of this jamming transition, along with more general behavior of such materials that emerges under shear driven flow where adjacent granular layers move parallel to each other with different relative speed.  Different mechanisms for energy dissipation, and the effects of different particle shapes will be investigated.\r\n\r\nThis project will also promote the teaching, training, and engagement in science and research, of a wide range of students across multiple institutions.  Undergraduate students will gain experience in both scientific research and scientific communication by presenting work at local and national research conferences.  Graduate students will be trained in the methods of modern theory and high-performance computing and experience research with direct interaction between theory and experiment. In this way, they become prepared for future high-tech careers in academia or industry.  The infrastructure for research and education will be enhanced by the formation of a network of collaborations with domestic and international colleagues engaged in complementary experimental and computational research in this area.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis award supports theoretical and computational research and education in granular and soft-matter materials. Computer simulations will be carried out to study different aspects of the behavior of granular and soft-matter materials near the jamming transition that marks the abrupt change from a flowing liquid-like state to a rigid but disordered solid state, as the particle packing is increased.  Materials of interest include dry granular matter, dense granular particles in a slurry, emulsions, foams, non-Brownian suspensions, and colloids.  Specific problems will be investigated, with the objective of increasing understanding about the flowing liquid and disordered solid phases of such materials, and the transitions between them. These include:  (i) the physical mechanisms behind shear banding of shear flowing materials in homogeneous environments; (ii) the relation between discontinuous shear thickening, the rapid jump in shear stress upon increasing the strain rate,  and microscopic inter-particle elastic friction; (iii) the differences between isotropic compressional jamming and shear jamming, in systems of frictional particles; (iv) the effect of orientational ordering and particle tumbling on the shear flow of materials consisting of aspherical particles; (v) the criticality of the shear-driven jamming transition for aspherical particles; (vi) the effect of particle surface concavity on shearing rheology.  Collaborations with experimental groups working in these areas will help inform and guide theoretical progress.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Significant energy loss arises due to inefficiencies in the processing of granular materials, and substantial economic gain would accrue from a better understanding of the structural and flow properties of granular materials. Understanding granular systems thus offers the potential for improvements in many areas of industry and technology.\n\nAs granular particles get packed more tightly together, they undergo a \"jamming\" transition from a flowing liquid-like state to a rigid but disordered solid-like state. This project focused on numerical investigations of this jamming transition in varied circumstances, using simple mathematical models.  For a model of spherical frictionless particles, we demonstrated that the critical behavior of the jamming transition, measured by the divergence of system viscosities, is independent of the strain distortion that drives the jamming.  The shear viscosity, in shear-driven jamming, diverges the same way as the bulk viscosity in compression-driven jamming.  This demonstrates that the jamming transition is \"universal\", i.e. independent of the symmetry of the stress tensor at jamming.\n\nWe considered the jamming of non-spherical frictionless particles with a rod-like shape.  Each particle thus has a particular orientation, given by the direction of the rod's long axis.  When isotropically compressed, such particles jam with random orientations.  When sheared, the particles were found to rotate with a non-uniform angular velocity, leading to a net average particle orientation in the steady-state.  Surprisingly, as the aspect ratio tends to unity and the rod-like particles approach spheres, there remains a finite orientational ordering of the particles.  We also considered the shearing of a dilute number of rod-like particles immersed in a background of spherical particles.  We found that the presence of the spheres caused the rod-like particles to be attracted to each other and form clusters.\n\nNumerical simulations of frictional spherical particles were used to analyze experiments on a system of cyclically compressed, gravity compacted, spheres.  Simulations showed good agreement with experiment in predicting the translational and rotational motion of the particles.  It was found that, within the bulk of the sample, rotations and contact point sliding, rather than translations, provide the main mechanism for energy dissipation in the system, highlighting the importance of rotational motion for understanding behavior in frictional granular systems.\n\nExperimental studies were carried out to investigate the collective behavior of self-propelled (\"active\") particles in a confined geometry, specifically vinegar eels confined to small fluid droplets.

He conducted his own experiments on the collective motion of vinegar eels confined to small fluid droplets.  In September 2022 he started a tenure-track position as Assistant Professor of Physics at California State University, Fullerton.
