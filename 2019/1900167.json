 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for US participation in the conference \"Great Lakes Mathematical Physics\" that will be held June 28-30, 2019 at Oberlin College.\r\n \r\nThe conference focuses on recent developments in mathematical physics, specifically in the areas of random matrices, quantum spin systems, one- and many-body localization in disordered quantum systems, the KPZ equation and universality class, and rigorous results in general relativity.  A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference.  This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference.   The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.   More information will be made available at:  https://sites.google.com/msu.edu/glamp2019/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
