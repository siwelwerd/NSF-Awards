 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will support a symposium entitled \"New Frontiers in Antarctic Marine Biology\" at the 2020\r\nSociety of Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB) meeting will be held 3-7 January in Austin,\r\nTexas. SICB has approximately 3000 members whose research interests span a wide range of biological\r\ntopics and their annual meetings are widely advertised and attended. Topical areas will include, among\r\nothers, the recent dramatic ecological impacts of climate changes across multiple trophic levels in\r\nAntarctic seas, advances in molecular and physiological aspects of cold adaptation in marine algae,\r\ninvertebrates, and fish, the role of chemical ecology in structuring nearshore macroalgal-mesograzer\r\ninteractions in communities of the Antarctic Peninsula, revising phylogeographic patterns in Antarctica in\r\nthe age of 'omics,' and advances in the use of biogeochemical markers to track diets and movement of\r\nAntarctic marine predators.\r\n\r\nThe unique marine environment of Antarctica provides an exciting opportunity to showcase a broadly\r\nbased symposium on aspects of the biology of its rich and diverse marine life. Not only are the topics in\r\nthe proposed symposium timely and to be presented by leaders in the field, they will encompass cutting\r\nedge science, novel techniques, and future directions. The presentations will be of pertinence to biologists\r\n(graduate students, post-docs, and research faculty) working in temperate and tropical marine\r\nenvironments, as well as polar marine environments\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWith the critical assistance of this NSF funded project we organized, coordinated, and directed a full-day society-wide symposium at the 2020 meetings of the Society of Integrated and Comparative Biology (SICB) entitled New Frontiers in Antarctic Marine Biology.  The symposium explored current and future directions of research in the rapidly expanding, dynamic, timely, and forward looking field of Antarctic Marine Biology.  The symposium took place at the annual SICB conference on January 3-7, 2020 in Austin, Texas.  Importantly, the symposium followed in the decadal footsteps of former SICB (ASZ) full-day symposia on Antarctic Marine Biology that took place in 1990, 2000, and 2010, and which all had papers published a symposium volume in the American Zoologist or in the current society journal Integrative and Comparative Biology.  The symposium assembled top researchers in Antarctic Marine Biology, their research assistants, postdoctoral associates, and graduate and undergraduate students.  Invitations to the symposium were promoted on web sites hosted by SICB, the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), and the Ecological Society of American (ESA).  \n\nEleven invited speakers, who are among the foremost in their field, and which emphasized representation by female and early career investigators, presented an overview of new frontiers in Antarctic Marine Biology.  The speakers covered a broad spectrum of topics that emphasized cutting edge science, novel techniques, and future directions.  Topical areas included, among others, biogeography, chemical ecology, physiological adaptation, microbial ecology, planktonic systems, fjord ecology, among others.  Almost all of the presentations encompassed aspects of the impacts of rapid climate change in Antarctica.\n\nPapers presented at the symposium are to published shortly in a symposium volume of Integrative and Comparative Biology.  These publications will provide an important and timely reference source for those interested in key advances and new frontiers in the field of Antarctic Marine Biology and in polar marine biology, in general.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/16/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James B Mcclintock"
