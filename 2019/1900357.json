 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although individual animals have long been considered a fundamental unit of evolution, we now know that each is really a co-dependent collection of host animal and microbes. This co-dependency reaches from ancient times through to the present day. Many animals depend on gut bacteria to process food and incorporate essential nutrients into the host's own tissues.  To untangle the importance of this partnership for hosts and symbiotic gut bacteria, this project will study a diverse and ecologically important social animal group, the turtle ants.  As social organisms, ants and humans share ways for acquiring helpful and harmful bacteria.  State-of-the-art molecular and genomic methods will be used to investigate ancient and modern influences on the symbiosis, the function of the bacteria for host health, and the means of passage and maintenance of the bacterial symbionts over millions of years.\r\n\r\nExplaining global patterns of biodiversity and their drivers have long been central challenges in the fields of ecology and evolution.  Increasingly, it is becoming apparent that biodiversity is itself a function of interactions across different levels of biological organization.  Among the metazoans, symbioses with microbes are a defining feature, and individuals are integrated collections of host and symbiont cells, together defining the \"holobiont\".  By studying the diverse and tractable turtle ant system, this research will address the relationships between symbiosis and the dimensions of holobiont biodiversity with unprecedented clarity.  Specifically, this research will address: 1) the roles of time, biogeography, and habitat in host diversification (host taxonomic dimension); 2) variation in gut communities across host ant phylogeny, geography, habitat, and ecological niches (symbiont taxonomic dimension integrated with host taxonomic and functional dimensions); 3) the extent of codiversification for ~10 core, host-specific symbiont lineages, and the impacts of host phylogeny, geography, and ecology on symbiont transfer (symbiont taxonomic dimension integrated with host taxonomic and functional dimensions); 4) variation in genome evolution and innovation across symbionts with varying degrees of codiversification, and across genes with varying function (taxonomic, genetic, and functional integration of hosts and symbionts); and 5) symbiont function in light of symbiont genome evolution, host-symbiont codiversification, and host phylogeny, geography, and ecology (taxonomic, genetic, and functional integration of hosts and symbionts).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit: To understand the aspects of the host and environment that structure gut bacterial communities we investigated the species rich turtle ant genus Cephalotes, which has maintained its core bacterial community for 50 million years.  Research from this project has shown that these gut bacteria recycle nitrogenous waste and provide essential amino acids to the host.  In addition, the nitrogen produced by these gut bacteria are used by the host to build a strong cuticle, an important characteristic of the turtle ants.  Without their symbiotic gut bacteria these ants are unable to develop normally, and these bacteria are found nowhere else except with their turtle ant host, showing the strength of this symbiotic relationship.  Further we see that the bacteria themselves are structured across the digestive tract with some bacteria found alone in some gut compartments and others in mixed communities.  Overall our project is helping us understand the functions of gut bacterial communities in hosts and the host and microbe factors that help maintain a healthy gut community.\n\nBroader Impact: Findings from this project were incorporated into two public museum exhibits allowing a broad and diverse audience to learn about the importance of ants in the ecosystem and how some species rely on their gut bacteria to thrive on nutritionally pour diets.  We also partnered with science communicators to create YouTube videos about our work, reaching millions of viewers.  We also engaged undergraduates and graduate students directly into this research, with many of them becoming authors of scientific research publications.  These students come from a very diverse set of backgrounds and were exposed to rigorous scientific research and participated in professional development opportunities including workshops, conferences, and presenting their findings.   \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/01/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Corrie S Moreau"
