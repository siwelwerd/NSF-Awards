 "awd_abstract_narration": "Within the geological community, collaboration through a shared database would facilitate  discovery and new scientific breakthroughs. However, geological data has proven difficult to  enter into digital formats, necessary for a shared database, because of the nature of the data itself and the varied and complex methods used to collect these data. The StraboSpot digital data system was designed to overcome these  difficulties and allow data from the geological sciences to become more easily accessible to both  scientists and citizens. The new work will allow for the development of new mobile user  interfaces, allowing geologists to collect field data in ways that are efficient and go beyond what  is currently possible in a paper notebook and map. The new application will also integrate data  collected at the microscopic level, including information about rock composition. Finally, the  data and interpretations will be made available through search capabilities that will use the  StraboSpot data repository. The broader impacts of this work include the engagement of scientists to best develop ways to share the data they collect, and the easier access to this data for scientists and the public.\r\n\r\nAs part of the development efforts in this project, various geologic  communities will be involved in initial design and evaluation. Continued engagement of these communities  through field trips, workshops, and student outreach help to identify three objectives that will improve the data system and will lead to wider adoption and use of StraboSpot. The objectives are to: 1) Develop new mobile user interfaces - determined by ongoing and future  conversations with the communities - that will allow practitioners to collect field data in ways  that are compelling, efficient, and go beyond what is currently possible in a paper notebook or on  a paper map; 2) Incorporate petrological data into the micrograph/thin section component of the  database, in addition to creating a desktop user interface that works seamlessly with data  collected with analytical instruments (such as scanning electron microscopes); and 3) Design and  implement interfaces and transfer protocols to efficiently extract information from the  StraboSpot data repository. If successful, StraboSpot will impact all practitioners in the geological sciences, motivating new and  innovative research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis proposal aimed to increase community adoption and use of a digital data system named StraboSpot. StraboSpot allows digital recording, storage, and retrieval of scientific information. As a result of this proposal, we have expanded this data system, which now consists of three separate parts: (1) StraboField is for geologists studying rocks in the field; (2) StraboMicro is for geologists studying rocks using microscopes; and (3) StraboExperimental is for scientists that experimentally deform rocks.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nWe completely re-designed field-based StraboField based on input from the community. This application has been thoroughly tested by geologists in the field and modified for streamlined use. For StraboMicro and StraboExperimental, vocabulary and data standards were developed with the rock deformation community in the US, with collaboration from European colleagues. The StraboMicro interface, also designed through community feedback, provides a flexible image management system that allows users to connect data with images. Because of the flexibility of the system, others in the geoscience community are now adopting the system. The StraboExperimental interface records community-approved metadata necessary for this community to share and reuse data. In all cases, we have engaged the relevant academic communities. We have utilized smallgroupsof scientists to use the data system to provide feedback to improve it.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe broader impacts of this work are significant. We have engaged the structural geology, tectonics, and experimental rock deformation practitioners in a community-based activity and have successfully agreed on standards for digital data sharing. To a lesser degree, we have involved the petrology, geochronology, and sedimentology communities. Our efforts will allow open communication of geological data to the community for sharing and reuse and provide relevant data to allied fields. In addition, our approach can be used as a template for other communities attempting to develop digital data systems. Under the funding of this grant, we also participated in a study of how to create sustainable data systems in the Earth Sciences.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nFinally, we supported a group of geoscience graduate students and postdoctoral fellows whose insight and efforts were required to complete this project successfully.
