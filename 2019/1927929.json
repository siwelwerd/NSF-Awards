 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this acoustic monitoring technology for remote pumping equipment is to help ensure the reliable and continuous flow of critical products, such as public water or oil and gas while increasing societal well-being and reducing industrial carbon footprint.  The initial focus will be on equipment such as compressors, valves or pumps located in a remote or dangerous location. This novel acoustic method and the corresponding AI analytics brings novel and advanced functionalities at a fraction of the cost of existing methods. This allows users such as water companies or oil producers to reduce the energy needs of their equipment while reducing downtime and enabling early detection of many types of failures.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project further develops an acoustic monitoring platform for remote pumping equipment.  It is a full stack internet of things solution for the monitoring, diagnostic and control of industrial equipment. Acoustic monitoring is a novel method that uses sensors to detect complex issues in remote pumping equipment. Simple surface sensors give important insight on the running condition of underground or remote equipment by integrating acoustic sensing with AI analytics. A control solution then adjusts the running condition of the equipment to extend its lifetime and increase its efficiency. The proposed industrial control solution aims to reduce down time, decrease leakage and increase the efficiency and output of many industrial pumps.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
