 "awd_abstract_narration": "As new species arise and older species become extinct, life on Earth is shaped and re-shaped over many millions of years.  Biologists seek to understand how particular traits of organisms---the size of an animal or the flower color of a plant, for example---affect the chances of giving rise to a new species or suffering extinction. This project develops computational tools to help identify traits that consistently affect speciation and extinction. It further applies the tools to understand the history of particular plant groups, including ones with agriculturally and economically valuable species. Undergraduate science opportunities and mentoring specifically target veterans of the armed services. A workshop and individual advising will equip young researchers with technical skills that are valuable for a variety of future careers. The international collaboration between American and Israeli labs will train students and postdoctoral researchers and hold workshops to build communities of young scientists working with phylogenetic comparative methods.\r\n\r\nInferring trait-dependent lineage diversification from phylogenetic trees is difficult. There is currently a need for methods that are both powerful and reliable, and for tools to distinguish when methods perform well or poorly. In this project, two novel modeling techniques target weaknesses recently revealed in current methods. The first incorporates sequence evolution into models of trait evolution, to allow shifts in diversification rate to be explained by processes at both those levels. The second focuses on connections between diversification and trait shifts, rather than their values, to avoid the statistical problem of pseudoreplication. Two computational tools provided by this project improve the usage of existing and future methods. One is a community-driven database of benchmark tests to compare how methods perform across diverse scenarios. The other is a means of assessing model adequacy, to guide confidence in empirical conclusions and directions for future model development. Finally, this project investigates the macroevolutionary dynamics of two traits that have major effects on plant phenotypes and genotypes: breeding system and whole genome duplication. Methodological advances and expanded datasets provide the potential to make the strongest cases yet for the importance of species selection in shaping biodiversity.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\nJust as the survival and reproduction of individuals shapes the evolution of populations, the survival and reproduction of whole species (avoiding extinction and splitting into new species) shapes the evolution of biodiversity.  The goal of this project was to develop and apply computational methods that use the phylogenetic tree of relationships among species to reveal how evolving traits affect rates of speciation and extinction.  Our main findings were: (1) phylogenetic tests of trait-dependent lineage diversification can be confounded if the trait also affects the rate of molecular sequence evolution; (2) a novel phylogenetic model can reveal traits whose evolutionary rate is affected by how long it has remained in a species; (3) breeding system is associated with differing rates of lineage diversification, even allowing for the effects of other traits.  Results have been disseminated through publications in leading journals and presentations at universities and conferences.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nAll project staff engaged in activities to make phylogenetics more accessible to biologists who might not yet have a strong background in modeling and computing.  This included an intensive week-long workshop (25 students and 10 instructors from schools across the country) in general methodologies and applications, several shorter workshops focused on the RevBayes software, and additional efforts to improve publicly-posted tutorials and other documentation.  The project's three postdocs and one technician moved on to positions in academia, industry, and secondary education.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/26/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Emma E Goldberg"
