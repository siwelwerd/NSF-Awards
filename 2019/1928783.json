 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA) is a premier forum for research on computer architecture, the hardware/software interface, and systems architecture. This award provides travel support for up to 20 students attending this flagship conference in June 2019 at Phoenix, Arizona, USA. ISCA embraces systems research that directly targets these new problems in new ways. Historically, the conference has attracted top research papers from both academia and industry, and many innovations published in the proceedings have been influential in the history of the processor industry. The acceptance rates for submitted papers is typically between 15-20%. \r\n\r\nThis award will have two primary direct benefits. First, The ISCA conference is strengthened as a result of better student attendance that this travel support enables, since they are the next-generation of the research workforce in this domain. Second, those students receiving travel support personally benefit from the opportunity to interact with peers and experts, as well as to establish connections that will help their professional careers. An undergraduate workshop at the event is one part of the computer architecture communities' efforts towards increasing diversity, and the travel funding seeks to also support students from underrepresented groups within the undergraduate attendees at the event.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
