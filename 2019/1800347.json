 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will increase the body of knowledge on the genomics of bacteriophages. \r\n\r\nThe goals of Salish Kootenai College's Science Education Alliance-Phage Hunters Advancing Genomics and Evolutionary Science in Tribal Colleges and Universities (SEA-PHAGES in TCUs) Project are to provide exciting professional development opportunities for STEM faculty, expand research-based learning opportunities for STEM students, and build institutional research capacity through participation in the SEA-PHAGES curriculum offered in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI). Faculty and students will isolate, identify, sequence and analyze newly discovered mycobacteriophages gathered from the local environment as part of a long-term, nationwide study. Faculty at SKC will learn novel laboratory procedures, participate in national training workshops, and enhance their research skills and knowledge. Students enrolled in the dual-credit STEM Academy will study genomics and bioinformatics, gain valuable hands-on laboratory experience, and participate in cutting edge research. Knowledge and skills gathered through this project will provide a strong foundation for future teaching and research in genomics, biotechnology and bioinformatics at Salish Kootenai College.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
