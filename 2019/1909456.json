 "awd_abstract_narration": "The abundance of Lithium, relative to Hydrogen, is a key prediction of Big Bang models of the early universe.  Abundances of the elements can be measured using the absorption lines in stellar spectra.  But Lithium can also be destroyed in stars when convection mixes surface material with the hotter stellar interiors.  Low abundance of Lithium in stellar atmospheres is seen among stars where processes that deplete Lithium would not be expected to occur, and abundances are far lower than predicted for stars where such depletion processes are expected to be operating.   This team will measure the abundance of Lithium in the atmospheres of a carefully selected sample of stars in order to better understand physical processes inside stars.  They hope to determine whether the Sun is a normal or abnormal star for its mass and age, whether there is variation in Lithium destruction among supposedly identical stars, and better understand the disagreement between the Big Bang Lithium abundance inferred from the microwave background observations and that seen in stellar atmospheres.  This is a collaborative effort among astronomers at four universities, including a predominantly undergraduate institution.  This project will lead to at least one PhD thesis and extend the educational opportunities for undergraduates at the individual schools by integrating a team of students in a large-scale research program, using astronomical observatories in Arizona, California, and Australia.\r\n\r\nThe research team will extend and expand its spectroscopic studies of stars in open and globular clusters, emphasizing the old open clusters M67 and NGC188, and the nearest globular cluster, NGC6397.  Their goals are (a) determine whether the Sun is a normal or abnormal star for its mass and age, (b) determine if there is variation in the physical mechanisms controlling Li destruction among supposedly identical stars, (c) pioneer studies on the role of stellar metal content in determining the level of Li-depletion, and (d) study the potential impact of stellar evolution on metal deficient stars of the halo, with implications for the true level of disagreement (if any) between the value of the Big Bang Li abundance inferred from the microwave background versus that inferred from halo dwarf surface Li abundances.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nLithium (Li) survives only in the outermost layers of stars, and thus the measured surface stellar abundances of lithium can reveal the action of physical processes connecting the surface to layers below, such as diffusion, mass loss, different kinds of mixing, and effects due to magnetic fields. Previous work with Li has shown that physical processes actually do occur in stars beyond those included in the standard model (no rotation, diffusion, mass loss, magnetic fields) and suggests that rotational mixing induced by loss of stellar angular momentum is the dominant mixing mechanism.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nA related issue is the prediction, from standard Big Bang theory, that the amount of Li produced during the first ten minutes of the life of the Universe (Big Bang Nucleosynthesis) should have been about three times larger than the very similar Li abundances observed in the very oldest stars. These stars are metal-poor because all elements heavier than Li were created through various processes, over time, after Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. So these earliest generations of stars formed with essentially the Big Bang Li abundance (and almost no metals), and the question that tests Big Bang theory becomes, could these stars have depleted their (surface) Li abundances during their lifetime to their observed value from some higher value?\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe details of how stars deplete their surface Li over time depends on their metallicity, and unfortunately, we cannot quantify this effect empirically by observing metal-poor stars of different ages because all metal-poor stars are very old. However, we know a lot about how stars with solar metallicity deplete their Li over time. Learning how stars of intermediate metallicity deplete their Li would provide a critically important bridge between this knowledge and the question of how metal-poor stars deplete their Li, and thus knowledge about the value of the Big Bang Li abundance.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nWe have thus embarked on a program to study surface stellar Li abundances in star clusters of intermediate metallicity. Star clusters are ideal laboratories because all stars in a given cluster formed at the same time and thus have the same age, and unlike for most astronomical objects, this age can be determined. For main sequence stars (that is, stars converting hydrogen to helium via fusion reactions), results are often reported as the Li abundances of cluster stars as a function of their mass, as tracked by their surface temperature (Teff). Clusters with solar metallicity and different ages show the following. Initially, the Li-Teff relation is flat but changes over time as stars of different mass deplete their Li by different amounts. Low mass stars including ones with one solar mass deplete a lot of Li; stars slightly more massive deplete less Li; then stars near 1.5 solar masses deplete Li severely, and more massive stars deplete Li more slowly. This Li peak near 1.2 solar masses is fairly narrow. In contrast, metal-poor stars show an extended Li-Teff plateau instead of a narrow Li-Teff peak. Not surprisingly, we find that clusters with intermediate metallicity show an intermediate pattern: a more extended Li-Teff plateau than solar metallicity stars, but not as extended as in metal-poor stars.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/26/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ConstantinePDeliyannis\n"
