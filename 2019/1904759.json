 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a need to develop new, environmentally friendly routes to fuels and chemical feedstocks from renewable sources. With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Neil Marsh from the University of Michigan Ann Arbor to examine how a newly-discovered class of enzymes remove carbon dioxide from unreactive starting materials to make them more chemically reactive and likely to form value-added commodity chemicals. Understanding the basic mechanisms of reaction for these enzymes will allow the development of highly efficient \"green\" catalysts to potentially replace energy-intensive industrial processes. Such biocompatible, biodegradable and non-toxic catalysts dovetail with efforts to replace fossil hydrocarbons for the production of commodity chemicals that are cost-effective, low-energy and sustainable.  In synergy with the scientific goals, the project advances the education, training and professional development of undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral scientists (including those from underrepresented minority groups) in the interdisciplinary area of chemical biology.\r\n\r\nThe project will elucidate the mechanisms of three prenylated-flavin (prFMN) decarboxylases that appear to use the same cofactor to catalyze decarboxylation reactions through three distinct mechanisms.  These enzymes are: ferulic acid decarboxylase in which prFMN is hypothesized to react by a dipolar cycloaddition mechanism; 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase in which prFMN may react by an electrophilic mechanism; and phenazine-1-carboxylate decarboxylase for which evidence suggests prFMN may react by a radical mechanism. The experimental approaches include steady state and pre-steady state kinetic analyses combined with isotopically-labelled substrates.  These studies determine the rates of formation and breakdown of enzyme intermediates.  The researches also identify unstable covalent intermediates formed between substrates and prFMN using novel mass spectrometry methods that allow for the analysis of proteins in their native state.  Finally, the researchers will probe the reaction pathways with substrate analogs that may function as mechanism-based inhibitors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEnzymes are proteins that catalyze all the chemical reactions in cells that are necessary for life.  There is increasing interest in using enzymes to catalyze industrial chemical reactions because they are extremely efficient, renewable, biodegradable and non-toxic.  One class of industrially promising enzymes are known as decarboxylases.  These have the capacity to add or remove carbon dioxide from molecules, which may allow them to be used in processes to develop new biofuels or important commodity chemicals such as styrene.  This project studied the biochemical properties of a newly discovered class of decarboxylase enzymes that can catalyze the addition or removal of carbon dioxide from aromatic hydrocarbon molecules. Aromatic hydrocarbons are widely distributed in nature ? they are components of many flavors and fragrances - and also have many industrial uses in plastics and oil-based fuels.  Some types of aromatic hydrocarbons are also persistent and toxic environmental pollutants. \n\nFor this project we investigated two decarboxylase enzymes.  One enzyme (abbreviated FDC) catalyzes the decarboxylation of the food preservative, cinnamic acid to produce the industrially important hydrocarbon, styrene and carbon dioxide.  The other (abbreviated PhdA) catalyzes the decarboxylation of phenazine-carboxylic acid which is important in biofilm formation.  Both enzymes need a novel, modified form of vitamin B6 to perform their reactions .  The common form of vitamin B6 is flavin mononucleotide (FMN) but this new form of FMN contains an additional 6-membered ring derived from isoprene give a new molecule known as prenylated-FMN. \n\nFor both enzymes we explored whether they could remove carbon dioxide from other aromatic molecules that are not natural substrates.  We found that both enzymes can recognize and decarboxylate a wide range of common aromatic molecules, which may prove useful for ?green? industrial chemical applications.  We also investigated whether the enzymes could catalyze the reverse reaction, i.e. add carbon dioxide onto aromatic molecules.  We found some evidence that this reaction occurs but it is unfavorable and occurs much more slowly than the forward reaction.\n\nMost interestingly, the reactions catalyzed by these enzymes are thought to occur by a type of chemical mechanism that was previously unknown in biochemistry, known as a cycloaddition reaction.  We conducted various experiments to examine whether this novel chemistry was indeed occurring.  By carefully monitoring the reaction using mass spectroscopy we were able to detect a key chemical intermediate predicted by the reaction mechanism, which provided valuable support for the proposed chemical mechanism.  Using other techniques that allow chemical reactions to be studied on the millisecond timescale we were able detect chemical intermediates formed by the enzymes that exist only very transiently, but are important in the overall reaction.  The knowledge we gained from these experiments may facilitate engineering these enzymes to be more efficient and/or to use a wider range of substrates.\n\nIn addition to the scientific goals, the project advanced the education, training and professional development of 2 University of Michigan undergraduates, 3 graduate students and a postdoctoral scientist in the inter-disciplinary area of chemical biology.  The students and post-doc received training in a wide variety of biochemical and biophysical techniques and presented their results at local and national scientific conferences.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/18/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: E.
