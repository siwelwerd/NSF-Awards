 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the organization of a National Science Foundation Directorate for Engineering 2020 Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) Proposal Writing Workshop. The workshop will be held in the Washington, D.C. area in the Spring of 2020, and it is expected that there will be about 300 attendees. The workshop will take place over one-and-a-half days and will include interactive sessions on good proposal writing practices, seminars by previous CAREER awardees, a mock CAREER proposal panel review, and a review session during which the attendees will have a chance to obtain feedback on project summaries of their own draft CAREER proposals. The attendees will also have an opportunity to interact with current NSF Program Directors both in one-on-one and in mock panel sessions. \r\n\r\nThis workshop will help to prepare CAREER program eligible faculty for careers in education and research by giving them tools and skills of good proposal writing for submissions to the CAREER program as well as core NSF programs. The objectives of the workshop include training for junior faculty with an emphasis on women and underrepresented minorities in engineering. A special additional emphasis will be placed on encouraging CAREER program eligible faculty from non-\"Research-1\" institutions to apply for participation. The workshop will serve as an introduction to NSF for many new researchers. The workshop will help participants to clarify their research and education career plans and to understand the need to clearly articulate these plans to external reviewers. In addition, the workshop includes mock panel sessions to give participants the experience of simulated panel evaluation discussions. All of the content and experiences will help attendees enrich their skills for writing successful research proposals on impactful research that benefits societal needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Three funded and three non-funded NSF ENG CAREER proposals were reviewed on each panel.  Workshop participants reviewed and critiqued past successful and unsuccessful NSF CAREER proposals. \n\nParticipants were asked to review and rate the proposals prior to the Workshop.  At the panel each of the six proposals were be placed in a funding category and ranked.  The results from each panel were compared and discussed.\n\nThe participants noted the panels provided insight into the dynamics of the panel review process.\n\nTim Anderson, former Dean of Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst provided a Plenary Session titled \"Life as an Assistant Professor - Tips to Tenure\". \n\nAt the end of the two-day workshop, participants were asked to complete an online evaluation survey.
