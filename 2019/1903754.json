 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the workshop \"Geometric Representation Theory and Equivariant Elliptic Cohomology'' to take place June 10--14, 2019, at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This workshop will provide the opportunity for mathematicians working in the fields of representation theory,  topology, and mathematical physics to share their research findings and develop collaborations. Grant funds will be utilized primarily to support the travel and attendance costs of conference participants, particularly graduate students, recent PhDs, and researchers who lack their own travel funds. \r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, representation theory studies symmetries, topology studies mathematical spaces, and mathematical physics looks to find mathematical underpinnings for ideas from theoretical physics. These three areas come together in the burgeoning field of equivariant elliptic cohomology. This is a particular mathematical object with roots in all three of these areas of mathematics. A better understanding of this object would both have deep impacts in these areas and also forge previously unseen connections between them.  The workshops will be advertised internationally, and graduate students and members of underrepresented groups will be given top priority for funding. The website for the workshop is https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~ecliff/MRC/EEC.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
