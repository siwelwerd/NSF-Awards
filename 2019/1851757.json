 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides renewed funding for the participation of junior faculty in the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) Summer Institute. For more than thirty years, NBER's Summer Institute has offered an ideal environment for developing new ideas and forging collaborative work relationships. Summer Institute brings together economists and scholars in other fields from universities, government, and international organizations for a few days or a few weeks of seminars, workshops, conferences, and cooperative research. The NBER Summer Institutes generate timely and influential research on important economic policy questions related to such topics as international financial stability, economic productivity and technology, environmental regulations, social security policy, and educational policies. The workshops are an invaluable part of the research infrastructure in economics and assist the research of many economists. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Summer Institute is four weeks long and includes at least 50 sessions organized and co-organized by over 100 individuals. There are more than 2,800 attendees each summer from over 425 universities and non-academic institutions. About two-thirds of all attendees are not NBER affiliates. While there are many presentations of work nearing completion, emphasis is placed on the workshop aspects of the program where new ideas are raised, preliminary research ideas are developed, and plans for joint or coordinated research efforts are established. Efforts are made to include a wide variety of new participants, and to reach out to women and minorities. Calls for papers are circulated widely and are available on the NBER website.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

About two thirds of the participants in these meetings were not NBER affiliates, and roughly one fifth were first-time Summer Institute participants.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach Summer Institute included roughly fifty distinct research meetings, each focused on a distinct sub-field within economics. The number of research papers presented at the Summer Institute varied between 547 and 639.

The key audience for these lectures, however, has been on-line; the four sets of Methods Lectures between 2019 and 2022 have attracted more than 23,000 views on the NBER YouTube channel. All of the lectures are posted on the NBER website as well:\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.nber.org/research/lectures\n\n\n\n\n\nEach of the Summer Institute meetings also include a Martin Feldstein Lecture, a lecture that honors the contributions of the NBERs longest-serving president.

In addition, the NBER has an initiative to invite some of the most promising graduates of the AEAs Summer Training Program to participate. Many of these students are from minority groups that are under-represented in the economics profession.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeginning with the virtual Summer Institute in 2020, video of most Summer Institute sessions was posted on the NBER YouTube channel for several days after the meeting. These videos have proven very popular: the NBER had less than 25 YouTube subscribers before the 2020 Summer Institute. That number rose to over 16,000 in the subsequent four years. Many recordings attract more than 500 views. The availability of these recordings has been an important way of expanding access to the research presentations at the NBER Summer Institute.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/22/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JamesMPoterba\n"
