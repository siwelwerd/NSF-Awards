 "awd_abstract_narration": "The global ocean has absorbed over 90% of the excess anthropogenic heat between 1971 and 2010, with about 10% of that going into the deep ocean and contributing to global and local sea level rise. Despite these broad societal implications, the mechanisms driving the deep warming are still poorly understood. This project aims to improve our understanding of these mechanisms through a global study using a new method to utilize chemical tracers (in this case chlorofluorocarbons; CFCs) to overcome previous obstacles due to limitations from sparse data. The analysis will capitalize on a growing data set of detectable CFC concentrations throughout the deep ocean as anthropogenic tracers enter and circulate along the bottom limb of the overturning circulation of the ocean. This data set allows for both defining new pathways that bring new waters into the deep ocean and assessment of the variability in deep water formation rates. The variability will allow for correlations with surface conditions to evaluate driving mechanisms so that they can be included in climate models. In addition, this work will update decadal trends in abyssal warming, anthropogenic carbon uptake, and deep steric sea level rise annually through the end of the project in 2021. The results  will help to close current global energy, carbon, and sea level budgets and advance our understanding of the physical mechanisms forcing the distribution of anthropogenic heat and carbon throughout the ocean. This work will demonstrate and explain modes of deep variability previously unknown for use in climate models leading to improved long-term climate projections under increased CO2 emissions, therefore enabling better societal adaptability to changes to come. The project will support a third year graduate student for his PhD work at SIO. In addition, smaller summer projects will be made available for undergraduate summer students through the Scripps Institution of Oceanography Undergraduates Research Fellowship (SURF) program. The project will produce gridded global CFC, deep ocean warming, and steric sea level rise data products that will be made available to the broader scientific and educational communities.\r\n\r\nThe overall objective of this proposal is to understand the variability in the bottom limb of the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) in order to quantify, explain, and forecast the role that the deep ocean plays in ocean heat and carbon uptake. The deep ocean is warming at a significant rate with important climatic implications for sea level rise and ocean heat absorption.  Despite these broad societal implications, the mechanism driving this deep warming is still poorly understood and difficult to simulate in climate models, decreasing our ability to predict how the climate will change under increased CO2 emissions . One hypothesis is the warming is driven by a decrease in deep water formation around Antarctica.  The deep CFC data will be used to produce annual gridded maps within neutral density surfaces around the globe by modeling the oceanic subsurface response and fitting the data within its uncertainty. The gridded CFC dataset will allow for inference of deep circulation, ventilation, and assessment of any interdecadal change in locations with multiple decades of data. It will validate any observed interdecadal variability by comparing to changes in tracer age, oxygen, and volume of deep water along repeated hydrographic sections. The decadal variability will be compared to observed deep warming trends in order to identify if these changes are causing the recent accumulation of heat in the abyssal ocean and explore any mechanisms driving the variability.  This work will allow better characterization of the mean and variability of the deep transport along the bottom limb of the MOC and how it has affected deep-ocean temperatures. The new method to find tracer transport from CFCs to provide an improved estimate of deep ocean circulation, ventilation, and variability will also lay the groundwork for future monitoring of global deep-ocean warming.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

First, this project produced a new curated \"time corrected\" transient tracer ocean data product for use by the general scientific community.  Transient tracers, including CFCs and SF6, have been measured periodically through the global ocean over the past 40 years. The inert nature of these chemicals, coupled with the time-varying atmospheric concentration due to anthropogenic sources, make these measurements a powerful tool for inferring ocean ventilation and circulation.  However, comparing observations taken across 40 years scattered around the ocean is challenging owing to the complicating effect of mixing in the ocean, leading to under use of these valuable measurements. This project focused on developing a new mathematical framework that simultaneously estimated the concentration of CFC11, CFC12, and SF6 at a given interior location of the ocean across all time from discrete samples.  The measured tracer concentration is modeled as the convolution of a Green\u2019s function (i.e., a Transient Time Distribution) and the surface CFC history at all previous times. The CFC data is inverted for both the time dependent surface history and the Green\u2019s function using a non-negative least squares algorithm and all available observations of CFC11/12 and SF6 at each given location.

This method was tested for robustness and demonstrated in Cimoli et al 2023 and the data product is available for download.\n\n\nThe second set of key outcomes from this proposal were around analyzing the new time corrected transient tracer ocean data product. The new product animated the process of bringing surface waters into the interior ocean and allowed for an estimate of the \"age\" or mean time since the water has been at the surface.  We examined the evolution of the CFC concentration in the interior ocean in order to define new pathways of deep ocean ventilation and allow for quantitative assessment of time scales of various ventilation pathways.  For example, Cimoli et al 2023 shows the year at which CFC 11 first arrived at each location along the seafloor (see figure 5 in Cimoli et al 2023).\n\n\nIn addition to the analysis of the steady state circulation, identifying regions where the method fails, was one of the most interesting results of this proposal. The method is constrained by a steady circulation. In locations with two or more occupations where no steady state solution could be found that fit all observations across time, this disproved the null hypothesis of a steady state circulation, and identifies regions of the ocean where ventilation and circulation has significantly changed.  For example, Antarctic Intermediate Water ventilation has changed significantly over the past 3 decades (shown in Cimoli et al 2023).  Large scale slowdowns in the bottom limb of the MOC were also observed, and are currently being investigated in follow on work.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/04/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sarah G Purkey"
