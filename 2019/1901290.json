The conference focuses on recent developments in the field of operator algebras (C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras) and its interactions with group theory and the relatively young subject of quantum information. The main activities of the program consist of two schools, two workshops, and an international conference, and the themes to be addressed include classification aspects of C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras, the dichotomy between amenability and paradoxicality in its various guises, and the Connes embedding problem in relation to quantum information.\r\n\r\nA number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak in the schools, workshops, and international conference. This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, and researchers not funded by NSF an opportunity to participate in this program. The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.   \r\nMore information is available at: \r\n\r\nhttps://www.icmat.es/RT/2019/OAGAQI/activities.php\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
