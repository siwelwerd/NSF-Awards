 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"Workshop on Risk Analysis for Extremes in the Earth System\" will take place at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab in Berkeley, Califirnia, on July 22-24, 2019.  This workshop will serve two complementary purposes. The first is to provide a venue for statisticians and Earth scientists to share ideas and facilitate collaboration aimed at understanding rare, high-impact events in the Earth system. The second is to introduce graduate students, as well as others wishing to enter into the area of extreme value analysis, to the techniques and challenges that are unique to studying rare events. \r\n\r\nThe first day of the workshop will feature a pair of short courses, one on contemporary advances in statistical analysis of extreme events, and the second on using the NIMBLE and climextRemes software for data analysis. The following two days will feature research talks on statistical methodology and applications related to extremes, as well as talks on the science and impacts of extreme events in the Earth system. These talks will include several by researchers in both statistics and fields related to Earth science. Finally, there will be a poster session on the evening of Tuesday, July 23.  For more information, see https://cascade.lbl.gov/upcoming-workshops-conferences/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
