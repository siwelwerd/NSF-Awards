 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation research improvement project will examine the effects that processes of migration and the economic and socio-political geographies of suburbia have on the daily practices of immigrants and families whose members have different citizenship or immigration statuses, or mixed-status families. As immigrants settle in increasing numbers throughout US suburbs, the rescaling of immigration policies to the local level affect an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants, with significant impacts on suburban towns and mixed-status families. This research will consider the significance of the everyday navigation practices of different migrant communities in suburbia by advancing theories in political geography, cultural placemaking, and ethnic studies. This research project centers on the specific insights offered by suburban residents. The findings will contribute to better understanding how the increase in the immigrant population across many midwestern states has led to divergent approaches in local immigration enforcement, particularly across post-industrial cities, with implications for human well-being. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this project will provide support to enable a promising student to establish an independent research career. \r\n\r\nThe doctoral student will use a mixed methods approach to examine the relationship between the local politics of immigration and economics, and how they structure the lives of suburban communities. Specifically, this research examines (1) how the issue of immigration shapes local approaches to economic revitalization; and (2) how and why some immigrants and mixed-status families alter their everyday practices to navigate local contexts. These research questions will be answered through a content analysis of city council meeting notes and news media sources, participant observation at local cultural events and organizational meetings, key informant interviews with city officials and local leaders, in-depth semi-structured interviews with immigrants and mixed-status families, and participatory photovoice documentation. Photovoice will be used to create a booklet which will be used as an educational tool for community members and local officials. The study will investigate these questions in Chicago, Illinois, and will provide new insights into how processes of immigration and mixed-status families shape local economic revitalization projects in post-industrial suburbs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It provides an in-depth ethnographic and historical account on the relationship between economic development, local immigration policies and attitudes, and different waves of settlers and migrants in a northern Illinois satellite city. The project argues that an analysis on the contemporary landscape of migration politics benefits from an historical framework on the terrains of capitalist development, race relations, and cultural politics. This approach contextualizes why some local municipal governments make political decisions on implementing either sanctuary or xenophobic policies towards immigrants. Additionally, the study complemented a structural analysis with on-the-ground perspectives on life in a post-industrial town. It centers the stories of people who identify as immigrants, as part of families wherein members have different citizenship or migratory statuses, or with Latinx as a broad category. Through interviews, residents reflected on the ways they experience and navigate the social, economic, and political landscape of a changing Midwestern location. In juxtaposing everyday people&rsquo;s knowledge about the world around them alongside historical archives, this project accounts for some of the underacknowledged barriers that migrants face when attempting to participate fully in daily life, such as the local state&rsquo;s failure to effectively engage with growing immigrant and Hispanic communities.
