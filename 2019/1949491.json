 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is threefold:  1) As an augmented reality math board game, our product can further contribute to the design, research, and implementation of mixed reality learning products into K-12 education while facilitating a more constructive, student-centered, and adaptive learning approach in the modern school system. 2) As digital game-based learning becomes more popular among educators in the recent decade, our product has a growing customer base (parents, teachers, and school principals) seeking evidence-based educational game products to better engage students and improve their mathematics proficiency. 3) Proficiency in mathematics is essential to for those wanting to pursue a career in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields (STEM). As a mathematics learning game that tackles the challenging conceptual transition between basic number sense and higher-level math skills, our product can help students improve student's confidence in mathematics and help them further their career goals in STEM-related fields. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is an augmented reality (AR) mathematics board game. The game requires students to apply their knowledge of arithmetic, pre-algebra, and geometric concepts in order to be successful. It combines the benefits of digital and tabletop games, making the play/learning experience entertaining, engaging, embodied, immersive, and social at the same time. The product was designed based on three learning theories - embodied learning, cognitive load, and sociocultural theory. The game is rooted in the physical world - players need to interact with the game board, pieces, and cards to solve problems and must collaborate; in the process, their collaborative skills, communication skills, and critical thinking skills will be utilized and strengthened. The AR features allow students to offload the procedural information onto the digital space, providing them with more ease and comfort to concentrate on mathematical problem-solving and game strategies. AR also allows scaffolding to be incorporated into the game mechanic in order to assist students with mathematics problem-solving.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
