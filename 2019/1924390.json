 "awd_abstract_narration": "Seventeen million years ago, Earth's climates gradually heated up and then stayed warm for several million years. This event is termed the mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum (MMCO) and it was the last global warming event before the Ice Age. Still, what caused the warming and how it affected plants and animals remains unclear. This project uses plant fossils preserved in lake sediments in Washington, Idaho and Oregon to study how ecosystems changed during the MMCO. Specifically, the researchers will investigate whether CO2 (a greenhouse gas) emitted from Pacific Northwest (PNW) volcanoes during the mid-Miocene helped heat the atmosphere, how climate changed in the PNW, and how local plant communities adjusted to these changes. Mid-Miocene ecosystems were similar to today; therefore, learning about the MMCO helps predict what may happen to today's ecosystems experiencing climate change. Several graduate and undergraduate students are being trained, and a new display featuring MMCO research in the Burke Museum is being created. \r\n\r\nThis project examines the causes and effects of mid-Miocene warming through the study of 18 exceptional PNW paleofloras from before, during and after the MMCO. Together, the floras form a sequence of linked data on atmospheric pCO2, regional climate change, and vegetation that can be precisely dated. The floras often preserve macrofossils, pollen, and phytoliths, providing an integrated view of local and regional climate and vegetation. Project aims are to: (1) do high-precision U-Pb geochronology on volcanic ashes at 13 floral sites across the MMCO; (2) study plant assemblages at all 18 sites to infer (a) vegetation composition, diversity, structure, and successional stage, (b) local-regional climate, and (c) atmospheric pCO2; and (3) use these data to evaluate the nature and timing of PNW ecosystem change during the MMCO. The project will contribute to a biogeographically more resolved understanding of how the Earth climate system and vegetation respond during global warming events.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This so-called mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum (MCO) is well known from global reconstructions of temperature. Further, it has been suggested that CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;emitted along with extrusion of enormous quantities of lava forming the Columbia River Basalts during roughly the same time might have contributed to the warming. What is less clear is how regional climates and plant communities on land responded to the warming and increase in CO<sub>2</sub>. Many studies have pointed to generally warmer and wetter local-regional climates and, as a result, the expansion of more warm- and wet-adapted vegetation; for example, warm-temperate forests are thought to have spread in the Pacific Northwest of North America. Other studies have pointed to variation in regional climates and vegetation.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In this project we used plant fossil records (leaves, pollen/spores, and plant biosilica, so-called phytoliths) from the Pacific Northwest, to elucidate: (1) how regional climates changed; (2) if, how, and when vegetation changed during the MCO and after, as global climates cooled (the so-called Middle Miocene Climatic Transition).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>To investigate these questions, we conducted fieldwork at altogether 17 fossil sites with documented floras that span before, during, and after the MCO, and collected ash, leaf fossils, and sedimentary rock samples for pollen and phytolith extraction whenever possible. We dated the ashes using U/Pb radiometric methods, which allowed us to assign precise ages to our floras. We described the leaf floras, assigning each leaf to a &lsquo;morphotype&rsquo;, which corresponds roughly to a plant species and calculated the relative abundance of different morphotypes (~species). We also described each morphotype by measuring its size and shape, such as the number of teeth along its margins. Because plants cannot move, they optimize the size and shape of their leaves to the local environment. For this reason, leaf size and shape provide information about plant ecological strategy and can also be used to reconstruct local climates. Similarly, we recorded the composition of pollen and spore assemblages to provide information both about regional plant community composition and climates, under the assumption that the fossil species have the same climate preferences as their closest living relative. Finally, we described phytolith assemblages to understand the abundance and types of grasses and other plants (e.g., palms), adding importantly to our overall vegetation and regional climate reconstructions.
