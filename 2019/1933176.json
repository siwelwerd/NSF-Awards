The oral presentation and the conference paper titled ?Error propagation from the PIV-based pressure gradient to the integrated pressure by the omni-directional integration method? reports for the first time a comprehensive theoretical analysis and the corresponding numerical and experimental validation results for error propagation characteristics of the ?omni-directional integration method?, which is shown to have better performance in data accuracy in comparison with the conventional Poisson equation reconstruction approach. The travel support will help the effort in proving and establishing the advantage of the ?parallel ray omni-directional integration method? over the conventional Poisson equation approach for pressure reconstruction from noise embedded experimental data. Moreover, since there are numerous occasions in science and engineering practice that require solution of a scalar potential from a conservative vector field using Poisson equation, e.g., the reconstruction of temperature or wavefront from their corresponding gradients, the ?parallel ray omni-directional integration method? is readily applicable to those generic occasions. Thus, the new pressure reconstruction method will not only bring lasting impact to the fluids community, but also to a much larger audience in science and engineering applications as well.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to prove and establish the advantage of the ?parallel ray omni-directional integration method? over the conventional Poisson equation approach in pressure reconstruction from noise embedded experimental data.  Characterization of the accuracy of the PIV pressure reconstruction methods is of critical importance in understanding the capabilities and limitations of these methods. Unfortunately, until the proposed oral presentation by the PI to be delivered at ISPIV 2019, there is no theoretical analysis available for the omni-directional integration method that characterizes the error propagation from the measured pressure gradient to the reconstructed pressure field. The proposed presentation and paper by the PI at ISPIV 2019 intends to fill the gap, and help settle the question about why the omni-directional method has better performance over the conventional Poisson equation based on theoretical analysis, numerical simulation and experimental data.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
