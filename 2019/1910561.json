 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will complete the scanning-digitization and processing of the remaining approximately 200,000 glass plates of the Digital Access to a Sky Century @ Harvard (DASCH) project, the first 100 year (1886-1992) full-sky database of the brightness and positions of 50,000 stars or stellar objects.   This data is on 500,000 glass plates contains repeated measurements of the variability of all detected stellar objects.  The DASCH project will create an all-sky 100 year photometric record which will allow the discovery and measurement of all classes of stellar and quasar/blazar variability on time scale of hours-days to many decades. By measuring historic outbursts of black hole-low mass X-ray binaries to identify their duty cycle, an estimate can be made of their occurrence in the galaxy.  The DASCH data base will make contributions to astrophysical studies as well to education by using the data base in high school curriculum science lessons on astronomy, as well as to meeting the public's interest in the variations of stars in night sky. \r\n\r\nThis grant will preserve the DASCH data  base for posterity and make it available to the scientific community and the public.  The remaining 200,000 of the 500,000 glass plates in the Harvard Plate Collection will be scanned, digitized, processed and archived.   This will allow the study of time variable events of stars and compact extragalactic objects such as quasars over the time period 1886-1992 for astrophysics, history of astronomy and high school science lesions in astronomy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nThe principal goal of the DASCH project is to make available for robust scientific use as well as public engagement a century of astronomical imaging from the Harvard College Observatory Plate Stacks.  With over 500,000 wide-format photographs dating back into the late 19th century, these plates are an astonishing historical record of time-variable astronomical events.  This century-scale view is highly complementary to the more precise and deeper imaging of modern time-domain observations, allowing us to put the rare (and most important) bright events into context and to track the recurring patterns of individual objects whose natural time scales are beyond the reach of the decade view of modern surveys.\nAt the heart, the DASCH project involves producing high-quality digital scans of over half a million photographic plates, mapping the whole sky with over 1000-fold coverage, and writing and running software to perform photometry and astrometry on these scans.  But to do this, we must also deal with the heterogeneity of the data and attempt to capture the historical context of the plates.  For example, much of the documentation is in written logs and written annotations on the plates themselves.  This information must be photographed, transcribed where possible, and brought into the database in a useful manner.\nScanning plates is a physical job.  Each plate must be handled, inspected, photographed, cleaned, and scanned.  Doing this a half million times is labor intensive, yet requires continued attention to assure that the final data entries are correct, since the intent of the project is to produce a database that can be used for science without physical access to the original plate.\nFinally, DASCH produces a public portal for this database, so that researchers around the world can access this past century of astronomical history.  This portal is not just for professional researchers: amateur astronomers with backyard telescopes and relatively inexpensive CCD cameras can detect the bright outbursts every few months of accreting white dwarfs in Cataclysmic Variables (e.g. SSCyg) and similar (but much more distant and luminous) outbursts every decade or two from stellar mass black holes (e.g. V404 Cyg) that give first-hand opportunities to ?see? a black hole.\nAt the conclusion of this grant, DASCH has scanned about 96% of the available material and is prepared to finish the scanning and produce a complete data release for the full sky.\nWe close this Impacts section by providing a single plot to summarize the history of the development of DASCH made possible by 3 NSF grants: AST0909073, AST1313370, and AST1910561, for which we (Harvard) and the entire Astronomical TDA community (rapidly growing) are most grateful. This is the image file DASCH plate Scanning/Processing-2009-2021, which is available for download in the Supporting Files.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/06/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jonathan E Grindlay"
