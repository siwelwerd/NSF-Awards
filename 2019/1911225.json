 "awd_abstract_narration": "A team of researchers working at the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) will leverage the observing capability of this network of telescopes to probe several new frontiers of research in explosive astrophysical transient objects. The research team will: (1) obtain the first well-observed sample of mysterious and recently discovered Fast Rising Luminous Transients; (2) develop the first large sample of a certain type of exploding star or supernova (Type Ia) for which the nature of the pre-explosion progenitor is inferred from observations of the explosion ejecta being shocked by hitting a companion star, and (3) study late-stage stellar mass loss from the progenitors of a different type of supernova, called a core-collapse supernova.  The LCO consists of a network of 22 robotic telescopes spaced around the globe, which are capable of rapid initial observations followed by continuing SNe observations for hundreds of days. This project will help to fund the Global Supernova Project, which pools discoveries from every major local universe supernova search program, screens hundreds of potential candidates, and triggers prompt and long-term monitoring of the most interesting targets across the electromagnetic spectrum.  The research project will also foster education by giving students in the LCO schools program opportunities to observe SNe with the network, obtain real science data, and learn from provided curricula. The investigators will engage in public outreach including public talks, radio, TV, print, and YouTube appearances and interviews.  Finally, supporting a successful public-private partnership through the LCO should encourage more private funding of astronomy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe observing program has an aim of answering the following questions. (1) What are Fast Rising Luminous Transients?  Proposed answers range from the shock breakout of a supernova, a failed blue supergiant supernova, an electron capture supernova, fallback onto a shrouded central engine with jets, the merger of white dwarfs to become a magnetar, and the tidal disruption of a star by an intermediate mass black hole. Are these more than 80 poorly observed transients (only AT2018cow has been well observed) even the same phenomena?  (2) Are there two classes of SN Ia progenitors as is currently thought?  For the single compact object progenitors, what is the distribution of inferred companion radii? Do these SNe share traits in terms of host galaxy properties, line velocities, composition, or subtype, which would allow us to separate them into a new class or identify them by other means?  (3) What fraction of supernovae have flash ionized features from circumstellar material lost by the progenitor in the weeks before the SN and how does this correlate with the luminosity function and other properties? What are the radii and structure of core-collapse progenitors as determined from shock cooling?\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
