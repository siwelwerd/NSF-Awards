 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a renewal of the summer REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) site in Astronomy at the University of Wyoming. Each summer, eight students will work together on the same research project, mentored by the entire astronomy faculty. In addition to the research experience, this will promote teamwork, leadership, and peer teaching skills. They will also attend presentations or short courses on research techniques and results, preparing for graduate school, writing and speaking in science, exploring ethical issues in science. Students will develop broadly-applicable skills in computer programming and image analysis. This program will benefit society by enhancing the education of undergraduates through research and professional development programs and by extending these opportunities to students from institutions otherwise unable to offer such experiences. Recruiting will focus on students with little to no research experience, mainly freshmen and sophomores from liberal arts colleges and smaller public institutions, including community colleges. \r\n\r\nStudents will have full access to the 2.3-meter and the 0.6-meter telescopes. The specific project and lead faculty member will rotate each summer. Other faculty will play supporting roles and conduct professional development programs for the students. REU students will have an opportunity to gain valuable outreach experience by assisting with AstroCamp, a 10-day residence camp for middle-school students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe University of Wyoming astronomy REU program recruited and mentored 27 STEM undergraduates during the summers of 2019, 2021, and 2022 (the program was canceled in 2020 due to the pandemic).  Our program is unique in two ways.  First, we run a collaborative internship.  Each summer our cohort works as a team and focuses on a single science project.  Second, we are observing-intensive, with each summer cohort gathering data every clear night using our 2.3 meter telescope.  Over the course of 10 weeks our students learn about cutting-edge astronomy science, become proficient ground-based observers, learn from several seminars that aim to prepare them for their post-baccalaureate lives, and develop skills in teamwork, leadership, and peer teaching.  Social outings include hikes in the local mountains, whitewater rafting in Colorado, and a multi-day camping trip to the Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks.\n\nThough we run a collaborative program, the students develop tremendous \"ownership\" in their work.  Not only do the students ultimately focus their analysis on their own subset of the larger sample of observational targets, students develop true ownership by being able to experience nearly all facets of astronomy research including sample selection, observational data-taking, and the subsequent data processing and analysis/modeling.  Moreover, our program takes pride in supporting and enabling every student to present the culmination of their work at a national meeting of professional astronomers.  In addition, for each year of the program we strive to produce a peer-reviewed publication with all members of the REU cohort earning co-author status.  The science topics for these three summers included supermassive black holes in particular and AGN in general as well as exoplanets.\n\nOur targeted demographic includes students who have little to no research experience, such as sophomores from smaller colleges and universities.  Moreover, though our applicant pool is typically two-thirds male, we take care to bring in equal numbers of females and males.  Our collaboration with the Cal-Bridge Summer program has significantly increased the percentage of participants from underrepresented groups.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/20/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel A Dale"
