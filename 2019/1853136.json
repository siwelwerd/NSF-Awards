 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to deploy a revolutionary water-flood technology to increase oil recovery.  The best current technology is limited to 30 - 50% recovery leaving significant resources in the ground.  The available methods to further increase recovery are expensive, have limited application and can cause environmental damage.  The proposed method is much less expensive and has minimal environmental impact.  Our technique does not use chemicals or additives thus avoiding the risk of contaminating ground and surface water resources.  Rather than drill thousands of new wells, our approach revitalizes old fields and requires little modification to the existing infrastructure and operational procedures.  It would allow older fields to continue to operate, providing jobs and taxes while increasing and further diversifying our domestic oil reserves.  Full success of enhanced oil recovery,could produce up to 21.7 billion barrels of additional oil generating over $1 trillion for the US oil industry over the next twenty-five years, thereby increasing the energy security of the U.S. and creating more jobs while stabilizing domestic oil production at much lower costs than other technologies. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase II project proposes to validate the technology to optimize wettability in existing oil reservoirs through flotation experiments, computer modeling and field pilots.  Once we have achieved good pH control during the flotation experiments, we will determine the impact on reservoir wettability, the effect of salinity on wettability and the equilibrium constants for the surface complexation computer model.  Finally, we will conduct concept validation projects in field to verify a minimum of 5% OOIP increase in oil production. Thus, we will provide producers with a field-verified process operators can implement to yield significant results for little cost.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nOverview: \n\n\nConventional oil fields pump for more than 50 years recovering 30-35% of the oil in place, but production from these old fields is declining and new discoveries can no longer replace reserves. Unconventional oil resources may be able to replace this shortfall, but only at higher prices. This research created technology to improve oil recovery from existing fields via waterflooding. The new technology is simple, low cost and effective and applicable to most conventional U.S. reservoirs. This technology also can be used during drilling and completion in unconventional wells. The technology is environmentally friendly, requires no chemicals and uses existing infrastructure with little or no modification. The method uses wettability alteration induced by changing injection water salinity. This approach can ensure domestic oil reserve growth and continued inexpensive oil production in the coming decades.\n\n\nKey Words: Oil production, chemistry, wettability, surface chemistry, waterfloods\n\n\nSubtopic Name: CT14. Emerging Technologies and Applications\n\n\n\n\n\nIntellectual Merit:\n\n\nThis research has developed an alternative model for wettability at the nano-scale that differs from existing conceptual and chemical models. This model recognizes and validates many nanoscale investigations on the geometry and composition of organic matter on mineral surfaces performed over the last decade. The project first developed critical laboratory technology to rapidly measure wettability at elevated temperatures over a range of salinity and brine chemical composition. These laboratory tools were then used to measure the relationship between wettability and salinity under real world conditions. The method is fast and accurate, allowing an order of magnitude more measurements over the same time with good accuracy and precision at low cost and without the need for expensive laboratory equipment. A database of wettability measurements with systematic changes in salinity and chemical composition was created. This database has more measurements than the industry has performed in the preceding three decades. The data allowed the development of a new conceptual model that can underpin improved surface chemistry models built from existing surface chemistry software. Applications of the model include better understanding of the behavior and remediation strategies for PFAS and petroleum contaminated sites. Inclusion of customers petroleum data helped to develop predictive screening tools to identify potential candidates for the technology together with the operational procedures and protocols for project implementation.\n\n\n\n\n\nBroader Impacts: \n\n\nThis is a revolutionary technology that represents a step forward in oil recovery and a paradigm shift for the oil industry. The current paradigm (green fields) is one of constant exploration for new resources followed by development and exploitation. The extraction of unconventional oil resources (tight sands and oil shale) requires vast numbers of expensive new wells that only produce for a few years. Instead, wettability alteration can extend the life of existing conventional oil fields by decades. The technology will allow the U.S. to continue production from existing oil fields without environmental impacts during the energy transition that is underway. We estimate that the process would add between one and three trillion dollars to the U.S. economy over the next 25 years. There are no worries about induced seismicity, stray gas or chemicals contaminating groundwater reservoirs, all potential concerns with unconventional oil recovery practices. This technology can increase the energy security of the U.S. by stabilizing domestic oil production at much lower costs than other technologies. ESal, LLC recognizes that the methodology and insights developed for wettability in petroleum reservoirs, which are complex systems of saline water, organic liquids and charged surfaces, may be valuable to the medical and material science fields as well. The ability to selectively alter movement of organic liquids, control the deposition of organic materials on surfaces and removal of organic material from surfaces has broad application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/05/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: TeresaLNealon\n"
