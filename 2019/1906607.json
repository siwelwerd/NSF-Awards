 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2019, Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. As the global population increases, people need affordable and obtainable resources to prevent crop losses. This project will provide researchers and farmers with new bioactive metabolites for protecting crops against plant bacteria. These compounds are expected to be more affordable and less harmful than existing chemicals. As bacteria become resistant to chemical sprays, it is crucial to discover ways to improve crop yields. The premise of this study is to develop novel tools for crop protection that will improve food security. As an underrepresented minority (URM), the Fellow will inspire URM students to develop a passion for plant science. Undergraduate students from The University of Chicago interested in impactful research and graduate school will also be mentored. Both groups will shadow the Fellow through the research project, utilizing various instruments and receiving an introduction  to the finer points of research.\r\n\r\nBacterial infection of crops is a major concern for farmers. Depending on the crop, yield losses can be significant. Research using the model plant Arabidopsis has provided insights into plant-microbe interactions. However, incomplete databases have limited the capabilities of identifying new signaling metabolites that set the basal defense state of Arabidopsis. The goal of this work is to identify metabolite-based natural modulators of plant immunity and the immune-related proteins they regulate. Arabidopsis plants will be exploited to produce high levels of basal metabolites with potent immune-regulatory properties. Mutant and transgenic plants with high levels of such metabolites will be used to discover which immune proteins are affected using a comparative proteomics approach. Metabolite extracts from such plants will be analyzed by chromatography techniques, fractionated, used for bioassays, and characterized by NMR to identify novel immune-modulating metabolites. These discoveries enable researchers to better understand metabolite-protein interactions in disease resistance models and have the potential to provide farmers with new crop protection methods ensuring food security. Many individuals do not realize how the farm to table food chain works. Therefore, the Fellow will also develop a plant science kit in collaboration with an inner-city elementary school in Chicago. This kit will allow students to discover how the farm to table cycle works and why food security is important.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
