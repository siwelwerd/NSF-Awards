 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic & Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Steven Stevenson of the Department of Chemistry at Purdue University Fort Wayne uses his newly discovered chemical separation approach to isolate and characterize new tubular-shaped carbon molecules that are part fullerene and part nanotube.  Referred to as FullerTubes, these fullerene-capped miniaturized single wall carbon nanotubes are largely unexplored with few literature reports.  These unusual FullerTubes have potential applications in photovoltaics, heat transfer, medicine, and electronics.  Professor Stevenson sends isolated Fullertubes to collaborative institutions to leverage NSF resources.  Other broader impacts include high school research internships, early undergraduate students, inclusion of non-majors, and participation of underrepresented groups in his research.\r\n  \r\nAs preliminary data, the PI has isolated three fullertubes using a selective chemical reaction that recognizes and separates tubular from spheroidal shaped carbon structures.  The reactivity differences are attributed to the more inert ring junctions located on the belt region of the fullertubes.  In the 1st objective, this group will selectively target the synthesis of fullertubes and suppress the formation of conventional spheroidal fullerene contaminants that would otherwise dominate. The 2nd objective is to chemically differentiate between spheroidal fullerenes and nanotubular shaped fullertubes.  In the 3rd objective, collaborative research opportunities with other universities will be explored.  These collaborative efforts include vibrational spectroscopy, EPR, spectroelectrochemistry, photophysics, X-ray crystallography, magnetic resonance, theoretical calculations, formation mechanism studies, and functionalization to make derivatives.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nSince the Nobel Prize was awarded for the discovery of C60 fullerenes more than 3 decades ago, scientists had wondered about the possible laboratory existence of a series of in-between molecules that were &frac12; fullerene and &frac12; nanotube. In fact, since the 1990s, scientists envisioned structures of these so-called nanotubular fullerenes. This is evidenced by the drawings of their theoretically predicted structures more than 30 years ago.\n\n\nA project outcome of this NSF grant was demonstrating, for the first time, experimental evidence from the laboratory that such nanotubular fullerenes (i.e., we named them fullertubes) do exist in nature. Intellectual merit and scientific findings include the following: (1) these mathematically envisioned fullertubes exist in the laboratory but were hiding for 33+ years in arc generated carbon soot, (2) these fullertubes are present as individual members of a series of families (C90, C100, C120, C130), and (3) these fullertubes can be now, for the 1st time, isolated with our new chemical-based, selective purification approach developed in this project.\n\n\nWe have disseminated our research findings at conferences, in book chapters, in journal publications, and from talks as an invited speaker to numerous domestic and foreign institutions. An outcome of the projects intellectual merit includes our discoveries being published in multiple JACS papers; this is especially impactful at undergraduate RUI institutions. Our most recent discovery of the C130 molecule was just selected as a journal cover for JACS in 2023. This has increased the visibility of this NSF work. Several highlights or nuggets have been submitted to NSF during the project.\n\n\nThe project had outcomes that were impactful. For example, broader impacts include (1) the development of a fullertube sample dissemination network to share these new molecules with global collaborators, (2) the fostering of inclusive opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students at internal and external institutions, both domestic and abroad, (3) participation by underrepresented groups in research, and (4) a change in infrastructure to add a Center of Fullertube Research at the PIs RUI institution as an outcome of the excitement generated by the projects findings. The desire of our administration to create a new Center is especially impactful given the nature and resources typically available at a RUI undergraduate institution. The findings of our NSF project were also disseminated to the general public via Quanta magazine, whose editorial staff did a feature story on the PIs fullertube research. This write-up further expanded the broader impacts. The link is below.\n\n\nhttps://www.quantamagazine.org/fullertubes-join-the-family-of-carbon-crystals-20221220/\n\n\nSpecifically, the PI fostered the inclusion of students who otherwise may not have had opportunities for undergraduate research. Underrepresented groups were also included in the PIs research group. These students disseminated their findings at conferences in regional, national, and international meetings. Professional development of the PIs students not only included developing their research skills in lab, but also extended student experiences by their writing abstracts, titles, and presenting their work. Multiple students from the PIs research group are presently in graduate school and pursuing Ph.D.s in Chemistry. The PI continues to present the projects research findings to lecture classes and also to incoming students at the department's orientation course for new students.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/27/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: StevenStevenson\n"
