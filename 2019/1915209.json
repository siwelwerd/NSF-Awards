 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal provides support for the participation of five students and two early career professionals in the 17th Geological Society of America Thompson Field Forum on the \"Age and carving of the Grand Canyon: Towards a resolution of 140 years of debate.\" The forum will bring together 28 researchers and scientists to discuss evidence for the age and incision history of the Grand Canyon in the context of recent advances and ongoing debates. The goal to promote the next generation of research on this subject, which is of broad interest both to the scientific community and the general public. There has been considerable interest in what seems to be like an old subject, but recent scientific advances have provoked controversy and new ideas regarding the age and formation of the canyon with high-profile publications in the journals, Science and Nature. Controversial ideas to be discussed include: 1) evidence for mantle-to surface hydrologic connections; 2) ongoing mantle-driven uplift of the Colorado Plateau; 3) the contested \"bulls-eye\" of erosion of the Colorado Plateau; and 4) Causes of major knickpoints as due to incision transients and/or variable strength rock layers. The conference is timely in that the community needs to examine and evaluate the evidence first hand and develop better integrated methodologies to test these and other debates. The students and early career professionals (including four women) will be supported by this activity are actively involved in Grand Canyon research and hence will be knowledgeable and receptive to the nuances of the discussions. They will also get a chance to present their new work for the general discussions. The exposure they will get to high level integrative science will be potentially transformative for their careers. A unique opportunity associated with the Field Forum will be a river trip down the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon with opportunities to discuss scientific questions on the outcrop and at evening seminars. Society benefits from this activity include contributions to STEM education and educator development; development of a diverse, globally competitive workforce; and contributions to the broadening of participation of underrepresented groups in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The field forum involved 28 researchers and young scientists selected from a pool of 40 applicants by the conveners. Participants included 5 students and 2 young career professionals, all actively involved in Grand Canyon research, 7 international participants, and a representative from Grand Canyon National Parks&rsquo;s science office. All 28 scientists had interdisciplinary expertise in one or more subdisciplines of hydrology, neotectonics, geomorphology, thermochronology, geodynamics, and geochemistry. The field forum took place during an eight-day field trip by raft through the Grand Canyon. It started and ended in Las Vegas, Nevada and covered 280 miles from Lees Ferry to Pearce Ferry under a charter with Grand Canyon Expeditions. Each of the participants gave a field seminar via presentations on the outcrop, &ldquo;plenary&rdquo; presentations at morning and evening seminars, and/or short talks and discussions on the hikes or on the boats at key locations. Each participant prepared ahead of time some reference figures that were compiled into a booklet that facilitated the presentations.</p>\n<p>The main scientific achievement was the open discussion and debate among high level experts in an informal setting. Scientific consensus was achieved in some, but not all, topics. The process of identifying future challenges was an equally important achievement. The following topics were energetically discussed. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Grand Canyon&rsquo;s incised aquifer system</span> shows complex mixing of meteoric, karst, and CO<sub>2</sub>-rich &ldquo;lower world&rdquo; waters that needs a better baseline for understanding water quantity and quality and groundwater pathways to continue to provide water for the Park&rsquo;s &gt;6 million annual visitors. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Regional uplift </span>of the Rocky Mountain &ndash; Colorado Plateau region took place in several stages over the past 70 million years and much debate focused on evidence for the whether it is ongoing.

The elevation difference needed for rivers to incise landscapes and carve canyons means that uplift history debates are entwined with canyon incision debates. The <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Age of the Colorado River, </span>the time the river reached the Gulf of California,<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> </span>is now well known to be about 5 million years based on research by trip participants. The <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Age of Grand Canyon </span>was debated; endmember &ldquo;young&rdquo; canyon models (all post 6 million years old) and &ldquo;old&rdquo; canyon models (70-17 million years old) were not supported on the trip.

The trip was effective for promoting a next generation of research on the evolution and tectonic geomorphology of this iconic region, as well as similar studies globally. One of the student participants, Muhammad Qasim Mahmood, discussed international geoscience outreach.
