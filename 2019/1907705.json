 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dense suspensions composed of solid particles suspended in a fluid exhibit a wide range of surprising mechanical behavior, including a dramatic increase in viscosity under increasing flow rates. This phenomenon, known as shear thickening, can be exploited for important applications, including energy dissipation, shock absorption and impact resistance.  However, shear thickening can also produce undesirable effects in material transport and processing. While substantial progress has been made in understanding shear thickening in suspensions of spherical and other compact particles, much less is known about shear thickening in suspensions of rod-like particles. These systems can show dramatic shear thickening at particle concentrations much lower than the concentration required for shear thickening in suspensions of spherical particles.  This suggests the possibility that suspensions with relatively low concentrations of very long rods can take advantage of shear thickening behavior in applications, or present challenges in material transport when shear thickening is not helpful. The dynamics of the orientations of the flowing rods is a critical determinant of the properties of suspensions of rods. This work seeks to characterize and understand the orientation dynamics in the shear thickening regime to enable prediction and control of the viscosity of rapidly flowing suspensions. The research team will also participate with the Science/Policy interface, a pilot project to involve a materials science graduate student in an interdisciplinary group project in science policy, and with outreach activities aimed at economically disadvantaged high school students through hands-on soft materials modules for use in the Georgetown University College Immersion Program.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the proposed research is to characterize shear thickening in suspensions of colloidal silica rods, which can be synthesized with a range of aspect ratios, and to utilize novel techniques to determine the dynamics of rod orientations and\r\ndirectly measure stress fluctuations during shear thickening. Using a customized high resolution microscope coupled with commercial rheometers, the investigators will be able to directly measure the spatially and temporally resolved orientation dynamics of the particles. In parallel, they will use a new technique they have developed to measure boundary stresses locally. Combining these two techniques will enable the team to determine the interplay between orientation fluctuations and stress fluctuations, and therefore identify the dynamical characteristics that determine shear thickening. The researchers will then extend this approach to silica rods with controlled nanoscale roughness. Orientation plays a critical role in the behavior of anisotropic molecules and particles, and the ability to control orientation through flow, external fields, or boundary effects is central to a wide range of commercial applications. The proposed research will develop and test novel tools and methods for characterizing the role of orientation in rod suspensions, and provide the characterization necessary to identify opportunities to manipulate particle orientation to control shear thickening. More generally, the proposed research will support the development and dissemination of a powerful techniques for measuring and analyzing orientation and stress dynamics of flowing suspensions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nWith this project we developed novel model systems for understanding and eventually controlling the behavior of suspensions composed of a mixture of fluid and long particles, such as needles or fibers. Such complex suspensions show up in a wide variety of natural and industrial processes, but their behavior cannot be accurately described by existing theories. We demonstrated that the underlying complexity arises from an interplay between the orientation of the long particles and the overall fluid flow. We also developed new ways of generating materials so that we are now in a position to test the dependence of the behavior on different aspects of the particles and their interactions. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the scientific advances, this project supported the development of a diverse STEM workforce. Four female undergraduate students participated in the research projects, two from groups that are under-represented in STEM. In addition, the project supported the work of one female graduate student, also from an under-represented group, and one female and one male postdoctoral fellow.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also developed a new international collaboration as part of this project. The research group of Prof. Roel Dullens, initially at Oxford University in England but now at Radbound University in the Netherlands, had developed an interesting method for fabricating particles that was a good fit for the needs of our project. Members of the Dullens group helped train the students listed above in the fabrication of the materials, and along the way provided critical training in synthetic chemistry. The collaboration continues, and another graduate student in the Dullens group is working closely with a Georgetown student on a project that was a direct result of the interaction supported by this award.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/17/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JeffreySUrbach\n"
