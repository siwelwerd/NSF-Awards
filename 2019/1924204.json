 "awd_abstract_narration": "HBCU-RISE: Enhancement of Research and Education Infrastructure - Laboratory for Prototype Devices Based on Functional Materials\r\n\r\nThe Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Research Infrastructure for Science and Engineering (HBCU-RISE) program supports the development of research capability at Historically Black Colleges and Universities that offer doctoral degrees in science and engineering disciplines. Supported projects have a unifying research focus in one of the research areas supported by the National Science Foundation, a direct connection to the long-term plans of the host department, institutional strategic plan and mission, and plans for expanding institutional research capacity, as well as increasing the production of doctoral students, especially those underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. With National Science Foundation support, Clark Atlanta University will conduct a project entitled \"Enhancement of Research and Education Infrastructure - Laboratory for Prototype Devices Based on Functional Materials\". The vision of this project is to increase the number of underrepresented scientists in the interdisciplinary field of materials science. This project will strengthen the research and education infrastructure at Clark Atlanta University. High quality research experience opportunities for students will be available through a university/ industry partnership. A summer research program will provide undergraduate students with academic enrichment experience and will serve as an introduction to the field of materials science. A new materials science course will be developed covering the basic laws and concepts relating the structures of solids to their physical and mechanical properties. This project will significantly increase the number of African-Americans earning doctoral degrees with expertise in materials science. These efforts will also enhance career opportunities for graduate students through the development of a multidisciplinary educational program.\r\n\r\nThe research component of this project will focus on the design, development and testing of prototype lithium-air batteries. Conventional lithium-ion batteries in use in hybrid and electric vehicles are approaching their theoretical limit.  Lithium-air technology offers the potential for ten-times the performance of today's lithium-ion technology. Proposed research is expected to lead to the development of new electronic materials such as electrolyte and anodes for lithium-air and lithium-ion batteries. Experimental work will be complemented by computational analyses. Battery studies will generate data sets to determine material design for improved functional performance.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The research and programmatic effort of the HBCU RISE award started in October 2019 included the (i) of developing a new class of electronic materials for Lithium batteries; (ii) graduating several doctoral students in the area of electronic materials/battery fabrication and (iii) working with the Departments of Chemistry and Physics to establish a BS and MS program in Materials Sciences. The faculty and students of the HBCU RISE program developed a novel electrolyte which contained within its molecular structure a boron atom; the presence of the boron atom in the structure resulted in electronic properties that make the structure extremely promising as electrolytes in Lithium batteries. A US Patent was awarded for this discovery which (Image 1). The novel electrolyte that was developed during the HBCU RISE funded research was awarded the 2023&nbsp;Best in Class Award&nbsp;from the HBCU Emerging Technologies &amp; Innovation Showcase in September, 2023. (Image 2). The award also made possible for CAU to setup a facility for testing novel electrolytes and also a setup for charge-discharge study for the prototype battery systems (Image 3).&nbsp; One of the major goals was to increase Clark Atlanta University&rsquo;s capacity to recruit and graduate Ph.D. students from underrepresented minority (URM) groups in the area of materials science. The, NSF HBCU RISE award was very successful with recruiting and graduating doctoral students. One (1) student have earned her Ph.D. degree and three additional students will be earning their Ph.D. degrees in 2024. &nbsp;Therefore, the HBCU RISE award will directly contribute to graduating four doctoral students with two students are continuing their doctoral studies with funding from other sources. That is the HBCU RISE award will directly contribute to graduating six (6) Ph.D. students from CAU. NSF RISE award supported the startup of a nee Assistant Professor&rsquo;s research program at Clark Atlanta University, and the buildup the Materials Science program through resources that forms the infrastructure and salary support for the PI and a current postdoctoral researcher. The new faculty purchased research equipment, specifically workstation computers and software licenses to start her computational research program in materials and used these resources to obtain initial data and develop winning proposals for external funding. &nbsp;The new faculty has four active research award and is one of the four successful young faculty in the area of Materials Science at the University. The HBCU RISE program worked closely with the Departments of Physics and Chemistry to develop and institutionalize four new courses and two new programs: (1) BS in Materials Science and (2) MS in Materials Science. Overall the NSF HBCU RISE has been successful in making CAU a leader in electronic materials, Lithium batteries and has expanded the institution&rsquo;s academic program to attract and mentor a new generation of STEM leaders.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/29/2024<br>\nModified by: Ishrat&nbsp;M&nbsp;Khan</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1924204/1924204_10615947_1706565586250_Taveion_tech_award--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1924204/1924204_10615947_1706565586250_Taveion_tech_award--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"CAU HBCU RISE Doctoral Students Receiving Technology Award\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1924204/1924204_10615947_1706565586250_Taveion_tech_award--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"CAU HBCU RISE Doctoral Students Receiving Technology Award\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">CAU HBCU RISE Doctoral Students Receiving Technology Award 2023</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ishrat Khan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ishrat&nbsp;M&nbsp;Khan\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">CAU HBCU RISE Doctoral Students Receiving Technology Award</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1924204/1924204_10615947_1706565785984_Battery_lab_photo--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1924204/1924204_10615947_1706565785984_Battery_lab_photo--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Electronic Materials and Battery Testing Equipment\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1924204/1924204_10615947_1706565785984_Battery_lab_photo--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Electronic Materials and Battery Testing Equipment\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Electronic Materials and Battery Testing Equipment</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ishrat Khan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ishrat&nbsp;M&nbsp;Khan\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Electronic Materials and Battery Testing Equipment</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1924204/1924204_10615947_1706565392849_Patent--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1924204/1924204_10615947_1706565392849_Patent--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"US Patent for Organoborane Electrolytes\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1924204/1924204_10615947_1706565392849_Patent--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"US Patent for Organoborane Electrolytes\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">US Patent for Novel Organoborane Electrolytes for Lithium Batteries</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ishrat Khan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ishrat&nbsp;M&nbsp;Khan\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">US Patent for Organoborane Electrolytes</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
