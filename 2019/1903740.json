 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thin film materials have broad application in electronics, light source, renewable energy, sensors, mechanical systems, etc. With the emergence of new thin film structures there is increasing demand for high performance laser scribing techniques capable of producing narrow (< 10 micron), straight walled cuts with little imparted surface damage. The research aims to address this challenge at the fundamental level by studying the laser-matter interaction mechanisms under a new laser double pulse irradiation strategy for thin film scribing. The basic research from this project will generate scientific knowledge to enable the development of high performance laser scribing techniques that can find application in numerous advanced technology areas including scribing of solar cells and smart window glass, patterning of flexible electronics, micromachining of microelectromechanical systems and light emitting diodes, etc. In the solar industry, for example, recent years have seen tremendous progress in thin film solar photovoltaics, especially perovskite solar cells exceeding 20 percent power conversion efficiency. The research could accelerate the adoption of thin film solar technology and contribute to a clean energy future free of air pollution, hazardous waste, and negative environmental impact. Besides potential industrial and societal benefits, engaging educational materials and activities derived from the project will be developed to train a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students, and to educate both K-12 students and the public. The principle investigator will take advantage of the new laser micromachining infrastructure to involve students from underrepresented groups in the project. \r\n\r\nThe research will verify that a femtosecond-picosecond double pulse irradiation will create a uniform critical electron number density through multiphoton absorption and avalanche ionization and enable a narrow thin film scribe with high surface integrity. The research objective is to identify the parameter window for pulse energy and time delay, and determine the laser-matter interaction mechanisms under this double pulse irradiation scheme. A combined experimental and numerical modeling approach will be used to verify the approach and to gain a deep understanding of electron dynamics and ablation mechanisms in a thin film structure when irradiated by a femtosecond-picosecond pulse train. The basic technical approach is to develop a numerical model to predict the free carrier density and the resulting ablation shape, while a model-based approach will be used to design and conduct thin film scribing experiments. This research will contribute to the scientific community by advancing the fundamental understanding of laser-matter interaction with advanced thin film materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

PI: Shuting Lei, Kansas State University</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The objective of this project is to (1) test the hypothesis that a two-burst laser irradiation on a thin film will enable more efficient ablation if a proper burst delay time is chosen and (2) develop new methods for quantitative characterization of laser thin film scribing quality. The major outcomes are summarized below.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Laser absorption is the first step in laser-matter interaction and the loss of laser energy in air can be significant but is rarely considered in existing studies in literature. In this project, a major finding is made through numerical modeling and simulation using a hydrodynamic code to gain insights on laser absorption by air in single pulse and two-burst irradiation on aluminum thin film. In single pulse irradiation, laser absorption by air is enabled by the expansion of aluminium surface, and the percentage of absorbed energy by air is usually less than 10% of the input laser energy for the conditions studied, which is small but not negligible. However, in two-burst irradiation, air absorption can account for &gt;30% of the input energy (Fig. 1), which can significantly affect laser ablation efficiency. Another main contribution is a deeper understanding of laser absorption and ablation efficiency in two-burst laser irradiation. It is found that two-burst laser irradiation normally enables more laser energy deposition in the material compared to single pulse irradiation. The longer the burst delay time is the more the energy deposition is, and the more the burst 2 energy portion the more energy deposition. However, more energy deposition in the material does not translate directly to higher ablation efficiency, and it is often the opposite. The main cause of ablation deficiency is due to plasma shielding of the second burst. Because of the intricacy of the laser-matter interaction with complicated pulse schemes like burst-mode irradiation, numerical simulation provides the most effective mean to assist in the search for optimal conditions to fully harvest the benefits of burst-mode laser ablation, as demonstrated in this project.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A deep transfer learning model is developed to evaluate laser scribing quality in terms of debris, scribe width, and scribe straightness based on images taken from laser scribes.

In addition, a new statistical approach for scribe quality assessment and laser scribing optimization is devised and demonstrated.
