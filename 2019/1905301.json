 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, and co-funding from the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), Professor Jonathan Merten and his group at Arkansas State University are pursuing research that aims to make the measurement of the chemical elements around us easier, faster, cheaper and \"greener.\"  Elemental analysis is important to many fields, including geologic exploration, electronics, manufacturing, agriculture, energy, defense, and health.  Typically, the measurement requires that the sample be dissolved in expensive and powerful acids before measurement, a process that can take hours and generates chemical waste with high costs for safe disposal.  The Merten group seeks to improve understanding of alternative laser-based methods which are safer and much faster.  Specifically, they direct pulsed lasers at samples to generate tiny plasmas hotter than the surface of the sun.  Through better control and understanding of the plasma formation process, they are working to improve the laser-based measurements.  Dr. Merten and his undergraduate students are also reaching out to the Northeast Arkansas community through programs at the Arkansas State Museum, which serves a rural population in Northeast Arkansas from its location on the campus of Arkansas State University.  This work has the potential to provide >5000 participatory interactions with the public using free-form laser-ablation experiments performed in a class I, safety-interlocked laser setup at the museum, increasing public knowledge of and interest in spectroscopy and improving the STEM pipeline.  \r\n\r\nLaser-ablation (LA) analytical methods, including laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and LA inductively coupled plasma analyses require little or no sample preparation and are rapid and (in the case of LIBS) portable.  Unfortunately, they are extremely prone to matrix effects, which are difficult to understand because of the inhomogeneous plasma?s small size and rapid evolution.  The Merten group has developed a technique that allows mapping of the LA plasma with high spatial and temporal resolution.  By spatially mapping the atomic absorption spectrum, it is possible to calculate the mass of the gaseous plasma.  This \"spectral massing\" procedure is being used to improve understanding of the post-ablation plasma directly and dynamically, thereby enhancing understanding of the ablation process and its relationship to the signal in elemental analysis methods.  Such understanding of the total atomized mass and its stoichiometric development is critical for LA analytical methods.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nNSF grant 1905301, Following Laser-Induced Plasma Stoichiometry with Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy allowed the PI and undergraduate researchers to study the laser-induced plasma with the aim of making it a better tool for instant and portable elemental analysis. The undergraduate researchers and principal investigator in this work also demonstrated laser plasma spectroscopy at the local (campus) natural history/history museum with a fully enclosed portable device built in the laboratory. The PI and students logged hundreds of visitor interactions despite the slowdown in museum attendance caused by COVID during the first half of the funding period.\r\n\n\nTo complete the work proposed by this grant, undergraduates learned to operate a complex laser-ablation spectroscopy setup using light to measure the ~nanogram-level masses of laser-induced plasma plumes with nanosecond time resolution. These student researchers (seven women and one man) included multiple underrepresented groups in Chemistry. In addition to their learning chemistry, physics and electrical engineering concepts in a hands-on and open-ended environment, several of the student researchers found that the projects flexible working hours meant that they could quit lesser-paid jobs that required unpredictable and inflexible hours (that interfered with their studies and childcare in the case of one single mother).\r\n\n\nOf these eight students, six have graduated, with four completing undergraduate degrees in Chemistry (other students completed degrees in Psychology and Biology). One student has been accepted to the state medical school and three of her predecessors have attended or are attending graduate school. One of these has completed a graduate degree in cardiac technology, another has recently completed her PhD in Analytical Chemistry at the University of Michigan and another former undergraduate is now in her third year of PhD studies at the University of Illinois (Physical Chemistry). Students from this project now staff the Arkansas state crime laboratory and the quality control department of a local manufacturer, increasing the STEM pipeline at the local, state and national levels. Several of these student researchers are first-generation college students who report conversations with family about their scientific work and the scientific process in our laboratory, effecting an informal, secondary form of scientific outreach in northeast Arkansas (an NSF EPSCOR state).\r\n\n\nSeven of the eight undergraduates presented their research as posters at atomic spectroscopy and analytical chemistry conferences. Subsequent PI conversations with students showed that this provided several of them with a feeling of membership in the scientific community. Their attendance also allowed them to witness the give and take communication (explaining experiments and results, questioning conclusions, suggesting further experiments or alternative explanations) that is necessary for the proper function of science.\r\n\n\nSix of the eight students coauthored peer-reviewed scientific publications in high-quality journals. In these publications, the PI and student researchers measured both the mass and stoichiometry of a vapor cloud that weighs only nanograms and lasts for just microseconds. Many analytical atomic spectroscopists did not understand that this is possible and are only now beginning to realize the possibilities due to these publications and presentations. Meanwhile, we continue using the technique to understand the extent and, more recently, the chemical environment of the plasma and are using this to make laser ablation and elemental analysis more efficient, effective and robust. \r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/13/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JonathanMerten\n"
