The goal of the inaugural Diversity in VTS\" workshop at VTC2019-Fall in Honolulu, Hawaii, Sept. 22 - 25, 2019, is to engage industry researchers, academic faculty members, and graduate students in interdisciplinary discussions on connected vehicles and autonomy. The IEEE Vehicular Technology Society (VTS) \"Diversity in VTS\" workshop will provide a common platform to enhance diversity in IEEE VTS and in the Engineering Community as a whole, by fostering the connection of women and other groups that represent minorities. The workshop is intended to create an opportunity to share experiences about the challenges that are faced by women and minorities in the engineering world and views on how to enhance diversity and increase the presence of minorities at all stages of their engineering careers.\r\n\r\nA total of $10,000 will be used to support up to 10 under-represented students. One third of the travel grants will be reserved for first-time attendees of the IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference where the workshop is co-located. One third of the travel grants will be reserved for women and other under-represented students attending the conference. It is anticipated that this conference will be the first of many to be held at the twice-annual IEEE Vehicular Technology Conferences and will be a venue where students can learn and find mentors, both from peers and more well-established researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
