A ScienceDMZ at KSU's main campus connects to OARnet's optical exchange to have 100 Gbps unimpeded transfer rate capacity. KSU and OARNet teams to build a virtual DMZ perimeter over a highly-responsive regional WAN allowing researchers from bandwidth constrained regional campuses to access the cyber-facility with uniform access. IPv6, and shared network innovations like PerfSONAR and InCommons are employed. \r\n\r\nThe ScienceDMZ leverages a broad set of compelling big-data projects. The project launches outdoor ultra-high speed wireless access infrastructure in campuses connected to the ScienceDMZ to facilitate big-data-driven dense sensor and IoT research projects. This project is unique in the sense that a shared regional science DMZ is leveraged across ten campuses throughout north-eastern Ohio. The region of the Kent's allied campuses is the Rust Belt of America. The project brings the world of data-driven STEM research closer to this mass of students, a large percentage of whom are Pell-eligible and/or first-generation college students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
