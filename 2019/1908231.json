 "awd_abstract_narration": "This effort is to develop small, low power, robust spectral rulers called frequency combs that astronomers can use to help measure the motion of stars. In doing so, they can identify planets orbiting those stars and gain information about the mass of the planets. This research enables tantalizing discoveries about the existence and nature of other planets, ultimately helping us to search for other worlds like our own.\r\n\r\nThis research is to advance the instrumental capabilities for Precision Radial Velocity (PRV) observations of exoplanet-hosting stars by creating broad, octave-spanning comb spectra in the 0.8 micron to greater than 2 micron region at GHz repetition rates through soliton formation in silica microresonators. This will be accomplished by balancing Raman and dispersive wave effects in the microresonators, and using pulsed excitation of the microcomb to improve pumping efficiency. The resulting combs will be used as low power, compact calibration sources on high-resolution spectrographs installed at ground-based observatories. Advances in PRV instrumentation can enable the identification of Earth-sized planets in the Habitable Zones of some of the nearest stars to the sun.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
