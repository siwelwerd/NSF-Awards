 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University will focus its annual international Symposium on Next Generation Diagnostics, convening up to 480 of the Wyss Institute's vast network of collaborators, students, researchers, faculty and clinicians alongside industrial researchers, and members of academic institutions and foundations leading the development of diagnostics technology. Through invited speakers, discussion and the exchange of ideas, the Wyss Institute Symposium looks to highlight the latest developments of this emerging field and address the need for more accurate, rapid, and lower cost diagnostic technologies to meet clinical challenges in hospitals, in physician's offices, at home, and at the point-of-care in both the developed and developing world. Presentations will focus on translation and accelerating the development and application of diagnostic technologies toward commercial and clinical applications.\r\n \r\n\r\nThis Symposium will allow the Wyss Institute to bring together leading academic and industrial researchers in the field of diagnostics from around the world to discuss emerging efforts in the diagnostics field by identifying challenges to the advancement and translation of diagnostics technology, and looking for opportunities to leverage the expertise of its faculty and researchers with that of world class experts to promote collaboration; furthering its mission and helping to advance the future of diagnostics technology. The Wyss has planned for three themed sessions followed by a fireside chat styled discussion at the Symposium comprised of Wyss Institute faculty, staff, and national experts.  During the first three sessions, speakers are allocated 25 minutes each, followed by 5 minutes for questions, and most if not all the presentations are to be focused on elements of work in this field that have the potential for near term impact.  Of particular interest are insights from invited speakers on the particular challenges of translating technology including approaches toward both commercial applications and the clinic.  Through a fireside chat and opportunities for reflection for a small group of influencers following the symposium, the Wyss Institute will further provide an opportunity to explore the potential for new national and international collaborations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
