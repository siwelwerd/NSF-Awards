Lower losses and higher power densities enabled by dc power transmission and distribution has sparked further implementation of high-voltage and medium-voltage dc transmission and distribution systems.

The objective of this research is to realize a new class of dc-dc converters, which pushes the boundaries of efficiency, scalability, power density and fault tolerance/reliability and expedites further expansion of  dc grids. To  this end, two  new promising converter topologies, one based on the voltage-sourced converter concept and the other one based on the current-sourced converter concept, are fully explored. The project will focus on modeling, analysis, control, short-circuit fault protection, and design optimization of these converter topologies, demonstrating the ability to achieve the objectives including compact, ultra-efficient, power dense, and embedded fault blocking capability. The proposed educational activities will help educate and equip next-generation power engineers/scientists with the required knowledge and skills to tackle energy chal\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
