 "awd_abstract_narration": "The transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture is one of the most significant changes in human history, and scholars world-wide, across multiple disciplines are engaged in understanding how and why this process took place. The South American Andes are considered to be one of the centers of domestication providing some of the world's most important foods, including potatoes and quinoa, and wool from llamas and alpacas support textile industries. Yet, our knowledge of the processes of domestication and the commitment to agriculture lags behind other regions due to small number of studies. Dr. Maria Bruno, of Dickinson College, Dr. Jose Capriles, of The Pennsylvania State University, and Dr. Christine Hastorf, of the University of California, Berkeley, will investigate the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture in the southeastern shore of Lake Titicaca basin in the South American Andes. Through new archaeological excavations and specialized analyses, this collaborative investigation, made up of a multidisciplinary team of North American and Bolivian specialists, will foster multiple opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to train and develop skills in archaeological field and laboratory procedures. The project will also involve the active participation of local indigenous Aymara communities whose traditional subsistence and land use practices have been increasingly impacted by environmental degradation and globalization.  Local high school students will be trained to participate in research and create videos that illustrate research methods and data interpretation, while documenting the histories of their sites and communities. In conjunction with local agencies, the project will help to promote on-going local tourism initiatives based on cultural patrimony. The project will make educational posters for the museum and high school, and print and distribute informative pamphlets with updated information regarding nearly four millennia of cumulative resource utilization by urban, farming, herding and fishing communities that created a complex socio-environmental system of dramatic landscape-scale transformations that are still visible today. \r\n\r\nThe Lake Titicaca basin of the south-central Andes sustained some of the highest pre-Columbian population densities in the western hemisphere. It is recognized as a center of crop domestication and early agriculture. To investigate the onset of food production and landscape modification in the basin, the researchers will carry out archaeological excavations focusing on the Early Formative Period (1500-800 BCE) at the sites of Chiripa, Chiaramaya and Chiripata, located in the Taraco Peninsula, Bolivia. Specifically, they will seek to answer what was the nature and timing of a commitment to domesticated plant and animal species and what was the role of climate change in either facilitating or constraining this process. To evaluate these questions, a team of specialists will carry out detailed analyses of plant and animals remains that reflect the changes in their use and management through time. A rigorous program of radiocarbon dating will permit to compare these changes to new records of past climate change, in addition to social and political transformations recorded in the archaeological record, to further on-going discussion about the transition to agriculture by humans locally and globally.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Between 2022 and 2024, the Taraco Archaeological Project undertook excavations and a wide-range of artifact and ecofact analyses to investigate this transition in the Lake Titicaca Basin of the Andes, a region where the processes of domestication and the commitment to agriculture lags behind due to a small number of studies. We completed excavations at three sites, Chiripa, Chiripata, and Chiaramaya, that revealed new deposits dating to the Early Formative period between 1600-1000 BCE with evidence for the early use of domesticated plants and animals. Using fine-grained archaeobotanical analyses, we have new evidence for early domesticated quinoa as well as potatoes. We also found evidence for the continued use of wild plant species, particularly lake plants such as totora reed and malvas. Through analysis of animal bones, we found early patterns of domesticated llamas and alpacas management. Through rigorous radiocarbon dating of the layers containing these remains, we have been able to refine the chronology of the adoption of domesticated species here. The excavations also revealed the contexts in which these early inhabitants settled in the region. &nbsp;In addition to extensive and rich sheet middens, we encountered small discrete pits and even a linear feature that could potentially be an early form of water management or possibly related to early architecture. On going analysis of the archaeological data compared to local climatic and cultural developments, will allow us to answer why this transition took place here and compare it to other areas of the Andes and the world.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In addition to these scientific advancements, this project promoted the education of eleven young archaeologists from the United States and Bolivia at both the undergraduate and graduate level. These students participated in field excavations, archaeobotanical and zooarchaeological recovery and analysis, database development and management. They also contributed to producing the year-end project reports, which we are now collaboratively publishing with the University of California, Berkeley Archaeological Research Facility. We also worked collaboratively with the Aymara Indigenous communities of Chiripa and Chiriamaya, as well as the township of Taraco and its mayoral office. Over 75 members of these communities worked on the project as excavation and flotation technicians, laboratory assistants, and analysts. The lead excavation, flotation, and laboratory workers are referred to as &ldquo;maestros&rdquo; and have traditionally been men. We were very pleased to have been the first project in the area to train two women as &ldquo;maestros&rdquo; in Chiripa. Beyond providing tours and lectures about the project to community members and local school children, we published and distributed a graphic novel based on the archaeology of Chiripa to every child in the local schools. We participated in the annual Solstice celebration at Chiripa and contributed new costumes for a traditional dance called Chuquela that only the eldest members of the community still know. The costumes were donated to the local museum and with the aim of preserving this important dance for future generations. Finally, we habilitated and furnished a new storage space in the community centers of Chiripa and Chiaramaya for all the archaeological materials recovered during the project. These materials will provide new information for the continued development of local museums and bourgeoning tourist circuit.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/19/2024<br>\nModified by: Maria&nbsp;C&nbsp;Bruno</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1920882/1920882_10611748_1734630063762_DSC_0416--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1920882/1920882_10611748_1734630063762_DSC_0416--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Team members of the 2023 excavation season gathered in Chiripa\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1920882/1920882_10611748_1734630063762_DSC_0416--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Team members of the 2023 excavation season gathered in Chiripa\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Group photo of the 2023 excavation and lab team in Chiripa.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Carlos Capriles</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Maria&nbsp;C&nbsp;Bruno\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Team members of the 2023 excavation season gathered in Chiripa</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1920882/1920882_10611748_1734629823977_6D3CA424_3283_4B25_875C_B476E4375B54--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1920882/1920882_10611748_1734629823977_6D3CA424_3283_4B25_875C_B476E4375B54--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"School children visit excavation unit and artifact screen\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1920882/1920882_10611748_1734629823977_6D3CA424_3283_4B25_875C_B476E4375B54--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"School children visit excavation unit and artifact screen\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Chiripa School Children visiting excavations in 2022</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Maria Bruno</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Maria&nbsp;C&nbsp;Bruno\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">School children visit excavation unit and artifact screen</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
