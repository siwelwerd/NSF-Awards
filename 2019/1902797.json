 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reconstructing the timing of evolutionary events, from the invasion of land to the origin of flowers, relies on evidence from the fossil record. For many groups of organisms, available fossils are scant or poorly described, resulting in uncertainty about when major evolutionary transitions occurred. This project will expand knowledge about the fossil record and estimate an evolutionary timeline for a large and economically important plant group, the nightshades. This family of nearly 3000 species includes many crops, such as tomato, potato, and tobacco, and yet is represented in the fossil record by only a handful of described specimens. The researchers will survey putative nightshade fossils and use morphological and statistical analyses to determine their placement in the evolutionary history of the family. In the process, the researchers will be able to estimate the timing of major evolutionary changes, such as the origin of fleshy fruits and whole genome duplications. Understanding this evolutionary history is fundamental for crop improvement, which relies on the morphological and genetic variation accumulated through diversification over millions of years. This project incorporates a range of training opportunities for early-career researchers, and the results of the research will be widely disseminated through public data repositories.\r\n\r\nDivergence times across the nightshades (Solanaceae) will be estimated through three specific aims. First, the researchers will revise all fossil records from the family and score a suite of discrete and continuous characters using traditional and newly developed techniques, including variable pressure scanning electron microscopy and x-ray microcomputed tomography. Second, a matching morphological dataset will be created for the roughly 1600 extant species with available molecular data from previous phylogenetic analyses. Finally, Bayesian total-evidence methods will be used to jointly estimate relationships among extant and extinct species and divergence times across the family. This integrative project will be carried out by a team of botanists, paleontologists, imaging specialists, and methods developers. In addition to estimating a robust timeline for Solanaceae, the project will expand knowledge of the plant fossil record, support training of undergraduate and graduate students and a post-doctoral researcher, as well as strengthen international scientific infrastructure and collaboration.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Nevertheless, extracting, identifying, and classifying fossil material can be exceptionally challenging, as organisms are compressed and fragmented during fossilization and soft parts are commonly lost. Thus, describing even a single new fossil species is often the result of years of sorting through material and comparing fossil specimens with living species. Here, we undertook a focused effort to expand our knowledge of the fossil record of the economically important nightshade family (Solanaceae). Although over a dozen fossils had been described for this flowering plant family, subsequent revisions suggested that most or all of these are too incomplete to be confidently considered nightshades. Through surveys of museum collections around the world, our project uncovered new well-preserved fruit and seed fossils that we conclusively determined belong to nightshades and were able to place within major groups (tomatillos, peppers, tomatoes). Most surprisingly, these ancient nightshade fruits and seeds were not exclusively from the American Tropics, where living nightshades are most diverse, but also from North America and Eurasia. For example, we described a fossil from the chilipepper clade that lived in Colorado over 50 million years ago and a fossil seed from the tomato genus from Siberia that dates to nearly 30 million years ago. These discoveries demonstrate that the nightshade family is much older than previously thought and likely achieved its worldwide distribution tens of millions of years ago. Our statistical phylogenetic analyses support these conclusions, with the radiation of the berry clade containing tomatoes, tomatillos and peppers occurring roughly 80 million years ago. In addition to these paleobotanical advances, this project has expanded the toolkit for total evidence dating, implementing for the first time combined analyses of continuous morphometric data, discrete characters and molecular sequences under the fossilized birth death model. This work was made possible by a vast international network of paleobotanists and taxonomists and the collaboration of a team of early career scientists, including six undergraduate researchers, a graduate student and a postdoctoral fellow. We shared our findings widely in peer-reviewed publications, presentations, and the popular press and provided training in fossil morphometrics and divergence time estimation through two workshops with freely available online tutorials.</span></span></p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/20/2024<br>\nModified by: Stacey&nbsp;D&nbsp;Smith</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1902797/1902797_10605266_1710910510108_print_talk_Smithsonian--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1902797/1902797_10605266_1710910510108_print_talk_Smithsonian--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"CT scan of fossil seed\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1902797/1902797_10605266_1710910510108_print_talk_Smithsonian--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"CT scan of fossil seed\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Micro-CT scan of ca. 4 million year old fossil nightshade seed showing embryo inside.
