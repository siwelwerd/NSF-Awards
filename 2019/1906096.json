 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technologies that rely on and exploit the quantum properties of light and matter are touted as the next phase\r\nof the modern industrial revolution. Light has become the preferred medium for information transfer in\r\nquantum technologies due to its high speed and exceptional noise properties, with single photons acting as\r\nthe most basic building blocks. However, the realization of robust, device-compatible, room-temperature\r\nsingle photon sources that can be activated and controlled on demand has been a major hurdle. Although\r\nthere have been different material systems that have shown single photon emission, they operate at low\r\ntemperature or at incompatible wavelengths, and are often hard to integrate with conventional photonic\r\nmaterials or CMOS technology. To address this challenge, this project aims to develop single photon\r\nemitters based on cavity-coupled van der Waals (vdW) materials. Specifically, the program will focus on\r\nhexagonal boron nitride, a wide bandgap semiconductor that can host optically active point defects with\r\nemission in the visible and near infra-red. Combining defect engineering and \"pick-and-place\" techniques,\r\nthe project will develop a range of light-confining hybrid structures designed to enhance light collection\r\nand light emission from single photon emitters as well as increase the strength of light-matter interaction.\r\nThe overarching goal is to develop the key building blocks for realizing quantum photonic devices based\r\non vdW materials.\r\nTechnical Abstract:\r\nThe development of quantum photonic technologies that can operate at elevated temperatures, are CMOS\r\ncompatible, and can be integrated with conventional photonics is highly desirable. This project addresses\r\nprecisely this need through the use of monolayer or few-layer vdW materials integrated with silicon\r\nnitride photonic platforms where we exploit the unique strengths of the two material systems. vdW\r\nmaterials are a highly attractive platform for active components in quantum photonics due their large\r\nlight-mater interaction strength, compatibility with a variety of substrates, and pick-and-place fabrication\r\ntechniques. In particular, hexagonal boron nitride has a wide bandgap (6 eV), which allows for a broadly\r\naccessible spectral range and mid gap defect states. Furthermore, owing to the few-layer vdW structure,\r\nthese systems show extreme susceptibility to strain and the dielectric environment, which will be\r\nexploited to control defect activation and integration with nanophotonic structures such as microresonators\r\nand waveguides. Silicon nitride, already recognized as an excellent material for passive\r\nphotonic devices due to its low loss and mature fabrication protocols will form the platform for realizing\r\nthe quantum photonic chips. Specific program goals include: (i) Deterministic engineering of defect\r\nstates in hBN for single photon emission, and (ii) Integration of emitters into micro-resonators and hybrid\r\ncavity systems for enhancing spontaneous emission and achieving the strong coupling regime.\r\nThe program will help train students from diverse backgrounds in the emerging interdisciplinary field of\r\nquantum optoelectronics. A highlight among the planned outreach activities is a hands-on quantum\r\ntechnologies workshop for undergraduate students at City College.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
