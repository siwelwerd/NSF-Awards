 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advertising now funds most of the popular web sites and internet services: companies often provide their services for free, in exchange for collecting data from their users as they interact with the service. In recent years, the scale and resolution of user data that platforms collect has led to a dramatic increase in the variety of targeting, reporting, measurement, and tracking mechanisms that platforms offer to advertisers.  Unfortunately, our understanding of the privacy and societal risks of these mechanisms has not kept pace with this increase, raising scientific questions about how much advertisers can learn about platform users through these mechanisms, as well as about their potential for acting in a biased or discriminatory way.  Because on the Internet can sign up to be an advertiser on all of these platforms -- granting access to these mechanisms and data at very low cost -- makes understanding their implications a critical need.  The goal of this project is to improve privacy for all users, and raise awareness among users and regulators of the extensive -- and often hidden -- advertising ecosystem that underlies today's popular services, and the privacy and societal risks it poses.\r\n\r\nThis project is following a three-pronged research agenda.  The first set of research tasks centers on enhancing privacy, addressing the problem of revealing advertising statistics while providing strong guarantees of user privacy based on methods from the field of differential privacy. The second set of research tasks focuses on detecting and preventing discrimination, addressing the multitude of ways in which the advertising platforms' features could inadvertently or intentionally discriminate against different groups through the choice of which ads to display to which users. The third set of research tasks addresses issues of transparency and control, studying whether current transparency practices are comprehensive and truthful from both users' and regulators' perspectives, and whether the provided control features have the expected effects on ad delivery and align with people's expectations of privacy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These sites use this data to provide fine-grained targeting tools to advertisers. The goals of this project were to better understand the current targeting and tracking mechanisms that various advertising platforms offer, and uncover and address the privacy and societal risks that they introduce.  Under this project, the PIs made significant scientific advances, trained multiple PhD students, and published papers at top computer science conferences.\n\n\nOver the lifetime of this project, the PIs made substantial contributions to measuring online advertising platforms, their algorithms, and their risks to certain user populations.  The PIs developed a number of new measurement methodologies to understand the large-scale algorithms that we interact with every day; these techniques can be re-used in the future to study additional platforms.  The PIs demonstrated ways in which platforms\u2019 ad delivery algorithms shape who sees political ads by providing economic dis-incentives to showing ads to users who the algorithm believes are not likely to agree with the content.  Moreover, the PIs showed that a commonly-used approach to try and de-bias a machine learning model&mdash;simply removing protected-class features as input&mdash;makes almost no difference in the output, when the protected class information can be reconstructed from other inputs and is predictive of the model\u2019s objective.  Finally, the PIs used novel techniques to prove that ad delivery algorithms\u2019 heavy reliance on images in ads can have discriminatory effects, with images of people from different demographics being delivered to significantly different user populations.  Such effects can be particularly worrisome for opportunity ads (e.g., housing, credit, and employment).\n\n\nThe work funded by this project has significant implications for internet users worldwide, due to the important role that advertising systems play today in mediating access to opportunities such as employment and housing and in mediating societal discourse.  The work funded by this project received significant press coverage, and one of the PIs testified before Congress on the topic of this project (algorithmic discrimination in advertising).  Additionally, the PIs presented their work in front of the Federal Trade Commission multiple times, as part of the Commission\u2019s PrivacyCon conference.\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/21/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alan Mislove"
