The funding opportunity, announced in February 2017 with NSF 17-053 Dear Colleague Letter: Funding Opportunity - A \"Quantum Leap\" Demonstration of Topological Quantum Computing\" generated 15 funded EAGER proposals focusing on research in the area of braiding. The first meeting was organized in the Spring of 2018, and involved participants of the first \"class\" of EAGER awards made in 2017. This award supports the second meeting, scheduled for the second week of July 2019. The workshop enables a full report-out and overview of accomplishments so far based on results of work done within the first 2 years of funding existence, which marks the final report for the first class of awards, and 1-year report for the second class of the 2-year EAGER awards. \r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract:\r\nProviding experimental evidence for braiding is a needed transformative step towards topological quantum computing. Ability to generate, control and braid Majorana zero modes is central to this effort. Theoretical support is required to design braiding schemes, ways to design and execute algorithms, and enable topological quantum computation protected from local disturbances by non-local character of the shared quantum state. The meeting of Principal Investigators funded through the NSF 17-053 Dear Colleague Letter: Funding Opportunity - A \"Quantum Leap\" Demonstration of Topological Quantum Computing\", will serve as report-out session and review of accomplishments, while also providing an opportunity for the award recipients to exchange and discuss details of their findings and plan next steps.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
