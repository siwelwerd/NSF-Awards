 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project deals with various problems in 2 and 3 dimensional geometry by applying ideas from conformal and hyperbolic geometry to problems of computer science and statistical physics, and, conversely, utilizing ideas from discrete and computational geometry to study longstanding problems in complex analysis and dynamics. These methods, in addition to their intrinsic interest, provide new connections between discrete and continuous mathematics, as well as between theoretical and applied questions.\r\nThis expands the range of tools available in all these areas, and facilitates more substantial interactions between disparate groups of mathematicians, physicists and computer scientists. The concrete, geometric, and practical aspects of these problems also make them appealing to students and can form the basis of student research projects. For example, what is the optimal way to decompose a 2 or 3 dimensional region as a union of triangles or tetrahedra? Doing this quickly (e.g., in polynomial time)  with good control of the shapes of the mesh elements  (e.g., no angles too large or too small) is a fundamental first step in most numerical modeling methods, and a good  initial mesh leads to faster, more accurate solutions. Nevertheless, many meshing algorithms used in practice (essentially all used in  three dimensions) are based on heuristics rather than rigorously justified methods. The PI's earlier work on meshing in 2 dimensions is based on exploiting ideas from conformal geometry and dynamics, and uses the PI's  earlier work on optimal algorithms for computing conformal mappings. The PI plans  to continue his work in 2 dimensions to find the optimal meshing algorithms and to seek analogous approaches in 3 dimensions. Conformal maps send one planar region to another in a way that preserves angles. Such maps have been studied for almost two hundred years and are fundamental to many areas including complex analysis, dynamics, fluid flow and probability. The connection with probability arises most strongly through Brownian motion,  the mathematical model of continuous random motion.  Conformal maps send Brownian paths to Brownian paths, and this `conformal invariance' allows probabilistic arguments to be applied in complex analysis and allows complex analysis to be used to study Brownian motion. The  project considers  another well known, but difficult to understand, random process related to conformal maps: diffusion limited aggregation (DLA for short). In DLA  particles wander at random in space until they make contact with a fixed cluster of particles and stick to it. As time progresses the cluster grows and takes a characteristic fractal shape, at least in numerical simulations; very little is known rigorously about the geometry of the resulting random clusters. Based on numerical simulations, the project considers new conjectures on DLA that may be more tractable. The above problems seek to use classical analysis to understand problems that are discrete in nature. Another aspect of the project is to use discrete ideas to attack  problems in continuous analysis. The PI previously introduced a new method, called quasiconformal folding, for constructing holomorphic maps that that emphasizes the discrete and combinatorial structure of holomorphic function. Using this method, the PI and other investigators have constructed examples that answered a number of open problems, including several in the field of holomorphic dynamics. This is the study of stable versus chaotic behavior when a function is  iterated, e.g.,   the Julia set of a map is a fractal set where the sequence of iterates acts chaotically. Determining the possible geometries  of this set is a fundamental problem, and the PI will work on specific conjectures  the case of general holomorphic functions defined on the whole complex plane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project consists of problems grouped into five main categories, but all dealing with the interaction of discrete combinatorial structures (usually trees or triangulations) with continuous problems related to complex analysis and conformal geometry (Riemann surfaces, holomorphic dynamics, hyperbolic 3-manifolds, computational geometry and statistical physics). The first part deals  with conformal structures induced by trees and graphs. Grothendieck's theory of \"dessins d'enfants\" shows that a finite graph on a compact topological surface induces a conformal structure on that surface, e.g., makes it into a Riemann surface. Several problems in the  project  seek to understand this connection precisely, e.g., given a finite tree in the plane, what does the tree \"look like\" in the induced conformal structure?  A related problem is to build a Riemann surface by identifying edges of equilateral triangles. It is known that not every compact surface occurs in this way (only countably many can occur), but the PI conjectures that every non-compact surface does occur in this way (joint work with Lasse Rempe-Gillen). The second group of problems deals with transcendental dynamics, i.e., the iteration theory of non-polynomial entire functions. Quasiconformal folding is a method of building entire functions, starting from an infinite planar tree, that gives very good control of the geometry of the function and locations of its critical values. The PI seeks to apply QC folding to various problems, such as the possible Hausdorff and packing dimension of transcendental Julia sets, and the behavior of these dimensions under perturbations of the function. The third part of the  project is to expand on recent work of the PI and Claude LeBrun that constructed examples 4-manifolds where the almost-Kahler structures form a non-empty,  proper open subset in the moduli space of ant-self-dual metric; such examples were not previously known to exist. The proof works by reducing to questions about harmonic measure on certain (very complicated)  hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Can simpler 3-manifolds be used? Are the \"exotic\" examples constructed actually \"common\" in some sense? The fourth part deals with optimal meshing problems in 2 and 3 dimensions. The PI recently proved that any planar domain bounded by a PSLG (planar straight line graph) can be meshed by non-obtuse triangles (maximum angle 90 degrees)  in polynomial time, but the optimal power remains open. The proof uses  a discrete closing lemma for certain flows associated to any triangulation and  perhaps ideas from surface dynamics might help close the gap. The proof uses several estimates from planar geometry, and it would be a very interesting and important to extend the results to triangulated surfaces, a stepping stone to the  important problem of meshing 3-dimension regions by non-obtuse tetrahedra. A key idea in the planar case is to decompose the region into pieces where either Euclidean or hyperbolic geometry is used to generate a mesh.  Can a similar strategy be used in three dimensions, perhaps using the wider variety of fundamental geometries that occur in three dimensions? Finally, the PI will consider diffusion limited aggregation (DLA), a widely studied random growth model.  The basic problem is to determine the almost sure growth rate of the cluster; there is no non-trivial lower bound and no  improvement of Kesten's 1987 upper bound.  The PI plans break the growth rate problem into two sub-problems: estimating upper bounds for the number of vertices on the convex hull boundary of DLA, and turning these into non-trivial lower bounds for the growth rate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We describe each of the main results below.<br /><br /><strong>Optimal triangulations</strong>: The PI has given an algorithm for triangulating a polygon using a maximum angle that is as small as possible.&nbsp; It has been known since the 1960's that any polygon can be decomposed into acute&nbsp; triangles, i.e.,&nbsp; so that&nbsp; every angle of every triangle is less than 90 degrees. A&nbsp; smaller upper bound&nbsp; will hold for&nbsp; each individual polygon, depending on that polygon. For example, a square can be triangulated with maximum angle 72 degrees, and it cannot be triangulated using only smaller angles.&nbsp; Thus 72 is optimal for the square. The PI's new result computes the optimal&nbsp; angle bound for triangulating any given polygon. It can&nbsp; find either&nbsp; the smallest upper&nbsp; bound, or the largest lower bound. Meshing with good angle bounds makes various algorithms more efficient, such&nbsp; finite element methods used in manufacturing and computer graphics, and triangulations with better angle bounds can give better performance.&nbsp; The proof&nbsp; that the algorithm is correct&nbsp; involves conformally mapping an equilateral triangulation (all side lengths are the same)&nbsp; from a model domain to the target polygon, and makes use of other ideas from the theory of Riemann surfaces and quasiconformal mappings. Thus the work represents a significant new application of classical complex analysis to discrete and computational geometry, and broadens the possibilities for&nbsp; further interactions between classical analysis and computer science.<br /><br /><strong>Weil-Petersson curves:&nbsp; </strong>Weil-Petersson curves are a class of closed, finite length curves that was introduced in 2006 by Takhtajan and Teo to answer certain questions arising in&nbsp; string theory and conformal field theory.&nbsp; The space of loops is infinite dimensional, and to make calculations possible, we want to give it a structure as close as possible to a finite dimensional Euclidean space. The appropriate structure is called a Hilbert manifold, and Takhtajan and Teo showed how to make the space of closed loops into a Hilbert manifold. The Weil-Petersson class is the collection of limiting curves of&nbsp; sequences of smoothly differentiable curves&nbsp; in the Takhtajan-Teo metric.&nbsp; The limits of differentiable curves need not be differentiable, and&nbsp; giving a geometric characterization these limits remained an open problem. Because of its good computational properties, the Weil-Petersson metric was used by David Mumford and his collaborators to allow computers to compare and classify shapes.&nbsp; The&nbsp; PI's results give the precise degree of differentiability&nbsp; of these curves, and&nbsp; connect&nbsp; them to several diverse areas in analysis, geometry and mathematical physics. For example,&nbsp; Weil-Petersson curves in the plane&nbsp; are the boundaries of minimal surfaces in hyperbolic 3-space&nbsp; that have finite total curvature, and these are exactly the surfaces that have finite renormalized energy, a concept introduced by Graham and Witten in relation to entanglement of quantum systems.</p>\n<p><strong>Equilateral triangulations of Riemann surfaces:</strong> Riemann surfaces are surfaces on which there is a way to measure angles between two intersecting curves. Such surfaces&nbsp; play a fundamental role in mathematics and physics, and they have been intensely studied since the mid 1800's.&nbsp; Much attention has focused on certain special surfaces that can be constructed by glueing together a finite number of planar&nbsp; equilateral triangles. These are called Belyi surfaces after the mathematician who characterized them. He showed a&nbsp; compact Riemann surface can be built geometrically from equilateral triangles if and only if it can be given algebraically as the solution set&nbsp; of certain polynomial equations related to number theory. This remarkable result instigated much further research and inspired Grothendieck's&nbsp; theory of <em>dessin d'enfants</em>,&nbsp; that involves to deep connections between algebra,&nbsp; combinatorics and geometry. The term compact means the surface has bounded diameter for the natural&nbsp;&nbsp; metric defined on any Riemann surface (e.g., the 2-sphere and a torus are compact surfaces, but the plane is not).&nbsp; Many Riemann surfaces are not compact (in some sense, most are not compact), and while some non-compact surfaces were known to&nbsp; be constructible&nbsp; from infinite collections of equilateral triangles, it was not clear which non-compact surfaces could be built in this way. Is there some analog of Belyi's theorem describing which one can?&nbsp; With Lasse Rempe, the PI has shown&nbsp; that every non-compact Riemann surface&nbsp; can be built from equilateral triangles&nbsp; (indeed every non-compact surface&nbsp; has infinitely many distinct equilateral triangulations).&nbsp;&nbsp; One&nbsp;consequence is a fact that has been known for over a century  in the compact case, but is now&nbsp; proven in general: every Riemann surface has&nbsp; a holomorphic&nbsp; map to the 2-sphere that has only&nbsp; finitely many critical values.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/19/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Christopher&nbsp;Bishop</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1906259/1906259_10605439_1695848956795_CW6--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1906259/1906259_10605439_1695848956795_CW6--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Triangulated pentagon\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1906259/1906259_10605439_1695848956795_CW6--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Triangulated pentagon\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A pentagon triangulated using the conformal image of a equilateral triangulation of a related polygon.

Meshing with good angle bounds makes various algorithms more efficient, such  finite element methods used in manufacturing and computer graphics, and triangulations with better angle bounds can give better performance.
