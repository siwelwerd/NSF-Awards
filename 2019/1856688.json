This year, the theme of the festival is Noncommutative Geometry and Representation Theory. \r\n\r\nThe goals of the festival are to highlight some of the most significant recent advances in noncommutative geometry, identify promising new research directions, and acquaint graduate students and postdocs with the most current research in the field. This year, topics will include index theory, hypoelliptic operators, representation theory, and more. More information about the conference can be found in the following website https://sites.google.com/site/ncgwustl/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
