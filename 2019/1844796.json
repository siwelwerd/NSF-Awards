The aim of this project is to broaden the participation of deaf individuals in disciplines that conduct sign language research. Funding from the National Science Foundation will be used to bring deaf college students from the U.S.A. to the Theoretical Issues in Sign Language Research (TISLR) conference, which will be hosted in Hamburg, Germany, during the summer of 2019, and to provide American Sign Language interpreting services for these students while attending the conference. \r\n\r\nTISLR is the most significant and well-attended international conference on sign language research. The students will work with a team of mentors prior to the conference to discuss their research interests and to prepare for presentations at the conference. The mentors will also meet with the students during and after the conference to help them plan their research careers. The knowledge, resources, and networks the students will develop at TISLR will make them better equipped to pursue careers in sign language research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
