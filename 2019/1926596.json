 "awd_abstract_narration": "While most wetlands and ponds are physically isolated, their communities are linked over years and long distances, through a process called \"teleconnections.\" These exchanges occur via atmospheric processes, temporary aquatic connections, natural 'hitchhiking' on other migrating animals, and dispersal by humans. Aquatic systems where these can be studied include Great Plains ephemeral wetlands. These systems, such as playas and prairie potholes, are abundant in grassland ecoregions and support resident invertebrate species, amphibians, and migrating waterfowl. Their ephemeral nature requires residents to periodically seek other aquatic systems or produce resistant eggs that allow them to survive dry periods lasting months to decades. Their 'signature' species are tiny fairy and tadpole shrimps. These lay resistant eggs which can be dispersed by 'wind and wing.' The former includes egg transport by prevailing Great Plains winds, and the latter by eggs hitching rides in the guts of migrating waterfowl to be deposited later in other wetlands. The research will manipulate community composition in outdoor tanks to determine competitive abilities of invertebrates from different sites and to check for migrating branchiopods in the digestive tracts of waterfowl shot by hunters. The project will use this accessible system to develop ecology programs for K-6th grade students; employing young students in science studies; educating under-served student populations, including Native Americans and students from our Hispanic Serving Institution; and working on wetlands-focused conservation.\r\n\r\nThe research will focus on the question: how do teleconnections (dispersal by wind and wing) and climatic factors influence macroinvertebrate community composition and synchrony (temporal links) in ephemeral ponds within a macrosystem network? This project will test 6 hypotheses on factors shaping community composition that are related to: strong dispersal, geographically variable dispersal, strong climatic synchrony, geographically variable climatic synchrony, equal roles for dispersal and climate, and a null hypothesis on stochasticity. The study will be 25 sites in the greater region, including 5 sites within the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). The study will consist of: (1) sampling pond invertebrate densities and diversities; (2) analyzing genetic signatures of branchiopod crustacean populations; (3) conducting tank experiments on community assembly; (4) obtaining data on waterfowl migrating through NEON sites; (5) correlating effects of winds and rainfall on species traits; and (6) extracting, hatching, and identifying crustacean eggs from gut contents analysis of waterfowl. Overall, this research will test the validity of a poorly understood phenomenon, that the biota of systems can be coupled without respect to geographic proximity but instead tele-connected by wind or wing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The larger a &ldquo;macrosystem&rdquo; is and the more disconnected its elements are, the harder it is to study. In our macrosystem project, we sought to understand the long-term ecological functioning of ephemeral wetlands of the U.S. Great Plains from North Dakota to Texas. Such wetlands can consist of northern prairie potholes, playa wetlands throughout the range, and a variety of often smaller and unnamed wetlands. Most playas fill in the rainy season to a few feet in depth and dry within 1-2 months. They may then refill later that year or stay desiccated for a few months to multiple years or even decades in times of extreme droughts. These wetlands typically lack fish, though tiny mosquitofish (<em>Gambusia</em>) may sometimes survive in larger wetlands within small, isolated pools when the wetland mostly dries. For these playas to constitute an interconnected macrosystem, they need to be linked periodically in some fashion. To study these macrosystems, our project involved faculty and students primarily located at Bowling Green State University, Haskell Indian Nations University, Kansas University, New Mexico State University, Texas A&amp;M-Corpus Christi University, and William and Mary University. Researchers from these universities investigated long-distance communication (= &ldquo;teleconnections&rdquo; or &ldquo;telecommunications&rdquo;) via dispersion of environmentally resistant, fertilized eggs (= cysts) of three species of freshwater invertebrates (fairy, clam, and tadpole shrimps) by seasonally prevailing winds and bird migration. In the later case, the cysts are transported on either the exterior or interior of the waterfowl. Our NSF project involved: (a) collection of live shrimps for both microscopic and genetic analyses; (b) evaluation of external and internal (gut) contents of waterfowl to locate and hatch any cysts found there; (c) search for cysts among air-transported dust particles collected at the KU Field Station; and (d) a diversity of experiments in 20 or more 100-gal outdoor tanks situated in New Mexico, Kansas, and North Dakota. While genetic analyses are continuing, our study indicates that shrimp from a local state outcompete those from the four more distant states when playa dirt from five states are mixed, hatched in the outdoor tanks, and hatching success is compared with populations from wetland dirt from the local state (KS, ND, or NM). We conclude that teleconnections occur, but that the rate is so low that it is nearly impossible to confirm in a four-year project.
