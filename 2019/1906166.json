 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) from the Sun are key causes of space weather and solar storms. Such storms can damage satellites, disrupt radio communications and create blackouts of electricity power grids. Studying the origins of these events requires astronomical observations of the Sun, and measurements of polarization across the solar disk. Conventional ground-based astronomical observations cannot reliably measure such polarizations because the atmosphere of the Earth changes from time to time. This project will develop a novel high-speed polarimetry system that effectively freezes the atmospheric perturbations. Resulting polarization measurements will enable studying the solar magnetic fields that govern CMEs. This solar polarimetry system will have a broad scientific impact. Full polarization images at high-speed over the full solar disk on an all-day basis are highly needed by the scientific community. They will benefit society by enabling improved understanding of space weather. California State University, Northridge is an eligible Research in Undergraduate Institution (RUI) as well as a minority serving institution. The instrument developed here will serve as a long-term platform to support the training and research of minority and other students in their early scientific careers.\r\n\r\nSolar CMEs are often associated with pre-existing prominences. The determination of the magnetic field in the solar chromosphere before, during, and after a CME event will enable understanding the conditions that trigger CMEs, and the magnetic field properties of the ejected material. This polarimetry system will consist of a telescope with a diameter at least 235mm, a tunable Fabry-Perot interferometer, a high-speed polarimeter, and a sCMOS camera. It will provide a large field of view that covers the entire solar disk and it will enable all-day observations. This system will provide the full polarization images in the H-alpha and He D3 lines to infer the chromospheric magnetic field in CME precursors, prominences, or whole active regions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Solar magnetic fields are responsible for solar activities that govern the space weather. The study of evolutionary changes in solar magnetic fields is important to understand the process of energy build-up in active regions. This excess energy stored in solar active regions is believed to be responsible for solar prominence, filament and flare associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and other eruptive phenomena, which are of utmost concern to the space weather. To answer many open and fundamental questions in solar astrophysics, full-Stokes polarization measurements with high spatial, temporal resolution and high-precision of 10<sup>-</sup><sup>3</sup> to 10<sup>-</sup><sup>5</sup> are required.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Currently, almost all our knowledge gained from Stokes polarimetry about magnetic field properties is retrieved from the solar photosphere, and future work should increasingly focus on the solar chromosphere. The chromosphere is dilute. While the magnetic field in the photosphere is stronger than several hundred Gauss, the field strength in the chromosphere is on the order of a few to ten Gauss only, which makes the field measurements extremely difficult. To address the challenging issues for the CME associated magnetic field measurements, we have successfully developed a compact, low-cost and high-performance spectropolarimeter. Our system consists of a 280-mm telescope, a tunable etalon interferometer, a high-speed polarimeter, and a high-speed sCMOS camera. It will be used for solar synoptic observations at the He D<sub>3&nbsp;&nbsp;</sub><span>5876</span><span>&Aring;&nbsp;</span>and H-alpha 6563&Aring;&nbsp;lines (or other spectral line in the visible wavelength range) and it has the following unique features that other synoptic instruments will not offers: (1) it is the first sCMOS based polarimeter that can achieve a polarization measurement speed up to 100 Hz, which will able to freeze the atmospheric turbulence&nbsp; induced image distortion. Polarimetric accuracy with a <em>true polarization measurement </em>will therefore be achievable in ground-based observations; (2) it will be the first ground-based polarimetry system that can provide an instant 2-dimensional polarization image over a large field of view without the need of the traditional spectrograph slit scanning; (3) our polarimetry system will be the first instrument that acquires polarization measurements in the He D<sub>3</sub> and H-alpha lines for the CME associated events on an daily synoptic base.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Through this NSF support, we have developed the high-speed spectropolarimeter. Figure 1 shows the instrument in our dome, being used for solar scientific observations. Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the results of the Stokes intensity I and circular V polarization images on the Sunspot 3507, at different wavelengths in the 3.5&Aring; wavelength range centering on the He D<sub>3</sub> line. Figure 4 shows the corresponding Stokes intensity profile I and the circular polarization profile V as a function of the wavelength, centering on the He D<sub>3</sub> line. This measurement shows that solar umbra polarization with amplitude of 10<sup>-3</sup> can be reliably measured, which can be immediately used to study the magnetoacoustic shocks in the chromospheric umbra. The scientific capability being delivered by this instrument is highly needed by the solar synoptic observational community for the space weather research. In addition, the high-speed polarimetry technique could be used for magnetic field measurements with other large ground-based telescopes such as the 4-m DKIST to provide a <em>true polarization measurement</em>. Our dedicated instrument is being used for daily CME-associated polarization measurements, which other general facility telescopes will not offer, because of the time and access constraints. CSUN is a Research in Undergraduate Institution (RUI) as well as a Minority Serving Institution, and the developed instrument will serve as a long-term platform to support the training and research of our minority and diverse students in their early scientific career developments.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/12/2023<br>\nModified by: Deqing&nbsp;Ren</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1906166/1906166_10635630_1702425152201_Picture_2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1906166/1906166_10635630_1702425152201_Picture_2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1906166/1906166_10635630_1702425152201_Picture_2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">I intensity images at short (left), center (center) and long (right) wavelengths, in the 3.5\ufffd wavelength range, centering at the He D3 5876\ufffd. 1000 images of each with 2 ms are used.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">None</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Deqing&nbsp;Ren\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1906166/1906166_10635630_1702424369951_Picture_1--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1906166/1906166_10635630_1702424369951_Picture_1--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1906166/1906166_10635630_1702424369951_Picture_1--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Photograph of the completed spectropolarimeter in our campus dome building for the scientific observations.
