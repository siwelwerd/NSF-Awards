 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Experience in ALpine Meteorology (REALM) will rely on the natural scientific laboratory, provided by the nearby Wasatch Mountains and adjacent urban areas, to enhance student awareness of societal challenges, such as water availability and air quality, that require understanding the influence of alpine terrain on weather and climate processes. The Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Utah is recognized internationally for its expertise in atmospheric studies related to mountain environments.  Following the models used by successful Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) sites, a cohesive framework will be developed to manage a high-quality, cohort-based undergraduate summer program. REALM will welcome and support underrepresented students from a variety of backgrounds in a highly inclusive environment. The REU program will include an independent evaluation to ensure the REU site is meeting the project goals and creates a sustainable model for future REU programs. \r\n\r\nThe objectives for REALM are the following: (1) engage students in full-time active research; (2) provide professional development opportunities for students and mentors; (3) motivate students towards STEM careers by constructing an engaging, inclusive, and supportive cohort experience that includes exposing them through site visits to employment opportunities in the weather, water, and climate enterprise; and (4) improve students' science literacy oral and written communication skills.  Students will spend 8 weeks at the University of Utah conducting research and gaining relevant professional development.  The REU program will utilize a multiple mentor approach to support the student participants.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
