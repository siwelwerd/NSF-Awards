 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to the University of Pennsylvania, located in Philadelphia, PA, supports the training of 10 undergraduate students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2020-2022. In this program, funded by the Division of Chemistry, undergraduate participants develop diverse approaches to improving chemical reactions under the mentorship of faculty and graduate students or postdoctoral associates. An aspect unique to this site is that participants also gain exposure to high throughput experimentation (HTE) methods, training that is often limited to industry. Exposure to HTE provides a distinct experience for participants, one with long-term leverage into both academic and industrial career pathways. Participants take part in regular professional development activities where they hone their communication skills, explore career paths, and learn about responsible research conduct, preparing them for advanced degrees in STEM. \r\n\r\nThe research projects available for participants span a significant space across catalysis: method development, catalyst development, and synthetic applications, as well as extension into molecular dynamics and beyond. This program recruits students nationwide, with an emphasis on underrepresented student groups. A wide raging network of industrial and academic collaborations expose participants to a variety of viable career pathways with the goal of sustaining a diverse and competitive chemical science workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
