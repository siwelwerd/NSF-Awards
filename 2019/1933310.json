 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jets injected perpendicularly into a cross-stream, or transverse jets, exist both in nature and in a wide range of engineering applications. For example, transverse jets are used to control fuel-air mixing and cooling of turbine blades in gas turbine engines for aircraft as well as in stationary power plants. Such jets are also used for fluid injection in liquid rocket engine pre-burners and in environmental control systems. A volcanic plume may also behave like a transverse jet in a windy environment. Controlling and optimizing transverse jet behavior can improve fuel efficiency, control vehicle performance, and potentially reduce environmental impact, all of which are important economic, energy and national security goals. Recent experimental studies have demonstrated the value of actively controlling transverse jets, or controlling the flow immediately exterior to the jets, in order to improve performance for a range of flow regimes and applications. The proposed experimental studies in this project are designed to focus, in greater detail, on the fundamental physics of transverse jet instabilities. This include studying their dynamical character, how they arise, and hence how they may be actively controlled in a robust manner. The broader impacts of the proposed studies will expand beyond practical applications and graduate level research. It will include undergraduate research training, community outreach, and summer laboratory experiences for local high school and community college students and potentially undergraduates at other universities.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed experimental research activities will examine shear layer instabilities and asymmetries that naturally form in the transverse jet flow field, and how different approaches for excitation can control jet behavior tailored to different classes of applications.  In addition to fundamental exploration for the single, nozzle-generated transverse jet, it is proposed to examine an alternative configuration, a coaxial jet in crossflow.  This will determine the effects of a new modality for control of shear layer instabilities via creation of counter-current shear using suction or blowing in the outer annular section of the coaxial jet.  The studies will also build on recent discoveries of dynamical lock-in, quasi-periodicity, and regular patterns in modes associated with proper orthogonal decomposition from laser-based imaging of the single transverse jet.  Corresponding studies involving linear stability theory applied to transverse jet shear layer dynamics are expected to be pursued via an international collaboration with researchers at the Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF) in Brazil.  The proposed studies have the potential to yield unprecedented understanding and identification of control methodologies for future innovations in propulsion and energy generation systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe major goals for research and educational activities in this study involved exploring the origins and fluid mechanical control of transverse jet shear layer instabilities and alternative mechanisms by which low-energy perturbation methods may be employed to alter jet structure, symmetry/asymmetry, and molecular mixing. The research exploits recently discovered and unexpected insights into two fundamental phenomena: (1) the origins of upstream shear layer (USL) instabilities in the transverse jet or jet in crossflow (JICF), and their known transition from being weak and convectively unstable (CU) to being very strong and absolutely unstable (AU), and (2) the origins and control of asymmetries in the jet flowfield and relevance to mixing enhancement. The extent of accomplishments and further new discoveries was broadened to include exploration of lock-in of USL instabilities to axisymmetric and asymmetric excitation, control of mixing and dynamical characteristics for the JICF, passive mixing control via tabs as well as localized suction, and variable density transverse jets. The broader impacts of these studies expanded beyond the practical applications and typical graduate level research and education to include undergraduate student research, outreach to underrepresented groups at the pre-college and college level, and public interviews. An additional broader impact activity, during 2020-21, involved COVID-19-related optical imaging at the UCLA hospital, in response to the request of physicians, of maternal breathing during labor and delivery (L&D) as a means of informing hospital personnel of special protective precautions needed for L&D staff.\n\n\nThe origins of the transition, and the analogy of the USL to a counter-current shear layer (CCSL), were explored in several different ways. One involved experimental studies with an alternative configuration to the single JICF, a coaxial counter-current jet in crossflow. Here the outer annular flow is designed to create localized suction, in some cases located in the vicinity of the upstream shear layer to force a CCSL to be present (and potentially create actively controllable conditions for transition to absolute instability) and in other cases the suction is applied elsewhere about the jet periphery. These studies suggest that there can indeed be a transition induced via suction in transverse jet USL instability characteristics and jet structure. These experiments were augmented by linear stability analysis (LSA) for coaxial counter-current round jets by Prof. Leonardo Alves and his students at Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF) -Brazil. Additional instability origin studies focused on the variable (low, and more recently, high) density JICF injected from our standard flush-mounted round nozzle, and in addition, for equidensity JICF studies of the CCSL and its stability characteristics for alternative injectors: the flush round pipe, the elevated nozzle, the flush nozzle with tabs, and the coaxial nozzle, again with corresponding LSA by our collaborators in Brazil.\n\n\nOur discoveries on the effects of axisymmetric and external helical or asymmetric excitation of the JICF on the dynamics of the USL, specifically, dynamical lock-in, quasi-periodicity, and regular patterns in modes associated with proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) from laser-based imaging, have also introduced intriguing new directions for transverse jet control. These findings suggest that there can be a number of alternative perturbation methods (especially relatively low-energy approaches) that can have a significant effect on jet structure and mixing for both the nozzle-generated and the coaxial nozzle-generated JICF. We completed a study of the effects of passive tabs placed within the periphery of the jet exit, as well as studies involving controlled vortex generation via axisymmetric excitation as well as small scale flush-mounted speakers about the round jet orifice associated with asymmetric jet excitation. An understanding of the USL stability and disturbance growth rates is a crucial element to the robust control of such flows, and in addition to experiments, we have been exploring 2D nonlinear stability analysis as well as the effects of alternative base flows on JICF stability characteristics.\n\n\nSince the initiation of this project in September, 2019, a significant number of presentations at meetings and universities, in addition to technical papers on JICF dynamics and control have been disseminated and/or published. Four Ph.D. dissertations were partially supported by this grant, as was part of the research by two postdoctoral scholars. In addition, we have had several undergraduate research assistants supported under the NSF REU supplemental awards.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/08/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: AnnRKaragozian\n"
