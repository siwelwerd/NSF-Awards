 "awd_abstract_narration": "Working with industry, high school, and college partners, this project aims to create a model for a work study-based associates degree in Information Technology.  To accomplish this goal, the project will complete three specific aims.  First, it will establish an industry-aligned work study model for information technology education.  The program of study will align with flexible industry-recognized apprenticeship approaches and enable students to synergistically learn and earn. The curriculum will be designed to provide foundational science, technology, engineering, and mathematics knowledge, balanced with specific technology competencies.  The second specific aim is to establish a dual credit information technology pathway for high school students, with professional development to enable high school teachers to teach the dual credit courses.  The third specific aim is to publish a technical guide to facilitate replication of the program and pilot the program at Marion Technical College in Ohio. The project has the potential to produce a replicable, flexible work study program designed for the information technology industry that could be implemented nationwide. As a result, it will contribute to building capacity in the nation's cybersecurity workforce.\r\n\r\nThe project goal is to leverage a collaboratively-developed and industry-led curriculum, leading to the creation, pilot, and scaling of an experiential learning model for students in Information Technology (IT) pathways starting in cybersecurity. An Associate Degree in Cybersecurity will be adapted to incorporate the work study experience. Work study orientation in the first year of the program and work study opportunities in the second year will prepare students to enter the workforce upon graduation. Wrap around services, including a comprehensive orientation and intrusive advising will inform students about the details of the program, and support them as they progress through it. Flexible schedules and learning experiences will facilitate student/employer interactions. With guidance from industry, essential skills and job tasks will be identified and moved earlier in the program of study to better prepare students for their work study experiences. Work study placements will include production-level roles that are re-conceptualized to support student completion of a two-year degree. To support veterans, current military codes and skills will be mapped to the curriculum and the project team will provide training and strategies for supporting military and veteran students in the classroom. Following development of the cybersecurity work study model, the program will be scaled to other IT pathways. The project team will collaborate with regional high schools to engage students in IT dual credit pathways. A Cyber Institute recruiting event will raise awareness of and interest in cybersecurity and IT, as well as recruit students into the program. Project components include conducting work readiness activities and providing competency-based modules to high school teachers to credential them to teach dual credit IT courses. The project will develop products that will be disseminated to other institutions, including a new industry-led replicable work study model in IT pathways, Early IT Pathways Initiative for high school, and a technical guide for replication and piloting at other institutions nationwide. This project is funded by NSF's Advanced Technological Education program, which focuses on the education of technicians for the high-technology fields that drive our nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\nProject Summary\n\n\n\n\nThe Information Technology Flexible Apprenticeship (ITFA) project (DUE 1902211) at Columbus State Community College (CSCC), was a collaboration with Marion Technical College (MTC) to create, pilot, and scale an experiential learning model for students in IT pathways. ITFA engaged employers by leveraging existing industry partnerships and developing new ones to prepare a pipeline of technicians that meet industry demand. By partnering with regional school districts and engaging students in high school through IT dual credit options, the project provided a steady foundation for their academic and career pathway. Students in the program complete a pre-apprenticeship that consists of frontloaded technical coursework at CSCC in their program of study, and soft skill development through the Career Services department. Students then participate in an interviewing event where they are hired into paid flexible apprenticeships with a partnering employer. While students are completing their apprenticeships, they are also finishing their coursework to get an associate degree and additional certifications they wish to pursue.\n\n\n\n\nKey Accomplishments\n\n\nFlexible Apprenticeship Outcomes  The project produced six cohorts over the grant, with more than 450 enrolled students who received 117 apprenticeships with 16 employer partners. The program team continuously expanded degree program offerings and apprenticeship opportunities to ten credential programs and a five-fold increase in employer partners since the first year. The college will continue to sustain the program for the foreseeable future.\n\n\n\nK-12 Industry Technician Pipeline  To create a 2+2 pipeline from local high schools, the project created career development curriculum offered in state dual enrollment IT courses in addition to having offered flexible professional development for high school teachers through partner institutions and online industry recognized credential options.\n\n\n\n\nReplication Guide  Pulling from the success of the flexible apprenticeship program, the Earn-and-Learn: Work-Based Learning Program Replication Guide for Information Technology shares key components of the program to guide institutions in the creation or modification of their own flexible apprenticeship program. Highlights include a suggested curriculum model, DEI processes in recruitment and retention, and employer partnership strategies.\n\n\n\n\n\nImpact\n\n\n\n\nThe ITFA grant's impact is profound for the college and the Columbus region. Successfully standing up a flexible apprenticeship program within the IT sector has created sustainable models for other areas of the college and a key component to the colleges future in technician education. Not only facilitating cross-department collaboration among workforce development, career education, and academic departments through program implementation and data collection practices, the grant has also created a positive culture within all involved departments leading to high performance. Project success has also been influenced by expanding employer involvement through the Cybersecurity Business and Industry Leadership Team, creating value in local IT culture for entry talent, and overcoming challenges with the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent economic environment through innovative practices.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/26/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: LawrenceJMcwherter\n"
