 "awd_abstract_narration": "In response to the urgent need to improve societal capabilities to withstand and recover from major natural or man-made catastrophic events, community microgrids are designed to provide sustainable and resilient electric energy supply for critical services.  With increased penetration of community microgrids and distributed energy resources, distribution systems are transforming from traditionally passive radial networks operated by a single utility to more sophisticated active networked topologies with multiple autonomic entities.  This transformation in distribution systems has resulted in a need to reshape the way electricity services are delivered and distribution systems are designed and managed.  To address these challenges, this CAREER project will investigate new approaches for comprehensive modeling of distinct characteristics of emerging distribution systems with a proliferation of community microgrids, and explore optimal operation strategies for enhancing the sustainability and resiliency of distribution systems.  Specifically, a two-tier hierarchical restructuring framework is proposed for guiding the optimal operation and coordination of distribution systems and community microgrids, with special focus on investigating fundamental market clearing mechanisms and efficient computation tools.  Results from this research could facilitate the optimal design of future fully liberalized retail distribution markets and related energy policies, and guide the active participation of microplayer-like electricity prosumers (producer-consumers) in such distribution-level markets.  The research efforts will be complemented by an education and outreach plan aimed at increasing public awareness and understanding of the complexity of distribution systems restructuring, and to prepare the next generation workforce with needed skills to meet the needs of the power industry.\r\n\r\nBoth physical feasibility and financial viability of individual autonomic entities are key to the successful implementation of distribution system restructuring and retail electricity markets.  This project will address such challenges via five integrated research and educational activities, namely: (i) Exploring market operation and pricing mechanisms for distribution system operators based on comprehensive unbalanced three-phase alternating current optimal power flow models and efficient computation methods.  The proposed per-phase nodal distribution locational marginal pricing concept can effectively incentivize the continued participation of various distribution customers in retail electricity markets;  (ii) Investigating market operation and pricing mechanisms for community microgrid operators based on comprehensive unbalanced three-phase alternating current unit commitment models and efficient computation methods.  The proposed per-phase nodal community locational marginal pricing concept can effectively coordinate heterogeneous community partners under both grid-connected and islanded operation modes, and incentivize their continued participation in community microgrids.  Flexibilities of typical community microgrid partners are also investigated to help guide their strategic bidding in community microgrids;  (iii) Addressing major research questions via the proposed models and computation methods to further promote the implementation of distribution systems restructuring;  (iv) Validating the proposed research in simulated and realistic system models;  and (v) Exploring knowledge and skill requirements for the sustainable operation and effective restructuring of emerging distribution systems and community microgrids, and investigating education and training needs for retooling existing power engineering programs and curricula.",
