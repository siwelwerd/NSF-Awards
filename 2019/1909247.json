 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent detections of gravitational waves by NSF's LIGO observatories and by astronomers of the motions of stars and gas near supermassive black holes, such as the one at the center of the Milky Way, have opened the possibility of testing Einstein's theory in realms where the warping of spacetime is extreme.   Yet in order to test Einstein's great theory, it is essential to know what it actually predicts for real measurements.  This project continues a program of research to provide concrete links between the abstract beauty and complex mathematics of Einstein's theory and the real world where measurements are made by physicists and astronomers.   These links are established by finding approximate, yet accurate solutions of the equations in forms that are practical and usable.    The outcomes of this research will be used by data experts at the gravitational-wave observatories to perform better tests of general relativity using newly detected signals, and will be used by astronomers to probe how general relativity affects complex systems such as stars orbiting supermassive black holes, or three-body systems involving bodies ranging from black holes to exoplanets.   Einstein's theory is a topic that fascinates the general public, and the PI will continue to give public lectures on topics related to this research, bringing understanding of Einstein's ideas to the broader community.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this project will contribute to the ability of ground-based gravitational-wave observatories such as the LIGO-Virgo network to test general relativity, by computing the equations of motion for binary star systems, along with the emitted gravitational waveforms, as predicted by an important alternative theory, known as Einstein-Aether gravity, to high accuracy in the so-called post-Newtonian approximation.  It will provide accurate waveforms predicted by this theory in a format that can be adapted to LIGO-Virgo data analysis methods.   Another important question that will be addressed is whether the evolution of binary orbits with general relativistic effects included leaves any residual orbital ellipticity in the final stages, leading to observable modulations of the gravitational signals emitted. The project also extends recent work of the PI on incorporating the effects of Einstein's theory into the dynamics of three-body systems, such as a star-exoplanet system in the presence of a third body, or a binary-black-hole system in a galactic core with a supermassive black hole at its center.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIs Einstein's theory of general relativity the correct theory of gravity, and if so, what difference does it make?  Although general relativity has successfully passed numerous experimental tests, it is important to continue to test it, especially in new regimes, such as near black holes and with gravitational waves.   And even if we assume that it is correct, it may have important effects in a variety of astrophysical situations.  Testing general relativity and studying its astrophysical implications are the two main themes of this research project.\n\nThe detection of gravitational radiation in 2015 provided a new means of testing general relativity.  At the same time, it is important to understand what competing theories predict for these waves, in order to evaluate the significance of any given test.  We analyzed one class of alternative theories to general relativity known as \"Einstein-Aether\" theories.  We used a method known as \"post-Newtonian\" theory, which has been a highly successful technique for systematically finding approximate but accurate solutions to general relativity for systems of astrophysical interest, such as binary star systems emitting gravitational waves.  However, this class of theories is significantly more complex than general relativity, and a number of special adjustments of the technique had to be made.  Nevertheless, we obtained solutions to the equations to the level of accuracy needed, and began to use them to obtain the equations of motion for binary black hole systems, and the gravitational-wave signal they emit.  \n\nGeneral relativity predicts black holes, and astronomical observations have revealed that they exist in many places, notably in the centers of galaxies. We analyzed the possibility that the supermassive black hole Sgr A* known to reside in the center of our Milky Way galaxy might have an intermediate-mass black-hole companion.  The gravity of such a companion would induce perturbations of the orbits of stars that have been observed revolving around Sgr A*.  Using over 20 years of data on the orbit of one of the stars, known as S0-2, we placed a significant limit on the mass of such a companion black hole, and showed that it must be either very close to the black hole or very far outside the orbit of S0-2.  We also studied the extent to which a companion black hole orbiting close to S0-2 could drive it into a substantially larger or smaller orbit, causing it to be either ejected from the central star cluster or injected down the black hole. \n\nUsing approximate but highly accurate orbital equations derived from general relativity, we studied how the orbits of binary black hole systems evolve with time.  Such systems emit gravitational waves, and as a result, their orbits shrink and become more circular.  We made accurate estimates of the residual non-circularity of such orbits at the time when the gravitational waves they emit are detectable by the array of ground-based gravitational-wave observatories LIGO and Virgo.  These estimates will be useful both for improving the detection capabilities of the observatories, and for understanding the origins of such binary black hole systems.\n\nThree-body systems also play an important role in astrophysics, in situations ranging from exoplanets to binary systems orbiting supermassive black holes.  Yet, even in the simplest theory of gravity, that of Newton, the dynamics of triple systems is essentially unsolvable, and is known to be chaotic.   Nevertheless, in one circumstance, where one of the bodies orbits at a substantial distance from a closely orbiting pair (a so-called \"hierarchical\" system), substantial progress can be made using sophisticated methods of approximation.  We applied a technique from mathematical physics, known as the \"two timescale\" technique, to this problem.  This method is well-known in many branches of physics and engineering, but is not widely used in astrophysics.  By carrying this method to higher levels of accuracy, we confirmed existing results in this field derived by conventional techniques, but also obtained new results, particularly relevant to cases where the outer third body is more massive than the closely orbiting binary system.  We also studied the effects of adding perturbations from general relativity to the evolution of these triple systems.    \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/20/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Clifford M Will"
