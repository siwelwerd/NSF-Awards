 "awd_abstract_narration": "This multidisciplinary research seeks to understand the timing, magnitude, and overall contribution of newly flooded land areas in the northern hemisphere to rapid increases in atmospheric methane concentrations during the last deglaciation (18-8 ka). Polar ice core records reveal dynamic increases in atmospheric methane concentrations during this period, but the source of this methane remains the subject of much debate. This study will measure the isotopic values of methane emissions from field samples to provide region-specific estimates of methane emissions from coastal wetlands, peatlands, proglacial lakes, and other lake types (e.g. thermokarst and post-glacial lakes) since the last deglaciation for comparisons with ice core records. This research will reconstruct the past methane emissions from flooded deglacial land areas (potentially representing unknown northern sources of increased atmospheric methane concentrations during these periods) and assess their role in contributing to the abrupt methane increases observed in in polar ice core records. Knowledge of past methane emissions from newly inundated land areas flooded by sea level rise, wetland expansion, permafrost thaw, and associated lake formation will provide an improved understanding of global climate feedbacks that will likely accelerate in the region. This knowledge is critical to answering larger societal questions about the role of northern systems in global environmental change and our ability to understand the cascade of effects from sea level rise and coastal flooding.\r\n\r\nThis research uses comprehensive paleoecological records of (a) northern continental shelf areas and coastal wetlands inundated by rapid deglacial sea-level rise (SLR) and (b) proglacial lake areas inundated by glacier and ice-sheet melt to document their past contributions to abrupt increases in atmospheric methane concentrations. The research goals are to: (1) synthesize new and existing shelf, coastal wetland, regional SLR curves, and proglacial-lake initiation data to reconstruct newly inundated areas poleward of 30? N; (2) estimate past methane flux from inundated northern coastal regions as they evolved from methane-consuming forest and grassland areas to higher emitting mudflats, marshes, and freshwater wetlands by integrating new and existing methane fluxes into an empirical model; (3) analyze new and existing methane fluxes from proglacial lakes of different sizes, ages and geographies to build an empirical model for reconstructing proglacial lake emissions from 18 ka to present (with an emphasis on the deglacial period,18-8 ka); (4) use stable isotopes (&#8706;13C, &#8706;D) of methane and 14C dating to constrain the magnitude and timing of methane flux from these newly flooded land areas; and (5) compare our reconstructions of past methane emissions and isotope fluxes from inundated shelves, coastal wetlands, and proglacial lakes with global atmospheric methane constraints based on recent, higher resolution data of methane isotopes (&#8706;13C, &#8706;D, 14C) from Greenland and Antarctic ice cores using atmospheric box modeling.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Ice cores collected from Greenland demonstrate that abrupt (decadal-scale) increases in North Atlantic temperature and precipitation coincided with an abrupt rise in atmospheric methane<sub> </sub>concentration (AMC). The origin of this climate/methane coupling likely reflects a strong teleconnection between terrestrial ecosystems and abrupt climate change that is at least hemispheric in extent. While low latitude wetlands are generally accepted to be the major source of atmospheric methane during<sub> </sub>the last glacial termination, the interpolar methane gradient, an indicator of the latitudinal distribution of methane sources computed from the methane concentration difference between contemporaneous Greenland and Antarctic ice cores, suggests that a new northern high latitude source contributed up to 41% of the new global methane emissions during 11,500 to 9,500 years ago. The source of the increase in northern AMC remains the subject of much debate. Several hypotheses have been put forth to explain the rise in AMC, including the release of methane<sub> </sub>clathrates, northern peatland development, and the formation of thermokarst (permafrost thaw) lakes. Radiocarbon ages of methane in the Greenland ice cores further constrained the AMC increase to a source(es) dominated by contemporary (not radiocarbon-depleted) methane-carbon, such as wetlands.</p>\r\n<p>The overarching goal of this project was to integrate paleoecology, climatology, biogeochemistry, geomorphology, and geology to understand the timing, magnitude, and contribution of previously-unaccounted-for, extensive land areas poleward of 30 &deg;N flooded by ice-sheet melt and sea-level rise to abrupt increases in northern atmospheric methane sources during the last deglaciation. We built upon our existing syntheses of northern peatland and lake databases to include deglacial-period methane emissions from terrestrial environments that were rapidly inundated by ice-sheet melt. These include previously exposed continental shelves and terrestrial ecosystems that transitioned to coastal wetlands (including mudflats and deltas) and proglacial lakes formed by impoundment of meltwater in front of ice sheets. We hypothesized that methane emissions from these extensive, flooded terrestrial ecosystems constituted a significant feedback between sea level rise and climate through the warming effect of atmospheric methane. These sources of contemporary methane would be consistent with polar ice core records.</p>\r\n<p>During the past 20,000 years, more than 2.8&nbsp;million square kilometers of previously unglaciated coastal, near-shore areas of today's Bering, Chukchi, Laptev, and East Siberian seas were flooded due to the melting of the Laurentide, Cordilleran, and Eurasian ice sheets. This now-inundated shelf and land area (an area larger than Greenland), is known as &#8245;Beringia&#8245;. We estimated methane emissions from coastal wetlands in Beringia for the past 20,000 years by applying modern-day emissions to the extent of reconstructed coastal wetland areas based on an extended geospatial analysis of inundated coastal areas during sea level rise. Maximum emissions (1.6-7.5 Tg CH4/year) 14,000 years ago preceded peak emissions from northern peatlands and thermokarst lakes, better aligning with polar ice core reconstructions of the northern source.</p>\r\n<p>While large proglacial lakes collectively flooded millions of square kilometers in the northern hemisphere over the last deglacial period, we focused our reconstruction on potential methane emissions from a single, large proglacial lake, Lake Agassiz in North America. Combining paleorecords of sediment organic geochemistry, sediment carbon accumulation, and paleolake area and bathymetry with observations of present-day proglacial lake methane emissions (including those based on novel remote sensing approaches), we estimated that Lake Agassiz contributed 0.4-2.7 Tg CH4/year during the last deglaciation. Although poor constraints of past global proglacial lake areas and morphologies currently prevent extrapolation of our results, we suggest that these systems were likely an additional source of methane (adding to coastal wetlands, thermokarst lake and glacial lake emissions) during the last deglacial transition that require further study.</p>\r\n<p>Knowledge of past methane emissions from newly inundated land areas by sea-level rise, ice-sheet melt, wetland expansion, permafrost thaw, and associated lake formation provides understanding of global climate feedbacks that will likely accelerate in arctic regions.
