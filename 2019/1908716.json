 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cosmology can be described as the study of the history, future, structure, and geometry of the Universe and is a foundation of astronomical research.  Astronomers' current best understanding of cosmology comes from using a certain type of exploding stars\r\n(supernovae) to \"map\" the Universe.  However, a fundamental tenet of science is that results should be tested and confirmed with independent methods.  This investigation thus seeks to determine if another type of astronomical object can be used to test current theories.  These objects are black holes that lurk in the cores of all massive galaxies, some of which are actively \"feeding\" today and are called \"quasars\".  Ultimately the goal is to attempt to determine if a sub-class of quasars can be used in the same way as supernovae to map the geometry of the universe.  In this process a graduate student will be trained in modern data science methods and both the student and PI will support education and public outreach, through activities involving Drexel's Lynch Observatory, engaging with elementary and middle-school classrooms, and actively working to increase inclusion and diversity at both Drexel University and in the science community in general.\r\n\r\nThis project has potential for advancing science because known quasars vastly outnumber the supernovae that are currently the foundation of cosmology and the quasars \"live\" longer in addition to having been discovered across cosmic time.  What one might hope to learn from them would provide independent constraints on existing methods.  This project will undertake a novel method for leveraging machine learning to improve and expand upon the use of quasars for cosmology.  The work involves calibrating two relationships that can be applied to up to 500,000 known quasars and can be accomplished using existing public data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.  The project is designed as a 1-year high-risk, high potential reward exploratory investigation that the proposing team is uniquely positioned to carry out. The results of this investigation will be broadly distributed, by making code and data products available not only through the science literature, but also common data-sharing platforms and outreach activities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Anyone looking at the night sky can understand one of the fundamental problems astronomers have to deal with: how far away are things?  The stars that we see in the sky all *look* like they are at the same distance.  But some are much, much further away than others.  Since the amount of light that we receive from an object twice as far away as its \"twin\" is 4x less not 2x less, we can understand just how important it is to accurately determine distances.\nThe tried-and-true method to determine accurate distances for galaxies that are very far away from us is to take advantage of a property of certain types of exploding stars in those galaxies.  These stars all have about the same intrinsic brightness, so how bright they appear to us tells us how far away they are.  That information, in turn, is needed to understand the \"geometry\" of the universe, which is a central goal of the branch of astronomy called \"cosmology\".\nHowever, those exploding stars take effort to find, only shine for about 6 months, and must be found at their peak brightness to be useful for distance determination experiments.  Our work instead sought to use a different source of light for the experiment: \"quasars\".  Quasars are just the name that we give to galaxies that have supermassive black holes in their cores (as does our own Milky Way), where those black holes are actively \"eating\" new material (for example gas and dust from the exploding stars).  The black holes themselves don't give off light, but the disk of material funneling into the black holes do -- indeed quite a bit of light! \nThis project was a 1-year exploratory project to test the feasibility of two different ways to use quasars for this experiment.  We first wanted to attempt to try to improve upon a method proposed by our colleagues in 2015 that requires having both ultraviolet and X-ray data for each quasar.   We next sought to find a way to use quasars only having UV data -- without the need for X-ray data which is expensive to obtain.  Initial results were included in two publications in refereed journals by a Drexel graduate student.  The project also led to an undergraduate senior research report and is currently the topic of another senior research project, which we hope will lead to another refereed journal publication in the Summer of 2023. \nThe combination of those publications captures the intellectual merit of this project.  Broader impact was achieved through scientific training for a number of students and the outreach efforts of these students and the PI, which included middle school visits as part of Project Astro, monthly telescope open houses (both until the pandemic hit) in addition to diversity and inclusion efforts by student officers of the Physics Graduate Student Association and the Minority and Women in Physics group.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/10/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gordon T Richards"
