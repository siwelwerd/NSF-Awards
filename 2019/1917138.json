 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a strong national and global need to develop crop plants that yield greater food, feed, fiber and bioenergy related products, and that are more tolerant of abiotic and biotic stresses, while requiring less inputs and having reduced environmental impacts during production. One critical tool used for crop genome research and genetic improvement is genetic engineering. However, current genetic engineering systems don't work efficiently, or at all, for many important crop species or varieties within species, limiting the research and improvement progress that can be made with those crops. Research conducted on this project is aimed at 1) development and optimization of efficient genetic engineering systems that can be utilized across a wide array of varieties, 2) creation of enhanced, open-source crop engineering tools and biological materials for use in public crop genome research and genetic enhancement, and 3) education and training in plant transformation principles, practices and stewardship of transgenic/edited plants. As a part of these outreach efforts, team members will host an intensive workshop on transformation methods and protocols to disseminate the knowledge to other laboratories. \r\n\r\nGenetic engineering systems are critical tools for the advancement of crop functional genomics research and genomics-based crop improvement efforts both in the U.S. and worldwide. Current crop transformation systems are limited, however, by genotype specificity, high complexity and low efficiency of the processes, variable responses of target tissues, and an overall lack of capacity at the national level. To overcome the above limitations, research will be conducted to meet the following objectives: 1) develop efficient, high throughput, genotype-flexible meristem-based transformation systems for maize and soybean targeting easily isolated, pretreatable, storable explants; 2) improve the breadth and efficiency of Agrobacterium-based plant transformation systems via enhanced vector design, strain manipulation and enhanced public access; and 3) rapid and effective transfer of the knowledge and research outcomes from the project via publication, training and a workshop, and implementation of  the improved protocols in public transformation research applications and services. Results from this research will lead to important advancement in understanding the plant transformation process and the role of specific biological, chemical and physical factors in dicot and monocot meristem-based plant transformation success and efficiency. New knowledge will also be generated regarding the function of individual and combined super-binary vector components and Agrobacterium strains on the plant transformation process. New knowledge, protocols, and biological/molecular materials developed through the research will be made widely available and contribute to development and deployment of enhanced crop transformation systems in the public sector, and training of the next generation of scientists in plant transformation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
