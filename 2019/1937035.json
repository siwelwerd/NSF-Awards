 "awd_abstract_narration": "American University (AU) will implement an ADVANCE Catalyst project: 1) to undertake the collection and synthesis of quantitative and qualitative faculty data with attention to intersectional perspectives as well as non-tenure track faculty; 2) to review structures, policies and procedures that impact equity among faculty in STEM; and 3) to develop and disseminate a STEM Faculty Equity Plan that is aligned with the university-wide Strategic Plan and Inclusive Excellence Plan. AU is a medium-sized, urban, private research university and will be a model for other similar institutions. This two-year project will prepare the university for future data collection and data analyses of faculty equity which can be used by institutional leadership to inform decision-making.  The Catalyst work will also prepare the institution to implement evidence-based strategies to enhance the university climate for all faculty which will be outlined in a five-year faculty equity strategic plan that will be produced as part of this project.   \r\n\r\nThe NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions.  Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational culture and climate.  ADVANCE \"Catalyst\" awards provide support for institutional equity assessments and the development of five-year faculty equity strategic plans at an academic, non-profit institution of higher education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntroduction\nAmerican University (AU) received a Catalyst Grant in 2019 to support a two-year project entitled, ADVANCE AU: Assessing Gender and Racial Equity Among STEM Faculty.  ADVANCE AU was an intentional, inclusive, and intersectional assessment of the university\u2019s full-time faculty (tenured, tenure-track, and non-tenured), including the structures, policies, and procedures that systemically impede equity for women and underrepresented minority (URM) faculty in STEM fields.  ADVANCE AU had three distinct aims: 1) to undertake the collection and synthesis of quantitative and qualitative faculty data, 2) to review structures, policies, and procedures that impact women and/or equity among faculty in STEM, and 3) to develop and disseminate a STEM Faculty Equity Plan.\n\n\nCollection and Synthesis of Faculty Data\nThe ADVANCE AU project team implemented mixed methods research, including focus groups, analyses of faculty demographic data, and climate surveys to determine the status of women and URM faculty in STEM areas and beyond.  These analyses contributed to the identification of barriers that interfere with women and URM faculty members\u2019 career development and their ability to thrive. Findings indicated systemic barriers such as lack of mentoring/sponsoring, non-inclusive promotion process for faculty, and lack of best practices for hiring and retaining women and URM faculty.  Similarly, commitment to strengthening the research and teaching portfolios of women STEM faculty is lacking at the department and university levels.  These findings have influenced and contributed to significant faculty diversity, equity, and inclusion reform on AU\u2019s campus, (most recently, a collection of recommendations created by the university\u2019s Task Force on Term Faculty Reappointment).  Most important, the project\u2019s findings indicated that retention data is critical to the university\u2019s ability to retain URM women faculty over time. This is evident in both the quantitative and qualitative data collected over the course of the project.  \n \nStructures, Policies, and Procedures\nThe ADVANCE AU team established an annual STEM faculty summit to broaden equity and antiracist-focused conversations among STEM faculty.  The annual summit is a space where faculty meet with provost-level administrators to discuss the implementation and development of faculty policies and procedures.  The ADVANCE AU team conducted three presentations at the annual university-wide Ann Ferren Conference to gain information from faculty about current policies, such as promotion for term (non-tenure track) faculty and mentoring/sponsoring for women and URM faculty across the university.  The information and data gained from women and URM faculty at this conference were documented in notes for analysis. Finally, the ADVANCE AU team performed a qualitative analysis of all the university\u2019s tenure, promotion, and reappointment guidelines to assess the focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion.  As a result, the university is now in the process of updating each unit\u2019s tenure, promotion, and reappointment guidelines to require faculty to contribute to DEI in teaching, service and research where appropriate.\n \nDevelop and Disseminate a STEM Faculty Equity Plan\n\nDuring the final year of the ADVANCE AU project, the team held a two-day retreat to examine data collected by the team followed by extensive faculty discussions on how to advance diversity, equity, antiracism, and inclusion among faculty (both tenured and untenured) at AU.   Steering committee members, project team members, academic leaders, and provost office staff participated in the retreat.  Discussion topics ranged from broad themes of values and purpose to specific innovations such as cluster hiring. The STEM Equity Plan was developed by the team based on discussions at the retreat.  The final Plan will be disseminated in Fall 2022.\n\nIn fall 2022, the STEM Faculty Equity Plan Task Force will convene to determine the responsible and accountable parties for each objective of the plan. This task force, consisting of both faculty and staff, will also develop a timeline to drive institutional accountability. This method of cross-campus collaboration is expected to enhance each party\u2019s motivation and willingness to participate in the proposed action steps. \n\n \n\nSummary\n\nOverall, ADVANCE AU collected data to inform the university\u2019s understanding of the systemic and structural barriers for women and URM STEM faculty at AU---a medium-sized, urban, private research university.  While the project team accomplished its stated goals, future work is needed to build upon the findings by incorporating and institutionalizing activities, policies, and structures that will enhance the experiences of women and the URM STEM faculty at AU. \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/28/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Monica Jackson"
