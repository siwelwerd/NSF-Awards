 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coastal ecosystems like the Florida Everglades provide many benefits to society. They protect coastlines from storms and store carbon. They provide habitat and food for important fisheries. They also support tourism and local economies, and store freshwater for millions of people. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program addresses how and why coastal ecosystems are changing in response to sea level rise and the actions of people. Like many coastal ecosystems, the Florida Everglades are threatened by the diversion of freshwater to support urban and agricultural expansion. At the same time, sea level rise has caused coastal ecosystems to become saltier, threatening the freshwater supply, stressing freshwater plants, and causing the soils to collapse. When the soils beneath coastal wetlands disappear, seawater invades even more quickly. Researchers in the FCE LTER are continuing long-term studies and experiments to understand how these changes influence ecosystem functions and services. They are also developing tools for resource managers to create an effective freshwater restoration program. The science team includes an active community of graduate students. As a group, they reach the public through education and outreach activities, and regularly advise policy-makers on resource management decisions.\r\n\r\nThe FCE LTER research program addresses how changing fresh and marine supplies of water influence coastal ecosystem dynamics through: (i) continued long-term assessment of changes in biogeochemistry, primary production, organic matter, and trophic dynamics in ecosystems along freshwater-to-marine gradients, (ii) maintenance of existing in situ and ex situ long-term experiments, (iii) use of high-resolution remote sensing, coupled with models to forecast landscape-scale changes, (iv) addition of synoptic satellite sites to capture discrete spatio-temporal responses to episodic disturbance, and (v) initiation of new experimental manipulations to determine drivers and mechanisms of resilience to saltwater intrusion. Data syntheses integrate month-to-annual and inter-annual data into models of water, nutrients, carbon, and species dynamics throughout the Everglades landscape to compare how ecosystems with different productivities and carbon stores respond (maintain, increase, or decline) to short- (pulses) and long-term changes (presses) in hydrologic connectivity. Understanding and predicting the drivers of abrupt changes in ecosystems is a key challenge in ecosystem ecology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Subsequent above and below-ground intrusion of saltwater - a key stressor - and the limiting nutrient, phosphorus (P) - the primary resource - interact to regulate marsh, mangrove, and seagrass plant growth, as well as the transport and breakdown of organic matter by microbial communities. Although the press of seawater intrusion appears to be reducing marsh plant growth and microbial diversity, hurricane pulses leave long-lasting P legacies that facilitate rapid recovery from wind defoliation and salt stress. Together with increasing managed delivery of fresh water through successful implementation of restoration projects, these coastal P supplies are enhancing the availability of the limiting nutrient throughout the ecosystem. A deliberate expansion of research on mobile food webs has enabled our program to track the effects of changing presses and pulses on prey access by predators, and the potential role of animals as important nutrient vectors. A similar expansion of our eddy covariance tower network has enabled the FCE to show that (1) the press increase in water depths driven by rising seas and freshwater restoration weakens carbon removal by marshes, creating a positive feedback to climate change, (2) hurricane pulses shift coastal forests from carbon sinks to sources, but only temporarily, (3) mangrove forest sequestration of carbon dioxide offsets methane emissions, and (4) particulate inorganic carbon precipitation is an important component of coastal carbon fluxes in carbonate ecosystems. Through cross-site synthesis activities, the FCE program has improved coastal modeling approaches to predict movements of the marsh-mangrove ecotone under climate and restoration scenarios, contributed to a book on environmental politics, and provided a framework for studying the effects of hurricanes on coastal ecosystems.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Broader Impacts:</span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&nbsp; Based at FIU, the FCE program reaches a majority-minority undergraduate student body and local community through an expansive research experience program engaging students and teachers.

FCE integrates the public directly in science discoveries by including agency scientists and decision-makers as senior scientists to facilitate the co-production of science. FCE is a leader in engaging cross-site and international research activities to understand the Everglades in the context of other coastal wetlands, and to examine the development dynamics of social-ecological systems under rapid environmental change.

These concepts were integrated through: (i) continued long-term assessment of changes in biogeochemistry, primary production, organic matter, and trophic dynamics in ecosystems along freshwater-to-marine gradients, (ii) maintenance of existing in situ and ex situ long-term experiments, (iii) use of high-resolution remote sensing and models to forecast landscape-scale changes, (iv) addition of synoptic satellite sites to capture discrete spatio-temporal responses to episodic disturbances, and (v) initiation of new experimental manipulations to determine drivers and mechanisms of resilience to saltwater intrusion. Our data syntheses integrated month-to-annual and inter-annual data into models of water, nutrients, carbon, and species dynamics throughout the Everglades landscape to determine how ecosystems with different productivities and carbon stores respond (maintain, increase, or decline) to short- (pulses) and long-term changes (presses) in hydrologic connectivity.\nIntellectual Merit:  Our long-term climate and hydrologic data and new satellite-based observations showed how our lower elevation coastal drainage is more exposed to the effects of sea level rise than the larger, but higher elevation drainage. Subsequent above and below-ground intrusion of saltwater - a key stressor - and the limiting nutrient, phosphorus (P) - the primary resource - interact to regulate marsh, mangrove, and seagrass plant growth, as well as the transport and breakdown of organic matter by microbial communities. Although the press of seawater intrusion appears to be reducing marsh plant growth and microbial diversity, hurricane pulses leave long-lasting P legacies that facilitate rapid recovery from wind defoliation and salt stress. Together with increasing managed delivery of fresh water through successful implementation of restoration projects, these coastal P supplies are enhancing the availability of the limiting nutrient throughout the ecosystem. A deliberate expansion of research on mobile food webs has enabled our program to track the effects of changing presses and pulses on prey access by predators, and the potential role of animals as important nutrient vectors. A similar expansion of our eddy covariance tower network has enabled the FCE to show that (1) the press increase in water depths driven by rising seas and freshwater restoration weakens carbon removal by marshes, creating a positive feedback to climate change, (2) hurricane pulses shift coastal forests from carbon sinks to sources, but only temporarily, (3) mangrove forest sequestration of carbon dioxide offsets methane emissions, and (4) particulate inorganic carbon precipitation is an important component of coastal carbon fluxes in carbonate ecosystems. Through cross-site synthesis activities, the FCE program has improved coastal modeling approaches to predict movements of the marsh-mangrove ecotone under climate and restoration scenarios, contributed to a book on environmental politics, and provided a framework for studying the effects of hurricanes on coastal ecosystems.\n\nBroader Impacts:  Based at FIU, the FCE program reaches a majority-minority undergraduate student body and local community through an expansive research experience program engaging students and teachers. The FCE graduate student organization is large, active, and diverse, and productive. Communications include an information-rich, user-friendly website and newsletter. FCE integrates the public directly in science discoveries by including agency scientists and decision-makers as senior scientists to facilitate the co-production of science. FCE is a leader in engaging cross-site and international research activities to understand the Everglades in the context of other coastal wetlands, and to examine the development dynamics of social-ecological systems under rapid environmental change. The FCE continued an intensive K-12 Schoolyard Program, and developed a new Research Experience for Teachers Program, provided authentic Research Experiences for Undergraduates through community partnerships, advised the National Academies Committee on Independent Review of Everglades Restoration Progress, and was uniquely engaged in public outreach through the integration of LTER science, the arts, and humanities through our Artists in Residence Program.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/07/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Evelyn E Gaiser"
