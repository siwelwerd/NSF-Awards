IEEE ICNP 2019 will be held in Chicago, Illinois, USA in October 7-10, 2019.\r\n\r\nThis award will support approximately fifteen students. The critical contributions of this award is that students (including first-time attendees, from under-represented groups, and minority students) will be able to attend the IEEE ICNP 2019 and affiliated events, including main conference, workshops,  posters and demos. By attending a high quality conference, the students will have the opportunity to meet and learn from experienced researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
