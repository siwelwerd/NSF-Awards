The meeting offers an opportunity for students to study new applications of atomic, molecular, and optical science, and to interact with senior scientists primarily from the United States, but also the broader international community. Support is provided only for students enrolled at U.S. institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
