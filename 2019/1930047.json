 "awd_abstract_narration": "In its strong commitment to broaden the participation of students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields from groups underrepresented in those disciplines, the National Science Foundation (NSF) provides funding for conferences and workshops. To this end, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) will hold the Emerging Researchers National (ERN) Conferences in STEM in 2020, 2021 and 2022 with the theme of \"Preparing Diverse STEM Researchers to Address Global Challenges.\" The conferences will include undergraduate and graduate students from the following programs at the NSF: Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program, Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation, Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology, Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate, Tribal Colleges and Universities Program, Hispanic-Serving Institutions Program, and Research Experiences for Undergraduates. However, any student wishing to participate in the conference, is encouraged to apply. Estimated annual conference participation is 1,100; including 750 students and 350 faculty and administrators. This conference, unlike those of most other professional societies, allows for presentations in all NSF supported disciplines, as well as presentations in interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary areas of study. \r\n\r\nThis project seeks to: provide opportunities to enhance students' sense of community and belonging in STEM; provide students with science communication and other professional skills for STEM workforce success; and disseminate resources and best practices to support student researchers and faculty. The three-day conference will include undergraduate and graduate student posters and oral presentations; plenary sessions that feature STEM professionals discussing their educational and career pathways and lessons learned about navigating a career in the STEM workforce; workshops focused on strategies for applying for and succeeding in graduate programs and finding funding for graduate school; and career preparation workshops. The project will include community building, professional development, and dissemination activities in three areas of engagement to provide students opportunities to build networks, connections and relationships within specific STEM education and research contexts to enhance their academic and social capital in STEM. The first pillar will support the community and foster a sense of belonging in STEM and includes in-person networking, exposure to STEM role models, and exposure to professional STEM contacts. The second pillar focuses on professional development and includes e-mentoring, STEM career and presentation skills webinars, and skills development sessions during the ERN conference. The third pillar, dissemination, uses the ERN website to share and promote resources, opportunities and best practices related to supporting student researchers and faculty. The project is guided by formative and summative evaluation; as well by an advisory board. The evaluation plan includes research questions designed to build knowledge in how these conferences contribute to students' efficacy in STEM.\r\n\r\nThe project is co-funded by programs in the Directorates of Biological Sciences, Computer and Information Science & Engineering, Education and Human Resources, Engineering, Geosciences, and Mathematical and Physical Sciences. Major funding contributions come from the following programs in the Division of Human Resource Development:  Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate, Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology, Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities-Undergraduate Program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
