 "awd_abstract_narration": "The three year renewal Research Experience for Student Veterans in Advanced Manufacturing and EntrePreneurship (REVAMP) program at Georgia Institute of Technology will continue to train a diverse cohort of undergraduate students in the fundamental principles of (1) advanced manufacturing science and technology; and (2) the transition of basic discoveries in manufacturing science into innovative commercial products. This enhanced REU program will focus on training of veterans and underrepresented minority students and annually will engage 10 undergraduate students who will perform hands-on fundamental manufacturing research in several critical areas including additive manufacturing, bio-/cell-manufacturing, composites/nanocomposites manufacturing, applications of AI and robotics in manufacturing. The REVAMP REU site focuses on the critical national need of manufacturing, and more specifically, advanced manufacturing research and technology, which will play a crucial role in positioning the U.S. manufacturing sector as a continued world leader.  By leveraging the Georgia Tech Manufacturing Institute (GTMI)'s world-class facilities, diverse technical expertise, and inspiring interdisciplinary research environment, the REU activities will give students the opportunity to improve knowledge in the critically important advanced manufacturing technology topic areas noted above. Training in research methodology, performance of scientific manufacturing research, tours of manufacturing facilities, and completion of technical seminars provided by GTMI faculty will significantly expand each student's manufacturing knowledge base, preparing them for future careers in advanced manufacturing. The research experience will be enhanced by entrepreneurship training including specialized customer discovery experiential learning, seminars focused on the fundamentals of evidenced-based entrepreneurship, and case studies presented by startup company leaders offered by the GT Enterprise Innovation Institute (EI2). Through entrepreneurship training, students will also have a transformative opportunity to develop critical leadership skills for transitioning basic research discoveries into commercially-viable innovations. NSF I-Corps South programs and veteran-faculty mentorship opportunities provided by the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) will be incorporated into this renewal REVAMP REU site program.   \r\n \r\nA unique feature of this REU site is its focus on training of veterans and underrepresented minority students. To accomplish this goal, GTMI will target its recruiting efforts on the top universities/colleges in the nation for veteran enrollment and several HBCU's and institutions with high female enrollment. This REU site will combine advanced manufacturing research training with the principles of entrepreneurship, encouraging students to become leaders in innovation. This will help to fill the current void between fundamental research and technology commercialization in the U.S. It is expected that the site will serve as a new educational model for educating veterans and 21st century engineers in STEM and entrepreneurship that can be replicated by other colleges and universities throughout the nation. In addition, the REU site will support and encourage strong participation by women and underrepresented minorities in manufacturing-related STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

REVAMP is unique and was established as one of the first NSF funded REU programs where special emphasis is placed on the recruitment and training of veterans. Our recruitment goal has been and will continue to be that <strong>five or more veteran participants will be recruited to the program each summer and at least 40% of all participants will be from underrepresented groups</strong>. The program is designed to provide the crucial experiences needed to aid veterans in their successful return to civilian life and academic studies by providing them with an unparalleled opportunity to: (1) participate in hands-on advanced manufacturing research; (2) connect with fellow veteran students, veteran faculty mentors, and traditional students through a cohort experience; and (3) build relationships and learn from entrepreneurs and industry startups.</p>\n<p><strong>REVAMP has generated very positive outcomes.</strong> For example, three REVAMP alumni from 2019 and 2021 cohorts are now currently enrolled in graduate school in STEM fields as confirmed by our long-term external evaluation report. Notably, two 2019 REVAMP alumni enrolled in graduate engineering programs at Georgia Tech: Daniel Cantrell enrolled in Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) M.S. program in Spring 2020 and Fernando Martinez enrolled in Bioengineering Ph.D. program in Fall of 2021. Fernando had several conference presentations with his faculty mentor and research group that extended beyond the REVAMP program. Daniel and Fernando requested recommendation letters from REVAMP faculty for their graduate school applications which was helpful for their admittance into Georgia Tech graduate programs. Fernando is pursuing the Ph.D., while Daniel graduated in May 2022 with M.S. degree in MSE and has published a thesis entitled ?<em>Onset of Kissing Bond Formation for Varying Levels of Bondline Contamination in Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer Composites</em>.? Further, REVAMP veteran students not only enjoyed their experiences with Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) veteran faculty, but at least one 2021 REVAMP alum gained employment by GTRI just after the program ended. GTRI veteran faculty have been impressed with the student veterans in the REVAMP program and are committed to recruiting them for post-REU employment opportunities&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/08/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Chun&nbsp;Zhang</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852253/1852253_10595873_1686248317256_2021REVAMPCohort--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852253/1852253_10595873_1686248317256_2021REVAMPCohort--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2021 REVAMP REU Cohort\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852253/1852253_10595873_1686248317256_2021REVAMPCohort--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2021 REVAMP REU Cohort\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2021 REVAMP REU Cohort</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Walter Rich</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Chun&nbsp;Zhang</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2021 REVAMP REU Cohort</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852253/1852253_10595873_1686248676212_REVAMPGroupPhotoFrontofGTMI--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852253/1852253_10595873_1686248676212_REVAMPGroupPhotoFrontofGTMI--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2021 REVAMP REU Cohort GTMI Front\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852253/1852253_10595873_1686248676212_REVAMPGroupPhotoFrontofGTMI--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2021 REVAMP REU Cohort GTMI Front\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2021 REVAMP REU Cohort GTMI Front</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Walter Rich</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Chun&nbsp;Zhang</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2021 REVAMP REU Cohort GTMI Front</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852253/1852253_10595873_1686248789656_2019REVAMPREUHyundaiMobisPhoto_DrBrownwithStudents--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852253/1852253_10595873_1686248789656_2019REVAMPREUHyundaiMobisPhoto_DrBrownwithStudents--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2019 REVAMP Hyundai Mobis Plant Tour\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852253/1852253_10595873_1686248789656_2019REVAMPREUHyundaiMobisPhoto_DrBrownwithStudents--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2019 REVAMP Hyundai Mobis Plant Tour\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2019 REVAMP Hyundai Mobis Plant Tour</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Walter Rich</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Chun&nbsp;Zhang</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2019 REVAMP Hyundai Mobis Plant Tour</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852253/1852253_10595873_1686249080351_IMG-5235--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852253/1852253_10595873_1686249080351_IMG-5235--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2022 REVAMP Cohort GTMI Front\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852253/1852253_10595873_1686249080351_IMG-5235--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2022 REVAMP Cohort GTMI Front\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2022 REVAMP Cohort GTMI Front</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Walter Rich</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Chun&nbsp;Zhang</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2022 REVAMP Cohort GTMI Front</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852253/1852253_10595873_1686249488312_IMG-5137--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852253/1852253_10595873_1686249488312_IMG-5137--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2022 REVAMP Cohort Textron GSE Plant Tour\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852253/1852253_10595873_1686249488312_IMG-5137--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2022 REVAMP Cohort Textron GSE Plant Tour\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2022 REVAMP Cohort Textron GSE Plant Tour</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Walter Rich</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Chun&nbsp;Zhang</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2022 REVAMP Cohort Textron GSE Plant Tour</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
