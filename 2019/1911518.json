 "awd_abstract_narration": "Silica glass has been valued more than 2000 years for its optical properties and chemical and thermal stability, making it a natural candidate for surface coatings. Current methods, such as chemical vapor deposition or conventional sol-gel processing, often require energy-costly high vacuum or high temperature methods. This collaborative project seeks to couple innovations in a new class of sol gel materials, 'melting gels', with electrospray deposition to create materials-efficient, durable hybrid glass coatings. Melting gels transform into these hybrid glasses at low temperatures enabling the use of substrates that would not normally be considered, such as polymer webs that are key for continuous manufacturing. The combination with electrospray, a type of industrially-accepted electrostatic manufacturing technology, enables thin (microscale) coatings on complex three-dimensional surfaces with facile incorporation of additives in ambient processing conditions. This award contributes fundamental understanding of the key process settings and the resulting coating properties (e.g. mechanical, electrical, chemical, and/or biological) that are desirable for a wide variety of coating applications. Results from this research benefits industrial applications in aerospace, nautical, automotive, and medical implant sectors, which would benefit U.S. economy. This project provides opportunities for students from a smaller Hispanic-serving institution and a major research institution to collaborate and engage in multidisciplinary research. \r\n\r\nMelting gels are oligomeric silsesquioxane materials made by a sol-gel process that possess consolidation temperatures in the range of 120 to 170 degree C, where the melting gels decompose and crosslink into an irreversible hybrid organically-modified silica network.  Melting gels and their hybrid glass partners are synthesized using a soft-chemistry approach that allows for direct covalent bonding of organic moieties to the inorganic network.  Electrospray deposition, a means of delivering uniform charged microdroplets in a high electric field, provides the necessary dynamic control of the micro- to nano-scale structure of melting gels to achieve superior coating properties. However, the effects of the charge injection and polarity of the spray on the sol-gel are currently unknown.  This research varies these parameters along with the melting gel consolidation temperature and intrinsic charge to identify changes in the consolidation mechanism through primarily mechanical and spectroscopic analysis.  These effects are then be connected to the final performance of the coatings. The team for this grant consists of two partners, combining sol-gel chemistry and electrospray deposition expertise to create a holistic approach for synthesis, processing, and property characterization.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our research determined that these effects were minimal due to rapid dissipation and dispersion of surface charge during spray; however, we uncovered new opportunities in the fundamental understanding of the charge transport and its effects on microscale self-assembly. This resulted in two major outcomes. First, we elucidated the effects of charge-induced shear in the formation of electrospray deposited morphologies, uncovering a new regime of individual nanowires that occur in gelling systems, including nanoparticle-melting gel composites and fibril hydrogel-forming cellulose ethers. This morphology is formed when this gelation occurs concurrently with solvent evaporation, which increases surface charge and results in extrusion of the spray droplets. The homogeneous increase in viscosity of the gel formers results in electrospinning on a drop-by-drop basis rather than production of smaller droplets usually seen in electrospray deposition. The second major outcome was revealing the role of charge in macroscale self-assembly at the surface of the targets, particularly the response to micron-scale templates such as patterned electrodes. It was shown that, while electrosprayed droplets are all drawn to grounded features, the dissipation of charge greatly affected what happened after arrival. When the spray droplets retained sufficient fluid mobility to spread charge by mass transport, deposits would expand beyond the template. This is highly similar to what occurs if conductive particles are deposited, except that these assemblies tended to build &ldquo;up&rdquo; rather than spread &ldquo;out.&rdquo; In contrast, if deposits were neither conductive nor mobile, charge would build leading to a self-limiting effect that we demonstrated resulted in minimal expansion beyond the template and more uniform coverage overall. This, when combined with the depercolating effects of the nanowire formation, allowed us to effectively template sprays highly loaded with functional materials, including the &ldquo;upgrading&rdquo; of electrodes into nanomaterial-enabled supercapacitive architectures.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Broader Impact:</strong> The understanding of the role of charge in electrospray deposition is essential in revitalizing this technique for modern advanced manufacturing. During the duration of this grant, we have identified opportunities in the creation of supercapacitive devices, application of vaccines to microneedle arrays, and the creation of barrier coatings. This in turn has created opportunities for technology transfer, including a licensed patent application. Further, together with another NSF Advanced Manufacturing award and NSF National I-Corps program, the research supported by this grant led to the receipt of multiple private grants/fellowships that supported the formation of a start-up company, Plumajet, Inc., which aims to commercialize our electrospray deposition technology. Results were also disseminated in multiple public presentations and posters and six peer reviewed journal articles or conference proceedings.</p>\r\n<p>There have also been considerable opportunities for student training, with both graduate and undergraduate student trainees participating actively in the project, and outreach. Most notably, this project supported the development of novel Virtual Research Group modules for the research-inspired educational outreach to high school students through the New Jersey Governor&rsquo;s School for Engineering, Science, and Technology. These modules simulated research through the &ldquo;acquisition&rdquo; of archival experimental data and emphasized student choice and discovery to create an engaging activity with minimal resources. This activity was successfully modified and exported to undergraduate classes at the Rose Hulman Institute of Technology.
