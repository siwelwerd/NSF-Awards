 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for US participation for three one-week events during a semester-long program at the Centre International de Rencontres Mathematiques (CIRM), in Marseille, France. Specifically, the three events are: \r\n(i) Research School: Coulomb Gases, Integrability and Painleve Equations, 11-15 March 2019 \r\n(ii) Large Conference: Integrability and Randomness in Mathematical Physics, 8-12 April 2019 \r\n(iii) Research workshop: Integrability and Nonlinear Dispersive Waves, 24-28 June 2019 \r\nThe award gives US-based early-career researchers, researchers who are members of underrepresented groups, and researchers without other sources of support a chance to attend and participate in this international meeting. The organizing committee will make major efforts to recruit speakers and attendees from these groups to promote diversity.  \r\n\r\nThe conference focuses on recent developments in the field of mathematical analysis, especially in the subfield of mathematical physics.   The main topics will be integrable systems and random phenomena, and their relations to other fields of mathematics, including probability theory, operator analysis, representation theory, combinatorics, partial differential equations, and complex analysis.  More information can be found on the program's web site https://www.chairejeanmorlet.com/2019-1-grava-bufetov.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
