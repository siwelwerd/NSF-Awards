 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemical Instrumentation Programs. Professor James Smith from the University of California Irvine and colleagues Barbara Finlayson-Pitts, Alex Guenther, Sergey Nizkorodov and Celia Faiola are acquiring a high-performance quadrupole mass spectrometer combined with an Orbitrap mass analyzer and equipped with an ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatograph and tandem capabilities. In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species embedded in complex samples. In a typical experiment, the components flow into a mass spectrometer where they are ionized into ions and the ions' masses are measured. This highly sensitive technique allows the structure of molecules in complex mixtures to be studied. An instrument with a liquid chromatograph can separate mixtures of compounds before they reach the mass spectrometer. This mass spectrometer can resolve ions with a precision that allows determination of molecular formulas and provide essential molecular information using tandem mass spectrometric capabilities. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the University and regional area. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse groups of students in research and research training using this modern analytical technique. This instrument provides opportunities for collaboration between chemists, earth system scientists, and ecologists in studies of the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum and its response to global modifications.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts studies of atmospheric phenomena.  The mass spectrometer is used to investigate ecosystem functioning, including specific processes such as cyclic and seasonal natural phenomena known as phenology, succession, and response to biotic and abiotic stresses, as well as the integrated dynamics of ecological response to environmental changes. The instrument also aids researchers exploring a metabolomics approach to understanding the formation and growth of atmospheric particles from the oxidation of biogenic volatile emissions by hydoxo species, ozone, and nitrogen oxide radicals. This instrument is also employed to perform chemical analysis of aerosol particles formed from biomass burning to better understand the processes controlling its formation and atmospheric impacts. Data from this instrument provides information on the relationship between health impacts and the molecular composition, particularly of the organic component, or ambient aerosol particles.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
