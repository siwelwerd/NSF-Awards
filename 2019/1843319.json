 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes the development and proof-of-concept prototype demonstration of a new wirelessly-enabled and distributed battery energy storage system technology which can result in significant contributions to wide range of applications that critically depend on energy storage systems and energy availability. These applications include electrification of transportation via Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Electric Aircraft (EA), off-power-grid homes, green homes, and other buildings. This technology seeks to and supports the adoption increase of EVs, EA, and renewable energy sources. As a result, the project contributes to the increase in energy efficiency, the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and the reduction in the dependence on foreign oil imports. The project enhances scientific and technological understanding by demonstrating the visibility, robustness, and stability of distributed wireless control methods and power electronics architecture for the wirelessly enabled and distributed energy storage system. The results of the project will be used to evaluate and determine the technical and commercial feasibility of the wirelessly enabled and distributed battery energy storage systems. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will focus on conducting research and development tasks that will address key technical challenges that are crucial to successful commercialization of the wirelessly-enabled and distributed energy storage system such as robust and stable controller realization, wireless communication link realization for continuous wireless control, realization of efficient light-weight multi-link wireless power transfer, high-density light-weight power electronics with high-efficiency, and electrical and mechanical integration of the overall system. A proof-of-concept prototype for Electric Vehicles application will also be developed under this project and used for several demonstrations to potential partners, customers, and investors. This proof-of-concept demonstration prototype will be used to demonstrate the feasibility of the system and related desired functionalities such as fast, easy and safe exchange of modules in the system without the need for specialized personnel and distribution infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
