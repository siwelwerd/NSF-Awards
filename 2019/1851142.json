 "awd_abstract_narration": "Linguistics is the science of language. Linguists conduct formal studies of the structure of the world's over 6,000 languages, investigate the acquisition and use of language in typical and atypical populations, seek to understand the neural structures that enable humans to learn and use language, and create the language models used in computational contexts, such as artificial intelligence and machine translation. The breadth of the field's applications makes it vital to technological and medical advancements, economic competitiveness in a global economy, as well as U.S. national security. Given the multi-faceted importance of the field for the country, it is crucial to devote resources to the introduction of this field to high school students, and to recruit the brightest minds in the country to pursue careers in linguistics.\r\n\r\nThis project supports the North American Computational Linguistics Olympiad (NACLO) organization in its mission to introduce linguistics to high school students, to provide training to interested students and support to their teachers, to select and coach the team of U.S. students that represent the country at the International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL), and to support the current work of the Linguistic Society of America (LSA) focused on creating and promoting the teaching of an Advanced Placement course in linguistics for high school students. Specifically, the grant supports the costs associated with training a team of 8 high school linguists from across the United States and escorting them to the 2019 IOL in Yongin, Korea. In addition, two members of the LSA Committee on AP Linguistics will join the coaches and team members to conduct research to inform the committee's efforts to promote linguistics in high school contexts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Specifically, the grant provide travel funds for eight high school students and five adult team leaders to attend the International Linguistics Olympiad in Yongin, South Korea, which was held from July 29 to August 2. The teams trained in Seattle before traveling to Yongin.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The US teams took home seven individual medals, an honorable mention, and a best solution award. Two US team members, Wesley Zhang of USA Red and Andrew Tockman of USA Red, earned gold medals, and five earned silver medals: Ziyan Lei of USA Red, Skyelar Raiti of USA Blue, Russell Emerine of USA Red, Jeremy Zhou of USA Blue, and Pranav Krishna of USA Blue. Katherine He of USA Blue received an honorable mention. Wesley Zhang was second overall in the individual contest with a score of 95.6 and one of three contestants awarded best solution for problem 5. In the individual contest team rankings, the winners were USA Red, comprising Wesley Zhang, Andrew Tockman, Ziyan Lei, and Russell Emerine, with an average score of 77.74, followed by Team Bulgaria 1 with a score of 70.44 and Canada Moose with a score of 69.19. USA Red was awarded the IOL team trophy, bringing the total number of times that the US has brought home the team trophy to eight in the 13 years it has participated in the IOL.</p>\n<p>The IOL provided a variety of enrichment activities. During a daylong excursion to Seoul, participants visited the National Hangeul Museum, the Gyeongbokgung Palace (the main palace of the Joseon dynasty), and the commercial district of Seoul, Myeongdong. Later in the week, participants collaborated with someone from a different country to speed solve a multilingual problem prepared by the Bulgarian team, and everyone participated in a trivia game hosted by US team leader Dragomir Radev culminating in a competition among four IOL participants and the audience.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The ten days I spent in Korea,&rdquo; said Wesley Zhang, &ldquo;from the competition to the tourist attractions to the food and culture to just playing card games with teammates and competitors, certainly were the richest days of my life.&rdquo; Pranav Krishna said, \"Whether it was the amazing performances during the opening ceremony, the problems during the contest, or the amazing friends I have made on the US team, this IOL was an unforgettable experience.\" Ziyan Lei added, &ldquo;This year&rsquo;s IOL has been a fantastic experience for me and my teammates. I enjoyed Korean food and learned a lot about Hangul and its unique features and history. I&rsquo;m grateful for everything the organizers prepared for us: the excursion to Seoul, the lecture on machine translation, the bonding activities, etc. And I certainly had fun playing around with the nice problems the jury wrote and edited thoughtfully. Most importantly, I was surrounded by so many like-minded people who shared my passion for linguistics and puzzle-solving, which makes the IOL week one of the most unforgettable experiences I've had as a high school student.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The teams were trained by team leaders Dragomir Radev of Yale University, Aleka Blackwell of Middle Tennessee State University, Lori Levin of Carnegie Mellon University, and Pat Littell of the National Research Center of Canada. Other coaches included Daniel Lovsted (2013 IOL bronze medalist and 2014 IOL gold medalist), Adam Hesterberg (2007 IOL gold medalist), Ethan Chi (2018 IOL silver medalist), and Andr&eacute;s Pablo Salanova of the University of Ottawa. The US teams were accompanied to the 2019 IOL by two representatives from the Linguistic Society of America&rsquo;s Committee on AP Linguistics, Suzanne Loosen from Milwaukee Public Schools and Jeffrey Heinz from Stony Brook University, who are conducting a study on the teaching of linguistics at the high school level around the world. Other members of the NACLO organizing committee include Adam Hesterberg of MIT, William Yang of Yale University, Shuli Jones of MIT, Ethan Chi of Stanford, and Kevin Liang of the University of Pennsylvania.
