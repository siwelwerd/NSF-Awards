 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award supports new research that focuses on a century of malaria elimination attempts in sub-Saharan Africa and on the island of Zanzibar. The research will chart the global institutions involved, changes in disease environments, and risks that accrued to local communities. Key mentoring and educational activities include developing new STS/African Studies courses; running an undergraduate global health research group; hiring undergraduates to work as research assistants; serving as primary advisor for students writing undergraduate theses; and providing a year of mentorship for a post-doctoral scholar in STS/African Studies. Research findings will be disseminated in the form of a book, four articles, blog posts, conference presentations, invited lectures at universities, and student presentations.\r\n\r\nThis research project on malaria elimination attempts in Africa uses archival, ethnographic, and oral research in Africa, Europe, and the US. It will draw on STS frameworks while engaging with literatures on the anthropology of science and biomedicine, and it will result in a series of closely-linked research and educational outputs centered around questions of history, ethics, and the role of vernacular knowledge in global health campaigns. Findings will contribute to the African Studies/STS literature about how to integrate vernacular knowledge into dominant epistemological frameworks and add to the postcolonial technoscience literature by doing ethnographically and historically informed research about the ethics of global health interventions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
