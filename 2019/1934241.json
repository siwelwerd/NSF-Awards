 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since 2003, the Forum on Nanotechnology Forum between U.S. and Korea has been held at alternating countries. The forum focuses on enhancing research collaboration in the field of nanotechnology conversion among scientists and engineers from both countries. Specifically, a joint forum facilitates networking between the research communities and agencies of both countries, enabling each side to exchange information and explore opportunities for research collaboration. This year the topics are nanomedicine focusing on single-cell level and sensors related to human cognition and brain research. The forum includes 8 senior presenters and 7 early-career presenters from U.S. and roughly equal number of Korean presenters will also participate. Organizing committee of this forum strives to place emphasis on diversity. This forum actively encourages partnerships in nanotechnology for breakthroughs in various topics, in addition to strengthening achievements and assessing the progress on recommendation made during the previous forums. All of the forum proceedings and findings are available on Carnegie Mellon's website for broad audiences. The contribution of this proposed forum is its ability to bring together a bi-national community of expert researchers and innovators who are working on the leading edge of nanomedicine focusing on single cell level and sensors related to human cognition. This forum will stimulate efforts to promote the above two areas by fully utilizing nanotechnology convergence to bio-information-cognitive technology. The outcome of this forum will lead to milestone and vigorous research collaboration of both countries where nanotechnology convergence will generate a great impact. \r\n\r\nAs we enter the 4th industrial revolution, which is characterized by a fusion of technologies that is blurring the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres, the rapid increase in the enormous amount of data processed and stored led us to a need for an emerging field of technologies including human cognition and nanomedicine. To fully explore these technologies, nanotechnology convergence with bio-information-cognitive methods play a critical role. The following two topics will be scrutinized during this 16th Forum. (a) Nanomedicine focusing on single cell level: Current challenges in nanomedicine area involve i) long-term fate for newly developed materials (distribution in space and time) and how to integrate already-developed nano-materials into application synergistically, ii) the niche of nanomaterials, iii)changing the general paradigm of medical practice, iv) precisely monitoring patients for preventive medicine, v) personalized medicine, vi) batch-to-batch consistency validation, vii) need for safer biomaterial, and viii) ability to target moving parts. Due to the importance of single-cell nanomedicine, this topic will be examined during the consecutive forums. (B) Sensors related to human cognition and brain research: Key technical components of human performance modification (HPM) are the nanosensors. Novel nanosensors that are capable of new functions allowing an era in HPM will be investigated. This technology includes an image processing unit and an artificial intelligence unit to name a few. With added sensory inputs and augmented sensors, ultimately HPM can drastically enhance human performance on a daily basis. The convergence of nanotechnology is likely to result in the development of novel sensor technologies that can advance in HPM including vision, audition, gustation, olfaction, and somatosensation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
