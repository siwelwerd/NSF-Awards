 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses the development of multiethnic coexistence and the ways past societies effectively ordered and maintained contexts of social pluralism. In the globalized world today, many of cities and neighborhoods are vibrantly multiethnic, yet socially diverse communities are largely considered a fact of large, well-organized societies. Nevertheless, there is enough evidence for cases of multiethnic diversity in smaller, less-centralized societies to challenge this relationship and to question how groups of different levels of political complexity were able to effectively negotiate multiethnic coexistence. Archaeology is uniquely suited to address the long-term development of multiethnic societies, how they were ordered, and what sort of institutions were used to mitigate divisive and destructive forces which often plague inter-ethnic relations. In particular, by collecting data across periods when state-control was either suspended or in full-swing, this research will provide insights regarding the role of multi-ethnicity in a variety of political contexts, helping us better understand how different approaches to multiethnic coexistence may encourage stability or instead lead to hostility and conflict.\r\n\r\nPrevious research has highlighted the political, often hostile nature of inter-ethnic interactions and the need for centralized judicial mechanisms for groups with diverse identities to peacefully live alongside one another. In this regard, states are considered uniquely suited to deal with inter-ethnic animosities through structural hierarchies and state-sponsored infrastructure which can control, channel, or suppress ongoing competition between ethnic groups, allowing different groups to live amongst one another as neighbors within the same city or in adjacent settlements. Alternatively, non-state societies are considered ill-equipped to manage inter-ethnic animosities, leading groups to instead live in exclusive, spatially segregated territories where inter-group conflict is an omnipresent threat. Under the direction of Dr. Elizabeth Arkush of the University of Pittsburgh, doctoral candidate Ryan Smith will conduct full coverage pedestrian survey, intensive site mapping, and a program of systematic surface collections near the Lake Titicaca basin of southern Peru to understand changes in the ethnic landscape directly before and after the arrival of the Inca state in the area (AD 1000-1530). These investigations are specifically centered on an important transition zone between the high plains around Lake Titicaca and the eastern Andean piedmont, forming what has been described as a 'multiethnic frontier' where ethnic groups coexisted alongside one another under Inca control, if not earlier. This research will first test the hypothesis that state-level political organization was necessary for multiethnic coexistence, investigating whether multiethnicity appears prior to or after the arrival of the Inca state. Survey data will also allow researchers to test how multiethnicity was effectively ordered through addressing what institutions, organizational forms, or spatial frameworks were enacted and how these approaches to inter-group interaction differed between state and non-state societies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Here, valleys served as gateways to resources unique to vertically differentiated environmental zones and connected large agropastoral communities of the Andean highlands with smaller communities of horticulturalists in the valleys as well as the humid, forested slopes of the montana and Amazonian basin below. A central question of this research was whether multiethnicity, particularly related to the development of historically-documented ethnic enclaves, preceded the Inca state in this region of the Andes, and how possibly contentious inter-ethnic relations were mediated via various administrative institutions, ritual practices, or settlement arrangements. Immediate results of fieldwork included the collection of a detailed archaeological dataset allowing for the primary reconstruction of past human demographics, settlement systems, social boundaries, and patterns of interaction through time.</p>\n<p>Limited archaeological research has been conducted in the Carabaya province east of Lake Titicaca. Fieldwork was designed to collect a comprehensive, multi-scalar database that included a combination of pedestrian survey, intensive site mapping, and systematic collections of surface artifacts (e.g., ceramic fragments and lithic tools/refuse). Work was concentrated in the upper valleys (3000-4200 masl) of the neighboring districts of Coasa and Usicayos (fig. 1). Additionally, to better identify signs of foreign material culture and interaction with the neighboring groups of the highlands, a smaller area of the nearby northern Titicaca Basin was selected for further investigation in the districts of San Anton and Asillo (Azangaro province). Here, rather than complete coverage survey, large architectural sites were specifically targeted for intensive mapping and surface collections. Ultimately, full-coverage survey in Coasa and Usicayos covered 60km<sup>2</sup>, resulting in the collection of 20,000 ceramic sherds, 400 lithic tools, 9 organic samples for dating, and the identification of numerous archaeological sites and features including residential and mortuary sites, rock art, petroglyphs, and other isolated architectural features (e.g., fig. 2). Intensive mapping and collections were completed at 18 late pre-Hispanic villages and mortuary sites in the valleys, half of which were recorded using drone (UAV) imagery. In the highlands, intensive mapping and collections was completed at an additional 7 large pre-Inca settlements. In total, architectural mapping in both the highlands and valleys resulted in a sample of nearly 1,000 residential and mortuary features.</p>\n<p>Findings from this research demonstrate increasing inter-regional interaction through time, although via various modes and organization. The first clear evidence of sedentary human occupation in the valleys dates to the Middle to Upper Formative periods (1000 BCE-400 CE). These populations, however, appear to be small and relatively mobile. Ceramic wares and ritual architecture (i.e., sunken courts) were documented and indicate valley populations were in fact interacting with highland groups, probably playing a key role in an emerging political economy focused on exotic goods exchange. This pattern would be disrupted by the turn of the first millennium CE when valley population clearly surged for the first time in the Late Intermediate Period (1000-1450 CE, LIP). Many but not all large LIP sites are fortified, indicating inter-communal conflict was present, although less intense than in the highlands. Highland ceramic styles also appear in substance at residential sites across the valleys, suggesting changing patterns of interaction in the form of permanent colonization (or seasonal movement from the highlands) rather than simply trade or exchange. Importantly, both local and foreign populations appear to have been coinhabiting the upper Carabaya valleys during the LIP, although in separate localities and with limited, probably antagonistic relations. Finally, the arrival of the Inca in the 15th century is marked by intrusive architecture, settlements, and other material culture. Inca sites are located on imposing landforms along key movement corridors and are almost always accompanied by large civic-ceremonial spaces, revealing intentional yet flexible strategies of statecraft that included various elements of direct political control, local delegation, population movement, and ritual interaction. In contrast to earlier periods, material signatures of ethnicity, primarily in ceramic styles and residential architecture, appear in high contrast at the site level for the first time. Although this may be an unsurprising finding given what we know about the Inca elsewhere in the Andes, it provides significant support that, unlike previous periods, the Inca were unprecedented in their ability to create and support uniquely plural or multi-ethnic environments.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ultimately, this research highlights the rich prehistory of Carabaya and the remarkable preservation of many archaeological sites, largely indebted to local communities who steward this past.
