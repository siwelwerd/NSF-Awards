 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for the 2019 Texas Analysis and Mathematical Physics Symposium that will take place at Rice University in Houston, Texas during the period October 25-27, 2019. The Texas Analysis and Mathematical Physics Symposium is a regional weekend meeting held annually, hosted in turn by Rice University, the University of Texas at Austin, and occasionally other institutions in the region. It is intended for the participation of around 60 people, including 25 non-local graduate students. The workshop brings together many senior mathematicians from Texas and neighboring states, who may not otherwise have an opportunity to discuss mathematics together throughout the year. Structurally the symposium consists of 7 main lectures given by nationally recognized leaders in the field, and contributed sessions (including a poster session) for advanced graduate students and participating researchers from regional universities, to present their work. This will provide graduate students with an opportunity to obtain feedback from senior faculty from other departments. The networking activities made possible by the Symposium will prove to be a valuable experience for young researchers. The Symposium encourages and financially supports participation by students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics. The Symposium is a forum for regional specialists in mathematical physics and related areas of analysis to become familiar with the latest problems and present their own results; in addition it introduces young mathematicians to the current state of the subject.\r\n\r\nThis year's Symposium will focus on the areas where ergodic theory and dynamical systems, partial differential equations, and probability theory intersect and interact. More information, including a list of speakers and abstracts, registration information, and an archive of the past Symposia can be found on the website of the meeting:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/tc/TeXAMP/TeXAMP-2019/TeXAMP-2019.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
