 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project includes both experimental and modeling studies to investigate processes that occur during the formation and aging of small particles in the atmosphere.  Small organic particles can separate into liquid phases that then can change the subsequent chemistry of the atmosphere.  Experiments will be conducted to study how particle properties such as size, shape, and composition affect particle phase separation.  Models will be used to study the impacts these particles have on the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis of the project is that the liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) process is governed by the molecular composition of the particle and the particle size. This hypothesis will be tested using secondary organic aerosol (SOA) produced from the dark ozonolysis of alpha-pined and the photooxidation of 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene in a flow reactor. Particles will be collected, and their morphology will be analyzed by cryotransmission electron microscopy. The research questions that will be addressed by the proposal are the following: (1) What particle-level parameters (O:C, organic:sulfate ratio, size, etc.) determine particle morphology? (2) How does the morphology of aerosol particles evolve in time? Specifically, how do the size of particles and aging influence particle morphology? and (3) What is the impact of aerosol morphology on aerosol processes such as heterogeneous N2O5 hydrolysis?  A particle-resolved modeling framework will make use of the experimental results and integrate them to quantify the relevance of the findings for atmospheric chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project, we investigated the growth and morphology of aerosol particles smaller than 100 nm in diameters due to the condensation of organic compounds on dry seed particles and reactions of these organic compounds with aqueous seed particles.  In addition, the impact of particle morphology on reactions particularly sensitive to the aerosol surface were modeled.  We found that wet ammonium sulfate seed particles grow faster than dry particles when exposed to alpha-pinene and ozone.  This result is observed likely because the oxidized organic vapors produced in the reaction of alpha-pinene and ozone condense onto both particle surfaces, but in the case of wet particles, the oxidized organic vapors can also react in the interior of the particle.  In terms of morphology, growth on dry and wet seed particles results in a core-shell structure, though not all particles have this morphology.\n\n \n\nWe compared two different characterization techniques for aerosol particles: scanning mobility particle sizing and transmission electron microscopy.  We found wide variability between the sizing determined from these two techniques because scanning mobility particle sizing characterizes particle sizes in the gas phase and transmission electron microscopy characterizes aerosol particles impacted onto a substrate.  In general, dry seed particle diameters increase after impaction, but wet seed particles have smaller differences in diameter.  Particles with organic coatings tend to show negative diameter changes for low organic growth, with growth on wet seeds showing larger magnitude changes than growth on dry seeds.\n\n \n\nFor the modeling portion of the project, we focused on the heterogeneous hydrolysis of N2O5 as an example of a heterogeneous reaction where particle composition determines the magnitude of the reaction rate. We investigated how appropriate the assumption is to use the bulk composition of the aerosol to calculate the N2O5 reaction probability rather than the per-particle composition.
