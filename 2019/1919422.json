 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemical Instrumentation Programs. Professor Elizabeth Stone from the University of Iowa and colleagues James Gloer, Keri Hornbuckle and David Cwiertny are acquiring a hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization (ESI) capabilities and equipped with an ultra high pressure chromatograph (UPLC).  In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species in complex samples. In a typical experiment, the components flow into a mass spectrometer where they are ionized and the ions' masses are measured.  An instrument with a liquid chromatograph can separate mixtures of compounds before they reach the mass spectrometer. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the University and regional area. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse groups of students in research and research training using this modern analytical technique. Some of the programs using the instrument are the Iowa Sloan Center for Exemplary Mentoring, Summer Research Opportunities Program, the Iowa Biosciences Academy, and an NSF-supported Sustainable Water Development Program.  Advancement of scientific knowledge in the areas of environmental chemistry, water treatment, bioremediation, natural products, medicinal chemistry, and food safety contribute to the achievement of societally-relevant outcomes.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition award enhances research and education at all levels. It especially impacts the characterization of molecular atmospheric aerosols and improves drinking water quality. The mass spectrometer is also used to identify the outcomes of steroids and other pharmaceuticals in the environment and bioactive products from fungi. The instrument also serves researchers evaluating toxicity and remediation of polychlorinated biphenyls as well as those characterizing environmental contaminants. In addition, the mass spectrometer aids in the discovery of transformation products and pathways of emerging water contaminants, and investigations of surface films at active environmental interfaces.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
