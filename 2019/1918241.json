 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine how people moving from a region that has undergone a natural disaster fare upon relocation to the continental U.S.  The project will advance scientific knowledge about the conditions under which those moving as a result of a disaster struggle or prosper upon relocation and resettlement.  This study will contribute theoretical innovations to what we know about incorporation and the ramifications for the emotional well-being of those who relocate by examining adaptation after moving regions due to a disaster. This research advances the health and welfare of a marginalized and vulnerable group living in the continental U.S. by understanding the mechanisms that support their resettlement and how the context that receives them creates the conditions that would offer them opportunities to succeed, or otherwise blunt them. This study will provide a knowledge base to guide the development of future work with those who relocate following a disaster and will identify what interventions are needed to uplift the economic, social, and emotional well-being of these populations.\r\n\r\nThis study involves three stages of data collection.  First, 900 people who relocated subsequent to a hurricane will be interviewed by phone.  The second stage will consist of 50 interviews of about two hours with heads of households.  Third, members of a subsample of 10 families will be interviewed.  The project's main research question concerns how individual attributes interact with the context of reception (e.g., the locality or region, including the labor market reception, demographic characteristics of a community, and the state and federal conditions that can facilitate or make adaptation more difficult) to shape their pathways of incorporation into mainstream society, including their emotional well-being, an oft-neglected dimension of integration. This study will enhance our understanding of a relocated community, its heterogeneity, and its resettlement experiences, and possible linkages to civic incorporation and participation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Upon arrival in the state of Florida, migrants sought to reconstitute their sense of home by finding affordable housing, seeking jobs that paid enough to sustain their families, and seeking health care services to address medical conditions. During the process of societal incorporation, many of those interviewed reported confronting stereotypes of Puerto Ricans as &ldquo;freeloaders&rdquo; wanting to live off of the government, and they responded by distancing themselves from these stereotypes, by illustrating their own work ethic and desires to attain the American Dream through hard work. Findings also illustrate that the Covid-19 pandemic, which ushered in a period in which businesses were shut down, negatively impacted the labor market incorporation process of migrants, as many experienced job loss, layoffs, reduced work hours, and financial insecurity. It also stunted social integration by bringing an abrupt halt to social life and interactions in public spaces. Moreover, migrants had to pause incorporation activities, such as taking English classes, or pursuing their educations. Some also struggled with guiding children in completing remote education due to language barriers. Our study reveals that between 20-25% of those we studied returned to Puerto Rico after a period of time in Florida. This segment of the population struggled with re-adapting to life in Puerto Rico given a combination of the persistence of the original reasons for leaving (e.g., damaged homes that remained in disrepair), difficulty finding well-remunerated work, health challenges, caregiving responsibilities, and limitations on social life imposed by the pandemic. Assessments of mental health among the population of returnees appeared to be worse than those of migrants who remained in the US, though, those in the US also faced challenges to their emotional adaptation. Overall findings show how elements of place and home-making specifically, such as the need for security, familiarity, control, and acceptance, shaped the likelihood that post-disaster migrants could adapt emotionally, successfully incorporate, and settle in new places of destination after migration.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project trained students and a post-doctoral scholar from under-represented backgrounds in academia on conducting quantitative and qualitative research. They gained experience recruiting and interviewing participants, learning how to analyze both quantitative and qualitative data, and were involved in the preparation and writing of manuscripts for publication in peer-reviewed academic journals. These new PhDs added to the diversity of future scientists&mdash;for example, one RA took a position as a post-doctoral fellow at USF&rsquo;s Im/migrant Well-Being Research Center, and the other accepted a tenure-track position at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke.
