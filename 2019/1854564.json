 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coastal marshes attenuate storm surge and waves, protecting life and property. This green infrastructure also improves water quality and provides habitat for economically important fisheries. Similarly, floodplain vegetation reduces flood peaks, enhances bank stability, and reduces nutrient loading to river channels. Because of these benefits, resource managers advocate the replanting and ecological management of vegetated landscapes along river corridors and in coastal zones. The US spends billions of dollars each year to restore these landscapes. The restoration efforts, which include the re-establishment of vegetation and the diversion of sediment into eroded areas, require a fundamental understanding of sediment transport and retention in vegetated regions that this project will help provide. In addition to these desired societal benefits that could stem from this research, the project will also train one doctoral student, support one undergraduate student each summer, and include outreach in Boston-area middle and high schools.\r\n\r\nThis research project will develop physical predictions of sediment transport as a function of flow and vegetation characteristics. The new models will be developed through a series of laboratory experiments using model vegetation of increasing complexity that will build an understanding of how vegetation geometry and distribution within a channel impact velocity, turbulence, and sediment transport. Experiments will record velocity and channel-scale sediment flux, and will use laser-scans to track bathymetric evolution. The transfer of new models to practical application in the full-scale restoration projects will be facilitated through collaboration with the US Bureau of Reclamation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

They provide habitat, reduce flooding associated with storm surge and waves, and store a large amount of carbon. However, sea-level rise, coastal development, and subsidence have caused extensive erosion and loss of coastal marshes, threatening these important ecosystem services. For example, over the past century, coastal Louisiana has lost over 5,000 km<sup>2</sup> of protective coastal marsh. To build and maintain its land area, marshes must continually trap new sediment. This is why restoration plans often involve the supply of new sediment to promote the natural marsh-building process. For example, two large sediment diversions will supply new sediment to the Louisiana marshes. To optimize these restoration efforts, this project has provided new predictions to describe how vegetation influences the accumulation of sediment by a marsh. Using laboratory experiments, this project developed detailed models that describe how vegetation influences the velocity, turbulence, and transport of sediment within marshes. Different types of sediment transport were considered, including the deposition of sediment to the bed, the resuspension (erosion) of sediment from the bed, the transport of sediment as suspended load (in the water column), and the transport of sediment as bed load. Each of these processes are influenced by turbulence generated by the plants. As water moves around the individual stems and leaves, eddies are formed that contribute to the turbulence and mixing in the water column. Models for each of these processes, developed in this study, will improve the management and restoration of valuable coastal wetlands, by providing predictions of the sediment trapping potential of marshes during different seasons of vegetation growth. As an example, the new models were integrated into a marsh simulation to describe how sediment is transported into and retained within a marsh, considering a marshes with different numbers of plants per bed area (vegetation density). The simulation showed that the retention of sediment varies with vegetation density over a growing season. As vegetation density increases, the flow resistance increases, which causes the water velocity to decline. Because sediment is carried into the marsh by the water, if water velocity decreases, the supply of new sediment into the marsh also decreases. However, a decrease in water velocity also decreases the turbulence generated by the plants, which makes it harder for sediment to stay in suspension. Therefore, as the water velocity declines, more of the sediment supplied to the marsh can fall out of the water column and deposit on the bed and be retained in the marsh. The competing trends of supply and retention produce a nonlinear relationship between net deposition and vegetation density, such that an intermediate density yields the maximum rate of sediment accumulation. The model was able to recreate the field observations from the Mississippi River Delta that showed sedimentation accretion rates that changed in response to seasonal variation in vegetation density. This information can guide the timing of river diversions to maximize the marsh-building potential of each diversion, and to avoid diversions, which disrupts navigation, during periods of vegetation density that inhibit sediment retention within the marsh.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/15/2024<br>\nModified by: Heidi&nbsp;M&nbsp;Nepf</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1854564/1854564_10588000_1710519893889_Figure.For.Project.Outcome--rgov-214x142.bmp\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1854564/1854564_10588000_1710519893889_Figure.For.Project.Outcome--rgov-800width.bmp\" title=\"Sediment Accumulation in a Marsh\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1854564/1854564_10588000_1710519893889_Figure.For.Project.Outcome--rgov-66x44.bmp\" alt=\"Sediment Accumulation in a Marsh\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1.
