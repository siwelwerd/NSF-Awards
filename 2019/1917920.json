 "awd_abstract_narration": "Conservatives and liberals in America often demonize the other side, judging each other's values to be inferior and immoral. Rather than seeking understanding of others, people often shut out, talk over, or even spew hatred at people who do not share their own perspectives. This \"empathy gap\" reflects a tendency for empathy to break down in situations where people are in conflict or feel different from each other. This research tests ways to reduce this empathy gap by focusing on how people understand their own empathy. Does the belief that empathy can be developed motivate people to empathize with those who have differing perspectives? By examining how people's beliefs about empathy influence their interactions with members of other groups, this project offers insights into promoting more open-minded interactive dialogue and reducing intergroup polarization. \r\n\r\nThis research focuses on the concept of empathic effort, which is the willingness to invest time and cognitive energy into understanding and relating to members of a different thought group. The project uses diverse methods and nationally representative samples to examine how to foster empathic effort. The research tests (a) whether a growth mindset of empathy (the belief that one can develop empathy) and a dynamic norm of empathy (the belief that a growing number of people think interparty empathy is important) combine to promote empathic effort toward outgroup members, (b) whether empathetic effort and feelings of empathy toward an outgroup member produce less hostility toward the broader outgroup, and (c) whether receiving empathic effort from an outgroup member encourages empathic effort from the recipient and reduces the recipient's hostility toward the broader outgroup. Messages that teach a growth mindset of empathy and dynamic norm of empathic effort could be delivered broadly and across multiple intergroup contexts.  As a result, the research offers insight into addressing the empathy gap between those with different perspectives and other intergroup contexts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Liberals and conservatives show bias toward members of their political outgroup and even dislike their outgroup more than they like their ingroup. They experience less empathy&nbsp;toward political outgroup members, see them as less moral, discriminate against them, and dehumanize them. This political hostility has serious consequences for how we function as a society. It can erode democratic norms, strain interpersonal relationships, and even threaten public health. In this project, we investigated psychological factors that enhance versus reduce political hostility in the American context, with a focus on understanding how we can promote a willingness to learn about and empathize with members of our political outgroup. In one line of work, we examined whether norms of interparty empathy guide our behavior toward political outgroup members. Although Americans accurately sense that their house is divided, those who believe that a&nbsp;<em>growing</em>number of Americans see value in understanding the other side are more likely to empathize with, learn about, and help political outgroup members. Notably, over the course of this three-year project, we found a rising appreciation for the importance of interparty empathy among study participants, suggesting that new norms about how to treat political outgroup members might actually be emerging. This trend is promising because messaging that highlights this emerging norm has the potential to reinforce the norm and enhance its benefits. In two related lines of work, we examined how beliefs about the political outgroup influence people&rsquo;s attitudes and behavior toward them. In one set of studies, we found that people who see members of the political outgroup as being &ldquo;all the same&rdquo; dislike them more, see them as less moral, stereotype them more, and are less willing to try to empathize with them. Importantly, drawing attention to diversity of values and beliefs within the political outgroup increased perceptions of their morality, and in turn, greater willingness to empathize with and cooperate with the outgroup. In another set of studies, we found that people who see the political outgroup as a serious threat to their own group&rsquo;s values and wellbeing are intensely hostile toward the outgroup, particularly when they are strongly identified with their own political group. Together, these studies point to the need for Americans to learn more about members of their political outgroup, to avoid the corrosive consequences that follow from stereotyping and demonizing the outgroup. We directly tested the benefits of learning about political outgroup members in an additional line of work, where we provided liberals and conservatives with individuating information about political outgroup members&mdash;information that provided knowledge about them beyond just their group membership, such as their social roles, emotions, and personality. We found that&nbsp;participants who learned individuating information about a political outgroup member were less hostile and more empathic toward that outgroup member, compared to participants who were not exposed to individuating information. Encouragingly, these benefits spread to other members in the outgroup member&rsquo;s social network, creating a ripple effect that might create a willingness to affiliate with additional outgroup members. However, in another set of studies, we identified one reason why Americans might be reluctant to affiliate with political outgroup members, even if they themselves believe it is acceptable to do so. We found that Americans who have friendships with political outgroup members receive social backlash from their ingroup. For example, they are perceived by the ingroup as being less strongly identified with the ingroup ideology and consequently are seen as disloyal and judged more harshly. This work again points to the benefits of changing norms around political relations in the U.S.: if it becomes more normatively acceptable to connect with those across the aisle, people will worry less about potential backlash and will be more willing to have positive interactions with outgroup members. Finally, recognizing the importance of these positive contact experiences for improving intergroup relations, we also developed a theoretical framework for understanding the ways in which intellectual humility&mdash;the tendency to recognize one&rsquo;s intellectual fallibility&mdash;can promote more frequent and productive interactions between political liberals and conservatives. Overall, this body of work offers insights into a variety of factors that can help build bridges across the aisle during a time of increasing and debilitating division.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/21/2023<br>\nModified by: Karina&nbsp;Schumann</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
