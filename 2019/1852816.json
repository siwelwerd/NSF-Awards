 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many densely populated areas such as Tokyo, Seattle, and Los Angeles are located near active plate boundaries capable of producing large earthquakes. These cities are often built on top of sedimentary basins which trap, focus and amplify earthquake seismic energy. Prediction of strong ground motions is critical in these areas to prevent the loss of life and property in future large events. PI Denolle pioneered a new empirical approach which uses seismic ambient noise, for example generated by ocean waves, to predict large earthquake ground motions. PI Olsen is an expert in 3D numerical simulations of ground-notion dynamics. Here, the PIs join effort to cross-validate these approaches in the greater Los Angeles. They use ambient noise and small past-earthquake data to create a suite of large scenario earthquakes (magnitude 6.5 to 7.8) on the southern San Andreas fault. The simulations allow evaluating whether the underlying geological structure may channel earthquake waves and thereby strongly amplify the ground motions. This 2-year project will help mitigating seismic hazards in southern California. The PIs' methodology can be applied to other urban areas located in similar geological context. The project also supports an early career female scientist and provides training to three graduate students.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to characterize the coupling effect between the amplification due to seismic waveguides and that due to source directivity. This effect may enhance shaking intensity in sedimentary basins. The project uses southern California as a natural laboratory. Other large metropolitan areas, such as Tokyo, Mexico City, Seattle, Salt Lake City and Jakarta, are subjected to similar hazards. Here, the team innovates in using cross-validation between two state-of-the-art ground-motion prediction approaches: the ambient-noise Virtual Earthquake Approach and 3D dynamic simulations. This cross-validation allows i) establishing bounds of confidence in the two methods, ii) examining the coupling between path and source effects in enhancing ground motion, and iii) evaluating the extent of nonlinear effects on future ground motions. The novelty of the project is the unique combination of theoretical and observational seismology. In this effort, newly collected data from dense arrays including both broadband and nodal-seismic instruments will be exploited.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The 2008 study suggested that the Los Angeles area could experience exceptionally strong long-period ground shaking due to interconnected sedimentary basins. However, those studies did not consider variation in surface topography. In our study, we have updated the simulations for the ShakeOut scenario to include the effects of surface topography, as well as refined models of the Los Angeles subsurface and southern San Andreas fault geometry. Our results suggest that the long-period ground motions in Los Angeles will be much less severe than previously thought, reduced by 65-100% due to the refined crustal structure outside the basins and an additional 25-45% by adding surface topography. Overall, our results suggest that the more realistic model used in our study reduces the most intense ground shaking in Los Angeles from ~250 cm/s to ~100 cm/s, with implications for earthquake risk in greater Los Angeles. Our simulations suggest that long-period ground motions for the ShakeOut scenario in the densely populated Los Angeles area have been severely overestimated based on low-resolution velocity models and fault structure, as well as omission of model features such as surface topography. We recommend that the ground motion predictions for the ShakeOut scenario be revisited using the result of this study to produce refined risk analysis for the greater Los Angeles area.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 05/24/2024<br>\nModified by: Kim&nbsp;B&nbsp;Olsen</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1852816/1852816_10599120_1716575185281_Pages_from_New_ShakeOut_GRL--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1852816/1852816_10599120_1716575185281_Pages_from_New_ShakeOut_GRL--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Distributions of spectral accelerations at 3s in the greater Los Angeles area for 8 models, illustrating the effects of different model features.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1852816/1852816_10599120_1716575185281_Pages_from_New_ShakeOut_GRL--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Distributions of spectral accelerations at 3s in the greater Los Angeles area for 8 models, illustrating the effects of different model features.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">3s-SA distributions in the greater Los Angeles area for 8 models, illustrating the effects of different model components.
