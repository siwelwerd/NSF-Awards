 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research supported under this award is aimed at fundamentally advancing our understanding of the Langlands functoriality conjecture.  The Langlands functoriality conjecture is a profound unifying force in modern mathematics.  Though largely open, even what is currently known has consequences that ripple throughout number theory, representation theory, algebraic geometry, and even mathematical physics. The basic objects of study are automorphic representations.  Automorphic representations are defined using locally symmetric spaces, which are highly symmetric spaces that can be thought of as arbitrary dimensional drums.  Every sound on a drum is a superposition of pure tones and automorphic representations are analogous to these pure tones.  These are very complicated objects. Every locally symmetric space has a comparatively simple invariant called an L-group, and the functoriality conjecture predicts that when one can relate L-groups one can relate (the far more complicated) automorphic representations. The PI will also train graduate students in this area of research and is involved in mentoring activities at all levels from high school through to post-doctoral.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing  relations between L-groups one defines functions called L-functions, and proving L-functions are \"nice\" is enough to prove Langlands functoriality.  This proejct will develop new techniques to prove that L-functions are nice.  The oldest tool available for proving L-functions are nice is the Poisson summation formula familiar from Fourier analysis, signal processing, etc.  The PI and B. Liu have recently discovered generalizations of the Poisson summation formula that are the first of their kind. The more particular goal of the research is to extend and exploit these generalizations with the aim of studying triple product L-functions in higher rank.  Using converse theory as developed by Cogdell and Piatetski-Shapiro many cases of Langlands functoriality can be reduced to the study of triple product L-functions so this is of fundamental importance.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Langlands program has been described as a grand unified theory of mathematics, originally bridging number theory and representation theory, but now encompassing links to algebraic geometry, harmonic analysis, and mathematical physics.   The main goal of the program is to establish Langlands functoriality.  This is a relationship between automorphic representations on different groups induced by an L-map.  A rough physical analogue is the following.  One can think of automorphic representations of a group as the ``pure tones'' one can obtain from a musical instrument attached to the group.  An L-map is supposed to induce a transfer of automorphic representations in the same manner as quoting musical scores allows one to mimic the tones from a certain instrument on another instrument.\n\nIn many cases establishing Langlands functoriality comes down to establishing that certain L-functions have nice analytic properties.  In the simplest setting this amounts to proving the functional equation and analytic continuation of the Riemann zeta function using Poisson summation.  Motivated by this, Braverman and Kazhdan proposed the Poisson summation conjecture.  It asserts the existence of suitable generalizations of the Poisson summation formula that would imply the expected analytic properties of general automorphic L-functions. The conjecture was subsequently extended by L. Lafforgue, Ngo, and Sakellaridis.  Apart from its important link to Langlands functoriality, the  Poisson summation conjecture should play a key role in harmonic analysis in the future.\n\nPrior to the research supported by this award, the Poisson summation conjecture was only known in simple cases that motivated the formulation of the conjecture.
