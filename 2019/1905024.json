As the name indicates, this conference is the 14th in a biannual series, and it is the premier international conference on the topic of finite fields, an important research area at the crossroads of algebra, number theory and combinatorics. \r\n\r\nTopics to be discussed at the conference include the structure of finite fields, perfect non-linear functions, algorithms and complexity, algebraic coding theory, cryptography and quantum information theory among others.  The website for this conference can be found at https://www.sfu.ca/math/news---events/department-events/fq14---vancouver-2019.html.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
