 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to partially support the travel and registration of students attending 2019 U.S. National Combustion Meeting. Experiences in attending technical conferences are extremely beneficial to students. These experiences will not only help with the professional development, but also stimulate their critical thinking in formulating future research directions. This meeting will be held in University of Southern California, March 24 - 27, 2019. This conference is a very important national conference on combustion science and engineering. Presentations in this conference represents the most updated research outcome in combustion in the U.S. The conference facilitates the exchange of combustion research results through plenary lectures and oral presentations. \r\n\r\nDue to its effect on energy conversion, environmental quality, and climate effects, understanding of combustion processes and practical combustion systems is of paramount importance to society. Exchange of information at conferences increases the rate at which research breakthroughs can be made to make combustion more efficient and cleaner with fuel-flexibility. This meeting is the ideal venue for student combustion researchers to exchange ideas and network with their peers and with leaders in the field. It is estimated that approximately 50 US-based students will benefit from this NSF support. Numerous workshops will also be held in conjunction with the conference to increase the professional skills of the students. This award will be used to offset the travel expenses of non-local students in an effort to increase student participation at the meeting, particularly students from underrepresented institutions that may not have the financial means to fully support student travel to conferences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOver 80% of the world\u2019s energy production and use is based on the combustion of fossil fuels.  Combustion is ubiquitous in traditional energy conversion systems such as automotive engines, stationary and aircraft gas turbines, rocket and space propulsion, electrical power generation, industrial furnaces, and home and institutional space heating.  Moreover, emerging technology areas such as hypersonic propulsion, microscale power generation and material synthesis depend critically on chemically reacting flow processes.  The world\u2019s dependence on combustion processes has led to many technological challenges including air quality, energy efficiency, global warming, and fire/explosion safety.  Thus, combustion is still an active, vital area of research.\n\nThe U.S. National Combustion meeting is by far the largest and most important national meeting for dissemination of the results of basic and applied combustion research.  It is held biannually, in a different location each time.  Practically all of the most published, most cited and most respected members of the national combustion research community attend this Meeeting.  Students attending this Meeting have a unique opportunity to meet these members of the community, discuss their research with them, and exchange ideas with both senior researchers as well as their student peers from around the US (with some international participation as well.  Thus, it is almost essential that fledgling combustion researchers attend this Meeting and present their work therein. \n\nThis grant helped fund travel and living expenses for 81 graduate students to attend the U.S. National Combustion Meeting, March 24 - 27, 2019, in Pasadena, CA and present their research at that venue.\n\nAll students supported by this grant were\n\nFull-time students (priority given to Ph.D. students) at an accredited U. S. university\nAttending a university more than 50 miles from the conference site\nSupported by their academic advisor, as evidenced by a letter of recommendation\nAn author or co-author of a contributed paper or poster accepted by the Program Committee\nThe presenter of the oral presentation of the paper or poster at the Symposium\n\n\nAdditionally, priority was given to students of under-represented groups, students whose faculty advisor is part of an under-represented group, students at universities in EPSCoR states, and students whose advisor is an untenured junior faculty member.  All students funded met at least one of these criteria.\n\nThe breakdown of the funding is as follows:\n\nTravel stipends:  81 stipends @ $275 each                $22,275\n\nTOTAL                                                                       $22,275\n\nThe assistance consisted of reimbursement for travel and per diem living expenses in Pasadena.\n\nA total of $20,000 was awarded from this grant; an additional $2,275 was available from the balance of a previous NSF student travel grant (CBT-1836764) which was used to fund additional students.\n\nUSC agreed to waive the administrative fee, thereby enabling support of additional students.  \n\nA request for applications was advertised via the Combustion Institute website (http://www.combustioninstitute.org) and email announcements were sent to the US section members of the Combustion Institute.  The applications included:\n\nA letter of endorsement by the academic advisor\nA list of other potential funding available to attend the Symposium\nComplete mailing address and e-mail address\n\n\nThe Combustion Institute supported this project by\n\n1. Posting the announcement on its server\n\n2. Sending emails advertising the support to the appropriate US members\n\n3. Collecting the applications and forward them to the PI for approval and payment via USC\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/01/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul D Ronney"
