 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers in forestry, ecology, climate sciences, environmental health, and many other fields routinely analyze geo-tagged data collected at thousands of locations using spatial statistics. Modern Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are empowered to simultaneously measure many different variables at each location. This heralds a shift towards a multivariate paradigm in spatial statistics. A joint analysis of all the variables help identify common geographical patterns and sources for the different variables. In this project, the PI pursues statistical methodology that can adequately address the emerging complexities of such highly-multivariate geospatial datasets. The innovations include a) utilizing available scientific information about the dependence among variables, b) ensuring computational scalability of the algorithms, and c) improving interpretability of findings from the multivariate analysis. The genesis of the proposed innovations lies in substantive questions related to climate modeling, air and water quality. These research domains study some of the most threatening challenges to the human society in the twenty-first century. The statistical methods developed in this project will enable practitioners in these fields to conduct highly-multivariate spatial analysis using modest computing resources. The project also provides the opportunity to train graduate students in many diverse and essential areas of statistics as well as in advanced statistical computing.\r\n\r\nGaussian Processes (GPs) have long been used for modeling multivariate spatial surfaces. Multivariate GPs are often created by mixing univariate ones which obfuscate the individual spatial characteristics of each resultant surface. Direct constructions like the multivariate Matern GP are more interpretable but entail complex parameter constraints offering little flexibility to exploit prior information about inter-variable dependence. The PI proposes a novel procedure to create multivariate GPs that endows each surface with an interpretable GP measure with surface-specific variance, smoothness and spatial decay, but also enables incorporating the dependency network among the variables into the construction. A recurrent theme throughout is the versatile exploitation of graphical models. Graphs defined in space, time and variable domains are used to create multivariate GPs with desirable properties in terms of interpretation, computation and structure. Another accompanying theme is utilizing a standard decomposition of GPs to extend the discrete construction to well-defined continuous stochastic processes, thereby enabling predictions at any new location. Novel, simple, but efficient strategies will be explored for parameter estimation. Finally, the PI separately focuses on non-Euclidean spatial domains like estuaries and river networks. New univariate GPs will be devised that respect the complicated contours of these domains. Subsequently, harmonious application of graphical models will create multivariate locally smooth GPs to analyze multivariate spatial data on such domains.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These high-dimensional geospatial datasets, now routinely encountered in the fields of climate and environmental sciences, forestry, ecology and infectious disease epidemiology, have challenged the orthodoxy of traditional spatial statistical modeling. This funded project addressed the need for a paradigm shift in spatial statistics -- developing models that are very scalable, capable of jointly modeling multiple variables at a large number of locations and of capturing complex interrelationships among the variables. At the same time, the developments were anchored to classic principles of statistical modeling in terms of parsimony and interpretability of statistical findings.<br /><br />There were multiple methodological developments. One of the main aims of the project was to develop interpretable and parsimonious multivariate spatial models that can jointly analyze spatial data collected on a high-dimensional number of variables. We developed a scalable and interpretable method Gaussian Graphical Processes (GGP) using graphical models that allows joint analysis of many environmental, climate or ecological variables collected over a large number of locations and over many time points. We also developed statistical models for data collected over non-standard spatial domains like water bodies (lakes, estuaries) which have highly irregular boundaries, where distances along the water are more relevant, and where traditional spatial analysis which relies on distances along the air are not applicable. Finally, a major development was a rigorous investigation of machine learning methods like random forests and neural networks which have become increasingly popular among climate and environmental scientists because of their capability to reveal complex relationships among the variables. A main finding was that such methods, applied naively to environmental data which possess spatial and temporal correlation, are sub-optimal. Subsequently, novel renditions of random forests and neural network algorithms were developed that are tailored for spatial data. The modern machine learning ideas were reinforced with traditional spatial statistics principles to account for spatial dependence in the data. A central theme in all the methods development was innovative and versatile use of graphical models, a powerful tool for joint statistical modeling of many variables that parsimoniously encodes information about the inter-relationships among the variables. The methods development was complemented with development of multiple open-access software with user-friendly vignettes facilitating wider adoption of the methods by practitioners.<br /><br />The developed methods were applied in various environmental applications. Particular emphasis was on enriching the suite of statistical models for improved assessment of exposure. Low-cost sensor air-pollution networks have become increasingly common to supplement the geographically sparse regulatory monitoring network. However, the data from these sensors are often biased and noisy, requiring proper statistical calibration before any use in scientific studies. The project partially supported development of a suite of statistical models for calibration of low-cost sensor networks for various pollutants including fine particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and methane. Studies were also conducted that informed about the best statistical designs for estimating the bias of the low-cost sensors.
