 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Graduate Research Workshop in Combinatorics (GRWC) 2019, to be held June 17-28 and hosted by the University of Kansas, is the sixth edition of an annual two-week collaborative research workshop for advanced graduate students and postdocs from all areas of combinatorics.  Participants work in small collaborative groups with faculty and postdocs on research problems from across the discipline.  The workshops also host a variety of professional development activities to prepare students and postdocs for industrial and academic careers.\r\n\r\nThe problems participants will work on cover a wide range of subfields of combinatorics, including (hyper)graph theory, combinatorial representation theory, Ramsey theory, and symmetric function theory. Details of the workshop can be found on the website: https://sites.google.com/view/grwc/workshops/2019-lawrence-ks\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
