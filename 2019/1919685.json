 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Instrumentation Programs. Professor Pamela Lundin from High Point University and colleagues Andrew Wommack, Melissa Srougi and Meghan Blackledge are acquiring a 400 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer that replaced an older low-field spectrometer. In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists to determine of the structure of molecules. NMR spectroscopy is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The NMR studies improve understanding of synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate and graduate students and several early career faculty  members at this growing institution. While using the instrument, students gain essential analytical skills that allow them to become more competitive candidates for industrial careers and graduate school programs. In addition, the NMR spectrometer is incorporated into the evolving portfolio of instrumentation utilized by this institution's Mobile Community Laboratory.  NMR is used to illustrate the concepts of structural chemistry and kinetics to local middle and high school students and to expand participation in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) programs.\r\n\r\nThe award of the NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts the characterization of polymerization products such as those of poly(3-hexylthiophene) and poly(phenylene ethynylenes) and the use of thiol-ene coupling reactions to generate redox-inert disulfide bioisosteres. The instrumentation also serves researchers elucidating the mechanism of antidepresant-dibenzazepine inhibition of protein serine/threonine (Stk1) kinase, and those designing, synthesizing and characterizing quinone structures. These research projects benefit the National health and welfare as well as education and diversity efforts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
