 "awd_abstract_narration": "The neural mechanisms that underlie and promote social interaction and communication remain elusive, despite a large number of evidence-based studies in psychology and psychiatry.  This is partially due to the lack of instruments and technology that can directly measure natural human interactions.  The proposed project intends to develop a dyadic functional magnetic resonance imaging (dfMRI) system to directly observe the brains of pairs of individuals while they are interacting with each other visually and by touch.  The project also hopes to develop a computer model to quantify these interactions.  Developing this technology will improve the level of knowledge about how brains work in complex environments.  Findings from this project will serve the national interest by assisting in the design of social robots, which will interact more naturally with humans.  Project findings may also help in identifying the neural underpinnings of mental disorders, particularly those that affect communication.\r\n\r\nThis project will leverage a pioneering dfMRI technology and methodology that can simultaneously scan two people in one commercial MRI scanner, and has generated successful feasibility tests in observing and analyzing brain-to-brain coupling in live face-to-face communication.  The first aim will be to develop a state-of-the-art dfMRI technology that will significantly improve temporal resolution and imaging quality by implementing local static magnetic field shimming and parallel imaging.  The second aim will be to use the new system to address two fundamental hypotheses in brain-to-brain interactions: (1) Face-to-face communication (measured by dfMRI) recruits more brain faculty that the Internet-based communications (measured by MR hyperscanning); therefore, it conveys more social and affective information. (2) A multi-channel cerebral network model - derived from dfMRI data - may be trained to deduce some basic social attribution processes in dyadic interaction; thus, a causal relationship between social behaviors and brain network can be identified.  Overall, this is a transformative, high-risk, high-payoff interdisciplinary proposal integrating engineering and social and behavioral science to enable new technology and methods to study human social interaction, mental disorders, and social robots.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

For aim 1, a hybrid active and passive local shimming (HAPLS) hardware and software were developed, which not only can remove the extreme high-order B0 inhomogeneity near bore but also can perform robust two-area shimming that commercial scanners cannot. Integration of the HAPLS system with a dual-head MRI AC/DC array was also accomplished (Fig. 1), which reached the two design goals--its dyadic functional scans are free from signal void in dyadic occipital lobes (Fig. 2A) and it can perform any current state-of-the-art fMRI protocols including parallel imaging and multiband options (Fig. 2B, 2C). Thus, the two major limitations of the previous version of dfMRI system are overcome.</p>\n<p>For aim 2, to identify the differences in brain responses between the direct eye-to-eye interaction and the eye contact mediated by video cameras, two cohorts of parent-child pairs were scanned with hyperscan fMRI (eye contact mediated by video cameras) and dyadic fMRI (direct eye-to-eye interaction) respectively. Their brain responses comparisons are shown in Fig. 3, which suggest that direct eye-to-eye interaction recruits more uni-lateral right amygdala, insular, hippocampus, planum polare, and temporal pole than the camera-mediated eye contact in both parents and children for handling more interactive information. In addition, the comparisons also show that in the case of camera-mediated eye contact, parents can leverage more occipital and temporal functions to compensate the insufficient interactive information, whereas children cannot. These results validate our hypothesis.</p>\n<p>To quantify dyadic brain network interaction, the Correspondence Analysis was chosen to decompose the brain-to-brain interaction matrix into multiple modes; the information flows in each mode were computed by bi-directional mutual information. As results, the first mode contributes 91.2% of explained variances (EV) and represents the dyadic visual pathway during eye contact. Its information flows are largely from children to parents. Interestingly, the third mode contributes 1.7% of EV, and its information flows are mostly from parents' endogenous system to children's exogenous system. Combination of mode 1 and 3 suggests a feedback loop which represents a form of developmental brains' external regulation, see Fig.4.</p>\n<p>In terms of broad impact, first, the outcomes of this study reveal the differences in the brain network underpins between in-person and online communication, especially their different impacts on adults and children. As our society fully embraces online communication as part of routine life, this study presents some scientific evidences on its shortcomings on autonomous responses, especially for children. Secondly, the quantification of brain-to-brain interaction establishes a foundation for quantify social behaviors. It transforms psychology and psychiatry from evidence-based to model-based scientific fields.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 04/12/2024<br>\nModified by: Ray&nbsp;F&nbsp;Lee</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1926789/1926789_10631483_1712929582998_FIG_5--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1926789/1926789_10631483_1712929582998_FIG_5--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1926789/1926789_10631483_1712929582998_FIG_5--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Based on the group analysis of the data from hfMRI, (A) is the activation maps of mode 1.
