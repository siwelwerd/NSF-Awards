 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will fund 10 US graduate students to attend the 2019 Magnetics Summer School at Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond between June 2-7, 2019. The students will undertake intensive classroom training in magnetics and visit National Institute of Standards and Technology at Gaithersburg to learn about advanced magnetics concepts and characterization. The summer school will also help in the professional development of the US graduate students by allowing them to present their research at the summer school. Through this summer school, the students will have additional cultural education and networking opportunities by meeting 80 other international graduate students working the area of magnetics which will foster multidisciplinary collaborations across multiple universities in different countries. The organizers of the Summer School have particularly encouraged women and underrepresented minorities to apply\r\n\r\nMagnetic materials and electromagnetic techniques have revolutionized our lives. New concepts in magnetics have enabled several technologies such as data recording, cancer therapy, non-volatile magnetic random access memory and brain imaging. The boundaries of these areas have been constantly pushed to overcome many existing challenges in the use of these concepts and technologies. The Magnetics Summer School will cover several of these areas of research including fundamentals of magnetism, magnetic data recording, magnetic memory, skyrmions and spin-orbit coupling. The latest results in these areas will be presented to the students by the world leading experts. Students will also present their research at the summer school in the form of poster presentations. Because of the restricted budget, the Magnetics Society has allocated funds for only 15 US students out of 80 total number of students coming from the four continents, North America, South America, Europe and Asia. Funds requested for additional 10 US student participants will enhance US strength in the field of magnetics\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

There were a record number of 93 student participants that included 80 fully funded students, 6 partially funded students and 7 student volunteers. Local organization committee included Ravi Hadimani and Robert Shull as co-Chairs, Radhika Barua as local treasurer, J. Atulasimha as student selection representative. MSS19 Program Chair was Brian Kirby and MSS19 Treasurer and Chair of Student Selection committee were Sara Majetich and Leszek Malkinski.</p>\n<p>There were 4 distinguished lectures (Victorino Franco, Justin Shaw, Hari Srikanth and Hyunsoo Yang) several talks given by 7 senior researchers in magnetics (Bernard Dieny, Ron Goldfarb, Chih-Huang Lai, Kyung-Jin Lee, Sara Majetich, Rudolf Sch?fer and Bruce Terris). There were 2 panel discussions.
