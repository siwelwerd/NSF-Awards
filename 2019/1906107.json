 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the study of mathematical objects, a key role is often played by the symmetries of the object - particularly when the object has many symmetries. This research investigates ways of characterizing, describing, and studying spaces with many symmetries in various dynamical, geometric and topological settings. These questions often require learning, adapting and applying ideas and techniques from many areas of mathematics. This work has connections with diverse areas of mathematics: from differential equations (the use of wavefront sets to study fine analytic properties of solutions to equations) to theoretical computer science ((super)expanders, Kazhdan's property (T), Lafforgue's strong property (T) and coarse embedding problems). Graduate student funding will be used to train a new generation of experts.\r\n\r\nThe main thrust of the project is to exploit connections between a wide set of areas to further understand fundamental structures related to lattices in Lie groups.  A major focus is the study of group actions on manifolds where the PI recently made major breakthroughs on conjectures of Zimmer's.  Another major focus is on the structure of hyperbolic manifolds where the PI recently made another major breakthrough on a question of McMullen and Reid. Other topics include studying families of expanders and superexpanders arising from dynamical constructions, both to understand their coarse geometry and to see if they have novel applications to computer science, dynamics or operator algebras.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award supported important fundamental research in pure mathematics.  The work centered around the role of symmetry in geometry and dynamics.  This is particularly related to certain kinds of high dimensional crystal structures known as lattices in Lie groups.  Many restrictions were placed on where and how these symmetric patterns could arise and also on the shapes of the patterns when they did arise. This work has many connections to other areas of pure mathematics and some connections to theoretical computer science.  The intellectual merits of the project consisted exactly of these fundamental contributions to human knowledge.  \n\nA particular development that was central to this award involved the connection between arithmeticity and totally geodesic submanifolds.  One way to describe this is roughly as follows: suppose we have a high dimensional crystal pattern and suppose that many of its lower dimensional slices are also precisely crystal patterns.  Then the original crystal pattern and the all the lower dimensional slices must be constructed in a particular way based on very algebraic and number theoretic constraints.  In general, the lower dimensional slices of a crystal pattern are only quasi-crystals and this result contributes an explanation of why that is necessarily true.\n\nIn additon, the grant helped support the PI while he mentored graduate students to become researchers.  And while he organized a large number of scientific conferences and events with the goal of disseminating knowledge and providing grounds for further development of ideas and collaborations.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/02/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David M Fisher"
