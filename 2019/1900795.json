 "awd_abstract_narration": "The amount of reactive nitrogen in the gas phase has a significant impact on the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere. In the terrestrial boundary layer (TBL), gas phase nitrous acid (HONO) is produced by various mechanisms from reactions of precursors like nitrogen oxides (NOx) and nitric acid (HNO3) on surfaces. These processes, which recycle deposited HNO3 to photochemically reactive nitrogen species, such as HONO, are often called \"renoxification.\" In the marine boundary layer (MBL), ocean waves produce sea salt aerosols that are highly enriched in organic matter and nitrate. These particles may serve as reactive media for photochemical and heterogeneous reactions leading to HONO formation. However, the distribution and the chemistry of HONO in marine environments are not well understood, with only a few field measurements of HONO reported in the MBL to date. This project aims to investigate renoxification resulting from rapid photolysis of particulate nitrate associated with sea-salt aerosol as a source of HONO. Work includes a series of field measurements, laboratory experiments and model simulations.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, researchers will: \r\n1) Conduct measurements at Tudor Hill Marine Atmospheric Observatory in Bermuda and establish the temporal distribution of HONO in the MBL in spring and late summer of 2019. Work will include collecting meteorological parameters and measurements of pNO3, HNO3, NOx, aerosol loading, aerosol ionic components (NO3-, Cl-, SO42-, Na+, Mg2+, and Ca2+), O3, and VOCs.\r\n2) Collect aerosol samples and use them to conduct photochemical experiments in the laboratory for the determination of the photolysis rate constant of pNO3 leading to HONO and NO2 productions.\r\n3) Conduct box and 3D chemical transport model simulations to examine pNO3 photolysis as a HONO source and as a renoxification pathway, and to evaluate the role of this process in oxidant production in the MBL.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nWe have conducted two 4-week intensive field measurements, extensive field and laboratory photochemical experiments, and a series of computer model simulations in the investigation into the daytime cycling of reactive nitrogen species in the marine boundary layer (MBL). The results from this research have confirmed our central hypothesis that the photolysis of particulate nitrate (pNO3), a major oxidation product of reactive nitrogen species NOx (= NO + NO2), is an important daytime source for nitrous acid (HONO) and is an effective pathway to recycle oxidized nitrogen end products back to NOx, a process called re-NOx-ification, in the MBL. Field measurement results demonstrated substantial levels of HONO, at concentrations of parts per trillion, were present in the background marine air masses, with daytime plateaus and nighttime valleys. HONO is a highly photo-labile species with a photolysis lifetime of ~10 min around solar noon to produce NO and OH. These diurnal distribution patterns indicate that HONO was produced by photochemical processes during the day in the MBL and that the ocean surface was likely a net HONO sink. In other atmospheric environments, the photolysis of pNO3 has been shown to be greatly enhanced to produce HONO as the dominant product, with an enhancement factor (EF) between 10 and over 1000 relative to gaseous HNO3photolysis. A moderate EF of 29 can balance the daytime HONO budget and to sustain the observed daytime HONO concentration against its effective photolytic loss. Laboratory photochemical experiments confirmed that the photolysis of pNO3 leads to the production of HONO as the dominant product and is significantly enhanced compared to the photolysis of gaseous HNO3 photolysis, by a factor of ~4. However, this laboratory determined EF is much lower than that of 29 derived from the field observation. While the discrepancy remains to be resolved, it may be in part due to the changes the physical and chemical characteristics of marine aerosols and thus their photo-reactivity when they were collected on filters, when compared to that of individual aerosol particles suspended in the air. The results from photochemical experiments on size-segregated marine aerosols demonstrated a strong dependence of pNO3 photolysis rate on particle size, about ten times higher for the smaller particle fraction (0.25 m) than that for the largest particle fraction (2.5 m). The formation of aerosol aggregates on the filter from individual small particles during sampling may contribute to the reduction in pNO3 photolysis rate. The diurnal distribution of NOx is similar to that of HONO, also suggesting a daytime NOx source. The simulation results using the MCM v3.3.1 box model indicated that photolysis of HONO at the observed level could mostly fulfill this daytime NOx source requirement, suggesting that HONO is a major intermediate species in the re-NOx-ification process in the MBL. NOx plays a central role in the photochemical production of oxidants. The current MCM v3.3.1 model does not include a re-NOx-ification process and has underestimated O3 abundance and O3 production rate are by 18% and 61%, respectively, leading to underestimations of OH abundance and OH source budget by 35% and 43%, respectively. By including a re-NOx-ification process, the model can reasonably reproduce the field observations. Therefore, implementation of an appropriate re-NOx-ification mechanism in the current atmospheric models may significantly improve our understanding of OH and ozone chemistry in the marine atmosphere and the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere since the ocean covers 70% of the earth surface.\n\n\n We also simulated the HOx (OH+HO2) radical budget using a box model based on the MCMv3.3.1. Measured concentrations of all species except NO were higher in the spring than during the summer. The higher ozone and VOC levels in the spring lead to a higher OH oxidation rate of CO and hydrocarbons compared to summer. The radical budget analysis demonstrates a NOx-limited regime, leading to inefficient recycling of RO2 and HO2 to OH, more apparent in spring compared to summer. Simulated OH reactivities of ~1.70.06 s1 and ~1.40.02 s1 during spring and summer, respectively, are very low compared to urban and suburban regions but agree with recent measurements in the marine boundary layer. OH reactivity, and radical budget analysis infers inefficient recycling and suggests missing OH reactivity sources of marine origin. We also investigated the role of halogen monoxides, XO on HOx. BrO and IO were found to decrease HO2 by ~14 and 18% during spring and summer, respectively, with only marginal impact on OH as HOBr and HOI loss to aerosol particles account for ~80 and ~50% of their total loss term, respectively. The results demonstrate the complex multiphase HOx-Halogen-aerosol chemistry in the MBL and call for more comprehensive multiphase investigations.
