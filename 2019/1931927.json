 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our world is currently experiencing an incredible increase in the amount of real-world data available, yet that data remains useful or valid only for a finite period of time. For example, detour information provided to drivers during traffic construction loses its utility upon completion of the construction assignment. This project develops methods to determine the validity of data accumulated in databases, to answer the question: when do data expire? Knowledge of data validity is even more important in the context of safety-critical applications in the physical world: how much of the past data should be trusted to make safety-critical decisions in the present? Can data from nearby locations be trusted to accurately reflect local context and conditions? Answering these fundamental questions will impact a wide-range of applications, including traffic management, national defense, weather forecasting, etc., since data is a universal feature of modern society. The methods developed in this project are implemented and tested for control of connected autonomous vehicles in safety-critical scenarios such as driving on potentially icy roads. This work has significant potential to not only ensure safety in the imminent deployment of connected autonomous vehicles, but also improve certainty and confidence in a wide range of data- and information- intensive applications. This collaborative research will support development of graduate and undergraduate researchers at Penn State University, Bucknell University, and the University of Massachusetts Lowell. The project also includes Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM)-focused outreach activities for middle-school students to broaden participation within the field of cyber-physical systems. \r\n\r\nThe research objective of the project is to create methods to determine how the validity of data decays over time, and over increasing distances away from where the data was collected. The research is conducted in the context of safety-critical systems, namely fleets of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) driving on potentially icy roads, where safety-critical road friction information is shared via a wireless data link to a central spatiotemporal database that mediates data averaging. This data is used to estimate the roadway friction coefficient (i.e. the presence of ice) and is transmitted to other connected vehicles in the vicinity. The time duration of data trust and validity of the friction estimates within the database are evaluated using Allan variance analysis, enabling the database to internally model and monitor data timeliness and quality. The investigators also study performance metrics (e.g., stability) of the coupled fast and slow feedback loops, where the fast loop acts at the vehicle level to ensure safe CAV operations in icy conditions using database-mediated preview of friction measurements. The slow loop is the spatial, multi-vehicle data averaging in the database using current measurements provided by a fleet of CAVs. These functionalities are then examined in the context of CAV fleets operating on road networks with large spatiotemporal extents. While implemented in a CAV context, these methods can be used in any application that synthesizes actionable information from spatial, temporal, or spatiotemporal data streams.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Drivers and vehicle safety systems need to know road conditions to make safe driving decisions. Road friction typically cannot be accurately estimated without driving on the road surface, yet high-speed driving on low-friction roads often leads to unexpected behavior that causes crashes, yet driving too slowly often leads to rear-end collisions and poor traffic flow.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>This work develops methods of sharing friction data between vehicles so that the vehicles ahead act as moving sensors for the vehicles that follow behind. Current technology on passenger vehicles including ABS, traction control, and electric power steering allow vehicles to estimate friction when driving over a road section. Typically, this data is used for control and immediately forgotten. A motivating concept of the proposal is that this critical information can be shared, allowing vehicles to anticipate dangerous situations. This project's broader impacts include the development of tools to merge and share information between systems, a common and recurring need in STEM fields.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>When sharing information, a challenge arises wherein each vehicle&rsquo;s measurements have errors and variation. By using averaged data between vehicles, across time, or across space, the resulting friction estimate is greatly improved. This obvious and well-known approach introduces very challenging mathematical problems because the road friction itself is always changing. For example, if friction data is averaged from last week with data obtained from today, this mixing of past and current information is likely to make the averaged estimate worse. A key question then is: when should data be forgotten in order to balance the influences of recency and variability in small data sets?</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The intellectual merit of this project is the development of algorithms for averaging time-changing data in ways that minimize the uncertainty. We solve this using a process called Allan Variance, a method invented to stabilize time measurements from atomic clocks. Existing techniques to calculate Allan Variance were very slow - often requiring hours of computation for typical road measurement datasets (hundreds of MB). We developed four fast algorithms to estimate Allan Variance and Dynamic Allan Variance very quickly, obtaining ways of estimating best data roughly 5,000 times faster than previous algorithms, fast enough that one can calculate the results &ldquo;live&rdquo; or in real-time for typical traffic situations. We shared code for this in repositories linked to the project webpage.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>A vehicle providing data of sufficient detail to locate slippery road sections generates data at a high rate, and so this project required the team to develop novel algorithms and database storage structures to perform calculations quickly on large data sets. We designed an organizational structure for databases that mimics the mathematical operations in Allan Variance techniques automatically, and so when the data is stored in this particular way within a database, the database itself produces best-averaged data automatically in each query without any extensive computation. Further, we found that the tree structure when used with simulated road network data automatically updates itself to reflect the adjacency of data records in time and space, as well as contexts - for example, storing all icy-bridge data in the same region of the database.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>To test and demonstrate the interaction of road safety with this novel data averaging method, the team created a calibrated, city-scale traffic network simulation producing data representative of thousands of vehicles, with data size of ~100 GB per simulated hour.

This was implemented and tested with an automation methodology - model predictive control - that looks ahead of the vehicle to estimate the optimal steering and throttle/braking inputs for the situation ahead. This guidance system also accounts for the uncertainty of the vehicle interacting with the database, including measurement errors, road surface irregularities, tire wear, and vehicle differences.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>In outreach, the team prepared hardware and software materials and course content to teach students core concepts in vehicle automation.
