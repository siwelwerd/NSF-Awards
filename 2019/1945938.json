 "awd_abstract_narration": "The open science movement is gaining momentum across the academic landscape. Since the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NAS) published the Open Science by Design: Realizing a Vision for 21st Century Research report in 2018, many institutions, organizations, and faculty have begun assessing their current practices and infrastructure to support a more open research ecosystem. To fully realize the vision for open science and scholarship, stakeholders need to adopt key infrastructure, standards, and practices necessary to facilitate responsible data practices. Drawing inspiration from sources such as the May 2019 NSF Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) the organizers propose an expert convening to discuss persistent identifiers (PIDs) for datasets and creating machine readable data management plans (DMPs).  The conference is organized by California Digital Library (CDL) and Association of Research Libraries (ARL), in partnership with the Association of American Universities (AAU) and the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU). \r\n\r\nThe conference will engage approximately 40 experts in a multi-day workshop in Washington DC winter of 2019 with the goal to identify and determine:\r\n\r\n1. What barriers remain to implementing the widely recognized good practices in the NSF DCL\r\n2. What kinds of model workflows might address those barriers, while minimizing faculty burden\r\n3. What implementation of the NSF DCL means for institutional data governance (e.g. sharing DMPs across campus units, between institutions, and publicly)\r\n4. Findings to bring back to policymakers, funding agencies, and other similar institutions\r\n5. Recommendations of effective practices for grants offices, including guidance to their researchers\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
