 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded from the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites program in the SBE Directorate. It has both scientific and societal benefits in addition to integrating research and education. The Upper Gila Preservation Archaeology Field School, located in rural southwestern New Mexico, provides hands-on training in ethically responsible and scientifically rigorous archaeological methods in the context of a long-term research project. Training is conducted within a Preservation Archaeology ethos, a philosophy integrating big-picture research, use of existing collections, focused fieldwork, site preservation, and local community outreach. Under the close supervision of a team of experienced instructors, this program offers undergraduate students an immersive environment in which to learn the fundamentals of archaeological field and laboratory work and how to link their work to broader anthropological issues that have contemporary relevance. Specifically, students are trained in excavation and survey techniques, experimental archaeology, artifact processing and analysis, report-writing, and public presentation. Based on the premise that sites are non-renewable resources, the Preservation Archaeology Field School is training the next generation of academic, private sector, and government agency archaeologists. This project attracts exceptional students from a variety of cultural and economic backgrounds. Student recruiting targets underrepresented groups, including Native American, Hispanic, and community/small college undergraduates with limited STEM opportunities, as well as students from major academic institutions to increase the diversity of views represented in the discipline. \r\n \r\nStudent efforts contribute directly to Archaeology Southwest's long term research program focused on the Salado Phenomenon in the southern U.S. Southwest during the late pre-contact period (A.D. 1200-1450). This research studies the processes of migration and social integration of culturally diverse groups during this time of upheaval and crisis across much of the Southwest. Students think critically about the values of archaeology and history to different communities and explore different ways to communicate the results of scientific research. Students present their work to various audiences through participation in outreach events for the local community, writing research reports, and presentations at professional meetings. Even students who do not go on to pursue careers in archaeology learn valuable skills in collaboration and collegiality, critical thinking, engaging the public, and the importance of cultural resources, in an active research setting.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Five graduate students and one international student (not supported by the REU grant) also participated. REU funding allowed undergraduates from 33 different colleges and universities and 23 US states and territories to participate as members of our research team and gain experience in archaeological survey, excavation, experimental archaeology, laboratory analysis, and communicating results to professional and public audiences.</p>\n<p>Seventeen students attending in 2019-2022 were members of historically underrepresented groups in archaeology, including 12 from small or community colleges with limited STEM research opportunities. Four were first-generation college students and two were veterans. Over the full REU funded period of this project (2014-2022), 52% of our students have been from historically underrepresented groups and/or from colleges with limited STEM research opportunities. Team members (students and staff) from the 2014-2022 period included diverse ethnic groups (Figure 1), 33 students from community colleges and small colleges with limited STEM opportunities, and nine veterans.</p>\n<p>Field school training gives students essential experience for careers in archaeology, and 36% of our students from 2019-22 found employment with private sector Cultural Resource Management (CRM) firms after completing our field school. About 19% found employment in museum settings and 14% in government archaeology positions (including the National Park Service and Forest Service), and over 36% have completed or are enrolled in graduate school in archaeology or related fields. Overall, 74% of our students from the 2019-2022 REU period have gone on to professional positions and/or graduate school in archaeology or related fields.</p>\n<p>Over the full REU funded period of this project (2014-2022), 33% of our past students have gone on to employment in CRM, 15% in museum positions, 10% in government archaeology positions, and 32% to related graduate programs. Overall, over 70% of our students have gone on to professional positions and/or graduate school in archaeology or related fields since our first REU-funded field school in 2014 (Figure 2).</p>\n<p>Students worked with professionals from academic, government, and private Cultural Resource Management sectors to investigate the Gila River Farm site, a large adobe village dating to the 1300s. This investigation was part of Archaeology Southwest's long-term research on the Salado Phenomenon (A.D. 1200-1500) in the US Southwest and the migrations and demographic changes associated with it (Figure 3).</p>\n<p>Preservation Archaeology aims to minimize adverse impact to sites while maximizing research results through use of existing collections, surface survey, and targeted excavation in sites at risk for destruction or with existing disturbance. The Gila River Farm site was ideal for Preservation Archaeology because it had been heavily impacted by erosion, vandalism, and agricultural disturbance. Another important component of Preservation Archaeology and the field school was sharing results with public audiences and other archaeologists. All students coauthored excavation unit summaries for professional audiences, and 17 students presented posters related to their field school projects at professional meetings. All students wrote blog posts about their experiences which were read by over 3,000 people each field season.&nbsp;Outreach to local residents included an annual Archaeology Fair of student presentations at the site, events at two local schools and several local libraries, additional local lectures and site tours, and an annual public lecture series at our field camp (Figure 4).</p>\n<p>Our team's research contributes to understanding migration and social cohesion during a period of crisis in the U.S. Southwest, in the centuries just before Europeans arrived. The late 1200s and 1300s were a time of great upheaval, as people fled social unrest in areas like the Four Corners and ultimately settled in other regions. In their new homes, migrants had to negotiate with established residents. Some newcomers settled at the edges of existing communities, where spatial separation and dissimilar pottery and other household items marked them as different. Over time, ideas from the migrants' former homelands blended with established local traditions and with symbolism linked to regions farther south to form a new ideology, which researchers have labeled \"Salado.\"</p>\n<p>Archaeologists see Salado ideology expressed in iconography on pottery vessels. This shared set of ideas allowed communities of people with different geographic origins and ethnic backgrounds to live together. At Gila River Farm and other nearby villages, people living in some groups of houses used pottery and tools showing heritage from the Four Corners area, while people in other groups of houses showed stronger signs of local heritage and of connections with areas to the southeast. Village households all contained artifacts and architecture showing their participation in the inclusive Salado ideology, but also showed variation in cultural heritage. These villages were multi-cultural communities where people of different backgrounds were able to live together without obvious differences in wealth or status-- at least not in their houses, household goods, and health.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/29/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Karen&nbsp;Schollmeyer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1851763/1851763_10593068_1690604908026_Fig3students--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1851763/1851763_10593068_1690604908026_Fig3students--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Preservation Archaeology Field School students\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1851763/1851763_10593068_1690604908026_Fig3students--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Preservation Archaeology Field School students\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 3: Students working together in the field.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Karen G.
