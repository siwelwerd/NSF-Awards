 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal supports student travel to attend the 2019 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Communications and Network Security Conference (CNS 2019) to be held in Washington, DC in June 2019. The IEEE CNS Conference is a premier venue for communications and network security researchers to present new research results in this domain. This travel grant will enable career development and learning opportunities for US-based and/or US citizen graduate students. Attending conferences is an important component of graduate school education for our society's future computer security researchers. Students have the opportunity to discuss leading edge research with world-class computer security researchers, and establish networks, connections, and mentoring relationships that will serve them well during their research careers.\r\n\r\nThis grant provides travel support to encourage participation in the 2019 IEEE Communications and Network Security  Conference by students who would normally find it difficult to attend. Criteria for selection include evidence of a serious interest in the field, as demonstrated by research output, coursework and/or project experience. Organizers encourage participation of women and students from other under-represented groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
