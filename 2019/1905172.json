 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry funds Professor Christopher Johnson at Stony Brook University to study the formation of new particles, called aerosols, directly from gases in the Earth's atmosphere. This is an important process, but no complete framework exists to predict particle formation and growth rates.  In particular, the role of water in these processes is unknown, because it is difficult to detect its presence and structure in new particles.  This project focuses on isolating \"seed\" particles with precisely known composition and growing them in inside a mass spectrometer under precisely controlled conditions. This allows the exact changes in composition to be followed one molecule at a time.  Water vapor pressure is controlled to determine whether it speeds up growth. Molecular clusters containing water are analyzed to determine the cause of the rate increase.  This work establishes how water impacts particle formation and provides critical comparisons for theoretical efforts to predict particle formation rates.  This will ultimately help to reduce uncertainties in global climate models. The project provides training and research opportunities for graduate students.  In addition, Professor Johnson and his students engage in outreach to the broader public through demonstrations and visualizations of particles forming clouds. \r\n\r\nThis project directly addresses the mechanistic impacts of water on new particle formation.  Using variable-temperature ion trap mass spectrometry techniques, the kinetics and energetics of growth are determined for precisely specified seed clusters consisting of sulfuric acid and a set of organic acids and amine bases, in the presence or absence of water.  Three hypotheses are being tested: (1) Water serves as a \"sacrificial ligand\" that enhances the sticking of incoming vapors.  (2) Water stabilizes surface-bound molecules through cooperative hydrogen bonding.  (3) Water catalyzes growth by lowering the barrier to structural rearrangement of the existing cluster to accommodate incoming vapors.  The critical structural features of seed and product clusters are characterized by in situ vibrational spectroscopy to determine the most active sites for growth.  This work is carried out in collaboration with theoreticians modeling particle growth. The experiments can validate the theoretical approaches and the calculations provide additional insights into experimental results.  This project is expected to yield enhanced predictions of growth rates, explicitly including water, that can be adapted to regional climate models. In addition to providing training and research opportunities to students, Professor Johnson also plans to interact with the Alan Alda Center at Stonybrook on promoting science communication.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project focused on understanding how water impacts atmospheric particles that form out of thin air.  Atmospheric particles affect climate by inducing clouds to form, which then reflect solar radiation back into space, cooling the Earth's surface.  Because it is difficult to accurately model the rate at which these particles enter and leave the atmosphere, particle impacts on climate simulation have the most uncertainty of any factor.  Of these particles, roughly half are emitted into the atmosphere as particles, and the other half are formed from thin air.\n\nWater is necessary for particles to form, but it is unclear what water does to help them form.  This is in large part because it is difficult to even know if water is attached to these particles, and even harder to study how water and particles interact.  We have unique instruments that allow us to isolate particles with and without water and study their structure.  Using these instruments, we find that water makes these particles more fleixble.  New particles are salty, composed of positively and negatively charged molecules that form rigid structures that are resistant to changing shape.  However, changing shape is necessary as particles grow, and this resistance is likely to slow down particle formation and growth.  When they have only one or a few water molecules attached to them, we find that the particles become much more flexible, which we hypothesize will make it easier for them to change shape as they grow.\n\nWe also studied new particles forming due to iodine.  Typically, particle formation is driven by sulfuric acid, which enters the atmosphere due to sulfur emissions during fossil fuel burning.  However, in regions of the Earth where there is little fossil fuel burning, or in times in history before humans burned significant amounts of fossil fuels, particles still formed.  Understanding how particles form without sulfuric acid is thus important to understand the specific impacts humans have on climate.\n\nIodine causes particles to form when it is converted into iodic acid and iodine oxides (IxOy), which cluster and grow.  We found that ammonia promotes this clustering.  It further facilitates the formation of larger iodine oxides that are less likely to evaporate from new particles, thereby accelerating particle formation.  These results suggest a synergistic effect between ammonia and iodine in forming new particles, which will be an important path to model to improve the accuracy of climate simulations.\n\nFinally, we developed a demonstration that allows people to literally watch clouds form due to particles.  We used a cloud chamber, which was originally invented to help physicists see elementary particles in particle physics experiments by converting the particles paths through the chamber into tiny trails of condensed vapor that could be seen by eye.  We adapted this concept to introduce particles into the cloud chamber, which immediately induce condensation into droplets, thereby allowing viewers to watch clouds form and dissapate as particles are introduced and removed from the chamber.  This demonstration gives people the connection between particles and clouds to explain not only how natural clouds form, but how contrails from planes form, and how humans could engineer and release particles to create their own clouds to fight weather and climate problems.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/27/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christopher Johnson"
