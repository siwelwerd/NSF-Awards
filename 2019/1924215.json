 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ocean\"s carbon cycle is an important part of Earth's climate system because it impacts the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), which is a greenhouse gas. However, carbon cycling in the ocean is currently not well understood in part because it is influenced by different complex physical, chemical and biological processes. This complicates quantification of changes in ocean carbon storage such as those between the contemporary ocean and that of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ~21,000 years ago) and hinders mechanistic understanding of the reasons for such changes. Previous studies have suggested several explanations for the lower atmospheric CO2 concentrations during the LGM including, increased sea ice cover, more sluggish deep ocean circulation, cooler temperatures and increased dust-borne iron fluxes that fertilized phytoplankton growth. This project will provide a novel data-constrained quantification of these processes, which will improve our mechanistic understanding of past changes, and may improve understanding of possible future projections. A graduate student will be trained in oceanography, biogeochemical and physical modeling. The project will support underrepresented students through more than 25 afterschool Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics clubs in rural Oregon middle and high schools. This will be achieved by working with teachers to develop and implement a carbon cycle and climate science curriculum into their programs. This is a project that is jointly funded by the National Science Foundation's Directorate of Geosciences (NSF/GEO) and the National  Environment Research Council (NERC) of the United Kingdom (UK) via the NSF/GEO-NERC Lead Agency Agreement. This Agreement allows a single joint US/UK proposal to be submitted and peer-reviewed by the Agency whose investigator has the largest proportion of the budget. Upon successful joint determination of an award, each Agency funds the proportion of the budget and the investigators associated with its own country.\r\n \r\nModern observations and paleoclimate data provide a wealth of information on changes to the carbon cycle. These data including carbon and nitrogen isotopes from glacial sediments will be used to constrain process-based models of the modern and LGM ocean. A newly developed method will be applied that provides a precise and complete decomposition of dissolved inorganic carbon storage into preformed and biologically-regenerated components. Preformed carbon is further separated into saturation and disequilibrium components, each of which has physical  and biological contributions. Perturbation experiments will be used in which one variable (temperature, sea ice, circulation, soluble iron fluxes) is changed at a time and the carbon decomposition is applied. Uncertainties in circulation, mixing, and biogeochemistry will be considered. Protactinium Thorium ratios (Pa/Th) will be implemented in the model and compared with modern and glacial sediment data, which will provide additional constraints on ocean circulation. Effects of ocean circulation changes on the different carbon components will be investigated. The decomposition will be extended to dissolved oxygen and carbon isotopes (d13C). Hypotheses regarding modern and glacial ocean carbon storage will be tested.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Carbon-13 isotopes measured in ocean sediments samples are used by paleoceanographers to reconstruct changes in carbon cycling and circulation in past oceans. One important, yet still unresolved issue in paleoclimate science is the variations in atmospheric carbon dioxide and climate during the ice age cycles of the last million years. Recent work has made progress in understanding this issue by applying climate and ocean models that include paleoclimate tracers such as carbon-13 to simulate the climate and oceans during the height of the last ice age, the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The principal investigators of this project have created a model of the LGM ocean and climate that agrees with a suite of paleoclimate tracers, including carbon-13, carbon-14 (radiocarbon), nitrogen-15, oxygen, and temperature and thus can be regarded as a viable state of the climate system for that period. In this project we have developed and applied a new method to decompose oxygen, carbon, carbon-13 cycling in ocean and climate models.

The organic carbon is subsequently cycled in the ocean&rsquo;s food web and eventually part of it sinks down to deeper levels where it remineralizes back to inorganic carbon and remains sequestered for hundreds of years. This process is often called the biological pump. Upwelling of biologically sequestered carbon leads to outgassing to the atmosphere, but since air-sea gas exchange is slow, outgassing is incomplete, which creates a disequilibrium that propagates back into the ocean interior, increasing carbon storage there. Our results have shown that this biologically mediated air-sea disequilibrium is the dominating component for changes in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-020-00667-z\">oxygen</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pclm.0000434\">carbon, and carbon-13</a> in the LGM.
