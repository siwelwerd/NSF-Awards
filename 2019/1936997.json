 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF Convergence Accelerator supports team-based, multidisciplinary efforts that address challenges of national importance and show potential for deliverables in the near future.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impact/potential benefit of this Convergence Accelerator Phase I project stems from empowering the global competitiveness of our future workforce. Although staying competitive requires the productivity of US manufacturing to increase with the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous robotics, advanced robotic systems currently require a workforce with, at the least, 4-year degrees in engineering, computer science or AI. The problem is amplified by the fact that current robotics technologies do not inherently support adaptability, safety and explainability. This project will address these issues by creating autonomous on-the-job training platforms that use safe, self-explaining, adaptive robots.  In order to achieve these objectives, our team employs a convergent approach drawing upon ideas and tools from research on intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), AI, robotics, manufacturing processes, human systems engineering, and cognitive science. The project's team also includes experts on resolving legal and socio-ethical challenges of bringing advanced technology to existing social infrastructure.  This project synthesizes these diverse approaches in coordination with multiple industrial partners to enable an autonomous on-the-job training platform that would empower our national workforce for working with autonomous systems. \r\n\r\nThis Convergence Accelerator Phase I project aims to initiate the invention, development and evaluation of intelligent training systems and self-explaining autonomous systems for providing safe on-the-job training for work with autonomous systems. Although autonomous systems have immense potential for empowering a highly productive workforce, this potential cannot be realized with the current state of the art. Training for work with today's autonomous systems presents unique challenges not addressed by current training paradigms, which are designed for operational systems characterized by fixed functionality and behavior. In contrast, AI systems will, by definition, change from day to day in their functionality and behavior. This interdisciplinary project will utilize safe and taskable self-explaining autonomous systems to develop a new class of intelligent tutoring systems that provide on-the-job training for work with autonomous systems. In the process, it will also advance methods for creating self-explaining autonomous systems, for the automated synthesis of task-specific robot behavior that is safe and compliant with workplace regulations, and for the evaluation of collaborative human-autonomy teamwork. In addition, it will advance research in these areas through the development of reproducible testbeds in consultation with industry experts in the domain of collaborative human-robot advanced manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The project team constituted an inter-disciplinary group of experts in AI, Human-Systems Engineering, Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), Robotics as well as in Legal and Socio-Technical Implications of advancing technology. &nbsp;<br /><br />The project team focused on advanced manufacturing as a starting point and developed a multi-faceted approach that conceptualized a new job/role for entry-level manufacturing workers: <em>robot taskers.</em> The team also developed prototype technology that would allow this role to serve as a skill ramp between entry-level roles such as robot operators (who carry primarily non-technical responsibilities such as monitoring execution and stopping it in the case of emergencies) and the role of an engineer. The team's prototype utilized research from the fields outlined above to create a new technical paradigm that would allow robot taskers to create new, demand-driven tasks for their robots. This paradigm utilized a high-level task-oriented system that did not require knowledge of computer programming. Research from explainable AI was also used to automatically identify and explain any conceptual errors to the robot tasker, thereby giving them personalized and need-based training. Using scenario-specific curricula of tasks of increasing complexity, this system would facilitate on-the-job training for robot-taskers. Autonomous computation of explanations would allow this system to automatically adapt to updates and improve deployed robotic systems. The team also developed and evaluated prototype software for the key components required in such systems.

Insights from ITS were used to augment the AI system for taskable robotics to develop a notion of mixed online and offline training and feedback. This compound training paradigm would allow manufacturers to deliver on-the-job training. It also used insights from AI to develop methods for assessing the skill level of workers based on their past experience and the questions that they asked the robot. The project contributed to interdisciplinary research in AI, ITS, industrial engineering and human-systems engineering by developing a new system of metrics for evaluating the role of technology and training along multiple socio-technical dimensions and scales.<br /><br /><strong>Broader Impact</strong><br />We expect that the research initiated in this project will help provide on-the-job training for future jobs; it will also help&nbsp;develop new research programs across the many fields (ITS, AI, safe control for robots, human systems engineering) involved in this inter-disciplinary project. The outcomes reported as a part of this report will enable a much broader class of workers to reconfigure, maintain and debug autonomous systems. In the manufacturing sector, it could enable agile manufacturing by encouraging the current workforce to use robots as force multipliers.
