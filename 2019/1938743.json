 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lake observatories produce data critical to the development of insights into the response of ecosystems to the global demands on freshwater resources. To help scientists study these issues, and to inspire educators and the public to learn about and further appreciate the importance of lake ecosystems to human well being, lake observatories need to accelerate the rate at which their observational data can be discovered and used by others. Through organizing a conference around the FAIR principles (data that are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable), the PIs propose to engage members of both the global lake ecology and the data and information science communities to identify and develop a roadmap by which lake observatories of the future can deliver FAIR data to researchers, managers, and the public. \r\n\r\nA one-and-a-half day workshop is planned for Spring 2020.  Attendees will represent key stakeholders from the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON), the data and informatics community emerging around FAIR, and affiliated observatory and international members.   The agenda will include reviewing lessons learned from current FAIR initiatives; gap identification and opportunities for lake observatories of the future; framework for discussing data valuation and longevity of data products from lake observatories; and use cases for edge computing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
