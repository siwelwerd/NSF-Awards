Participation?</strong> was to broaden minority students? participation in the STEM workforce by developing innovative ideas to increase recruitment, retention and opportunities for experiential research and learning at Kentucky State University (KSU). Thirty students and twelve faculty directly participated in this project over the three-year period in multiple STEM education and research activities. The accomplished student-focused activities enhanced STEM teaching, learning, and research and improved minority students? access to and retention in STEM programs. We created an ?Adopt a STEM Student? initiative and provided them with stipend to work with mentors in research projects. The project team, including students, met twice at annual retreats and overviewed STEM curricula, challenges in increasing recruitment, retention and graduation, and advising efforts. KSU faculty and staff organized the Summer Apprenticeship Program (SAP) for 40 rising high school juniors who participated from 30 high schools from Kentucky and across the nation, including Alabama, Tennessee, Florida. Students were paired with mentors and involved in experiential research projects aimed at solving complex scientific problems inherent in STEM fields. Students? projects culminated in the production of scientifically formatted digital presentation documents, long-form research papers, and formal presentations. Participating faculty taught multiple dual-credit courses and enhanced and extended KSU?s efforts to meet the needs of high school students interested in attaining university credit early and at reduced cost. Visiting multiple high schools for recruitment promoted KSU and its programs in rural Kentucky. Such efforts helped to establish new contact with several high schools and students. Participating students worked on innovative projects such as web applications to connect consumers to agricultural producers and sellers and an application for exploring and disseminating environmental and water quality. These application-based projects gave the student participants the opportunity to have direct contact with governmental agencies and decision-makers and to cooperate with them. This opportunity also allowed the students to show their skills and abilities to potential employers while providing students the knowledge that they can perform important job-related skills when given the opportunity. Other important examples of student-centered experiential projects have included the utilization of unmanned aerial vehicles and sensor technology coupled with machine learning in the characterization and temporal monitoring of managed productive landscapes, including farm and forest lands. Additional new opportunities for students to engage in experiential STEM learning include the maintenance of academic clubs such as the Physics Club, which prioritizes STEM learning concepts, including projects incorporating 3-D printing and open-source electronics for product development and testing. Many STEM faculty members have utilized varieties of active learning and student engagement modules in teaching, such as Flipped Classroom Model, a team-based learning instructional strategy to improve student problem solving and interpersonal skills; setting up extra office hours and extra classes and special study sessions for students who needed extra time to study or prepare for tests; and discussing a growth versus fixed mindset. Some faculty designed assignments based on the students? learning abilities and real-life examples by giving them different levels of reading, writing, and problem-solving assignments. These methods increased student engagement and improved overall class performance. The COVID-19 pandemic created multiple challenges to students and faculty for teaching and learning. Many faculty developed simulation labs to demonstrate various topics and created study groups in virtual classrooms to allow students to adjust to the new online delivery methods. The STEM Symposium at KSU held in November 2019 was a great success to showcase the research work completed by participating KSU students to about 180 middle and high school students. &nbsp;Participants were engaged in discussion about STEM concepts, new ideas for research topics, and pathways for a STEM-based career. The grant accomplishments demonstrated the capacity of the project team, faculty, and staff to integrate STEM concepts into relevant learning opportunities for students. The grant provided resources to purchase new equipment for hands-on student learning and enhancements to curricula including tutorials, applications, and equipment that allowed for effective teaching of the latest STEM technologies used in research in agriculture, computer science, and environmental sciences to prepare students for careers in these related fields better. The instruments we purchased using grant funds have enhanced laboratory, data collection, and analysis capacity and assisted faculty in improving teaching effectiveness and students? engagement in-class activities. Through this grant, the members of the project team, with their multidisciplinary background and expertise, have learned from each other about research and teaching work they do in and outside the classroom. The grant-related activities have served to inspire more students to pursue STEM fields for further academic study and as potential career paths. The availability of stipends and travel and supply funds for both students and faculty contributed to enhancing their research and teaching capacities. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/28/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Buddhi&nbsp;Gyawali</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1912413/1912413_10603107_1664412528656_Projectteammeeting--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1912413/1912413_10603107_1664412528656_Projectteammeeting--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Project Team meeting\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1912413/1912413_10603107_1664412528656_Projectteammeeting--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Project Team meeting\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The grant team is having a meeting</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Buddhi Gyawali</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Buddhi&nbsp;Gyawali</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Project Team meeting</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1912413/1912413_10603107_1664412720348_STEMDay--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1912413/1912413_10603107_1664412720348_STEMDay--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"STEM Day\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1912413/1912413_10603107_1664412720348_STEMDay--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"STEM Day\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Observation of UAV/Drones by middle school students  at Kentucky State University</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Buddhi Gyawali</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Buddhi&nbsp;Gyawali</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">STEM Day</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1912413/1912413_10603107_1664413524729_RAtalkingtomentors--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1912413/1912413_10603107_1664413524729_RAtalkingtomentors--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Research Assistant\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1912413/1912413_10603107_1664413524729_RAtalkingtomentors--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Research Assistant\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Research Assistant is sharing research experience with the project team.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Buddhi Gyawali</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Buddhi&nbsp;Gyawali</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Research Assistant</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
