 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed decentralized/distributed control and optimization for the critical cyber-physical networked infrastructures (CPNI) will improve the robustness, security and resiliency of the electric distribution grid, which directly impacts the life of citizens and national economy. The proposed control and optimization architectures are flexible, adapt to changing operating scenarios, respond quickly and accurately, provide better scalability and robustness, and safely operate the system even when pushed towards the edges by leveraging massive sensor data, distributed computation, and edge computing. The algorithms and platform will be released open source and royalty-free and the project team will work with industry members and researchers for wider usage of the developed algorithms for other CPNI. Developed artifacts as part of the proposed work will be integrated in existing undergraduate and graduate related courses. Undergraduate students will be engaged in research through supplements and underrepresented and pre-engineering students will be engaged through existing outreach activities at home institutions including Imagine U program and 4-H Teens summer camp programs and the Pacific Northwest Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participations.  Additionally, project team plans to organize a workshop in the third year to demonstrate the fundamental concepts and applications of the proposed control and optimization architecture to advance CPNI. Developed solutions can be extended for range of applications in multiple CPNIs beyond use cases discussed in the proposed work.\r\n\r\nWhile the proposed control architecture with edge computing offer great potential; coordinating decentralized control and optimization is extremely challenging due to variable network and computational delays, several interleavings of message arrivals, disparate failure modes of components, and cyber security threats leading to several fundamental theoretical problems. Proposed work offers number of novel solutions including (a) adaptive and delay-aware control algorithms, (b) Predictive control and distributed optimization with realistic cyber-physical constraints, (c) threat sharing, data-driven detection and mitigation for cyber security, (d) coordination and management of computing nodes, (e) knowledge learning and sharing. Proposed solutions will be a step towards advancing fundamentals in CPNI and in engineering next generation CPNI. The proposed work also aims to use high fidelity testbed to evaluate developed algorithms and tools for specific CPNI: electric distribution grid.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
