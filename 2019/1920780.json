 "awd_abstract_narration": "The next generation of engineers will need essential technical and professional skills to solve the complex problems facing society. Changes to how departments operate, the curriculum, and teaching practices in engineering programs are required to better prepare students for the profession. Efforts to implement these kinds of changes are often slowed down by department cultures or faculty attitudes about the amount of time and work that would be involved. In this project the Electrical, Computer, Software, and Systems Engineering (ECSSE) Department at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University will implement an innovative approach to become a department that responds quickly to student and industry needs. This approach will apply agile development methods typically used in industry to deliver the best products faster. Agile methods involve working on teams in short cycles which allow shared work responsibility, frequent feedback, and adjustments between cycles. The ECSSE Department will use the Scrum agile method to organize how the department carries out its normal operations. The department will also embed Scrum agile product development into courses across the curriculum. The new approach will allow faculty to achieve quicker changes and implementation of prioritized items for the department. Examples of prioritized items will include incorporating more evidence-based practices in courses such as just-in-time teaching, case-based teaching, active learning, and peer instruction; fostering inclusive learning environments; updating course materials; revising department procedures; and recruiting diverse students and faculty. Consequently, both faculty and students in the department will gain expertise with this agile professional skill. The project will investigate how the changes to department operations enhance faculty and student experiences. The findings would help inform other engineering departments about practices to improve the education of a diverse student population to be well-skilled engineers for the workforce. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project will be to radically transform the ECSSE department into an agile department that: 1) develops students into engineers with agile skills desired by industry, and 2) develops an agile faculty culture which models the use of agile practices for students. Faculty will work collectively in Scrum teams to innovate the practices, policies, and culture of the department. Students will use Scrum in individual and team projects throughout the middle two years of the curriculum to progressively build their expertise for the culminating capstone courses in the senior year. The research study will use an explanatory case study design guided by social cognitive theory. Quantitative and qualitative analyses will be performed using data from interviews with faculty and students, feedback from stakeholders, and artifacts from Scrum teams. Research results could lead to transformations in engineering education by offering a model on the novel use of Scrum as an agile organizational practice and its influences on the collective efficacy of faculty. This project is jointly funded by the Division of Undergraduate Education and the Division of Engineering Education and Centers reflecting the alignment of this project with the respective goals of the divisions and their programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
