 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the past decades much insight has been made into ocean currents and energy cycles from a profiling float that measures velocity.  This instrument is no longer available, however, because an essential microprocessor has been discontinued.  To maintain this observational platform, and to improve the profiler's capabilities and extensibility for future applications, the researchers will develop a new velocity profiler.  It will be used to advance our observational knowledge of ocean currents and the ocean-atmosphere system.  With its unique sampling capabilities for measuring subsurface ocean velocity, it is particularly useful for studying oceanic internal waves, ocean mixing, wind input of energy into the ocean, currents under sea ice and marine glaciers, and the ocean response to hurricanes, among many other uses.  The final instrument design will be made commercially available through an industry partner, for broad availability by the oceanographic community.  In addition, this project will transition engineering knowledge to a next generation of scientists and engineers.\r\n\r\nThe velocity profiling float to be developed measures weak electric field in the ocean to infer water velocity, a highly exacting type of measurement.  Largely relying on existing hardware, the development tasks include updating the internal electronics, inserting a second microprocessor, and rewriting the firmware and logic that controls the float.  The design goal is to build an extensible system that can easily be modified for new sampling patterns and can easily be integrated with new sensors, such as turbulent microstructure and biochemical sensors.  The ability to perform adaptive adjustments to its sampling pattern while underwater will also be included.  Extensive testing on the bench, in tanks, and in the field will be required to ensure a robust final system.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
