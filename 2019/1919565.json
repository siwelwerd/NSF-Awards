 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemical Instrumentation Programs. Professor Aaron Odom from Michigan State University and colleagues Milton Smith, Babak Borhan, Robert LaDuca and Richard Lunt are acquiring a dual source single crystal diffractometer. In general, an X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here impact many areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate and graduate students in chemistry and biochemistry at this institution. The facility serves as a regional XRD resource benefitting students and faculty from primarily undergraduate institutions within the state of Michigan as well as those from other colleges and universities around the U.S., including University of Idaho, Alabama A&M University, Binghamton University, Georgia State University and Dartmouth University.\r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. The diffractometer is especially used in developing processes using titanium to generate pharmacologically-active heterocycles and for studying cobalt-catalyzed carbon-hydrogen borylation reactions. It is also employed for studying brittle, high-melting intermetallic compounds commonly referred to as Zintl species used for thermoelectrics for which either a temperature difference creates an electrical potential or vice versa as well as materials for photovoltaics. The instrument aids investigations of lichen metabolites with antibacterial, antifungal and antioxidant activities. In collaboration with Oakland and Dartmouth Universities, the diffractometer is used in studies of bioinorganic models and studies of photoactive complexes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
