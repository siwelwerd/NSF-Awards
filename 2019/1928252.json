 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is focused on investigating a specific pathway for the formation of new particles in the atmosphere. This pathway involves reactions of methanesulfonic acid (MSA), a compound that is widespread throughout the lower troposphere and one that may be more significant in new particle formation than previously known.  Improvements in predicting new particle formation will enhance our ability to better understand a number of the effects of atmospheric pollution central to human health and welfare and provide ways to help mitigate these impacts.\r\n\r\nThe major objectives of this project are to: (1) quantitatively investigate possible synergies between mixtures of multifunctional amines and mixtures of selected amines and NH3 on new particle formation (NPF) and growth from MSA reactions; (2) investigate the role of low volatility highly oxidized organics produced from the oxidation of biogenic volatile organic compounds on these systems; (3) probe interactions between H2SO4 and MSA for NPF; and (4) translate the mechanistic understanding into atmospheric models.\r\n\r\nThis project will result in the parameterization of the rate of NPF as a function of precursor concentrations. The results will be incorporated into the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) air quality model to better understand the importance of MSA in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
