 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project intends to study the core enzymes that drive the production and breakdown of carbohydrates. These enzymes, called the carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes), are found in all living organisms and particularly in plants and plant-associated microbes. The complex carbohydrates found in plant cell walls are the most abundant, and renewable, organic material on Earth. If we had efficient systems to convert them to biomaterials and biofuels they would be attractive targets for bio-manufacturing projects. Important effects in the natural world are (i) the CAZymes produced by plant microbial pathogens cause plant cell wall breakdown leading to devastating crop loss ($5 billion in the United States and Canada each year) and (ii) bacteria in animal guts produce hundreds of CAZymes that digest the carbohydrates in the diet, some of which may have positive, and others toxic, consequences to the host. The research approach combines genomics and bioinformatics: the genome of a green algae will be sequenced and then bioinformatics tools will be used to carry out data analysis. This green algae is the common ancestor of all land plants, its genome compared to those of plants will show how evolution has modified core carbohydrate chemistry to meet changing environmental challenges. Bioengineering of these enzymes may well contribute to the development of a more sustainable and secure bioeconomy (e.g., bioenergy and agricultural industries) in the US, as part of the global Genomics market, whose value is expected to reach $20 billion by 2020. Students trained in the course of this project will be poised to become the next generation of scientists, able to exploit their understanding of comparative genome sequence analysis to create new understanding and novel applications. The educational and outreach objectives of this project are to engage students as active participants in the research activities, including data analysis, and to to train undergraduate students and K-12 Science teachers to understand the basics of genome sequencing and comparison methods, including hands-on skills. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn the first Aim, new bioinformatics programs will be developed to allow in-depth CAZyme annotation with predicted biochemical activities. In the second Aim, the genomic context of CAZymes will be studied in microbial genomes and metagenomes of various ecological environments. Overall four computational tools will be developed, integrated, and delivered as a CAZyme bioinformatics web portal named dbCAN2. These free online tools will facilitate CAZyme research in various research fields such as genomics, carbohydrate, bioenergy, plant disease, food security, human gut microbiome, evolution and ecology. In the third Aim, this project will sequence and mine the genomes and transcriptomes of algae and early plants for CAZymes. This includes sequencing the genome and transcriptome of a green alga Zygnema circumcarinatum, the immediate ancestor of all land plants that is extremely critical for understanding the early evolution of carbohydrate-rich cell walls. The specific education activities include: (i) working with the Office of Student Engagement and Experiential Learning (OSEEL) of Northern Illinois University to bring undergraduate students, particularly under-represented minority students, into CAZyme bioinformatics research; (ii) collaborating with the Center for Secondary Science Teacher Education of NIU to integrate DNA sequencing and data analysis topics into the curriculum of the Teacher Licensure Program as well as the professional development programs for K-12 Science teachers; and (iii) incorporating Zygnema genome annotation as new lab components into BIOS308 (Genetics) and BIOS441 (Practical Bioinformatics). Research products of this project will be disseminated at: http://cys.bios.niu.edu/dbCAN2/.",

The main target of this project was the enzymes that are involved in the synthesis and degradation of complex carbohydrates in plants and microbes. Examples of these complex carbohydrates include celluloses, hemicelluloses, and pectins, which are main chemical components of plant and algal cell walls. Complex carbohydrates in cell walls are the feedstock for biofuel production, the food for humans (e.g., dietary fibers in veggies and fruits) and animals (grains and forages), the natural barriers for protecting plants from environmental stresses and pathogens, and the main carbon sinks in oceans (algal cell walls), forests (plant cell walls), and soils (fungal and bacterial cell walls).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Therefore, this project had two main research objectives to address the intellectual merit. The first one was to develop innovative bioinformatics tools to automate the discovery of enzymes for complex carbohydrate metabolisms. These enzymes are called carbohydrate-activie enzymes or CAZymes. The second one was to generate the draft genome of a green alga called <em>Zygnema circumcarinatum</em>, which is the closest relative of all land plants. This draft genome could help other scientists to understand how plants have evolved the extremely strong but delicate cell walls. These cell walls contain various complex carbohydrates tangled together and recalcitrant to enzymatic degradation, which is the reason that cell walls can protect plant cells from stresses and pathogens and at the same time the reason that lignocellulosic biofuel production is so expensive.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For the first main objective, the key outcome was a family of bioinformatics tools (7 computer software systems) that benefit tens of thousands of users on a daily basis from over 150 countries of all the six major continents. The core tool is called dbCAN, which is provided as a web server and a standalone software package. It is the most popular automated CAZyme discovery server in the world (300,000+ jobs processed for users in 10 years, 8,000+ email addresses, and paper cited over 3,000 times).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For the second main objective, the key outcome was ~2 Terabytes of DNA and RNA sequencing data of four Zygnema green algal genomes. These data have been deposited to the GenBank database of the United States National Library of Medicine and the Joint Genome Institute's algal genome database of the United States Department of Energy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Lastly, we also had an education and outreach objective to address the broader of impacts. The key outcome for this objective was that we provided research training for over 50 trainnes directly or indirectly involved in this NSF project. These include 4 postdocs, 22 graduate students, 20 undergrad students, and 4 visiting scholars/students. Among these students, 22 are female, and 7 are under-represented minority students. One example is that, working with Northern Illinois University's Center for Secondary Science and Mathematics Education and the Teacher Licensure for Biology program, we had a very successful \"Introduction to Genomic Data Sciences\" summit in 2018.
