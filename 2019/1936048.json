 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participants of the Hudson River Undergraduate Mathematics Conference to be held in the month of April of 2020, 2021, and 2022. This conference, first held in 1994, will continue to serve students and faculty from a diverse list of universities, colleges, and community colleges in the Northeast. The goals of the conference are to motivate undergraduate students, in particular underrepresented groups and women, at all levels to attend and participate in a professional conference of the mathematical sciences; to provide students with an opportunity to learn about the community of mathematical scientists by interacting and networking with peers and faculty; and to provide a venue where undergraduates, share their scholarship, and practice communicating through preparing and presenting talks. This conference is distinctive because it explicitly aims to involve first-year and sophomore students as participants and because it is free to attendees. It is thus able to nourish the mathematical growth and collaborative experience of students and faculty at institutions that do not have the funds for conference expenses. The conferences will include two panels: one on how to make the most of one's college career and the other on career choices both in and out of academia. The atmosphere of the conference is exciting and encouraging and conference surveys have shown again and again that the experience of attending and/or presenting at the conference is key to retaining and encouraging students in the mathematical sciences. The problem-solving, reasoning, and communication skills developed at these conferences are transferable and will prepare students to solve larger societal issues. \r\n\r\nThese three one-day conferences will each bring together 300-350 students and faculty from the mathematical sciences. Students, under the mentorship of faculty members, will give most (approximately 80%) of the 15 minute presentations which are organized into three 1- hour session times each with multiple parallel sessions organized by subject. All conference participants will come together for an hour long keynote speech given by a well-known mathematical scientist followed by a working lunch and two informative lunchtime panels. The conference organizers have an assessment plan to modify the conference's evaluation tool and to centralize storage and access of conference data and an outreach plan to increase participation by members of underrepresented groups and to include first and second year students, as well as high school students and their teachers.  Through the preparation and presentation of talks, students learn to take complex mathematical ideas and present them in clear, understandable terms. In short, they are gaining first-hand experience on how mathematical scientists interact and communicate in order to further their understanding. More information regarding this conference can be found at www.skidmore.edu/hrumc.htm\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe objective of this NSF grant was to support the hosting of a major regional undergraduate mathematics research conference, the Hudson River Undergraduate Mathematics Conference (HRUMC) for three years starting with Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts in 2020, at Keene State College in Keene, New Hampshire in 2021 and at Siena College in Loudonville, New York in 2022. Now entering its 31st year, the HRUMC is a well-established conference, usually held on a Saturday in April, that engages around 300 undergraduates and their faculty in a daylong immersion dedicated to discussing and learning mathematics. The attendees are students and faculty members from a highly diverse list of universities, colleges, and community colleges all over the Northeast.\r\n\n\nAn undergraduate conference such as HRUMC provides a way for students to get away from the traditional classroom and into a vibrant marketplace of mathematical ideas. Their participation and commitment contribute to their personal intellectual development in the following ways: (1) The faculty committed to HRUMC make a strong effort to get first- and second-year students to attend the conference. (2) A student giving a talk, experiences a period of intense inquiry, of close mentoring by a faculty member, and of the preparation of an oral presentation of results in a recognized and formal setting. (3) The interactions between the participants at the conference provide important opportunities for growth. Students begin to think and act like mathematical scientists. (4) HRUMC creates an atmosphere where faculty and students drop their traditional classroom roles and are now all learners. The important objective of mathematical collaboration is on display.\r\n\n\nProfessional Development Panels on graduate school and industry careers have become a regular feature of HRUMC in recent years and they too are well attended. The panel members are usually graduates from the institutions that host the conference. The question-and-answer periods show that the students have a deep interest in possible career opportunities.\r\n\n\nMore details about the talks and the panels over the course of this grant can be found at the link,\r\n\n\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/hrumc\r\n\n\nThose faculty who mentor students and follow their careers after graduation report that former students remember this experience as one of the highlights of their college career. We feel that these past programs illustrate well the goals and ideals of HRUMC.\r\n\n\nBecause of the pandemic, the organizers were forced to cancel the conference in 2020 and hold it virtually in 2021. Participants were slow to return in person in 2022 but the number of attendees in 2023 and 2024 were in the two hundreds. The numbers do occasionally depend on the location, but HRUMCs Steering Committee does feel that the conference is close to being the size of those prior to the pandemic.\r\n\n\nThe original organizers of HRUMC and subsequent Steering Committee members did not want money to be a factor in attendance and so the conference expenses have been covered by grants, so all students needed to do is to get to the conference site. Expenses have included morning snacks, lunch, and midafternoon snacks. The institutional expenses covered by this grant were between $6,000 and $7,000 for each conference. We consider this a small investment in a student-oriented experience with significant long-term benefits. Many colleges are facing financial challenges and so a conference that is free for all attendees is strongly supported by the institutions.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/12/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: VincentJosephFerlini\n"
