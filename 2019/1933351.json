 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project transforms two uniquely located comparative field sites to support a diverse array of research, education, and capacity building efforts in Africa's Congo Basin ((https://www.cbi.ucla.edu/field-stations/).  The project provides basic scientific instrumentation and modest facilities upgrades that will permit longer stays, and sustainability measures at two biological field stations in Cameroon: 1) the Somalomo station in secondary forest at the border of the Dja Biosphere Reserve, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and 2) the Bouamir station, located in mature rainforest at the center of the reserve.  The project supports research in a region where species loss, deforestation, emerging diseases, and natural resource extraction are having global impacts.  It increases critical local scientific capacity in the region by pairing American scientists with African researchers.  The two field sites also hire and train naturalists from indigenous Baka villages, facilitating the translation of traditional knowledge and providing meaningful employment to this marginalized group.  Ultimately, the project will increase the capacity for American-led scientific research on topics such as emerging infectious diseases food and water security and ecosystem function.\r\n\r\nHaving one station located at the human forest interface and a second within a mature tropical rainforest offers researchers an unparalleled opportunity to conduct comparative work in a very understudied region. The sites support research and education on a variety of topics, including human and animal disease, food and water security, anthropology, geology, and environmental sciences.  This project increases scientific capacity at the sites through: (1) Improved scientific equipment by creating a networked system of basic sensors (e.g., weather stations, temperature loggers, and other biomonitoring equipment) that will report on ecological and environmental variables. (2) Facilities upgrades including adding plumbing and other basic conveniences. (3) Increased functionality and sustainability at the sites by providing solar-based electricity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
