 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a conference that convenes researchers from the fields of operations engineering and criminal justice, along with police department leadership from across the US, to explore research directions in decision analytics and operations research to improve dynamic, data-driven policing methods.  Beginning in 2008, so-called \"predictive policing\", which entails using analytical methods to predict how, when, where, and by whom crimes will occur, has been deployed by police departments in many states.  These methods rely on  historical data collected on time, location, and details of crimes, as well as on characteristics of perpetrators and victims.  While some jurisdiction have shown an overall decrease in crime after implementation of predictive policing, other evaluative studies have shown the effects to be negligible or even detrimental.  These methods have been criticized on three critical aspects:  (1) they are not informed by a sociological perspective; (2) they assume that data include the necessary information for both prediction and effective response; and (3) they ignore the dynamic nature of the policing system.  This conference will bring together appropriate researchers, along with practitioners, to build a cross-disciplinary understanding of policing challenges that may be addressable by decision analytics and operations research.\r\n\r\nOne of the most serious challenges facing police departments is the effective use of resources to address calls for service, especially when responding to serious crimes.  Police departments recognize that part of a comprehensive approach to community safety involves protecting the rights of all involved during police encounters.  The focus of this workshop is on identifying operational aspects, including data collection and analysis, planning, training, and crime scene investigation, where additional research may lead to improved resource allocation.  Day 1 of the conference includes keynotes on predictive policing and data analytic case studies, as well as breakout sessions for working groups. Day 2 of the conference will include a keynote speaker addressing international policing strategies, and working groups will continue to discuss and document research needs.  Four teams of researchers who have established relationships with large police organizations serve as workshop organizers.  Additional teams of attendees (operations engineers, criminal justice researchers, police department leadership) will be recruited to participate in the workshop.  This activity will provide a unique forum to bring together a variety of stakeholders to encourage research on this important societal topic.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nStrategic partnerships between officials in police agencies and criminologists in university settings, over time, have become quite routine.  The traditional approach in law enforcement studies utilizes randomized control trials.  However, this approach does not take advantage of today's data collection capabilities.  Within the last decade, the concept of predictive policing was proposed by a RAND report, funded by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ), to categorize and encourage academic research developing machine learning and statistical modeling tools to accurately predict crime.  Unfortunately, existing predictive policing methods are flawed in four critical aspects: 1. They omit the human perspective, including human behavior, political biases, and community perception.  2. They assume that the data include the necessary information for both prediction and action. 3. They assume that historical data on the policing system will be representative for the future. 4. They assume unlimited police resources.\n\nA key element in the RAND report that has yet to be acknowledged in the literature is the concept of prediction-led policing.  For this concept, it is recognized that prediction alone, regardless of accuracy, is inadequate without connection to a policing strategy that identifies appropriate actions.  To specifically study the decision-making element of policing, this workshop brought together 10 local teams of police departments (PDs) and academics with expertise in decision analytics and operations research (DA/OR) and criminal justice (CJ).  The workshop was led by teams in Texas, Virginia, Alabama, and Georgia and introduced new teams in Arizona, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Oregon, and Wisconsin.  The local team structure was successful at facilitating discussions within and across DA/OR, CJ, and PD participants, so as to examine all three perspectives.  Workshop participants were a diverse group with 21 women and 6 under-represented minorities out of 47 workshop attendees.  Among the 5 keynote speakers, 2 were women.  The implemented workshop structure is recommended as a model for future workshops and research partnerships in other complex cross-disciplinary application domains.\n\nOne of the most serious challenges facing police departments is the effective utilization of resources to address calls for service, especially when responding to serious crimes. This issue was addressed quite clearly in the report from the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing (2015, p. 19), as the authors noted that \"data collection, supervision, and accountability are also part of a comprehensive systemic approach to keeping everyone safe and protecting the rights of all involved during police encounters.\"  DA/OR as a discipline is not well known within the law enforcement context.  Towards filling this gap, this workshop identified and recommended specific research directions and challenges for developing DA/OR approaches to enable policing strategies that are cost-effective, consider social influences, identify the appropriate data, address policing dynamics and uncertainty, and utilize existing knowledge from PD/CJ expertise.  Further, the workshop provided guidance on facilitating communication and building academic-PD partnerships.\n\nResearch topics arising from workshop discussion could be categorized broadly into four categories: (i) PDs/Officers, (ii) Offenders, (iii) Community, and (iv) Technology/Data.  Topics addressing PDs/Officers included officer training, mental health and wellness, and staffing and resources.  Topics concerning Offenders included recidivism, opioids and drug abuse, and gun violence.  Topics arising from the Community included the public perception of PDs, politics, and community-based policing.  Finally, topics related to Technology/Data included the expense vs. value of technology, the cost-effectiveness of big data, and the lack of appropriate performance measures.  Workshop discussions focused on understanding what is controllable in policing, what is dynamic, and what causes uncertainty.  The combination of these three elements creates the complexity of decision-making for law enforcement systems.  By clearly defining what is controllable, PD participants were better able to focus on how DA/OR methods could benefit policing.  Discussions revealed that PDs are overwhelmed by an abundance of unhelpful data while simultaneously lacking records on policing strategies.  More importantly, performance metrics currently employed to evaluate PDs were superficially chosen based on ease of access. \n\nIn order for a DA/OR approach to yield useful results, care must be taken to select genuinely relevant performance objectives.  In this regard, it become apparent in the discussions that human and social elements must be represented.  Hence, one of the primary findings was the need for DA/OR researchers to work closely with CJ experts and other social scientists to ensure understanding of behavioral and social influences and impacts.  A second important finding was that DA/OR researchers should tread carefully in developing approaches and solutions, so as not to follow the mistakes of the predictive policing movement.  PD participants emphasized that if DA/OR solutions fail once, there may not be a second chance.  Overall, the potential impact of DA/OR research in law enforcement is extremely high, but progress will require care, collaboration, persistence, and an open mind.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/23/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Victoria C Chen"
