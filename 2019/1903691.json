 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impacts of this I-Corps project are to improve hands-on laboratory experiences in the field of materials science and to increase STEM awareness for students/instructors at the 9-12 and undergraduate levels. The educational kit bridges the gap between theoretical and practical molecular materials technologies. The kit is an interactive learning tool designed for interdisciplinary laboratory activities and can be used in physics, chemistry, engineering, and material science educational settings. The kits provide all needed materials, a fully developed curriculum, and training for implementation. Professional development workshops for instructors help to integrate the laboratory activities into instructor?s existing science curriculum while addressing national and international science standards. There is a significant market for hands-on laboratory activities that incorporate contemporary science experiments currently under investigation and development at the university level. School districts and science / engineering departments will likely be interested in acquiring the kits, making them a commercially impactful and important education platform. The kit is flexible and can be expanded upon to include future experiments and professional development. The kits can also be used and developed for extracurricular activities such as science fairs and competitions.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project involves a polymer electronics laboratory kit to improve materials science education for 9-12 and undergraduate students. The three-module kit and curriculum use polymer semiconductors to provide hands-on inquiry activities integrating themes of electrical conductivity, light emission, and light-harvesting solar energy conversion. These themes are critical to contemporary materials science research and education. The kit includes materials to evaluate the electrical properties of conductive colloidal polyaniline inks, to construct a polymer light- emitting diode using polyphenylene vinylene, and to build a polymer solar cell using semiconductive polymers and nanoparticulate TiO2. Designed initially for high school science classrooms, the activities developed also meet new collegiate undergraduate education requirements for macromolecular, supramolecular, and nanoscale systems in the curriculum and can be used in undergraduate teaching laboratories. The modules and kit have also been implemented in professional development workshops for training 9&#8722;12 science educators to help integrate the laboratory activities into their curriculum.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Importantly, our participation in the I-Corps program was directed towards identifying our major customer segments and strengthening our value propositions. Our company is built around a polymer semiconductor education kit designed to improve materials science education for students in grades 9-12 and undergraduate students (Figure 1). The educational kit bridges the gap between theoretical and practical molecular materials technologies. It is an interactive learning tool designed for interdisciplinary laboratory activities and can be used in physics, chemistry, engineering, and material science educational settings. Using commercially available polymer materials, the kit is designed to educate and engage the users about many important applications of conducting and semiconducting polymers. Our prototype kit is composed of three-modules with curriculum that provide hands-on inquiry activities integrating themes of electrical conductivity, light emission, and light-harvesting solar energy conversion. These themes are critical to contemporary materials science research and education. Modules have been designed with help from high school teachers and university researchers after carefully considering the requirements and background of high school students, teachers and undergraduate researchers. Designed initially for high school science classrooms, the activities also meet new collegiate undergraduate education requirements for macromolecular, supramolecular, and nanoscale systems in the curriculum and can be used in undergraduate teaching laboratories. The modules and kit have also been implemented in professional development workshops for training science educators to integrate the laboratory activities into instructor's existing science curriculum while addressing state/national science standards.</p>\n<p>We conducted interviews with students, teachers, professors, researchers and parents to determine our potential customer segments. Several initial customer segments stood out. For instance, principal investigators at universities or colleges who are already involved in organizing school/university workshops showed a great deal of interest in a STEM outreach product that was ready-to-go. We also identified early on that a major customer segment would be high school STEM teachers and school district officials. We were especially aware that an education kit that has everything ready for a teacher to initiate the experiments in their own classroom is an excellent platform for taking university level research and transforming it into hands-on activities. We quickly determined that our education kit could significantly help decrease lab preparation time for instructors. Additionally, the kit provided lab activities that can be run anywhere (on a desktop or non-science equipped classroom) or even at home. It doesn't require specialized equipment, and it provides significant flexibility, especially for homeschool or virtual learning. Another value proposition that became clear as we conducted more interviews was the need for professional development for teacher recertification. We believe this is a significant financial advantage for school districts if the teacher recertification hours could be acquired at the same time as the professional development, therefore eliminating the recertification costs. As we spoke with more public-school administrators, the workshops used to train science educators to integrate the laboratory activities into their curriculum was a very attractive feature of our program. Our education kit workshops can be used for teacher recertification at the same time introducing a new science curriculum that addresses state and national science standards.</p>\n<p>Overall, our hope is that this program can demonstrate how university-level, contemporary, academic research can be available to all educators and students at any level. We want to accelerate the rate at which this dissemination takes place, and we believe our program has begun to identify the means by which this can occur. Partnerships with schools, districts, and educators is critical for developing the experiments and activities for the appropriate level. We've learned that professional development and teacher training is a great model for creating these partnerships.</p>\n<!-- @font-face \t{font-family:\"Cambria Math\"; \tpanose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:roman; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face \t{font-family:Calibri; \tpanose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:swiss; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-469750017 -1073732485 9 0 511 0;}p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal \t{mso-style-unhide:no; \tmso-style-qformat:yes; \tmso-style-parent:\"\"; \tmargin:0in; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:12.0pt; \tfont-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}p \t{mso-style-noshow:yes; \tmso-style-priority:99; \tmso-margin-top-alt:auto; \tmargin-right:0in; \tmso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; \tmargin-left:0in; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:12.0pt; \tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif; \tmso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";}.MsoChpDefault \t{mso-style-type:export-only; \tmso-default-props:yes; \tfont-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}div.WordSection1 \t{page:WordSection1;} --> <!-- @font-face \t{font-family:\"Cambria Math\"; \tpanose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:roman; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face \t{font-family:Calibri; \tpanose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:swiss; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-469750017 -1073732485 9 0 511 0;}p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal \t{mso-style-unhide:no; \tmso-style-qformat:yes; \tmso-style-parent:\"\"; \tmargin:0in; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:12.0pt; \tfont-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}p \t{mso-style-noshow:yes; \tmso-style-priority:99; \tmso-margin-top-alt:auto; \tmargin-right:0in; \tmso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; \tmargin-left:0in; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:12.0pt; \tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif; \tmso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";}.MsoChpDefault \t{mso-style-type:export-only; \tmso-default-props:yes; \tfont-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}div.WordSection1 \t{page:WordSection1;} --><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/28/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michael&nbsp;G&nbsp;Walter</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1903691/1903691_10590161_1656446027403_PolymerSemiconductorEducationKit--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1903691/1903691_10590161_1656446027403_PolymerSemiconductorEducationKit--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Polymer Semiconductor Education Kit Contents\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1903691/1903691_10590161_1656446027403_PolymerSemiconductorEducationKit--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Polymer Semiconductor Education Kit Contents\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Prototype Polymer Semiconductor Education Kit</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Michael G.
