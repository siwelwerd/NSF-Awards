 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. \r\n\r\nThe North Florida Community College project provides middle school students in a high poverty rural area in Northern Florida an opportunity to pursue post-secondary study in STEM by providing quality and relevant STEM design. The design challenges will be contextualized within a rural region (i.e., GIS mapping and drones used for surveying large ranches, farms, and forests), producing a series of six design challenge modules and two competition design challenges with accompanying teacher guides for preparing relevant STEM modules for 90 middle school aged students. The project will integrate 4 components: (a) engineering design, (b) technology and society, (c) electrical knowledge, and (d) computer science. The project aims to improve middle school students' spatial reasoning through experiences embedded within engineering design challenges. competition design challenges with accompanying teacher guides for preparing relevant STEM modules for aged students\r\nCollaborative partners consisting of school level, college level, and STEM professionals will develop the design challenges, using best practices from STEM learning research, with the intent of advancing STEM pathway awareness and participation among historically underserved students in the rural, high-poverty region served by North Florida Community College. Data regarding student outcomes will be collected before and after implementation, including measures of content mastery, spatial reasoning skills, self-efficacy, attitudes and interests in STEM, and academic achievement in science courses Assessment of the data will involve the research and development phases of six curriculum modules and (2) an intervention study following a delayed-treatment design model\r\n\r\nThere is a growing need for the increased broadening of STEM by underserved groups. By increasing the number of rural students who participate in STEM hands on, interdisciplinary experiences, the project has the potential to expand interest and competency in mathematics and science and expand the number of students who are aware of STEM career pathways\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe goal of this project was to improve student understanding of STEM through experiences embedded within engineering design challenges such as experiences that had been developed through a collaborative partnership consisting of K-12 educators and community college STEM experts. The collaboration and summer institute were designed with the intent of advancing STEM pathway awareness and participation among historically underserved students in a rural, high poverty region. We achieved this by incorporating computing and engineering principles within sea, air, and land-focused summer institutes (called STEM SEALs) couched within a Design-based Research model. The application of this model involved the integration of local STEM experts from the area community college, middle and high school teachers employed within areas schools, social scientists from outside the State, and national advisors, thereby establishing an expansive STEM learning support network.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a direct product of the projects efforts, detailed guides for student STEM SEALs experiences leading up to design challenges were generated. The modules introduced students to practical STEM challenges across the different domains. They emphasize affordable design prototypes, sensor-integrated programming, and hands-on construction, whether the context was rovers, boats, or drones. Throughout, students learned about micro:bit processors, iterative design processes, and the key components of their respective vehicles, which enhanced their understanding of technology and engineering. These collaboratively crafted and iteratively developed, tested, and refined modules are now accessible for broader applications. The guides include assembly pictures and facilitator resources to support implementation including links to source codes and video tutorials. They are available on our project website (https://www.nfc.edu/STEM-SEALs/).\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother direct outcome of the projects efforts was the identification and engagement of more than seventy STEM-capable students who participated in the projects summer institutes. From their exposure, multiple areas of impact were identified through pre- and post-assessments of participating students. Statistically significant findings included improved computational thinking, adoption of a growth mindset, greater knowledge of how to use block coding, more experience with robotics, and gains in confidence in computing and coding ability.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe engagement of local K-12 educators as collaborators led to the formation of a group of highly skilled STEM advocates within the rural counties targeted by the project. A pre- and post-assessment design highlighted the project's profound impact on these educators. As a result of their participation in the summer institutes, educators were more confident about doing engineering design tasks and their self- efficacy increased in the following areas: in providing explanations, demonstrating relevance, finding resources, integrating with other subject areas, planning out the logic when programming, and problem solving.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis projects work has been well received. Of particular note, this project leveraged a rapid cycle Design-based Research approach during a global pandemic to understand best practices in transitioning high quality STEM learning environments from in-person to virtual. The contributions of this exploratory study of applying the Design-based Research approach within rapid change efforts in STEM enrichment resulted in important contributions toward expanding the knowledge base around best practices for embedding Design-based Research within rapid design efforts. This learning was disseminated through a journal article that can be found here https://www.astesj.com/v08/i03/p25/.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/15/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: GuenterMaresch\n"
