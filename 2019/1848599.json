 "awd_abstract_narration": "Further developments in modeling of materials science phenomena and training of the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists are of critical importance to maintaining U.S. leadership in science and technology. This award provides support for participants in a symposium entitled \"Mathematical Aspects of Materials Science - Modeling, Analysis, and Computations,\" to be held during the Materials Research Society 2019 Spring Meeting and Exhibit in Phoenix, Arizona on April 22-26, 2019. The four-day symposium will feature twenty invited presentations by leading mathematicians and materials scientists working on problems at the intersection of their disciplines. The invited presentations will be complemented by up to fifty contributed presentations from the members of both communities; it is anticipated that a significant number of these talks will be given by researchers in early stages of their careers. This will offer a unique networking and training opportunity for students and junior researchers to interact with their senior counterparts working at the cutting edge of the mathematics of materials. The funding from this award will be used to support a diverse group of early-career participants from all parts of the scientific community, including women and minorities. The opportunity to expose their research by presenting a contributed talk at the premier materials science gathering and a chance to develop new interdisciplinary collaborations would be an important step in a career development for young mathematicians. \r\n\r\nThe symposium will cover a wide range of topics of interest to the larger materials science community. The principal focus will be on problems related to structural defects and phase transitions in materials, microstructure and pattern formation, homogenization, and the relationship between descriptions of materials at different scales. From the mathematical perspective, the issues discussed at the symposium will come under the umbrella of nonlinear analysis, modeling, and computations. The combination of cutting edge materials science and modern mathematics at the symposium offers a strong chance to further advance research in both disciplines through cross-penetration of ideas.  Details can be found at https://www.mrs.org/spring2019/symposium-sessions/symposium-sessions-detail?code=CP09\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
