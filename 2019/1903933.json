 "awd_abstract_narration": "While nanotechnology is revolutionizing many industry sectors and having significant impact to our daily lives, investigating the potential negative impacts of nanomaterials becomes ever more important. Most studies that focus on understanding potential health effects are carried out with cells cultured in a petri-dish. While such studies have provided a wealth of information about the importance of nanomaterial's physical, mechanical, and chemical properties in toxicity to cells, they inform less about the interactions of the nanoparticles with human tissues and organs. This project aims to create an engineered 3-dimensional human heart tissue model generated by a novel bioprinting technique, and to use this model to study the impact of nanoparticles on the heart.  Success of this this project will eliminate the need for expensive animal model systems in studies of tissue and organ toxicity to nanomaterials. The highly interdisciplinary nature of the project will involve training students across the traditional boundaries, offering exciting topics including bioprinting, tissue engineering, nanotechnology, and biological interactions of nanoparticles. Also, the project will facilitate training broadly across multiple stages of professional and academic development by including graduate students, undergraduate students, and high school students of diverse backgrounds.  \r\n\r\nTechnically, this project will be the first attempt in the field to investigate how nanoparticles interact with 3-dimensional human heart tissues, created by 3-dimensional bioprinting. The first research task aims to establish the bioprinted microscale human heart tissue model and evaluate cell alignment, morphology, gene expression, and cardiac function. The second research task will focus on the synthesis of a suite of monodispersed nanoparticles with varying compositions and surface coatings. Assessment of nano-cardio interactions will be carried out to investigate the effects of these nanoparticles on cell viability, morphology, gene expression, and cardiac force output. From this project, the feasibility of using these engineered human tissue models for nanotoxicity studies will be established. The project is of high-risk. But if successful, the outcomes of the project will lead to high reward since it will provide significant insights into the biocompatibility of nanoparticles to 3-dimensional human tissues. Using human induced pluripotent stem cells derived cardiomyocytes, the project will further reveal individual effects of these nanoparticles. The investigators are well situated and uniquely positioned to tackle these issues. The principal investigator is a pioneer in 3-dimensional bioprinting with an excellent track record for cutting-edge research in biomaterials, bioprinting, and tissue engineering. The co-principal investigator is a leading expert in studying the environmental and health implications of nanomaterials. Such a unique collaboration will lead to transformative results. The highly interdisciplinary nature of the project will enable student training across the traditional boundaries, offering exciting topics including biomanufacturing, nanotechnology and biological interactions of nanoparticles. Also, the project will facilitate training graduate students, undergraduate students, and high school students of diverse backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
