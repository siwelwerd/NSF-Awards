 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the role of symmetry in algebraic geometry, an area of mathematics concerned with the study of the solution sets of systems of polynomial equations.  This topic has long played a central role in mathematics, and it lies at the intersection of many fields of mathematics: the problems to be studied relate to wide variety of areas of mathematics, including topology, algebra, and number theory.  The project will investigate a variety of situations in which unexpected symmetries of equations make it possible to explore otherwise difficult-to-understand geometric phenomena and to test a wide variety of geometric conjectures in new settings.\r\n\r\nThe particular emphasis of this project will be on the connections between algebraic geometry and algebraic dynamics, the study of iterated rational maps, and the results will include applications of each field to the other.  On one hand, the investigator will work to understand how ideas from dynamics can be used to reveal a variety of otherwise obscure phenomena in higher-dimensional algebraic geometry, and he aims to demonstrate that varieties admitting dynamically interesting self-maps provide a fertile source of examples (and counterexamples).  Conversely, the investigator will also work to understand how the methods of algebraic geometry (and the minimal model program in particular) can be employed to understand the geometric properties of algebraic varieties with very large groups of symmetries.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAlgebraic dynamics is the study of iterated applications of rational functions. For example, one could consider the function f(z) = z^2 + 1/2 and ask what happens when one repeatedly applies the function f to some input. The project \"Birational Geometry and Algebraic Dynamics\" dealt with bringing tools from algebraic geometry to bear on problems in algebraic dynamics.\n\nThe funding resulted in a number of research publications.  Two of these were applications of geometric techniques to problems in algebraic dynamics, two were applications of dynamical ideas to problems in algebraic geometry, and one included applications both ways.  Taken together, this work demonstrated the rich interplay between birational geometry and algebraic dynamics.\n\nOne of these research outcomes was of particular interest.  A question from Nakayama in the 1990's asked whether an invariant called the \"numerical Iitaka dimension\" could be defined in a certain way.  These question had apparently been answered in the affirmative not once, but twice, with proofs appearing in 2012 and again in 2016. However, both of these proofs had been discovered to contain errors.  The paper \"Notions of Numerical Iitaka Dimension Do Not Coincide\" settled the question of whether this invariant exists in general, showing the negative: despite the earlier proofs, the invariant is not actually well-defined!\n\nThe project funding also enabled a number of activities sharing these ideas with both the public and researchers in nearby areas.  The PI organized two conferences during the grant period, one aimed at researchers in the field, and the other aimed at undergraduate students who were new to the area.  He also gave some events geared toward the general public, including presentations at a county fair and at the local high school math club.\n\nThe PI also directed two successful undergraduate research projects during the life of the grant, one of which has continued beyond the grant period.  One of these students is now in the process of applying to mathematics graduate school with a focus broadly in the area of the grant.  The attached image shows one of the discoveries made by the second group of students: it shows that the behavior of a function called the \"volume\" can have a fractal structure, much more complicated that had been generally expected!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/04/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John D Lesieutre"
