 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This project addresses the need to expand the performance of materials that resist wear at elevated temperatures in a wide range of applications from microelectronics to protective coatings for manufacturing. Such coatings are critical for ensuring component quality and reliability by reducing manufacturing flaws, reducing in-service damage and extending the lifetime of components in the field and in manufacturing processes - all of which will largely eliminate waste, inefficient operations and resource intensive redundancies. Improved coatings may also expand the design space, allowing engineers to make choices that are more sustainable or could improve performance but are otherwise impossible with existing technologies. Transition metal diborides have exceptional wear properties and are quite tolerant of high temperatures; however, the presence of oxygen in these service environments diminishes those properties. This research is coupling processing science with state of the art characterization tools to develop new coating chemistries in the diboride family that evolve to protect themselves in oxidizing environments. Moreover, the processing route uses chemically safe precursors and operates at lower temperatures, making it a sustainable alternative to many existing coating technologies.  By engaging an industrial partner, UES Inc., though the GOALI program, this research is focused on industrially identified gaps in understanding and technology.  Graduate student researchers are also benefiting from this close partnership, gaining invaluable training and professional skills by working directly with UES researchers. These graduate students will be well positioned to join companies across a wide spectrum of industries dependent on these protective coatings (e.g., automotive, microelectronics, aerospace, power generation, tooling, etc.) where they are very much in demand. Teaching, training and participation of underrepresented groups is being fostered through targeted recruitment of graduate students from the University of Illinois Support of Under-Represented Groups in Engineering (SURGE) program and undergraduate researchers from the Illinois Scholars Undergraduate Research (ISUR) program.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS:  The overarching objective of this study is to establish the scientific underpinnings of a new sustainable kinetic route towards durable, oxidation resistant refractory diboride thin films of HfAlxBy and HfCrxBy. The initial metastable state is established through low temperature chemical vapor deposition and the use of chemically safe (halogen free) precursors. The PIs are committed to sustainable synthesis routes, specifically the co-PI is a co-founder and lead instructor in the 'Energy and Sustainability Engineering' graduate certificate and MEng degree programs at UI (http://EaSE.Illinois.edu).  Once fabricated, film properties are evaluated in both as-deposited and annealed conditions using quantitative techniques, including transmission electron microscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The results for film growth, microstructure and composition are then analyzed in terms of kinetic models for the component steps in the synthesis process. Additionally, in exploratory work, incorporation of Cr is examined using the Cr(B3H8)2 precursor developed by a collaborator. This precursor, which contains no heteroatoms other than hydrogen, has previously been demonstrated by the co-PI to deposit high quality CrB2 films, hence, it is expected to work well in combination with Hf(BH4)4. Film growth, including the pursuit and validation of chemically safe synthesis routes, analysis and testing actively involve the GOALI partner, UES Inc., facilitated by regular communication and extended visits of personnel between sites. Successful protocols are then transferred to industry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project developed a thin coating material based on an alloy of hafnium, aluminum, and boron that can be applied to a part with complex shape. The coating has a favorable combination of properties including chemical inertness, high mechanical hardness, high fracture toughness, good electrical conductivity, and resistance to oxidation up to a temperature of 700C. These properties make it an attractive candidate for use in applications where the part is subject to friction and wear at elevated temperatures in oxygen-containing environments.\r\n\n\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\n\nThe unique approach of this project was to deposit the coating using the technique of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) with two volatile precursor molecules, one to supply hafnium and boron (Hf(BH4)4) and the other to supply aluminum (AlH3N(CH3)3). CVD is highly applicable to complex shapes because the coating elements are supplied to the film growth surface via the gas phase, in contrast to line-of-sight coating methods such as evaporation or sputtering. The relative content of hafnium and aluminum in the coating (denoted as x in Hf1-xAlxBy) is controllably varied by changing the partial pressures of the two precursor molecules.\r\n\n\nThis choice of precursor molecules affords a film with a dense nanocrystalline structure in the as-deposited state, which is unusual considering that the temperature during growth (300C) is small compared with the estimated melting temperature of the film. We hypothesized that the supply of aluminum to the growth surface consumes the excess boron that arrives with the Hf(BH4)4 molecule, leading both to the nanocrystalline structure and to an enhanced growth rate  faster than the sum of growth rates when each precursor is used alone.\r\n\n\nUsing compositional control, we identified the range of composition x that affords nanocrystalline material with the best combination of mechanical and oxidation-resistant properties as 0.40  x  0.66. Those with x \r\n\n\nBroader Impacts\r\n\n\nScience: The insight provided by our mechanistic hypothesis opens a new pathway for CVD growth of a variety of thin film materials, including other hard protective coatings.\r\n\n\nPractical application: The combination of low temperature crystallinity and oxidation resistance in these coatings expands the potential impact beyond the application in die casting envisioned by our industrial collaborator, UES (Dayton, OH). Likely applications include nanostructures with three-dimensional architectures.\r\n\n\nTransfer to industry: The CVD growth method is well established industrially, so the results of this research can be transferred to industry without barriers due to limited know-how or equipment.\r\n\n\nHuman resource development: All students who were trained in this project are identified as members of historically marginalized groups in engineering.
