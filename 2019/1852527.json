 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to Mississippi State University, located in Starkville, MS, supports the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2020-2022. In this program, funded by the Division of Chemistry, participants pursue collaborative research projects at the interface of chemistry, engineering, and environmental science.  Participants learn about the interdependencies of water quality, fertilizer use for increased food production, and renewable energy using interdisciplinary approaches.  This research leads to the development of environmentally -engaged scientists and a better trained workforce.  Through seminars and workshops, this program also promotes entrepreneurial thinking and explores pathways to starting small businesses.\r\n\r\nParticipants learn about the areas of energy security, water quality, food security and related issues. The research project areas include the conversion of biomass and energy crops into biofuels; the utilization of biochar (a biofuel production byproduct) for the purification of water; and the enhancement of food security through biochar soil amendment. Components of these projects include growing biomass, converting it into biofuels, and using the by-products to clean water and improve soil quality. These projects expose participants to research instrumentation, which encourages excitement for science and teaches participants practical skills that can translate to careers in the chemical sciences or graduate school. Alongside research, seminars and workshops shape an environmentally conscious and entrepreneurially-minded cohort, building a chemical sciences workforce ready to tackle big societal problems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Thirty-five students have been supported through this program and have included undergraduates in the majors of chemistry, biochemistry, engineering, and other related sciences from primarily undergraduate institutions located across the United States. The primary recruiting target fort this program was to support female and minority students from undergraduate institutions that had limited research opportunities and we successfully fulfilled that recruiting mission with 74% of our 35 participants defined as minority or women.&nbsp; As well 51% of our cohort were First-Generation students. &nbsp;Our program has successfully exposed undergraduate students to a breadth of research on related Food, Energy and Water Security topics and allowed for connections of chemistry across disciplinary boundaries.</p>\n<p>A second focus of this REU-INFEWS program was to support entrepreneurial thinking and encourage students to consider small business opportunities as they move forward in their careers. The work created through this program has produced 6 publications including a paper on the success and strategies of this REU program.&nbsp; In addition, the program has supported two additional manuscripts currently under review, 4 presentations at chemistry conferences and 35 poster presentations at undergraduate research symposia. &nbsp;Training for our students included informing students about the career pathways and timelines for graduate school application, supporting students to gain technical skills and scientific comprehension with their projects, encouraging students to think critically about their research work and present their findings at conferences.</p>\n<p>This REU program was able to successfully engage students in laboratory research experiences during the 2020 summer when most programs were closed due to COVID restrictions.&nbsp; Working closely with our university and program managers we were able to create a safe and productive working environment for students to get hands-on training and experience performing research in the laboratory.&nbsp; With safety as the top priority, our students were still able to engage in all training and presentation aspects of our REU program through online meetings and videotaped presentations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This REU-INFEWS program successfully integrated in with other funded research programs at our university to allow for an expanded social cohort of students and additional training opportunities.&nbsp; Students overlapped and engaged with 20-30 additional undergraduate researchers each summer which allowed them to develop ideal support networks and gain access to training components offered through other programs.&nbsp; This program included field trips to visit the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies (IMMS) in Gulfport, MS for a behind-the-scenes tour and discussion with their marine mammal veterinarian as some student research projects overlapped with the Institute.
