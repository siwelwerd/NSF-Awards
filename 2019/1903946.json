 "awd_abstract_narration": "Christopher Faesi is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to conduct a program of research and education at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.  Faesi will undertake an extensive observational program to study Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs)---the birthplaces of stars---in a large sample of nearby galaxies.  Studying how the properties of GMCs change with the environmental conditions within galaxies will allow astronomers to understand how those conditions influence star formation.  Alongside this research, Faesi will develop a series of lesson plans to introduce modern astronomical research into undergraduate classrooms.\r\n \r\nFaesi will measure GMC properties across a range of environments and develop methods to calibrate star formation rates at GMC scales in nearby galaxies.  This will allow a better understanding of the global relationship between stars and interstellar gas in galaxies.  For the educational component of his work, Faesi will develop a program to expose undergraduate students to astronomical research by implementing lesson plans involving digestible summaries of recent research articles, and he will assess how this exposure affects student retention, interest, and success in science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
