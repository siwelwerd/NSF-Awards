 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern computer chips are made from semiconductors, such as silicon, coated with an extremely thin layer of silicon-oxide. To fabricate reliable electronic components, the thickness of this oxide layer must be precisely controlled, which presents significant challenges as devices become smaller and smaller. Present methods of creating the silicon-oxide film require heating the semiconductor at high temperature.  This process leads to a non-uniform oxide layer.  In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms-A (CSDM-A) program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Sylvia T. Ceyer of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and her students are using sophisticated molecular beam techniques to study the oxide formation process.  Their discoveries could lead to improved methods using lower temperatures, which would have significant societal and economic benefit.  This research is also providing a broad-based education in scientific problem solving for students embarking on careers in chemical industry.  Professor Ceyer leverages MIT?s Summer Research Program (MSRP) to recruit underrepresented undergraduate students for summer research engaging them in the excitement of scientific discovery.  Professor Ceyer also authors and narrates compelling general chemistry lectures on YouTube as a part of educational and outreach activities designed to make science understandable and accessible for all. \r\n\r\nThis work proposes a novel method using (O2)2 dimer to easily synthesize O2 in its first electronically excited singlet state with the aim of bypassing a spin-forbidden reaction that limits oxidation activity of semiconductors.  This idea may lead to precise control of ever-thinner oxide layers in devices. The comparison between the experimentally-determined interaction dynamics of O2 versus (O2)2 are providing insights into the origin of the low, but non-zero probability of this spin forbidden reaction.  This research program also explores a non-equilibrium phenomenon involving lattice electronic excitations due to the initial collision of the incident O2 in the quest for understanding the non-zero O2 reactivity.  Finally, these experiments test a hypothesis that an alternate mechanism for dissociative chemisorption, atom abstraction, which does not require a spin forbidden transition, may be operative via a metastable, non-equilibrium precursor state or a direct atom abstraction associated with a transient potential energy maximum.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nComputer or cell phone electronic chips are made from semiconductors, such as silicon, and require an extremely thin layer of silicon-oxide coating in order to function.  To fabricate reliable electronic components, the thickness of this oxide layer must be precisely controlled, which presents significant challenges as devices become smaller and smaller. Present methods of creating this oxide layer require heating the semiconductor to high temperature in the presence of oxygen, and often lack the control to produce a uniform oxide layer.  This project has demonstrated a novel method to carry out silicon oxidation at low temperature using sophisticated molecular beam techniques to create a unique form of oxygen and to study the oxidation process at the atomic level.  Preliminary measurements of the reaction probability yield a value that is about nine times greater than that measured with standard silicon oxidation processes at high silicon temperatures.  This discovery could lead to more precise control of ever-thinner oxide layers in semiconductor chips, which would have significant societal benefit in both faster and smaller electronic devices. \n\nGraphene, an emerging two-dimensional material with a higher electrical conductivity than copper, a higher electron mobility than silicon, and a greater hardness than steel, could revolutionize the electronics industry.  But the problem in integrating graphene into computer chips is that the temperatures necessary to grow graphene are too high to be compatible with silicon devices.  The high temperatures would melt the existing layers of the many materials that make up the structure of the silicon computer chip.  This project demonstrated a scheme for graphene production at very low temperatures compared to previous methods by introducing minute amounts of gold into a nickel surface.  The gold was shown to catalyze or speed up graphene growth at low temperatures compatible with semiconductor chip technology.   The capability of low temperature graphene growth opens up significant potential for the incorporation of graphene into complementary metal-oxide semiconductor processes, which would result in smaller and faster electronic chips. \n\nThese research projects provided a broad-based education in scientific problem solving for graduate and postdoctoral students to begin careers in chemical industry, equipping them with skills that are in high demand particularly in the semiconductor materials industry and in chemical companies, or to begin careers as researchers or teachers.  They also provided insight into the fundamental principles of semiconductor oxidation chemistry and gold catalytic activity, which in turn will spur additional creative approaches to both research problems and practical applications.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/22/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sylvia T Ceyer"
