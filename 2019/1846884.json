 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops a computational imaging system for the selective capture of fluorescence images. Fluorescence is exhibited by many compounds and materials and provides information about the objects' molecular makeup and microstructure. While not usually directly visible to the eye, it can be made visible using controlled illumination and optical filters. The fast response of fluorescence to illumination is visible only to special ultrafast cameras. Interpretation of these signals significantly enhances conventional imaging capabilities, for example to distinguish between healthy and cancerous tissue, detect blood and other bodily fluids, assess plant health, match gunshot residue to a gun and gunpowder manufacturer, identify the paints used in paintings, and classify minerals. However, capturing the fluorescence spectra for all different possible illumination wavelengths along with their fast temporal behavior for each pixel in an image would lead to a high dimensional dataset involving immense amounts of data and is therefore impractical. To enable the use of fluorescence, this project therefore will design a flexible computational imaging system that is able to selectively and adaptively capture individual pieces of the multidimensional fluorescence signal.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit The high resolution information available in the optical light field along\r\nmultiple dimensions presents a fundamental challenge to all imaging systems. The amount of\r\ndata available for sampling far exceeds the collection, processing and storage capacities of even\r\nthe most advanced computing equipment. Capturing it ultimately is limited not only by technical capabilities, but also by the total number of photons available to the imaging system. It is reasonable that the answer to this problem is to design imaging systems that analyze light specific to an imaging task. Imaging systems are designed where a joint optimization is performed over computational feature space and available hardware components to perform selective sensing.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts This project will educate laymen and students about the prevalence of fluorescence, fluorescence lifetime and other \"hidden\" spectral phenomena in everyday scenes. We will also provide an important step in the direction of application specific, high dimensional selective imaging systems. This will result in smaller and more practical computational imaging and compressive sensing implementations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Fluorescent materials also emit light of a particular wavelength when illuminated with excitation light of a different shorter wavelengths. Generally fluorescence mixes with the ambient and reflected light and even though it is present in most materials it requires special lighting and color filters to see. A blacklight, for example emits ultraviolet light largely invisible to the human eye and can excite the fluorescent materials in objects to make them easily visible with the naked eye. Because fluorescence can reveal material properties and can label objects and structures that are otherwise hard to see, it is an important tool in many fields form cell microscopy, over surgery, to material sciencne.<br /><br />This project developed more efficient ways to capture and process the often faint fluorescence light seen in those applications.<br /><br />Conventional cameras collect and process large amounts of photons to create human interpretable images. Compressed sensing techniques have been developed to capture compressed versions of images to reduce the requirements to capturing and processing hardware. While these methods provide improtant theortical insights, they have been difficult to adapt to actual cameras because of physical and technical constraints encountered in a real system. This project introduces selective sensing techniques for real measurements with realistic photon noise and paractical optical and electronic hardware to develop practical methods for specific applications. The methods developed for compressed sensing and optical coding are employed in different stages of those imaging systems in the camera optics, as well as for compression of photon counts in the camera chip just after the light has been captured. The developed methods prove particularly effective for vision systems where images are collected for processing by machines rather than human viewing.<br /><br />The project developed improved processing methods for fluorescence guided surgery cameras, where fluorescence excited in the patient is used to show the surgeon important structures such as nerves and tumors. An ongoing follow up project develops cameras for detection of psoriasis by imaging the patients skin. In camera compression methods are applied to LiDAR cameras to enable higher resolution 3D mapping. Similar processing allow for capture of high speed video with single photon cameras in low light (see figure).<br /><br />To educate k-12 students and the general public about fluorescence, the project developed a fluorescence exploration lab that uses simple and inexpensive equipment to image fluorescence in food items. Students are encouraged to explore and create their own combination, for example by providing fluroescent drink recipes (see figure). Using safe fluorescence food ingredients such as chlorophyl (in leaves) or ribflavin (vitamin B) students can also recreate scientific applications of fluorescence sich as labeling of structures for better visualization. Due to the COVID pandemic, the first part of this project was published as a website. The project was then developed into educational kits to be used in the classroom.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 06/26/2024<br>\nModified by: Andreas&nbsp;U&nbsp;Velten</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1846884/1846884_10591796_1718658794420_HardwareSetup--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1846884/1846884_10591796_1718658794420_HardwareSetup--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Selective Sensing Setup\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1846884/1846884_10591796_1718658794420_HardwareSetup--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Selective Sensing Setup\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Experimental Hardware setup created for this project.
