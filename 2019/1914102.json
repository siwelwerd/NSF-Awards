 "awd_abstract_narration": "What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project redefines how Medicaid recipients access health care. Over 75 million low-income Americans receive health care coverage through Medicaid, but socioeconomic barriers intrinsic to this population make it difficult to navigate the system. Many face challenges including housing insecurity, food poverty, substance abuse and lack of support that further inhibit the ability to obtain basic health care. Without earlier interventions, the most vulnerable individuals are prone to rely on hospital emergency departments for care - a vicious cycle that is costly to health care organizations and patients alike. Increasingly, community-based organizations (CBOs) such as food pantries, mobile health clinics, resource centers and shelters have emerged as survival touch points. As non-profits with limited resources, however, CBOs lack infrastructure for recordkeeping and reporting. The proposed technology addresses the data management needs of CBOs through a free and configurable web-based application that builds longitudinal profiles on the clients served. In turn, this application creates value for health care organizations by alerting care management teams when respective members visit a CBO and establishes a channel for earlier as well as preventive forms of engagement. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed technology extends the reach of health care organizations into the communities where Medicaid members reside. This entails equipping CBOs with a free client management application that improves organizational bandwidth and access to funding through streamlined data reporting. On the back-end, a matching engine ingests member enrollment files from health care organizations and queries the CBO database for unique linkages. When matches are found, care management teams at health care organizations receive notifications on the status and location of difficult to reach as well as vulnerable members. Subsequently, they can communicate bidirectionally with CBO staff that directly serve Medicaid members and have stronger relationships. CBO staff are provided with guidance on best practices to engage their clients and effectively serve as extensions of the care team. With at least 400,000 CBOs across the country, this approach has the potential to activate a vast network of existing infrastructure and dramatically improve care coordination for those on Medicaid. During this proposal period, an end-to-end solution will be implemented that links Medicaid members to their respective health care organizations and transforms CBOs into technology-enabled gateways to health care. Furthermore, the feasibility of the proposed technology will be evaluated for Phase II considerations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project supported the development of a platform, bosWell, that improves the delivery of care to Medicaid recipients in community-based settings.  The core of bosWell is a two-sided market model that establishes channels between community-based organizations (CBOs) and Medicaid health systems.  CBOs, which comprise touch points including food pantries, mobile health clinics, shelters and resource centers utilize bosWell to streamline client management while building longitudinal profiles on the individuals served.  Subsequently, bosWell links individuals who have provided consent via CBOs to their respective health plans and providers. \n\nOver the duration of this SBIR Phase I project, it was demonstrated that bosWell is readily adopted at the CBO level, Medicaid members can be linked to their attributed health systems and the developed platform is a channel for engagement.  bosWell strengthens safety-net CBOs by improving operational efficiency and creates value for care management teams at health systems through a real-time dashboard that conveys information on the status as well as location of linked members.  The care management dashboard capabilities of bosWell enable health systems to reach unengaged members and offers the potential to reconnect these individuals to primary care.  In doing so, bosWell provides a mechanism to reduce missed opportunities for care coordination and avert costlier outcomes.  By the conclusion of Phase I, the commercial viability of bosWell was validated by health systems. \n\nUltimately, bosWell redefines the \"medical home\" and extends it from the four walls of the clinical setting to include CBO touch points that serve Medicaid members in the neighborhoods where they reside.  The emphasis is on identifying the needs of individuals at an earlier stage and enabling interventions that are proactive rather than reactive.  Furthermore, the incorporation of CBOs into the Medicaid value chain offers the potential for shared savings models conducive to value-based care.  Beyond Phase I, bosWell will be developed further to improve upon engagement strategies and leverage CBO data to prospectively identify Medicaid members with the greatest needs. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/13/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Aristotle M Mannan"
