This award is a QLCI Conceptualization Grant, which supports activities to build capacity among teams planning for the large-scale, interdisciplinary Challenge Institute projects that aim to advance the frontiers of quantum information science and engineering. Research at these Institutes will span the focus areas of quantum computation, quantum communication, quantum simulation, and/or quantum sensing. The Institutes are expected to foster multidisciplinary approaches to specific scientific, technological, and workforce development goals in these fields.\r\n\r\nThis Conceptualization Grant will develop well-formulated plans for a future Challenge Institute proposal along the themes of designing new materials for chiral qubits, single-photon emitters, and superconducting qubits.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This award has supported activities to advance interdisciplinary research, merging the areas of quantum communication networks, fundamental material science, and distributed engineering systems. Independently, the Stony Brook team developed and applied successfully for another NSF QLCI Conceptualization Grant, titled \"QLCI-CG: Center for Quantum-Engineered Distributed Computing and Communication Testbed\" (Led by Eden Figueroa, Stony Brook University). The merger of the two teams allowed us to tie to other quantum efforts in the state of New York to develop the quantum communication network. The concepts were developed in a series of four large meetings with representatives from the two Conceptualization Grant (CG) teams. First, in Stony Brook, in September 2019, where the merger was agreed upon. Second, in Buffalo, in October 2019, where a convergent scientific agenda was defined. A third meeting was held in New York City in January 2020, where the research packages were defined and invitations to other participants in the State of New York were agreed upon. Finally, the fourth Summer Quantum Summit virtual workshop was hosted by Stony Brook University in August 2021. As a result of these conversations, synergistic partnerships with faculty at the University of Rochester, City University of New York, and Cornell University were incorporated into the final QLCI concept. &nbsp;Regularly organized internal meetings among people from different departments at the University at Buffalo built collaborations in the field of quantum science.&nbsp;&nbsp;We also incorporated the Office of Industry and External Affairs from the Research Foundation for SUNY to form our planned Institute's Industry council. Multiple online meetings within the University at Buffalo campus and across the campuses in New York State results took place among several collaborative teams.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader impact:</strong>&nbsp;This program's result was the development and successful application for a national-scale pre-proposal \"QLCI-CI: New York Center for a Scalable Hybrid Quantum Internet\" with the core located in New York State, which was invited to submit a full proposal. The convergence of several disciplines (Electrical Engineering, Physics, Materials Science, and Computer Science) among multiple universities across the State of New York informed the research and broader outreach agenda. During the period of the QLCI-CG award and, primarily, as a result of this award program on Engineering Sciences MS: Quantum Science &amp; Nanotechnology is offered at the University at Buffalo. Most of the program's courses are offered by the PI/co-PIs/SIs of the QLCI-CG award.
