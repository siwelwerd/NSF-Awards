 "awd_abstract_narration": "A large proportion of married women suffer physical or sexual violence during their lives; in some less developed countries, the proportion may be as high as 50%. The drivers of domestic violence and pathways to change it is poorly understood. Income support programs targeted towards women have failed to decrease domestic violence and, in some cases, may have led to temporary increases in victimization. This suggests that interventions that increase women's income without addressing the underlying causes of domestic violence might increase violence. Understanding what drives spousal abuse and its complex relationship with income is essential for designing effective anti-violence interventions and to avoid backlash against victims; especially for poor women with limited means to escape violent relationships. This study uses field experimental methods to assess the relative importance of different motives for which husbands might use violence against their wives as well as the reasons why low-income husbands use more violence than high-income husbands. By providing an understanding of why and how domestic violence occurs, the results of this research will provide important inputs in designing policies to reduce domestic violence. The results of the research project could establish the US as the global leader in reducing domestic violence. \r\n\r\nThis research project develops and experimentally test a conceptual framework to study the mechanisms through which spousal disobedience and income might trigger episodes of domestic violence. As opposed to existing framework, we assume that husbands receive disutility from the use of violence. This research draws from economics, psychology, and sociology to show why husbands might use violence despite a preference aversion. This project creates random variation in the conditions under which husbands consider the use of violence. The key intellectual merit of the project is twofold: First, it assesses the relative importance of different motives for violence---idiosyncratic violence, reactive violence, and reaction violence. Second, it studies the role of certain triggers of violence such as consumption concerns, and social image concerns. This will allow researchers to design effective interventions to reduce domestic violence that directly target the motives and triggers that are found to be important in this setting. The results of this research contribute to the methodology of studying domestic violence as well as provide inputs into policies to reduce domestic violence both in the U.S. and globally. The results of the research project could establish the US as the global leader in reducing domestic violence.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Specifically, we examine the role played by the following two key factors in explaining this pattern: first, whether low-income men resort to violence to enhance their self-image or improve their reputation within their community; second, whether financial concerns play a role, specifically whether low-income men use violence to control behaviors that affect their financial gains from marriage or impose financial costs on them. We collect survey data and conduct a lab-in-the-field experiment to elicit gender norms and attitudes towards intimate partner violence (IPV). In our lab-in-the-field experiment, we present vignettes depicting a fictional married couple. The husband instructs his wife not to visit the neighbor's house, a potential social norm transgression. We elicit respondents' beliefs on how the husband would discipline his wife (perceived prevalence of violence) and society's expectations (perceived social acceptability of violence) in various situations. Building on data from the baseline data collection, we will design an education entertainment (edutainment) campaign and evaluate its effectiveness in changing attitudes towards IPV and/or reducing the incidence of IPV.</p>\n<p>Preliminary results from the baseline data collection show that 44% of women reported experiencing at least one episode of IPV in the previous six months: 37% reported psychological violence, 20% physical, 18% sexual, and 12% financial violence.

Key findings that emerge from the data are: i) top male earners have better mental health; ii) women married to men with higher respectability scores and women with higher soft-character scores (scores obtained based on responses to five close-ended questions), are significantly less likely to report incidents of IPV in the past 6 months; iii) women who adhere to more conservative gender norms are less likely to report incidents of psychological violence in the past 6 months; iv) women who live in lower-wealth households and those who report witnessing IPV against their mothers and mothers-in-law are more likely to have experienced IPV in the past 6 months.</p>\n<p>Initial findings from the lab-in-the-field experiment show that: i) women report higher levels of perceived prevalence and social acceptability of violence compared to men; ii) men believe that violence is more prevalent and socially acceptable when used to deter wives from transgressing social norms or when used due to loss of control; iii) men believe that violence is more socially acceptable when the transgression and the disciplining are visible to neighbors (public), compared to when they are private; iv) men with higher income report lower levels of perceived prevalence and social acceptability of violence.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/30/2023<br>\nModified by: Nina&nbsp;C&nbsp;Buchmann</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1919335/1919335_10641319_1703927029295_female_respondent_30122023--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1919335/1919335_10641319_1703927029295_female_respondent_30122023--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Female respondent survey\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1919335/1919335_10641319_1703927029295_female_respondent_30122023--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Female respondent survey\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Female enumerator surveying a female respondent</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Fahmida Nasrin</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nina&nbsp;C&nbsp;Buchmann\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Female respondent survey</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1919335/1919335_10641319_1703927228930_male_respondent_30122023--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1919335/1919335_10641319_1703927228930_male_respondent_30122023--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Male respondent survey\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1919335/1919335_10641319_1703927228930_male_respondent_30122023--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Male respondent survey\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Male enumerator surveying male respondent</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ashraful Islam</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nina&nbsp;C&nbsp;Buchmann\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Male respondent survey</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
