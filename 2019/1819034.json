 "awd_abstract_narration": "Global leadership in science and engineering is an important goal for the United States. To sustain such global leadership, the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM), through their Board on International Scientific Organizations works with the International Scientific Unions to oversee a network of US National Committees (USNCs) to facilitate US leadership, collaboration, and representation in international scientific organizations and institutions. The US National Commission on Mathematics Instruction (USNC/MI) is the US-based body of the International Commission on Mathematics Instruction (ICMI), a commission of the International Mathematical Union. This project will fund the continued operations of the USNC/MI to ensure the US remains engaged in important conversations about mathematics education across the lifespan across the world. \r\n\r\nThe USNC/MI will hold one face-to-face annual meeting and one virtual meeting of the USNC/MI and participate in the upcoming ICMI Studies. The USNC/MI chair also will attend the Conference Board of Mathematical Sciences meeting to keep US mathematics organizations abreast of international trends in mathematics education. USNC/MI staff will continue to facilitate international collaborations to support the improvement of mathematics education in the US and internationally.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe mission of the U.S. National Commission on Mathematics Instruction (USNC/MI) is to facilitate the U.S. participation in the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction (ICMI) activities and to engage the U.S. community in advancing mathematics education in the United States and throughout the world.  The USNC/MI identified the following three goals for a year grant: Goal 1) Representation - Leverage and promote the nation\u2019s strength in research in mathematics education on the international level; Goal 2) Learning and Collaboration - Develop and foster learning experiences for U.S. and international educators to share promising practices and develop ongoing collaboration opportunities; and Goal 3) Communication - Substantially increase USNC/MI communications and outreach to the U.S. scientific community. \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe primary activities pursued in this grant and their respective outcomes are:\n\n1) Participation in ICMI Studies.  This series of studies contribute to a better understanding of multidisciplinary and culturally diverse research and development in mathematics education.  Each Study focuses on a topic or issue of interest in mathematics education.  The last two studies (conference proceedings) are Study 24 and 25.  ICMI Study 24 addressed \"School Mathematics Curriculum Reforms: Challenges and Changes.\"  An American mathematics educator and researcher, Al Cuoco, was part of the study committee.  Similarly, ICMI Study 25 addresses \"Teachers of Mathematics Working and Learning in Collaborative Groups.\"  Hilda Borko from Stanford University and Despina Potari from Greece co-chaired this study.   \n\n2) U.S. representation at the ICMI Congress (ICME-14) and the General Assembly in 2020 and 2021.  The U.S. had a full delegation at the General Assembly held in Shanghai, China in July 2021 as a hybrid, which was well represented by U.S. participants, sessions, invited speakers, and educators at the Congress. \n\n3) Outreach and Dissemination.  The USNC/MI started a series of national and international Webinar Series, which are freely available and open to anyone.  Also, professional societies have included USNC/MI articles and announcements in their newsletters. \n\nBroader Impact\n\nThe USNC/MI takes advantage of the international awards and nominations to put forward American researchers and experts.  The USNC/MI leverage the international networks to advance its agenda and taps on newsletters and announcements to get the word out.  Social media and virtual tools enabled us to improve our outreach with activities like the Webinar Series. \n\nOverall, this grant facilitated and promoted U.S. mathematics education in the world and assisted in the professional development of U.S. mathematics educators through the activities planned and held by the USNC/MI.  The commission increased its impact by facilitating the production of material that can be easily accessible and used by others, such as videos, handout, slides, etc.  The USNC/MI has represented the United States mathematics education community at large in ICMI and brought ICMI news and opportunities to the U.S.  An evidence of success in improving the outreach is the fact that more Americans are now involved in ICMI initiatives such as ICMI Studies and Congresses.  In addition, the diversity of the USNC/MI membership is a role model for other USNCs. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/26/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ana M Ferreras"
