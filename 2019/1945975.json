 "awd_abstract_narration": "This EAGER proposal will obtain samples from newly identified gas and fluid plumes in Puget Sound to determine whether the plumes come from the Cascadia subduction zone megathrust. The idea is that deep regional faults act as pathways for upward migration of fluid that has been generated by heating along the plate interface between the North America and the incoming Juan de Fuca Plate. If the Puget Sound plumes have a subduction zone source, the plumes may provide a means to monitor the pressure and chemistry of the fluid between the plates, and provide a new approach for studying slip on the Cascadia subduction zone megathrust fault. This project is a first step toward developing predictive models for understanding seismic hazards in the heavily-populated Pacific Northwest.\r\n\r\nUpward migration of fluid and gas through the forearc crust that overlies active subduction zone faults has been observed in settings very similar to the Puget Sound region, including Japan Trench on the Kii peninsula, New Zealand at the Hikurangi margin, and on the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico. Although these fluid seeps emit fluid with helium, oxygen, hydrogen isotope signatures that unambiguously identify them as coming from the subduction zone fault, none of them emit fluid and gas with the vigor or wide spatial distribution observed within Puget Sound. Critically, none of the previous globally-identified forearc plumes are in subduction zones where periodic Episodic Tremor and Slip (ETS) events occur - that arise from periodic local slippage on the subduction zone fault. At Cascadia, these ETS events have a quasi-period of 14 months and variations in the amplitude and intervals are newly-recognized as potential precursors to both regional faulting and large episodic megathrust earthquakes. If the the new Puget plumes are found to be derived from the subduction zone megathrust zone, it would be the first step in using correlations between the variations in emissions and ETS behavior to understand slip on the megathrust.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nThis grant supported a pilot study into the recent discovery of methane gas bubble plumes located in the urban estuary of Puget Sound.  The initial unfunded discovery of the gas emissions used academic class day-cruises by University of Washington Oceanography undergraduate students.  These classes were for biology and physical oceanography topics and the RV CARSON sonar data was recorded but ignored by the classes.  Compilation and processing of the sonar from all 43 academic cruises showed clearly that vigorous methane vent fields were located directly  overlying the three regional fault zones that penetrate the western edge of the North American continent and the Cascadia Subduction Zone.  Previous studies have shown that variations in fluid flow moving along major active fault zones can be used to predict upcoming earthquakes. The most vigorous methane plume field that we discovered in this pilot study overlies the Seattle Fault Zone. This dangerous fault extends bemeath the city of Seattle and is considered by the U.S. Geological Survey as  a major urban seismic hazard.\n\nThis high-risk-potential-high-reward EAGER grant provided the essential data that (1) better defined methane venting in Puget Sound and (2)  was the basis of a successful follow-on proposal to the National Science Foundation  to understand active methane venting in Puget Sound.   Two field programs (RV THOMPSON and RV CARSON) have been carried out in the new post-EAGER grant period and both were extremely successful.  This initial EAGER grant satisfied the designed criteria of developing accidental discoveries into a scientific study and supporting clearly designed field programs to achieve the larger scientific goals that are in the public interest.  The raw data has been submitted to the federal archives, one paper has been published in the reviewed scientific literature and 8 University of Washington graduate and undergraduate students have participated in the field work and post-cruise data analyses.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/10/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Harlan P Johnson"
