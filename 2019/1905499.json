Early studies offered understanding of magnetism in simple metals -- iron, cobalt, and nickel. Currently, however, the state of knowledge and theoretical tools available to materials scientists affords insight into magnetic behavior of more complex intermetallic systems, consisting of two or more elements. This project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, will combine advanced theoretical methods with experimental studies of itinerant magnets. Chemical synthesis, applied pressure, and high magnetic fields will be used to trigger changes in magnetic behavior. A detailed analysis of the changes observed will establish how itinerant magnets respond to variations in their crystal and electronic structures. The outcome of these studies will be improved understanding of itinerant magnets for the design of advanced magnetic materials to be used in clean-energy technologies and other applications. The diversity of theoretical and experimental tools employed in this project will provide unique research training for graduate and undergraduate students, who will become proficient in solid state chemistry, materials synthesis and characterization, and quantum-chemical calculations. For broader outreach, the project PI will also organize nationwide undergraduate summer schools in magnetism and magnetic materials.\r\n\r\nPART II:  TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nItinerant magnetism has been a fascinating area of research in condensed-matter physics for many decades. Currently, however, such magnetic systems are receiving renewed attention from solid-state chemists, due to the broader availability of theoretical tools for investigation of electronic structure and improved insight into peculiarities of chemical bonding in the solid state. This project aims to uncover correlations between the nature of magnetic ordering and chemical bonding in itinerant magnets by exploring the interplay between the crystal and electronic structure and magnetic properties as a function of chemical substitution, applied pressure, or magnetic field.  One aspect of the project will focus on complex transition metal pnictides, with an emphasis on effects of pressure and light-induced excitations that may lead to drastic changes in metallic behavior.  The project will also investigate behavior of spin-frustrated systems with metallic or strongly covalent bonding. These studies target the next level of complexity in the spin-frustrated systems, where the addition of itinerant magnetic behavior can lead to the discovery of exotic spin textures and unconventional spin dynamics. The proposed research activities will provide versatile training to graduate and undergraduate students in materials synthesis, investigation of structural and magnetic properties, and studies of the electronic band structure. Undergraduate students and students from underrepresented groups will be involved in the project, both as researchers and through participation in national undergraduate summer schools in magnetism and magnetic materials organized by the PI.  This project is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

To achieve better understanding of correlations between the structure and properties of these materials, we have used diverse synthetic methods in conjunction with a variety of characterization techniques, including X-ray crystallography, magnetometry, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and neutron diffraction. In addition, theoretical methods were used to establish correlations between the electronic and crystal structures of solids and their magnetic behavior. We have demonstrated that the interplay between the crystal and electronic structure can be used to tune magnetic properties via judicious variation of chemical composition, as well as by application of applied pressure or magnetic field. Moreover, these developments have led us to propose novel approaches to generating magnetic structures with non-collinear arrangement of magnetic moments. Such materials can be very useful for the future quantum, sensing, and data storage technologies.</p>\n<p>We used a combination of X-ray and neutron scattering to detect an intermediate phase involved in martensitic phase transition between cubic and hexagonal polymorphs of MnSe. This transition is one of the most fundamental structural transformations in crystallography. The detection of the intermediate orthorhombic phase provides a rare experimental visualization of this transformation, which plays important role in a variety of physical disciplines.</p>\n<p>We also discovered an unusual reversal of magnetic ordering in La<sub>0.4</sub>Ce<sub>0.6</sub>Co<sub>2</sub>P<sub>2</sub>, where the initial ferromagnetic ordering that takes place below 225 K is lost as the temperature is lowered below 190 K. Such a behavior is rather unusual, because lowering the temperature typically makes magnetically ordered states more robust. By using a combination of various experimental techniques and theoretical studies, we have demonstrated that the loss of magnetic ordering was caused by a structural phase transition at 190 K. Thus, this study has provided yet another demonstration of the intimate relationship between the crystal and electronic structures of itinerant magnets and their magnetic properties.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Broader Impacts</span>.</strong>&nbsp;The project activities have provided research training and education to 1 postdoctoral scholar, 8 graduate students (3 of them have already defended the PhD dissertations), and 10 undergraduate students (5 of them females and 4 minority students).
