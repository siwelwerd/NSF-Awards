This meeting is designed to bring together scientists from around the world to present and discuss new research on diverse topics that promise to reveal insights into the function of mobile elements, also known as transposable elements.  Compared to previous meetings, which had a focus on mammalian mobile elements, this meeting will include presentations on organisms from many branches of the Tree of Life.  The meeting format will feature keynote lectures from leaders in the field, as well as a combination of talks and posters to promote scientific exchange in both formal and informal settings.   Early-career participants will benefit from engagement as speakers and poster presenters.  A special session in memory of Barbara McClintock will recognize the contribution of women to this field.   \r\n\r\nThe scientific focus of the meeting will be on topics that were chosen to highlight the importance of mobile elements in multiple biological functions.  Sessions will highlight: comparative genomics of transposable elements, mobile DNA defense and regulation, mobile DNA modulation of epigenetic and gene regulation, mechanisms of mobilization, mobile DNA and the environment, and population genomics of mobile DNA. The meeting will provide an excellent venue for graduate student and postdoctoral participants, including those from underrepresented groups, to share their research with researchers from the U.S. and abroad and to receive feedback on their work from experts in the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
