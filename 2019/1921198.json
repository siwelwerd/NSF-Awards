 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support US-based graduate student, postdoctoral and early career investigator attendance at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) meeting at Snowmass, CO on June 30 - July 5, 2019. The meeting focuses on RNA localization and local translation and is co-organized by Ruth Lehmann, Fulvia Bono, Simon Bullock and Antonella Riccio. The format of the meeting is a combination of 28 invited talks, 22 talks selected from submitted abstracts and several poster sessions. Three keynote lectures by leaders in the field of RNA structure and localization will be given throughout the meeting. There is a dedicated 2-hour session for trainees to interact with leading experts at the meeting and two different career-workshops will be held focusing on \"Big ideas for the RNA field\" and \"Entrepreneurial opportunities for RNA biology and therapeutics.\" This meeting affords many opportunities (both formal and informal) for sharing recent research findings and exploring collaborations. \r\n\r\nThis is a unique biannual meeting focusing on RNA localization and regulation that began in 1994. Recent advances on how the spatial and often developmentally-programmed localization of RNA impacts cell development and function will be highlighted in this conference. The session topics include RNA transport, translation control, RNA localization, developmental processes, RNA in disease, RNA processing and RNP structure. The conference primarily highlights unpublished research findings and provides many experiences for young researchers to learn about the field and devise future avenues for research. The meeting will bring together diverse scientists and encourage career development of a new generation of researchers, including those who are underrepresented in science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
