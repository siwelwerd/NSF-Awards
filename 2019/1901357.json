 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theory of Dynamical systems studies the long-term behavior of trajectories described by a certain iteration procedure, and the way this phase portrait depends on the parameters of the system. Very interesting fractal objects may appear as phase and parameter diagrams for such systems. The principal investigator focuses on complex low-dimensional dynamical systems described by simple quadratic equations in this project. Despite simplicity of the description, these systems are known to display complicated chaotic behavior serving as a good model for various phenomena that appear in celestial mechanics, fluid dynamics, biology, and other branches of natural science. The activity will result in deeper insights into small scale structure of dynamical systems, in training of highly qualified postdocs and graduate students  who will apply their skills in academia and industry, in broader interactions between experts in various branches of real and complex dynamics, in publishing a book that would help a broad student and research community to acquire background in the area, in promotion of communication in the field by organizing conferences and scientific programs, giving mini-courses, and  maintaining a dynamics web site: http//www.math.stonybrook/dynamics.\r\n\r\nIn this research a broad research program on several intertwined geometric themes of complex low-dimensional dynamics is investigated. The principal investigator will make a gradual transition from the one-dimensional to the two-dimensional world.  The principal investigator will pursue several one-dimensional projects unified by the idea of renormalization as a powerful tool of penetrating into small-scale structure of dynamical objects aimed towards complete their classification. They include the Pacman Renormalization Theory, scaling of Mandelbrot limbs, and a priori bounds for infinitely renormalizable quadratic polynomials.  The principal investigator will keep exploring the structure of the group of quasisymmetris for various classes of Julia sets and develop a new theory: the dynamics generated by Schwarz reflections in quadrature domains. In two complex dimensions, the principal investigator plans to keep working on the dynamics of dissipative complex Henon maps. Specific themes will include exploring the problem of existence of wandering domains, search for new examples of hyperbolic Henon maps, and description of their structure. The principal investigator also plans to finish the first two volumes of a book \"Conformal Geometry and Dynamics of Quadratic Polynomials\".\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
