 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I project will develop Virtual Reality (VR) based curriculum for first year university science courses. VR has the potential to create a step change in the way STEM education is taught and ultimately the way students learn. This project aims to build VR science curriculum to make science education more accessible, engaging and effective, and turn traditional STEM leavers into stayers which will positively impact STEM retention to meet the U.S. workforce demand. The VR science curriculum will be used alongside the existing curriculum at universities, with students participating in one 30-minute virtual lesson a week. The effect of these lessons on the students' performance will be measured to validate the ability of VR to positively impact learning outcomes. This project supports the NSF mission by progressing the science of education, by developing education tools using the scientific method, and measuring effectiveness. Moreover, the focus on improving university science education will improve the workforce pipeline, creating more and better prepared scientists. The products resulting from the proposed work will make science more accessible preparing today's students to be tomorrow's inventors, problem solvers and next great minds.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project is in the approach to developing VR curricula, and continually validating each curriculum by using data science to correlate student performance in the lesson to their performance in the classroom. Each lesson combines exposition, active learning, problem-based inquiry and assessment into self-contained modules which can be added to any existing curriculum. Student actions, and concept mastery are tracked within each lesson; ultimately, to correlate what the student is doing in a VR lesson to their learning outcome in real time. This enables the project team to validate which components of each lesson are working to improve student learning outcomes, and continually refine the VR pedagogy. This approach to developing each lesson and the cycle of refinement is the key innovation of the project team. The goal of the proposed research is to evaluate the magnitude of learning outcome improvement achieved when VR lessons are added to existing curricula, correlate the student actions in the VR lesson to their learning outcome as measured through in-class assessments, and evaluate perceived implementation hurdles for use of VR by instructors. This will be accomplished by integrating VR lessons in university curriculum and measuring the results against a control group. Instructor feedback will be gathered through a mixed methods study.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We believe this will revolutionize STEM education and positively impact a broad spectrum of education stakeholders; students, instructors, university departments and colleges.  The Sama VR Learning Platform is designed to develop, test and iterate an entirely new curriculum model designed specifically for immersive instruction, and to take advantage of artificial intelligence.

In order to positively impacting learning across the education ecosystem, Sama Learning has designed their solutions to be easily adopted across a wide spectrum of higher education institutions at a cost that can be easily absorbed by the school. \n\n VR represents an exceptional modality for collecting data on student experience and learning outcomes, in order to understand the foundational concepts of cognition, which enables Sama Learning to develop entirely new pedagogies in a data driven feedback loop, develop sequential learning algorithms which tailor the learning experience to individual students.  Evidence-based practices are at the center of the Sama Learning philosophy.  The volume and quality of data that virtual reality provides enables Sama to leverage a data-driven methodology to validate the effectiveness of the courses published using the Sama Learning content creation tools, rapidly scaling the content available to learners, and provide an ongoing iterative process for continuous improvement for each course and the underlying learning taxonomy.  \n\n            The ultimate objective of Phase I of the NSF SBIR was to validate our approach to VR-based lesson development, assess the level of learning outcome improvement, confirm our implementation strategy and validate our analytics approach of iterating on the content in an evidence-based framework\n\n The first phase of the project concluded successfully.  We were able to solidify the content development process and utilize that process to produce five lessons targeted at acknowledged pain points in the existing chemistry curriculum.

Student learning outcomes were measured at multiple Universities and demonstrated increased student success through the use of these tools.  This foundational research on the efficacy of the product is a primary enabler for the acquisition of new customers and the continued growth of the business.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/17/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Barbara Dehart"
