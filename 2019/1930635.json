The Doctoral Consortium provides a forum for mentoring and research collaborations with EDM participants. The doctoral students will be chosen through an application process. The selection committee will ensure that the selected students form a diverse group with respect to interests and with attention being paid for participation of underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThe Doctoral Consortium is a conference within the conference where each student is matched with a mentor. The students will share their research with their mentors, other experienced researchers, and other students as they pitch their research as a high-level overview. They will then get tailored advice and research contacts that will be valuable for their future.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
