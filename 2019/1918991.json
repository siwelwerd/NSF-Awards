 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation-Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to develop silicon-based rechargeable batteries that can charge fast and can maintain a charge longer. Such batteries will allow cell phones to be charged to their full capacity in 20 minutes, compared with current standards of 2 hours; and will extend usage time to 3 days, rather than 2, prior to needing recharging.  The ultrafast charging batteries and high energy batteries would impact other important products, ranging from cameras and laptops to drones, power tools, electric forklifts, military devices, and others.  Silicon-based high-energy batteries could reduce the cost and weight of the battery pack by 60% in electric vehicles. The scientific understanding derived from this project would enable translation of silicon-based battery technology into consumer electronics applications in the near term and electric vehicle applications in the longer term.\r\n \r\nThe proposed project employs a novel, simple and low cost manufacturing method that can synthesize a new type of Si-based anode powder that exhibits unusual properties with ultrafast charging capability, high specific capacity and long cycle life simultaneously. The objective of this research is to overcome technical challenges in translating this new half-cell technology into full cell rechargeable batteries with unprecedented ultrafast charging capability, high specific energy and long cycle life. Six research tasks will be performed to address the challenges of low Coulombic efficiency and irreversible Li loss in the first formation cycle of full cells, cathode material design, correct matching of anode and cathode capacities for high specific energy, proper selection of cutoff voltages of full cells to minimize capacity decay during cycles, and design of full cells capable of ultrafast charging without Li plating. Three-electrode pouch cell investigation and post-mortem analysis of full cells with different active material loadings per unit area and charge/discharge rates after different cycles will be conducted to develop fundamental understanding and provide guidance to address the aforementioned challenges and achieve the research objective.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
