 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biometrics are part of modern citizens' identity. Individuals' mobile devices collect facial, iris, fingerprint, and electrocardiogram data. Border checkpoints collect travelers' biometrics.  National identity cards use biometrics to identify individuals. In many applications, a large group of users' biometrics are stored together in a centralized database.  This type of widespread and expanding use of biometrics creates privacy concerns as biometrics are correlated to sensitive attributes such as race, gender, and disease risk factors. Protecting this data balances needs and citizens' privacy.  This project designs a new system that allows identification while retaining privacy of non-relevant individuals when querying centralized biometric databases.  The system design uses cryptography to provide rigorous security claims.\r\n\r\nSearchable encryption allows a database to process queries without knowing the underlying data.  Current biometrics are characterized by noise between repeated readings. This project designs two systems which both build on searchable encryption and noise tolerant cryptography.  The first system combines selective locality sensitive hashes and searchable encryption to retrieve records that match many locality sensitive hash outputs.  The second system builds a variant of inner-product encryption that retrieves only the set of close records.  The superior of the two designs will be implemented and benchmarked.  An important aspect of any searchable encryption design is its leakage profile.  As such, the implemented scheme's leakage is evaluated with respect to the known statistical properties of an identified biometric.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBiometric databases are a reality of modern life.  Many countries keep biometric databases of their citizens. Databases are also kept by private enterprises such as social media companies, stores for tracking shoplifters, and businesses for authenticating their employees.  Biometric data is sensitive for three reasons: 1) it can be linked to sensitive attributes such as gender and race, 2) it cannot be changed meaning that a compromise follows an individual through their life, and 3) it is used for both identification and authentication, meaning it must be kept secret for security.  \nThis project developed searchable encryption techniques appropriate for biometric data.  Searchable encryption allows an untrusted server to store data and answer queries on that data without learning about the stored data.  The design of searchable encryption is a balancing act between the intended functionality provided to the server and any unintended information that is made visible to the server.  In this project, the intended functionality is the ability to check if a candidate biometric is similar to any stored biometric in the database.  The server should learn nothing more than the answer to this question.  \nThis project developed three techniques for performing such search, based on inner-product encryption, based on locality sensitive hashing with Bloom filters, and with error correcting codes.  The construction based on inner-product encryption is the most mature.  This techniques reveals nothing to the server as long as at most one record is returned by the search.  This project tuned existing techniques in inner product encryption to be applicable for biometric data with a focus on the iris.  The iris is a frequently collected biometric.  A prototype implementation of the cryptographic schemes are open-sourced and available to the public.  These techniques have been tested and verified on real iris data.\nThe project additionally supported work on understanding the risks of biometric storage and cryptographic techniques for removing noise from biometrics.  This project showed that existing systems for converting biometrics to stored values can be reversed to form realistic images of the individuals biometric.  This project also developed new techniques for deriving stable keys from a noisy value.  \nThe project supported research activities of two graduate students at the University of Connecticut and three undergraduate students.  Four of the five students come from historically marginalized backgrounds.  For all students, this project provided their first exposure to research.  Multiple students published their first peer-reviewed research under this project.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/03/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Benjamin Fuller"
