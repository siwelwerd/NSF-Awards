 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that ultrasound is a life-saving technology.  Fifty percent of the world does not have access to ultrasound, a lifesaving tool, and yet there are more cell phones than toilets in the world, and mobile devices are multiplying faster than people. This concept leverages this trend of going mobile with a key technology to improve health outcomes for patients around the world.  This technology will be developed to reach the 50% of the world that still needs access to ultrasound imaging by increasing support and access to assistance with image interpretation. Clinicians in emerging economies are impeded by limited economic resources and lower levels of training that preclude the standard adoption of expensive traditional cart-based ultrasound imaging.  While improving maternal health is a key United Nations health objective and hence the first area of focus for this project, the ultimate goal is to be the number one mobile ultrasound in the world for healthcare professionals serving trauma/emergency care, women's health and family medicine patients.  \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project will focus on learning about pain points of using existing ultrasound technology and barriers to adoption.  Medical students, OBGYN, family and emergency physicians will provide data and observations about their use of cart-based ultrasound.  Interviewing end users and buyers of ultrasound technology will illuminate challenges with learning ultrasound, understanding diagnoses, and navigating software platforms.  Knowing these challenges that potential customers have, the team will further develop and fine-tune the handheld ultrasound software platform they have created.  The technology has an advanced user interface and display, the ability to gain insights about a patient?s medical images, and the ability to conduct real-time diagnoses.  The technical results on which the project is based on feedback from probe manufacturers, ultrasound technology specialists, and clinicians of varying skill levels.  In addition to interviewing users and experts, the team will also conduct in-depth observations of various types of ultrasound technology in use.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes\n\nThe goal of this project under the I-Corps Teams program was to apply the scientific method to determining the pain points that healthcare providers experience regarding utilizing ultrasound.  The goal was to learn how to perform the execute a rigorous plan of customer research focused on the commercial viability for an ultrasound platform for mobile devices.  The team participated in a cohort-style training program.  Customer research included developing hypotheses about customer segments for cell phone-based ultrasound usage, interviewing customers to understand the differences and pain points across segments and gaining knowledge of each of their requirements and preferences for imaging equipment and purchase processes.  Based on that information the team was able to disprove various hypotheses about potential user segments and develop value propositions for two specific customer segments that have common pain points that would drive them to adopt cell phone-based ultrasound. This customer research provided a real-world, hands-on and immersive learning opportunity on how to transfer (research) knowledge into real products and processes that benefit society.\n\nThe biggest outcome of the work was what the team learned.  The team learned, invalidated, and disproved a number of its initial hypotheses.  For example, the veterinary, urgent care, anesthesiology, and endocrinology segments have minimal need for handheld ultrasound, whereas emergency providers, OBGYN, and global health providers have a growing need for dependable portable ultrasound equipment that can provide quick answers to medical questions in the field, at the bedside, or in transit.  This learning allowed the team to abandon potential customer segments that had no pressing need for the envisioned technology early in the customer discovery process and instead allowed the team to focus more on a fitting customer segment and exploring this segment in depth.  The team also learned about pitfalls and challengers of current solutions and what providers need from a technical standpoint to fulfil their needs for portable imaging equipment.  As a result of the research on this project, the team has been involved in further research about the efficacy and impacts of using handheld ultrasound technology.  As a result of the research the team developed handheld ultrasound technology in a startup company for which FDA clearance has been obtained.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThe broader impact of this project is that the proposed cell-phone based ultrasound has the potential to save lives, especially when deployed at scale.  The team learned that in the pre-hospital setting, trauma patients can benefit from potential faster, more directed care when paramedics or emergency medical technicians have access to ultrasound as a diagnostic tool during transport of the patient to medical facilities. The team learned that handheld ultrasound technology can benefit women?s health providers during labor and delivery. The handheld ultrasound is especially promising under the scope of global health by providing answers to providers that can help shape the direction of further care.  The technology, when deployed at scale, could someday be a factor in reducing trauma-related deaths in the United States, could improve maternal health patient management during labor and delivery, and could in the global health setting improving patient outcomes. There could also be an opportunity to reduce the cost of healthcare incurred by delayed care due to limited access to ultrasound imaging.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/16/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anita I Bell"
