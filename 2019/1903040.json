  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis fellowship supported the PI, Philip Tosteson, as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Chicago where he was mentored by Benson Farb. With this support, the PI developed a mathematical research program, traveled and communicated with other researchers, and engaged in outreach for the general public.\n\n\nWith the help of this grant the PI published 5 papers, wrote 2 preprints, and developed several other projects. The main research contributions of the PI were the area of representation stability, in particular to the theory and applications of FSop modules. Broadly, representation stability is an area that incorporates both symmetry and asymptotic patterns. Given a sequence of symmetric mathematical objects X_1, X_2, X_3, ... we can often associate numerical statistics b_1, b_2, b_3, ... that capture part of the structure of the X_i. A typical question is: do the numbers b_N follow a uniform pattern, at least when N is large?\n\n\nAn FSop module is a mathematical structure, built from data involving linear algebra and the combinatorics of finite sets, which has proven useful for answering this sort of question. An important problem in representation stability is to understand the structure of FSop modules: can they be classified, or broken into atomic building blocks? The PI made significant progress in this direction, by classifying the possible behaviors that the sequence of representations underlying an FSop module can exhibit. The PI applied this theory to study the topology of certain moduli spaces that arise in algebraic geometry and mathematical physics.\n\n\n\nIn addition to carrying out research, the PI communicated these results to other mathematicians and promoted math to students. At University of Chicago, the PI interacted and collaborated with graduate students and postdocs in Farb's working group. The PI spoke at seminars and conference, giving virtual and in person talks about his research. The PI also participated in outreach through Math Circles of Chicago, with the goal of giving middle school students a chance to have a positive experience with math outside of the usual curriculum.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: PhilipTosteson\n"
