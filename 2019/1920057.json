 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Instrumentation Programs. Professor Banglin Chen from the University of Texas San Antonio and colleagues Michael Doyle and Zachary Tonzetich are acquiring a single crystal X-ray diffractometer equipped with a dual source of molybdenum and copper. In general, an X-ray diffractometer (XRD) allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles.  A diffractometer also provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here impact many areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate and graduate students in chemistry and biochemistry at this institution. The facility serves as a regional XRD resource benefitting students and faculty at Trinity University, St. Mary's University, and Incarnate Word University in San Antonio, as well as Texas Lutheran University, Texas A&M University-Kingsville, University of Texas at Rio Grande Valley, and Sul Ross State University in the greater South Texas region.\r\n\r\nThe award of this diffractometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It is especially useful for the characterization of synthetic crystal frameworks and during photophysical investigations of platinum(II) and iridium(III)-carbene complexes. The instrument also serves researchers developing and understanding homogeneous catalyst systems based on earth-abundant transition metals, and understanding the coordination geometries and chemical reactivities of model complexes of metalloproteins.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
