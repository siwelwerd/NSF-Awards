 "awd_abstract_narration": "This planning grant award will be used to study the feasibility of establishing a multi-university-industry Center for High-Assurance Secure Systems and Internet-of-Things (CHASSI) that will focus on areas where both security and high assurance are necessary to support operations of high mission criticality, due to safety or economic impact.  Examples include medical devices, manufacturing, the energy grid, real-time financial markets, construction, and defense.  Combining security and high-assurance is hard, however, intentionally combining them will lead to new models, techniques, designs, architectures, and systems that will be applicable across a range of important U.S. industries. \r\n\r\nCHASSI has five sites: University of Kansas, University of Minnesota, Syracuse University, Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), and Indiana University.  CHASSI research falls into four main thrusts: (1) Architectures, design and formal modeling for systems-level security, privacy, stability, and performance; (2) Secure communication, sensing, and devices; (3) Scalable trust and privacy; and (4) Human behavior for privacy and security.  CWRU brings expertise in industrial controls, Internet-of-Things (IoT), Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT), and manufacturing and energy applications. Complementary expertise at the other sites includes mission assurance and systems security, assurance of medical devices, networking, cyber-physical systems, mobile security, and human factors.\r\n\r\nCHASSI faculty members will gain an understanding of the specific interests and actual needs/barriers of industrial companies.  Likewise, companies will benefit from exposure to: cutting-edge university research across all sites; networking with and learning best practices from other industry colleagues in and out of their sector; students who may be potential hires; and faculty that might perform center projects or proprietary research.  During the planning period, CWRU will explore ways to advance diversity and outreach with the Women in Science and Engineering Roundtable (WISER) and Women in Technology initiatives through recruiting prospective students, educating current students, and identifying student researchers.\r\n\r\nThe collaborators from this multi-university-industry Center will host a single Center-wide repository at: http://chassi.ku.edu. This shared repository will include meeting materials, program information, publications, etc., and will be made available for a minimum of five years after the conclusion of the award or until the Center transitions to the next phase.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Examples include medical devices, manufacturing and production systems, electric energy systems, real-time financial markets, critical infrastructure, and defense. \n \nCHASSI would leverage the expertise of more than 40 cybersecurity and assurance faculty and hundreds of students across five university Sites: University of Kansas (KU, Lead), Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Indiana University (IU), Syracuse University (SU), and University of Minnesota (UMN).\n \nAll CHASSI Sites completed the IUCRC Bootcamp, mentoring sessions, and exceeded the required number of customer discovery interviews.  The CHASSI leadership team coordinated activities with weekly video conference calls, augmented with site-to-site and one-on-one meetings as needed.    Originally scheduled for May 21-22, 2020, our Planning Workshop was postponed due to regulations and complications arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.  On November 13, 2020, we held an Insights Discussion workshop via Zoom attended by about 60 participants representing 25 potential partner organizations.  A Zoom-based Planning Workshop held on April 29-30, 2021 was attended by more than 80 participants representing 30 different organizations.\n \nThe CHASSI team conducted over 160 customer discovery interviews.  We grouped 42 insights into 5 themes, and developed 30+ project ideas with Site faculty, all of which were presented and discussed at our Insights Discussion workshop.  Armed with feedback from potential partners,  we subsequently refined our research roadmap and  developed 10 integrated projects (many of which were multi-Site) that were presented at our 2-day Planning Workshop on April 29-30, 2021.\n \nBefore the Planning Workshop, participants received a packet with a one-slide ?quad chart? summary of each project.  During Day 1 of the meeting, pre-recorded videos were played followed by live Q&amp;A and participants using the Level of Interest and Feedback Evaluations (LIFE) forms to provide feedback on each potential project.  We also received substantial feedback within the LIFE system regarding the technical details and approach of the projects, all of which were addressed by the associated project faculty, and discussed in a lively fashion by the industry members on Day 2\n \nOverall, the presented portfolio garnered strong support from potential Industry Advisory Board (IAB) members, with a large majority of Very Interested (VI) and Interested (I) ratings across the board within the LIFE form system. \n \n\nAll five CHASSI Sites submitted Phase I proposals on June 9, 2021, which included 17 letters of commitment (only 15 were required) and a fully executed memorandum of understanding (MOU) among all the Sites.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/19/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kenneth Loparo"
