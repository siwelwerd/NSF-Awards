 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a four-day Conference in Discrete Geometry and Algebraic Combinatorics to be held from April 29 to May 2, 2019 in South Padre Island, TX. The conference, the 10th in a series, is devoted to a wide range of classical and modern problems in these active areas of mathematical research. The conferences bring together students and researchers in the region centered at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. Due to the diverse composition of the student body, conference organizers expect to be able to attract a sizable fraction of attendees from among groups traditionally underrepresented in U.S. mathematics studies. The grant provides travel support for graduate students and early-career researchers, as well as non-local participants without other sources of support. \r\n\r\nTopics to be discussed at the conference include packings, coverings, and tilings; rigidity and flexibility; geometric graph theory; topological combinatorics; incidence structures; lattices and discrete groups; geometric set partitioning and transversals; optimal configurations; spherical and Euclidean designs; semidefinite and linear programming in coding theory and discrete geometry.  More information is available at the conference website www.utrgv.edu/discgeo.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
