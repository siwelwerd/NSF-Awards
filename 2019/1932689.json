 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major goal of research funding is to support transformative science. A challenge to achieving this goal, however, is determining what kinds of research funding will lead to such transformations.  This work examines the extent to which funding acts to change the organizational context within which research takes place and how that stimulates transformative science.   The results of this work will help inform the practice of both science and innovation policy by building better understanding of such organizational factors as team size, composition, seniority and gender in stimulating innovation.  The resulting practical insights should help inform how to direct funding to support collaborative networks and support the careers of junior and female scientists.  Access will be available through both the Virtual Data Enclave at the Institute for Research on Innovation and Science and the Federal Statistical Research Data Centers; the work should act as magnet for junior researchers who are developing their career research agendas.\r\n\r\nThe analysis is made possible by a new longitudinal dataset containing information about research scientists, their organizations, their career trajectories and their productivity--particularly their patenting activity. A major innovation is a new method that measures transformativeness by capturing the degree to which new ideas in the patents make existing work obsolete. The combination of the new data and new methods are used to (1) describe the broader formal and informal context within which research takes place, (2) characterize transformational research, and (3) describe the link between the two.  The econometric approach makes use of two novel instruments - quasi-random variation in the geographic and organizational distribution of potential collaborators both within and outside of an institution - to control for potential selection and other confounding factors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "The work was the first to use a new dataset to show gender differences in scientific attribution.  Women in science are less likely than their male counterparts to receive authorship credit for the work they do, as documented in the work that was published in Nature.  The combination of aset of administrative data from universities that revealed exactly who was involved with and paid on various research projects were linked to authorship information on patents and articles published in scientific journals&mdash;to see which people who worked on individual projects received credit in the patents and journals and who did not.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results showed that women who worked on a research project were 13% less likely to be named as authors in related scientific articles compared to their male colleagues.  There is a clear gap between the rate at which women and men are named as coauthors on publications.  The gap is strong, persistent, and independent of the research field.\n\nAnd there was another, even larger, gap.  Women are not nearly as likely as men to be named on patents related to projects that they both worked on&mdash;leven controlling for all factors, the gap was 59%.\n\nThe administrative data that was key to this study came from the UMETRICS dataset available through the Institute for Research on Innovation and Science, which contained detailed information on sponsored research projects for 52 colleges and universities from 2013 to 2016. It included information on 128,859 people who worked on 9,778 research teams, including faculty members, graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, research staff and undergraduates.\n\nA complementary source of data for the study reinforced the results.  A survey of over 2,400 scientists revealed that women and other historically marginalized groups must often put in significantly more effort for their scientific contributions to be recognized.  Respondents to the survey noted that \"Being a woman [means] that quite often you contribute in one way or another to science but unless you shout or make a strong point, our contributions are often underestimated.\" Multiple respondents mentioned that lack of voice could disproportionately affect women, minorities, and foreign-born scientists.\n\nThe survey results showed that 43% of women said they had been excluded from a scientific paper to which they had contributed&mdash;compared to 38% of men. Women were also more likely than men to report that others underestimated their contributions and that they faced discrimination, stereotyping, and bias.\n\nThe new research goes beyond providing new insights into the causes of the long-observed gender gap in research output.  The work showcases a new and rich data infrastructure that can provide insights into the organization of science and could inform evidence-based policies to increase diversity in science.   The data and code are available at the Institute for Research on Innovation and Science at the University of Michigan so that other researchers can expand on the findings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Julia I Lane"
