 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project involves improving oil and gas sustainability.  To achieve that goal, we are proposing purifying produced water at the wellsite using waste natural gas to reduce disposal costs, carbon footprint and human induced seismicity from disposal wells. This process is enabled by patented equipment that fundamentally changes thermal distillation by performing the entire process inside a heat exchanger to reduce equipment and energy costs.   In Texas, using the amount of gas that is flared annually, the proposed X-VAPTM system can theoretically purify a significant percentage of U.S. produced water problem of 33 billion barrels in 2020.  The brine discharge from the purification process will be concentrated into specific densities to be recycled as a drilling fluid.  This new circular economy will provide environmental benefits by reducing the need for large diesel water trucks to move the source water, dispose the produced water and deliver heavy brine for drilling.  Society will benefit with a new renewable source of fresh water and reduce the need for oil and gas producers to compete with farmers and ranchers for increasingly scarce fresh water resources.\r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to prove the X-VAPTM thermal distillation system can fundamentally improve thermal distillation by reducing equipment costs and energy requirements.  Before this patented invention, the entire thermal distillation including the distillation and separation from contaminates has never been performed inside a heat exchanger. The unique design provides a removable spring water tray and distillation column to address maintenance issues including scaling in the field.  Our team of industry-experienced engineers will further test, improve and validate the existing thermal distillation prototype by performing prototype lab experiments and coordinated simulations to calibrate and improve equipment designs (Phase I).  These novel simulations will need to be calibrated against coordinated prototype laboratory tests to achieve a 90% agreement between simulations and laboratory tests.  This testing data and correlated simulations will be utilized to scale the prototype design to efficiently handle large volumes of produced water typically encountered at oil and gas well sites.  The proposed research and simulation testing will validate the patented system and create a proposed program for customer field testing prior to commercialization (Phase II).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProduced water disposal is increasingly becoming an industry issue because of the well-known economic, environmental and societal issues associated with current disposal options. Recycling produced water for frack water reuse is increasing but can only address a small portion of the total amount of the produced water created.  Meanwhile, the world is running out of natural fresh-water resources and most available technologies deployed to purify water to freshwater standards are expensive to build and operate.  Reverse osmosis desalination and traditional thermal distillation require expensive equipment and substantial amounts of energy.  There is a need to reduce equipment costs and operating costs including energy consumption when purifying produced water for freshwater reuse.\n\nA novel apparatus, method and system reduces the equipment and energy costs using thermal distillation.  The patented technology performs the entire thermal distillation process including distillation and separation inside a heat exchanger to significantly increase energy efficiency.  Standard industrial heat exchangers were internally modified to have a distillation column and alternative flow paths using baffles and tubing to distill and separate the purified water from the contaminates. Existing heat sources or waste energy such as, flare gas can be utilized to operate the modified heat exchangers without the need for additional equipment such as, flash chambers and separation devices.\n\nA small human-portable prototype with a maximum throughput of 50 barrels per day was tested on multiple samples including produced water.  This standalone piece of equipment was able to remove over 98 percent of the contaminates in a single passthrough of less than 10 seconds.  A high TDS sample was tested from Oman and reduced the TDS from over 150,000 TDS to less than 3,000 TDS making the treated produced water suitable for freshwater agricultural reuse.  Laboratory testing showed combining this novel equipment with pre-treatment systems such as, electrocoagulation will create pure brine that can concentrated to specific densities including 10-pound (10 lb./gallon) and then be reused as a high-quality drilling mud.  Heat energy at the wellsite can be recycled to make the process more efficient. \n\nKatz Water Technologies has received National Science Foundation (NSF) Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase 1 funding to commercialize this technology.  That funding paid for a field trial to advance the technology.  At the field trial, the prototype was able to remove over 99 percent of the TDS in the produced water with a single passthrough through only one-piece equipment and without any pretreatment at the wellsite.  Katz Water Technologies recently built a second prototype.  The prototype has significantly improved the energy efficiency, by over 18 times, over the first prototype while increasing volumetric flow rates to over 72 barrels per day.  Currently, the energy mass balance is 0.032 MMBTU per barrel processed with the second prototype  \n\n Katz Water Technologies is testing a third larger prototype with higher throughputs and is currently building a robust multi-unit skid system that can operated remotely at the wellsite for long periods of time and intend to have field test data later this year.         \n\nNatural gas, worth billions of dollars, is wasted by being flared annually.  This flared gas can be utilized to purify water using thermal distillation, vapor extraction, and condensation.  This unique onsite approach solves three pressing problems faced by the oil and gas industry.  These problems include gas flaring, produced water disposal and sourcing water for oilfield operations such as, hydraulic fracturing, drilling and water flooding. Multiple technical solutions to purify produced water using flare gas were addressed in designing and testing the equipment and proposed wellsite systems. \n\nRegulatory constraints regarding flare gas, water usage and water disposal are likely to increase requiring new technology to efficiently solve these issues.  This novel technology can address these regulatory concerns, significantly reduce produced water disposal costs and provide a renewable source of clean water from produced water.  The ultimate goal of this technology would be to utilize enough flare gas to turn the industry from a net consumer of fresh water to a net provider of fresh water to improve oil and gas production sustainability. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/31/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gary P Katz"
