 "awd_abstract_narration": "This funding is to support the Doctoral Consortium (DC) at the 18th Annual Interaction Design and Children conference (IDC 2019).  IDC is the premier international conference for researchers, educators, and practitioners to share the latest research findings, innovative methodologies, and new technologies in the areas of inclusive child-centered design, learning, and interaction.  Students in the DC will present their research questions, approach, and agenda, and receive feedback from faculty mentors and peers. The constructive feedback will enrich their research by enabling them to better articulate their research focus, and refine their research methods and approach. DC participants will also have the opportunity of sharing a poster of their research during the main portion of the conference, in order to give them further opportunities to present and refine their research and connect to a larger scholarly network. \r\n\r\nIDC will be held June 12-15 in Boise, Idaho.  This award will support 10 students' participation in the doctoral consortium and partially defray the costs of four senior mentors' participation.  The consortium organizers will broadly advertise the opportunity to participate among mailing lists related to children and technology design and among organizations that support groups traditionally underrepresented in computing.  Participants will be selected in a holistic process that includes their stage of the PhD, the quality of their research and the benefits they will receive from participating, and efforts to recruit from a diverse set of topics, methodologies, institutions, and intellectual backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
