The International Symposium on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust (HOST) is a leading forum for hardware security researchers. This travel grant enables student researchers to attend the symposium.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this proposed activity includes professional development for undergraduate and graduate students as well as continued growth of the symposium. Preparation has begun for HOST 2019 to be held in the Washington, DC Metro Area. This project provides opportunities for 50 students to receive travel support to attend HOST 2019. Their attendance enables them to learn about the latest tools, design methods, architectures, circuits, and novel applications of secure hardware. \r\n\r\nTechnical contributions from previous symposia have covered topics such as: (1) counterfeit detection and avoidance, (2) side channel analysis and fault analysis, (3) hardware architectures for cryptography, and (4) physically unclonable functions (PUFs). The travel grants would encourage more students to consider a technical submission, participation in hardware demonstration to a large diverse audience, or even to attend as a means to prepare for a technical submission in future years.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It is a week-long event with a three day technical program, tutorials, and associated workshops. The 2019 edition of HOST was held from May 6 to 10&nbsp;in the Great Washington DC area. It has attracted a record-breaking 367 registered attendees, including 120 students.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>HOST is also known as a student-friendly conference, where we provide students the opportunity to get feedback on their work, talk with senior researchers from government, industry, and academia, and be exposed to the latest research in hardware security.

The NSF student travel grant has been the major financial resource to allow us provide students free or discounted registration for HOST technical talks, free access to the tutorials, and free or discounted hotel accommodation.</p>\n<p>This year, HOST has awarded 53 students in the forms of free registration, free access to the tutorials, and 1-4 nights of free hotel rooms. A total of 69 room-nights were completed paid by HOST to accommodate 39 students (most rooms were shared by two students). In addition, 16 room-nights were partially covered by HOST.&nbsp;The entire amount of this NSF student travel grant was used to pay the hotel rooms.
