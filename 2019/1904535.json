 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemistry of Life Processes Program of the Chemistry Division, Professors Kyle M. Lancaster of the Cornell University and Arnold J. Bloom of the University of California Davis evaluate the role of differential metal binding, specifically magnesium versus manganese, on the mechanisms and bioenergetics of photorespiration in which Rubisco, the most prevalent protein on the planet, reacts with oxygen rather than with carbon dioxide. This collaboration between a bioinorganic spectroscopist and a plant physiologist seeks to provide new perspectives on the evolution of photosynthesis and the relationships between plant carbon and nitrogen balances under past, present, and future environmental conditions. Such information is critical for maintaining food quality and ensuring world food security in the coming decades. Professors Lancaster and Bloom disseminate this information through articles in the online Encyclopedia of Earth, workshops at scientific meetings, including some organized by Societies of scientists who are members of groups underrepresented in STEM careers, and by writing and keeping up-to-date printed and online textbooks used by students as well as by American and foreign professionals whose work is related to environmental change.   \r\n\r\nThe proposed research involves application of a broad range of spectroscopic, kinetics, and computational techniques to contrast protein structure and plant metabolism when manganese or magnesium binds to the enzymes that catalyze the first three chemical steps in the photorespiratory pathway. The Mn2+-bound forms of Rubisco, malic enzyme, and phosphoglycolate phosphatase are characterized by X-ray crystallography and by electron spin resonance, X-ray absorption, and magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy. Both isolated, intact chloroplasts as well as purified photorespiratory enzymes are studied. The work with isolated chloroplasts involves ratiometric dye measurements of magnesium and manganese concentrations, optode measurements of O2 and CO2 consumption, and mass spectrometric assessment of photorespiratory products. Work carried out on isolated enzymes involves measurement of electron transfer kinetics from manganese Rubisco during oxygenation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate as well as investigation of potential physiologically relevant electron transfer partners.   The research tests the hypothesis that photorespiration is not a wasteful process, but one that generates reductant to support the conversion of nitrate and sulfate into amino acids. Therefore, C3 carbon fixation may be much more energy efficient than previously assumed.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Rubisco from land plants has a metal binding site in its large subunit that associates with either magnesium or manganese but has a lower affinity for magnesium than for manganese. Each affinity is similar to the concentration of the metal in higher plant chloroplasts. Thus, rubisco in a plant associates almost equally with magnesium and manganese and rapidly exchanges one metal for the other.</p>\r\n<p>Rubisco catalyzes several competing chemical reactions. One reaction combines ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate with carbon dioxide to form two molecules of 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3PGA) that initiates C<sub>3</sub> carbon fixation, the foundation of primary productivity. In a second reaction, rubisco converts a small amount of RuBP into one molecule of pyruvate and one molecule of 3PGA or 2-phosphoglycolate (2PG). In a third reaction, rubisco facilitates the reaction of RuBP with oxygen to form one molecule of 3PGA and one molecule of 2PG, initiating photorespiration, a process generally considered to dissipate more than 25% of the energy in C<sub>3</sub> plants as waste heat. Photorespiration, however, enhances the conversion of nitrate into amino acids in plant shoots. Therefore, plant protein concentrations, growth, and yields begin to decrease when elevated carbon dioxide atmospheres inhibit photorespiration for periods longer than a few days.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Indent\">A handful of studies conducted more than four decades ago indicated that binding rubisco to magnesium instead of manganese accelerates the reaction of RuBP with carbon dioxide and inhibits the reaction of RuBP with oxygen but the rates of these reactions were highly variable. This project developed new methods to purify rubisco from six plant species gently and to conduct assessments of the reaction of the purified rubisco with carbon dioxide or oxygen that were accurate when either magnesium or manganese were present. The preference of rubisco for the reaction with carbon dioxide versus the one with oxygen increased when the purified enzymes were bound to magnesium rather than manganese (<strong>Fig.&nbsp;1</strong>). Rubisco from tobacco generated up to 14% of the RuBP into pyruvate when the enzyme was associated with manganese and bound to the ligand 6PG (<strong>Fig.&nbsp; 2</strong>). Malic enzyme from <em>Arabidopsis</em> plastids generated malate three times faster than when the enzyme was associated with manganese than magnesium (<strong>Fig.&nbsp; 3</strong>). These results are consistent with a previously unrecognized biochemical pathway in chloroplasts in which 6PG + O<sub>2</sub> &rarr; glycolate + malate (<strong>Fig. 4</strong>). This pathway has escaped detection because every <em>in vitro</em> experiment that examined C<sub>3</sub> carbon fixation and photorespiration during the past 40 years has removed manganese from the enzymes involved and replaced it with magnesium: the reactions in this pathway become prominent only when rubisco, malic enzyme, and phosphogluconate dehydrogenase are associated with manganese.</p>\r\n<p>The &ldquo;Bloom&rdquo; Pathway clarifies the relationships among photorespiration, shoot nitrate assimilation, malate valve, pentose phosphate shunt, and the Calvin, Benson, and Bassam cycle. It explains why leaves exposed to carbon dioxide enrichment accumulate less magnesium than manganese: such a shift in [magnesium/manganese] restores both the balance between carboxylation and oxygenation, the balance between C<sub>3</sub> assimilation and shoot nitrate assimilation, and promotes carbon to nitrogen homeostasis. Finally, it elucidates why C<sub>3</sub> plants that conduct a significant amount of photorespiration remain dominant in most terrestrial ecosystems.</p>\r\n<p>This award trained two graduate students, two postdocs, and two undergraduates.
