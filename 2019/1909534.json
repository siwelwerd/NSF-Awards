 "awd_abstract_narration": "The revolutionary discovery and multi-messenger follow-up of the first known merging binary neutron star (GW170817) has demonstrated the unique opportunities that observations and analysis of such mergers can provide.  A scientific collaboration between Rochester Institute of Technology and the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, will develop the research infrastructure needed to exploit gravitational wave (GW) observations and electromagnetic observations in order to determine the nature of dense matter.  The research team will develop a flexible procedure to self-consistently infer the nuclear equation of state (EOS) for neutron stars (NS), directly from multiple measurements of many NS, using GW measurements of mergers, X-ray observations of galactic NS, and light curves and spectra from the resulting kilonova explosion.  An EOS is an equation, like the ideal gas law of physics, which describes the state of matter under a given set of physical conditions.   Using the tools derived to understand the nuclear EOS, the investigators will determine if binary mergers are responsible for the observed r-process elemental abundances.  The rapid neutron-capture process (r-process) is a set of nuclear reactions by which many of the atomic elements heavier than iron are produced in astrophysical settings.  The project will include the training of young researchers as the first generation of truly multi-messenger astrophysicists, and the principal investigators will create new course materials for introductory general relativity, to educate the next generation of scientists in results from GW astronomy.  \r\n\r\nThe research program has two major goals: to constrain the nature of dense nuclear matter and to determine whether NS mergers alone explain the abundances of r-process elements.  The research team will create new high-precision surrogate models for kilonova light curves and spectra, calibrated to detailed radiative-transfer calculations. To draw inferences with data from multiple messengers and multiple objects, where each data source is connected to the EOS in a different way, the researchers will create a unified Bayesian inference engine, called Concordance.  This inference engine will constrain dense nuclear matter and the composition of the neutron star core. It will also infer the NS merger rate, ejecta mass, and ejecta composition, which will allow the scientists to predict the element-by-element r-process abundances in the present-day local universe due to the observed population of binary NS mergers. They will compare their prediction to observations; determine whether and what kind of missing population (like black hole (BH)-NS) would be required to reconcile observations with element abundances; and see whether that missing population is consistent with formation scenarios and observational constraints.  This project advances the goals of the NSF Windows on the Universe Big Idea.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nDecades of experimental work -- critically including the gravitational wave detector LIGO, with pioneering support provided by the National Science Foundation --have created a revolutionary new form of astronomy: simultaneously observing a phenomena with multiple \"messengers\",such as gravitational waves and light. The prototype for this new field remains the binary neutron star mergeridentified in Aug 17 2017. This merger was simultaneously identified by the gravitational waves emitted by the two neutronstars' final few orbits, along with a strong burst of high-energy light emitted promptly from the merger. However,over the following few days, some hot radioactive material ejected from the merger remained visible, a \"kilonova\".The properties of this light suggest this hot radioactive material includes the \"r-process\" elements like gold, whoseorigin remains a longstanding and critical astrophysical mystery, being seen in our own solar system and in distantstars in a distinctive pattern. The amount of material ejected, combined with howfrequently these mergers occur, suggest that these mergers could be responsible for all this material. \n\n\n\nThe amount of material ejected was closely entangled with another critical uncertainty: exactly what neutron stars are madeof, its ``equation of state\" (EOS). The equation of state determines for example how large a neutron star will be, at agiven mass. While the gravitational wave signal from this merger provided some information limitingthe EOS, complementing other information like direct mass/radius measurements enabled by other instruments (NICER), the EOS remainslargely unknown, with large qualitative uncertainties about its behavior.\n\n\n\nThis award supported the collaborative development and implementation of techniques to simultaneously disentangle these questions: theEOS, the light emitted from kilonova, and the origin of r-process elements in our solar system and elsewhere.  Weinvestigated new ways to limit the EOS, based on existing galactic observations of neutron stars,relic r-process elemental abundances, and multiple gravitational observations respectively. We investigated howreliably we could infer properties of merging neutron stars from their gravitational waves.  Finally, working closely withcolleagues from Los Alamos National Lab (LANL), we conducted extensive studies of the light emitted from kilonova, to assesshow well we understand it and conversely what we can reliably infer when we measure it. Notably, we generated severaltools which quickly interpolate between the detailed LANL kilonova simulations, providing detailed and very accuratepredictions for the light emitted in kilonovae.For all of these studies, we created and disseminated open-source software and released the raw simulations underlyingour kilonova models, enabling a wider community of researchers to benefitfrom our efforts.\n\n\n\nWhile multimessenger observations have opened a new frontier for observational astronomy, even ongoing large-scalesingle-messenger surveys are still turning up surprises, with kilonova transients are being increasingly found,including in somewhat unexpected places. New instruments like JWST are providing deep probes of their properties andcomposition, and our team has contributed to the interpretation of these observations.This award also helps prepare for interpreting multimessenger transients that could be identified during the LIGO O4 survey, which commences shortly after this award's period of performance.\n\n\n\nOur group has also worked hard to support STEM education in general and student training in multimessenger astrophysics specifically.For example, during most years supported by this award, our group has mentored one or more female high school students, who learn the basicsof multimessenger astrophysics and Bayesian inference.
