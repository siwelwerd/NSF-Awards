 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for students and early-career researchers to attend the 13th International Meeting on Light and Color in Nature.  This meeting brings together researchers working in the areas of atmospheric and environmental optics to share their findings and stimulate new areas of research.  Public engagement will include presentations at a local college and at Acadia National Park as part of a National Park Service public event.\r\n\r\nThe 13th International Meeting on Light and Color in Nature will take place in Bar Harbor, Maine in July, 2019.  Projected attendance for the meeting is 40-50 participants with a full slate of oral presentations on topics such as visibility, refraction effects, and colors created by absorption and scattering in water and air.  A planned outcome of the meeting is a special issue of the journal Applied Optics.  NSF funding is for airfare and lodging for 10 US participants, with priority given to students, underrepresented participants, and early-career scientists.  This award is being co-funded by the Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences and the Division of Electrical, Communications & Cyber Systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
