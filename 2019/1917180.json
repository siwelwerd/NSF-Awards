 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funding is provided to Battelle Memorial Institute to execute a workshop intended to assemble leaders of Environmental Research Infrastructures (ERIs) from six countries to explore common research interests and explore models to enhance collaborations that leverage each infrastructure's individual, and their combined research strengths. The sheer geographic breadth and the diverse research communities served by participating ERIs potentially add extensive societal benefits to this global scientific endeavor, supported by international data sharing.\r\n\r\nA workshop facilitating the identification of common research themes and the development of features and potential requirements for a potential governance structure that aligns with each ERI's national goals and engenders global perspectives and good practices for research infrastructures is funded. The workshop also promotes the building of lasting scientific collaborations that will catalyze actions addressing global research questions in environmental science and ecology. The activities proposed will initiate the creation of a platform that fosters wider community mobilization across international boundaries, thus having the potential for significant societal impacts. The organizers plan to engage 28-32 individuals from six ERIs and allow for remote participation, expanding the reach of the workshop. In summary, this workshop leverages NSF's investment in the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and provides a collaborative framework for US researchers to participate in this global conversation and potentially influence, and gain access to, a global ecological data set.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOver the past decade, large-scale Environmental Research Infrastructures (ERIs) have been designed, constructed around the world, and now they are in operations to address these challenges and to provide informed decision making tools in light of our changing world.  By design, ERIs capture ecological data over the continental scale and over decades, making them unique among individual research projects.  The coevolution of both ERIs (approach) and ecological sciences (theory) has developed into a new science discipline; macrosystems ecology.  Here, we brought together 6 ERIs from around the world (Global ERI = GERI), and: (i) developed a process to federate the ERIs globally (i.e., development roadmap and removed barriers); (ii) defined the steps needed to design and make an operational-ready Governance Structure (with Charter), Governing Principles (i.e., how we will make decisions), and an Organizational Chart; (iii) drafted a GERI Value proposition of \u2018How\u2019 we will realize a GERI, and \u2018What\u2019 are our offerings\u2019; (iv) drafted a GERI Vision Statement, and (v) developed a strong GERI science rationale that demonstrate the utility of a GERI to enable cross -continental/cross-country frontier ecological research (which will be submitted for publication).  This workshop advanced our ability to federate ERIs across continents, that in turn, enable new understandings and knowledge that otherwise would not be possible and meet the rubric of Transformative Science.  The 6 ERIs are; the US National Science Foundation-sponsored (NSF) National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON); European Commission-sponsored European Long Term Ecosystem, critical zone and socio-ecological systems Research Network (eLTER); European Commission-sponsored Integrated Carbon Observing System (ICOS); Australia\u2019s Department of Education, Skills, and Employment (NCRI)-sponsored Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN); the Chinese Academy of Science-sponsored (CAS) Chinese Ecosystem Research Network (CERN); and the South African National Research Foundation-sponsored (NRF) South Africa Ecological Observatory Network (SAEON).  The GERI is now ready for implementation and broader inclusion of other networks and infrastructure, with a Mission Statement of;\n\n\"We are site-based research infrastructures dedicated to better understand the function and change of indicator ecosystems (terrestrial, freshwater, coastal, indicator, representative, benchmark, tbd) across global biomes to support excellent science that can inform political and managerial decision-making addressing grand societal challenges\"\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts: The National Science Foundation (NSF) \u2018envisions a nation that capitalizes on new concepts in science and engineering and provides global leadership to advance research and education\u2019, and \u2018advance large science areas,\u2019 i.e., \u2018Big Science\u2019.  One of NSF's 10 \u2018Big Ideas\u2019 specifically calls for \u2018&hellip;establishment of observational research sites, observational platforms, or networks of sites to document key aspects coupled processes across terrestrial, marine, atmospheric and social systems.\u2019 and through large research infrastructures, e.g., the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON).  This workshop contributed directly towards NSF\u2019s; \u2018Harnessing the Data Revolution\u2019, \u2018Navigating the new Arctic\u2019, and \u2018Growing Convergence Research\u2019 rf. NSF 2026.

The GERI embraces diversity in gender, career stage, scientific discipline, and geographic and institutional distribution. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/28/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Hank W Loescher"
