 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of an X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT) instrument at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) to enable new fundamental research on next-generation manufactured components. Quality components that embody the latest advances in materials and manufacturing are essential to state- of-the-art products from aerospace to infrastructure and biomedical devices.  Researchers will use the XCT to develop new understanding of what causes flaws and voids in components--enabling the design of higher performing, more reliable products. This award directly benefits materials engineering research conducted by more than 100 faculty, staff researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students at UNL. More than a third of the students involved in this research are from underrepresented groups. The instrument will be placed in a facility that provides access to academic and industrial researchers across the Great Plains region. The XCT will catalyze new multidisciplinary research at UNL and beyond, strengthen UNL collaborations with partner minority-serving institutions, and stimulate interest among students from underrepresented groups to pursue graduate study and careers in engineering. \r\n\r\nTo understand, model, and exploit the promise of cutting-edge manufacturing processes, researchers need information on a component?s external and internal geometry, surface characteristics, and the presence of flaws, such as voids. The XCT is critical because it allows nondestructive analysis of the functional and safety-critical aspects of a sample. Researchers at UNL and its partners will use the XCT to provide fundamental insight into the 3D internal and external structure of a wide range of organic and inorganic materials from centimeter to micrometer scales. The information obtained from the XCT analysis will advance understanding of the process-structure relationship in several multi-disciplinary domains, including 1) additive manufacturing for which the process-material interactions during manufacturing are studied with respect to the quality of the final part, 2) material science for laser-engineered functionalized surfaces for which surface characteristics from laser-processing are quantified relative to their impact on phenomena such as hydrophobicity and anti-icing, and 3) materials for next-generation infrastructure for which structural components made from concrete and steel are studied with respect to their aging and sustainable manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

An XCT takes multiple X-ray images of a sample (object) from different angles and subsequently combines these images to create a 3D volumetric representation of a sample in a non-destructive manner. The XT H 225 ST XCT was purchased from Nikon Metrology and installed. Subsequently, appropriate training occurred for UNL staff. The instrument is located in the Nano-Engineering Research Core Facility (NERCF; http://nercf.unl.edu) at UNL and NERCF provides the overall management for the instrument. It is available to internal and external users and it is already proving itself to be an indispensable instrument for research in a broad variety of disciplines, ranging from materials science and manufacturing to paleontology. The figure shows an example regarding the capabilities of the instrument to identify porosity within a metal sample of Inconel, an important alloy especially within the aerospace industry, created by 3D printing. The sample was created using the laser powder bed fusion process which uses a laser to melt metal powder to achieve the final part. The printing process has several adjustable parameters including the laser power and the laser scan speed. The quality of the final part is a function of these parameters which are specific to the material and the sample geometry. The figure shows the power of the XCT to identify pores present within the sample and to identify the shape of each pore with very high resolution and in three dimensions. The pore shape provides insight to researchers about the type of defect which is connected to mechanisms of the build process. Thus, the XCT will serve as a critical inspection tool in order to create 3D printed components that meet the safety requirements necessary for a given application, whether it is connected with aerospace or biomedical engineering. The impact of the XCT has potential to be further amplified to the national level because it complements the existing equipment at the Nebraska Nanoscale Facility which is funded by an NSF National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure grant. In addition, as an educational institution, UNL and NERCF have a mission to educate scientists and engineers on the best and newest equipment possible. Thus, the XCT will be a critical tool for the training of students for such nondestructive measurements. XCT-focused modules will be developed to augment eight existing lab-based courses. The XCT, given its wide applicability, will catalyze new multidisciplinary research and strengthen ongoing collaborations with minority-serving institutions, such as Navajo Technical Univ., Tuskegee Univ., and the Univ. of Texas Rio Grande Valley. These relationships will be leveraged to recruit students from underrepresented sociocultural backgrounds for graduate studies. Workshops and classes are used to alert potential users to the capabilities of the XCT, including outreach to industry partners in the Great Plains region. This unique instrument will promote economic development of high technology businesses by helping them create quality products for their customers.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/23/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Joseph&nbsp;A&nbsp;Turner</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1920245/1920245_10636957_1642783916967_OutcomesFig--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1920245/1920245_10636957_1642783916967_OutcomesFig--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Pores revealed in metal 3D parts.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1920245/1920245_10636957_1642783916967_OutcomesFig--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Pores revealed in metal 3D parts.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The XCT reveals the nature of irregular shaped pores characteristic of lack-of-fusion  in a cone-shaped laser powder bed fusion part made of Inconel.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Prahalada Rao and collaborators</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Joseph&nbsp;A&nbsp;Turner</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Pores revealed in metal 3D parts.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
