 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded by the Major Research Instrumentation and Chemical Instrumentation programs. Professor Punit Kohli from Southern Illinois University Carbondale and colleagues Saikat Talapatra, Kyle Plunkett, Farhan Chowdhury and Senetta Bancroft are acquiring a multimode atomic force microscope (AFM). The microscope is a powerful tool for studying the surface of various materials.  It uses an atomic scale probe in which the pointed tip scans across a surface and measures the force between the probe and the surface.  This produces a high-resolution image of the surface with information on its structure and properties.  It leads to a basic understanding of complicated phenomenon that are in play at the atomic level.  Such knowledge is needed for understanding key physical properties of nanoscale materials and systems. An example of its use is in the synthesis of materials effective for treating contaminated water by photo catalytic methods to destroy organic contaminants such as dioxane or polyfluoroalkyl substances.  The instrument is employed by students in their research. It is used in classroom and laboratory instruction.  Therefore, the availability of this instrument significantly augments the learning experience of the students, faculty and staff not only at the SIUC campus but also beyond at other colleges and universities in the rural Southern Illinois region. \r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels.  The AFM is used to investigate the  mechanical properties at the nanoscale of organic, inorganic, and biological materials.  The fabrication and assembly of three dimensional (3D) architectural devices for electronics  and neuron circuits is being studied.  Strategic innovations in nanomaterials synthesis and design are under investigation for improving opto-electronics devices for energy storage and catalysis.  Materials for contaminant sequestration and bioremediation to improve water quality are also targeted. Another application addresses engineering a microenvironment for homogeneous epiblast stem cell renewal. The results have implications in multiple fields including cell mechanics, stem cell biology, and tissue engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
