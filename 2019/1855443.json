 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms-B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Lin Pu of the Department of Chemistry at University of Virginia is developing new molecular sensors for the recognition of chiral organic molecules.  These sensors can be used to facilitate high throughput screening of asymmetric reactions.  As these asymmetric reactions are widely used in fine chemical preparations such as pharmaceutical drugs and their intermediates, these sensors can increase the efficiency of their preparation and perhaps reduce cost.  In this project, students and other researchers receive education and training in diverse areas including organic, analytical, and materials chemistry.  The research team is also active in outreach activities to K-12 students in science and technology. \r\n\r\nThe molecular probes of high fluorine contents are being designed and synthesized for enantioselective fluorescent recognition.  These probes can form covalent bonds with the targeted chiral substrates and bring them into the fluorous phase for fluorescent detection.  When these materials are used to screen asymmetric reactions, their fluorescence responses toward the reaction products can be measured in the fluorous phase, and this may minimize the interference from other components in the reaction media since normal organic and inorganic materials cannot be dissolved in the fluorous phase.  In comparison to the traditional chromatography-based methods, this fluorescence measurement method may be much faster and more well suited to high throughput analysis.  This strategy could facilitate the discovery of chiral catalysts and reagents for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral compounds with diverse applications in areas such as biochemical, pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
