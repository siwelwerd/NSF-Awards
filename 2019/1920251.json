 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Saint Louis University to acquire a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM) to expand the research and educational capabilities of the basic science departments located on the Frost Campus. The most highly impacted departments include Biology, Chemistry, Psychology, and Biomedical and Civil Engineering. The instrument also services the LSCM needs of the Department of Mathematics and Natural Sciences at Harris Stowe State University. This instrument has impacts beyond the research laboratory and is used to prepare our future STEM workforce through the training of postdoctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate students in fluorescence microscopy, both in research labs and in classrooms. The instrument augments the research experiences of many local high school students, who gain experience with LSCM through various science apprenticeship programs that involve many of our campus researchers. The project also supports an initiative directed at inspiring local middle school students to pursue careers in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThe instrument is used in a variety of important research areas, including in studies of cardiac function with varying oxygen availability, the basic mechanisms of neuronal synapse formation, eye development, and of novel materials for growing cells in culture. It is being used to develop unique fluorescent compounds that can be used by many scientists to study basic cellular functions. Other biologists and bioengineers use the instrument to study bacteria in water treatment, and the basic mechanisms of cell signaling, gene expression, and tissue regeneration. The results of these research projects will be disseminated in peer-reviewed publications and at scientific meetings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It also provided access to students and researchers at Harris-Stowe State University, a historically-black college located across the street from Saint Louis University. The instrument is outfitted with diode lasers (405, 488, 522 and 645 nm), which allow for imaging of most fluorescent dyes with its two HyD and two PMT detectors. The instrument is equipped with an OkoLab stage incubator with variable and programmable CO2 (0-10%), O2, N2 and temperature controls (4-40 degrees Celsius) that can be used for a variety of cell and tissue culture-based studies under normoxic, hypoxic and hypercapnic conditions. During the funding period, nearly 2000 hours were logged on the instrument, mostly by graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. The instrument stimulated significant research activity and led to dozens of published manuscripts and conference presentations. Data generated from the instrument led to multiple successfully funded external grants. A diversity of research areas were moved forward, including work on G-protein coupled receptor localization, microfluidics devices, hydrogel research, mitotic spindle formation, retinal development, and the neurophysiology of anoxia tolerance. The instrument also provided STEAM outreach experiences to several dozen local school children from backgrounds typically underrepresented in STEM. We expect this instrument to continue serving the researchers on the north campus of Saint Louis University for years to come.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/20/2023<br>\nModified by: Daniel&nbsp;E&nbsp;Warren</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1920251/1920251_10636087_1703126692724_Confocal_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1920251/1920251_10636087_1703126692724_Confocal_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"The instrument\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1920251/1920251_10636087_1703126692724_Confocal_1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"The instrument\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A trainee learns to carry-out confocal microscopy.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Joey Bruns</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Daniel&nbsp;E&nbsp;Warren\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">The instrument</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1920251/1920251_10636087_1703126796617_Confocal_2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1920251/1920251_10636087_1703126796617_Confocal_2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Confocal microscope 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1920251/1920251_10636087_1703126796617_Confocal_2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Confocal microscope 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A trainee acquires images on the confocal microscope.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Joey Bruns</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Daniel&nbsp;E&nbsp;Warren\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Confocal microscope 2</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1920251/1920251_10636087_1703127015669_Confocal_3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1920251/1920251_10636087_1703127015669_Confocal_3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Sample confocal image\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1920251/1920251_10636087_1703127015669_Confocal_3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Sample confocal image\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Confocal image of a cell cluster generated with the instrument.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Joey Bruns</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Daniel&nbsp;E&nbsp;Warren\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Sample confocal image</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1920251/1920251_10636087_1703127105379_Stage_Incubator--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1920251/1920251_10636087_1703127105379_Stage_Incubator--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Stage incubator\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1920251/1920251_10636087_1703127105379_Stage_Incubator--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Stage incubator\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The instrument is outfitted with a temperature-controlled stage incubator for use in a variety of cell culture applications.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Joey Bruns</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Daniel&nbsp;E&nbsp;Warren\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Stage incubator</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
