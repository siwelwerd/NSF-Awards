 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the National Academy of Science to implement a Roundtable on Global Science Diplomacy to advance knowledge at the intersection of science and policy with the goal of sustained U.S. leadership in science diplomacy. Science diplomacy has emerged as a critical concept for discussions within the scientific and foreign policy communities. The United States has been a leader both at the governmental and non-governmental levels. In recent years, unfortunately, some efforts within the United States have decreased, especially with the decrease in activity and focus within the AAAS Center for Science Diplomacy. At a time when many national challenges are intrinsically linked to global developments, and global challenges require U.S. leadership science diplomacy, including accessing knowledge networks, is critical to achieving goals and in turn, preserving the welfare of the U.S. The Roundtable seeks to reinforce U.S. expertise and leadership in this space, promote young scientists and future generations to continue this important work, and ensure beneficial U.S. interaction with the growing number of science diplomacy networks.The Roundtable also provides an opportunity to investigate the role of funding agencies in science diplomacy especially as it relates to multilateral and global networks and how best to leverage and strengthen networks. It is also an opportunity for agencies to further their international reach, highlight their own innovative programs, and learn from other innovative initiatives around the world.\r\n\r\nRoundtable discussions will be structured to catalyze activities such as topical workshops within NASEM as well as activities, projects, and programs to be pursued by others. Workshop topics include a focus on next generation talent, involving NASEM's early-career STEM leader initiative, New Voices; regional opportunities within key countries as identified through discussions with the U.S. government;\r\nand assessing progress since the 1999 National Academies report on science in foreign policy to map future opportunities in this space.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
