 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Critical Zone, defined as the thin layer of Earth's surface between the top of vegetation and the bottom of groundwater, is the site of complex interactions among rock, soil, water, air, and living organisms.  These interactions provide societal benefits, including life-sustaining resources, primary among them food and water. Processes in the Critical Zone operate over wide range of time scales that depend, in part, on the composition of the underlying bedrock. Silicate minerals that break down slowly comprise much of the bedrock, but carbonate minerals in limestone tend to react quickly, commonly leaving large voids that facilitate the transfer of water through the Critical Zone. The current Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) network lacks a site that contains significant amounts of carbonate bedrock.  This Research Coordination Network will foster discussion among researchers about Critical Zones with elevated carbonate mineral contents, evaluate how properties and processes of carbonate-rich Critical Zones can be generalized to other lithologies, and integrate these findings with results from the CZO network.\r\n\r\nA principal goal of this project is to create a Research Coordination Network (RCN) in which researchers can evaluate Critical-Zone properties and processes that are endemic to Critical Zones in carbonate terrains.  A related and equally important goal is to integrate new findings with on-going research within the CZO network.  These goals will be achieved through four primary technical objectives: (1) compile available data and models stemming from current research ;(2) convene workshops, in the field and at major disciplinary conferences to explore new research directions; (3) build capacity in state- of-the-art techniques used to study carbonate Critical Zones;  (4) use data compilation, workshop participation, and training to advance knowledge of properties and processes in all Critical-Zone environments.  Outcomes of these objectives will include expanding knowledge of how relative amounts of carbonate and silicate minerals may cause different properties and processes in the Critical Zone between regions.  This Research Coordination Network will also develop human capital of Critical-Zone science by including underrepresented groups in all project activities and by research collaborations created during workshops.  Outcomes will be disseminated among the research community through workshop reports, a series of three peer-reviewed papers, and the project website.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It extends from the top of the canopy to its base at shallow depths in the Earth&rsquo;s crust, variously defined as being at the bottom of weathered bedrock or groundwater.&nbsp; Over the past couple decades, research has revealed information about physical and chemical processes in the critical zone regionally where it occurs in silicate rocks (Fig. 1A). &nbsp;Although similar research has been conducted by individuals and small groups in regions underlain by carbonate rocks (Fig. 1B), rarely has this research been conducted within the broad framework of the critical zone and little integration and synthesis has occurred across different carbonate regions. &nbsp;Similarly, little research evaluates characteristics and processes where the critical zone occurs in mixed silicate and carbonate rocks (Fig. 2).&nbsp; Consequently, this project focused on the critical zone in terrains underlain by carbonate rocks (i.e., the &ldquo;carbonate critical zone&rdquo;) with the goal of developing a network of researchers interested in processes and characteristics of the carbonate critical zone and to develop, integrate, and synthesize information about carbonate critical zone processes and characteristics.</p>\n<p>This goal was accomplished through hosting a series of workshops that led to a group of papers in preparation, submitted, and published in the peer reviewed literature.&nbsp; Three primary multi-day workshops hosted participants with training that ranged from undergraduate students to senior academic faculty and governmental employees, all of whom represent multiple disciplines including geology, biology, microbiology, geochemistry, and hydrology.&nbsp; The primary workshops occurred approximately every year and a half during this project.&nbsp; Smaller events were organized between the workshops, including a one-day field excursion for 22 undergraduate students to three culturally relevant caves in Las Cabachuelas Natural Reserve in Puerto Rico and a three-day training program for 10 undergraduate students to learn field sampling methods in the carbonate critical zone and ways to use the Python programing language to evaluate field data they collected.&nbsp;

That workshop, which was held intermittently over a period of two months bookended by two three-hour plenary sessions, hosted 77 participants.&nbsp; Participants were organized into seven groups based on themes related to distinct attributes of the carbonate critical zone.&nbsp; Participants met as breakout groups during the plenary sessions and during ad hoc sessions between the two plenary sessions to discuss research needs in carbonate critical zone processes.&nbsp; During the breakout session, participants identified 22 key research questions that naturally fell within four distinct topics.</p>\n<p>These four topics led to organized activities during the second workshop, which was held in person, and the development of three working groups populated by researchers with common interests.&nbsp; At the second workshop, working groups met during breakout sessions to discuss ways to address key research questions and to identify legacy data available for synthesis that could be used address these research questions.&nbsp; Between the second and third workshops, the working groups met regularly in virtual meetings and occasionally at national society meetings (e.g., Geological Society of America) to coordinate compilation of the legacy data and to initiate data synthesis.&nbsp; These activities were furthered at the third in-person workshop where the working groups also presented their findings to all participants to cross-fertilize the questions being addressed.&nbsp; Although this five-year project is now completed, the working groups continue to compile and synthesize legacy data with plans to publish their findings in the peer-reviewed literature.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual merit </strong>of this project includes new findings and syntheses about the carbonate critical zone.&nbsp; These findings include defining the concept of the carbonate critical zone and the carbonate-silicate critical zone spectrum.&nbsp; This concept demonstrates that the standard conveyor model for silicate critical zone evolution breaks down in carbonate dominated regions because of differences in weathering mechanisms of carbonate and silicate minerals (Fig. 1).&nbsp;
