 "awd_abstract_narration": "-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFunded by the EHR Core Research Program, this project addresses the need for the development of and research about a near real-time observation tool to improve mathematics classrooms. The observation tool will provide information about the kinds of student interactions in mathematics classrooms that are known to predict student outcomes. The level of detail obtained through the tool will be sufficient to capture different ways in which students participate, as well as produce data that teachers can use to inform and improve their teaching practices. Research on the use of this new tool will provide knowledge and build theory on how teachers' use of the feedback provided by this tool influences their practice, what student interactions in K-12 mathematics classrooms are occurring, and how the student interactions may connect to student outcomes. \r\n\r\nThe project focuses on producing data about the value and usefulness of the information provided by a near real-time observational tool that tracks student participation and teacher support of students' participation. The results will inform the potential next step of promoting large-scale use of the tool by teachers, principals, school district leaders, and researchers to inform and improve teacher learning, teaching practices, and student outcomes. Results from the project will: show how to feasibly produce near real-time information about classroom interaction; produce a tool that can support teachers, principals, district leaders, and researchers in efforts to improve teaching and learning; and provide specific evidence about how such an observational tool can influence teacher learning and practice. Student participation with others around mathematical ideas and students' perceived competence about their abilities are important for both immediate learning outcomes and long-term participation in mathematics. Although no single instrument can address all variables that influence learning and teaching, this tool will move the field forward by focusing on a bounded set of classroom interaction features that research shows are predictive of student outcomes for diverse schools and student populations. This project will provide professional development opportunities to graduate students, pre-service teachers, and in-service teachers in Southern California and results will be disseminated to educators and other researchers. The findings have the potential to support teachers' efforts to provide each student with equitable opportunities to participate and learn.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
