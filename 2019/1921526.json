 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will advance knowledge of the measurement of skin color in survey field research. Skin color is a frequently used measure of race and ethnicity. Interviewer-coded skin color is simple to collect in the field, but researchers use coarse and subjective categories. Handheld instruments for objective physical measurements of skin color have advantages of increased replicability and precision, but adoption in the social and behavioral sciences has been limited. This project will determine whether a new generation of portable devices for color measurement are practically feasible and scientifically sound for use in measuring human skin tone in large-scale field-based survey research. The investigators also will seek to better understand how physical measures of skin color compare to interviewer-coded skin color scales. Undergraduate and graduate students will be involved throughout the project. Results will be disseminated not only to other scholars and teachers, but also to policymakers, practitioners, and the broader public.\r\n\r\nThis research project will conduct the empirical and translational work necessary to bring tools for measurement of skin color into broad use in field settings in the social, behavioral, and economic sciences. Although handheld devices have been widely used in some fields of medicine and physical anthropology, there is varying standardization of measurement protocol and little adoption in other fields. This project will evaluate the reliability of handheld measurement devices and of self- and interviewer-rated categorical scales of skin color; establish their validity in relation to social, behavioral, and academic outcomes; and assess the feasibility of each approach. The study population will include individuals from a wide range of racial and ethnic backgrounds, drawing from a data collection site at one of the most diverse universities in the country. Specific guidance regarding methods of skin color measurement for field-based studies will be produced, along with cost information, technical recommendations, and template research protocols and budget sheets. By generating these resources, the project will improve both internal and external validity of skin color data, facilitating cross-sample and cross-cohort comparisons. The investigators will identify the strengths and limitations of conventional skin color rating scales that primarily assess a single dimension of lightness-to-darkness, providing evidence of the need to incorporate measures of undertones (such as redness and yellowness) to better align with contemporary multifaceted and fluid conceptions of race-ethnicity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
