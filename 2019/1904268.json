 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sediments and sedimentary rocks record how mountains are built, when climate changes, how sea level fluctuates, and the processes that erode, move, and deposit sediment.  This information can inform our understanding of modern Earth surface processes, natural hazards, and environmental systems crucial to sustainable food and water resources. A key location to study these processes is in the Peloritani Mountains, northeastern Sicily, where the mountains are going up rapidly as a result of large and frequent earthquakes. Hillslopes are prone to landslides during both earthquakes and violent storms, sending large amounts of sediment into the rivers. This sediment is transported downstream to a narrow, densely-populated coastal strip, where it spreads out forming a delta at sea level. This project documents episodes of sediment deposition in the deltas and uses computer models to decipher the causative processes. This research will better constrain how the Peloritani Mountain landscape responds to earthquakes, climate, landslides, flash floods, and sea level variability. Results from this work will help inform the local populace on geologic hazards in the region. The project provides support for graduate students, early career post-doctoral researchers, and educational outreach to underrepresented groups at the K-12 level.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on the construction of a source to sink landscape evolution model (LEM) informed by sediment yield and rock-magnetic cyclostratigraphic data to explore how quasi-periodic and stochastic tectonic forcings are encoded, shredded, propagated, and preserved in sedimentary archives. With a relatively small drainage area (< 500 km2), uniform bedrock, and a known history of climate and base level variation, the study area offers an unparalleled natural experiment that scales well to a LEM exploring the geomorphic and sedimentologic responses to tectonic forcings in a system with low source storage. The project tests hypotheses that changes in rates of rock uplift on short earthquake cycles to long secular uplift time scales (1) impact the response time and the autogenic periods of the system, lengthening both, (2) impact the grain size and sediment yield of the source independent of, and unique to, responses driven by periodic climate change, and (3) impart unique stratal onlap and offlap geometries, bed thickness, textural, and rock-magnetic variations in the sink, distinct from those imparted by periodic climatic forcing and quasi-periodic autogenic processes. The project incorporates a modeling strategy that merges Landlab in the source to Sedflux in the sink in order to predict unsteadiness in the source sediment flux and the resulting basin depositional architecture for a tightly linked source-to-sink system. LEM predictions are evaluated against lithostratigraphy, rock-magnetic cyclostratigraphy, terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide (TCN)-determined modern and paleo-erosion rates, and sediment accumulation rates in fan deltas determined by optical luminescence.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These sediment deposits hold clues to past environmental conditions. Motivated by sediment deposits in Utah and Sicily, Italy, this project took a multi-pronged approach to learning about how to decipher these sediment archives. One approach to understanding these deposits is to measure properties of different layers of sediment in field locations. Another approach is to use a computer model to understand how different environmental conditions may be interpreted from sediment deposits. Both approaches were used in this project. The Tulane University team led the computer modeling part of this study, in collaboration with researchers from two other universities who focused on interpreting the sediment deposits and landscapes in the two field areas.<br />Our aim with the computer modeling was to understand how landslide material moves through a river system to the river mouth and into the sediment archive. Geologically speaking, landslides happen in an instance. The side of a hill, or part of a mountain, slips into a river valley. The material from the landslide, known as the landslide deposit, is slowly eroded and moved downstream by the river (Figure 1). As the landslide deposit moves downstream, it gets smoothed out and reworked. In other words, some of the sediment moves faster and some moves slower. It may take days, years, or centuries for the landslide sediment to reach the river mouth, where it can be deposited into the sediment archive. Ultimately, we would like to know if periods of increased landsliding, due to tectonic or climatic conditions, can be identified in the sediment delivered from a river into a sediment deposit. This will help us identify time periods of increased and decreased landsliding in the past, which gives us more insight into past climatic conditions and potentially earthquake frequencies. This will also help us to understand how climate change could impact the infilling of reservoirs in some mountainous settings.<br />We used the open source Landlab Python Library to model a range of conditions that could occur naturally. For example, some models had very frequent landsliding (about every 10 years), while in others, landslides may occur about once every 10,000 years. We changed the shape and size of the river network that reworked the landslide deposits and delivered them to the sedimentary archive. We also changed the sediment properties of the landslide deposit (fine clay to large rocks). We chose these properties because we hypothesized they would impact whether landslide deposits arrived at the river mouth in one distinct pulse or got smoothed out through the river network. We ran hundreds of model scenarios. In all scenarios landslides occurred randomly. We could control how likely they were to occur but not exactly when or where they would happen. Figure 2A is an example of a modeled landscape and figure 2B is an example of how the sediment volume per time arriving at the river mouth changes over time. The spikes in Figure 2B are large volumes of sediment from landslide deposits that moved from somewhere in the river network to the river mouth.&nbsp;<br />We ran each scenario for millions of years so that we could develop statistically sound results. We analyzed the data by calculating the frequency of large pulses of sediment transported to the river mouth. We specifically were interested in finding whether these volumes passed with regularity or if they were random. If sediment pulses were random, we would not expect to find any decipherable record of environmental signals in the sediment archive. However, if different conditions created different frequencies of sediment delivery, then this may also be the case in real-world landscapes where we can perhaps find similar environmental signals in real sediment archives.<br />We find that there are interpretable patterns in the sediment volume passing through the river mouth. The details of these patterns vary systematically among our model scenarios. In landscapes with more frequent landsliding, smaller volumes of sediment move through the river mouth more frequently. In contrast, infrequent landslides result in infrequent but larger volumes of sediment moving through the river mouth. We also find that the size of the landscape impacts how strong the periodic signal is. All these results can be used to improve our understanding of real sediment archives.<br />In the final part of this project, we developed new software to track sediment properties (for example, size, color, or mineral content) as the sediment moves off a hillslope and through a river network. We are still in the process of testing the software capabilities. As soon as it is fully tested it will be made available through the open source Landlab Python Library.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/16/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Nicole&nbsp;Gasparini</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1904268/1904268_10611291_1692216370840_laurent_watershed_schematic--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1904268/1904268_10611291_1692216370840_laurent_watershed_schematic--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1904268/1904268_10611291_1692216370840_laurent_watershed_schematic--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Schematic of a river network with two landslides that have deposited sediment into the rivers.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Laurent Roberge</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nicole&nbsp;Gasparini</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1904268/1904268_10611291_1692216986084_landscape_timeseries--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1904268/1904268_10611291_1692216986084_landscape_timeseries--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1904268/1904268_10611291_1692216986084_landscape_timeseries--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A is a landscape from the computer model.
