Activities will include attendance in the conference sessions, presentation of a poster, and participation in (1) evening technical mini-lectures and (2) mini-workshop on career planning and development for young researchers. The mini-lectures will focus on emerging topics in the areas of phononics such as additive manufacturing, computational methods, and topological acoustics and its potential applications. The mini-workshop on career planning and development will help the graduate students to begin to shape their careers.\r\n\r\nThis project will facilitate the formation of a cohort of graduate students in the multidisciplinary field of acoustic metamaterials and phononic crystals. Furthermore, this project will prepare these students for the leadership in this emerging scientific and technological field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
