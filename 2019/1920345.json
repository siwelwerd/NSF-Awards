 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests acquisition of a swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging system and a deep learning workstation (DLW) at California State University, Chico (CSU, Chico). The proposed OCT imaging system and DLW will enable studies on the application of OCT imaging in dentistry to detect early carious lesions, micro-fractures, pulpal inflammation, early dysplastic changes in oral malignancies and signatures of other dental diseases. Acquisition of the OCT imaging system and DLW will significantly enhance current research programs and enable new research directions at CSU, Chico. These instruments will also support the established collaborative research with faculty at the Stony Brook University School of Dental Medicine. Approximately 500 students from the Departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science, and Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering and Sustainable Manufacturing will be among the major users of the OCT system and DLW and will be available for use by the broader CSU, Chico research community.  CSU, Chico is a minority-serving institution with a large proportion of students from underrepresented and underserved groups, including veterans, and Hispanics. This cutting-edge OCT system and DLW will provide these students with hands-on experience. The OCT system and DLW will be used to (1) increase involvement of undergraduate students in research, (2) promote active learning and skills development, (3) train upper-division undergraduate and graduate students on state-of-the-art imaging and algorithm development techniques, and (4) stimulate collaborations with faculty and students across CSU, Chico and from other institutions of higher learning.  \r\n \r\nThe proposed swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging system and deep learning workstation (DLW) will stimulate interdisciplinary research projects in healthcare and industrial nondestructive testing at CSU, Chico. OCT is a noninvasive optical imaging modality based on low-coherence interferometry that utilizes non-ionizing near-infrared laser to obtain images with 1-10 micrometer resolution. Currently, the major biomedical application of OCT is in ophthalmology. Many other applications of OCT are under investigation as researchers take advantage of the ability to rapidly acquire images noninvasively. Machine learning and deep learning techniques can be used to supplement the OCT images to more accurately identify diseased and damaged tissue. The following research projects at CSU, Chico will utilize the OCT imaging system and DLW: (1) the development of a deep learning model, namely convolutional neural networks (CNN), and quantitative analysis of OCT images for early dental caries detection; (2) the investigation of various deep learning optimization methods and their performances with OCT images to minimize back-propagating errors; (3) the development of signal and image processing algorithms to extract meaningful features from OCT data for image classification; (4) the design of compact and low-cost fiber optic based probe for noninvasive OCT imaging of occlusal caries; and (5) the use of deep learning to analyze and model non-speech sounds, such as music or industrial noise, as well as automatic analysis and classification of musical timbre. The OCT imaging system and DLW will help catalyze interdisciplinary efforts between engineering, science, and agriculture faculty, and develop an undergraduate and graduate research and teaching laboratory at CSU, Chico.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The OCT imaging system and DLW have supported the established collaborative research with faculty at the Stony Brook University School of Dental Medicine. Having an OCT imaging system and DLW at CSU Chico have allowed hands-on, high impact research in novel optical imaging and sensing systems, signal and image processing, machine learning and pattern recognition for broad applications in bioimaging, bioinstrumentation, healthcare, agriculture, physical science, and industrial inspection. In this project, a novel approach combining OCT imaging modality and deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models for the detection of early carious lesions was investigated. Signal and image processing algorithms were developed to process OCT images and extract meaningful features from OCT data for image classification and analysis.</p>\n<p>In this research, human tooth specimens provided by Stony Brook University School of Dental Medicine were imaged ex vivo using OCT imaging system, and an&nbsp;automated three-class grading system based on deep learning models for detection and classification of carious lesions was developed. Human extracted premolar and molar teeth were collected and categorized into three classes, Grade 0: healthy (non-carious teeth), Grade 1: early-stage caries (caries extending into enamel), and Grade 2: late-stage caries (caries extending into dentin). Advanced image processing and augmentation techniques were performed to prepare the image data and generate additional examples of each class prior to the deep learning process. For deep learning, ten deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) architectures were investigated to determine the optimal numbers of convolutional and fully connected layers for the classification tasks. The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated for detection and diagnostic performances of the CNN models. This study was a step forward in the development of automated deep learning/OCT imaging system for early dental caries diagnosis.</p>\n<p>In another study within the scope of this grant, after OCT data acquisition, data augmentation was performed to obtain a large amount of training data in order to effectively learn, where collection of such training data is often expensive and laborious. For the backpropagation process, seven optimization methods, namely Adadelta, AdaGrad, Adam, AdaMax, Nadam, RMSProp, and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) were investigated to improve the accuracy of a CNN classifier for diagnosing early dental caries. In this study, 75% of the data were utilized for training and 25% for testing. This study highlighted the performance of various optimization methods for deep CNN models with OCT images to detect early dental caries.</p>\n<p>In another study, the performances of various deep CNN models with transfer-learning and fine-tuning strategies were investigated for automated classification of OCT images. Collecting a large amount of OCT image data from dental samples can be difficult, and not providing sufficient data for CNN models can lead to overfitting. For these reasons, transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques were utilized in this study. Ex vivo human tooth specimens were imaged using OCT imaging system. OCT images of human extracted premolar and molar teeth were categorized into three classes: non-carious teeth (NC), non-carious cervical lesion (NCCL), and root caries (RC, caries extending into the root). Five deep CNN models, specifically, a basic CNN with three convolutional and max pooling layers, VGG16 (VGG: Visual Geometry Group at University of Oxford) and VGG19 transfer-learning models, and finely tuned VGG16 and VGG19 models were developed and evaluated for OCT image classification of carious lesions.</p>\n<p>The OCT imaging system and deep learning workstation have allowed students to (1) use high-tech, state-of-the-art equipment as a routine tool to investigate the suitability of optical imaging for various applications and to develop deep learning models for automatic image classification and recognition, (2) acquire specialized knowledge, and (3) work in interdisciplinary teams to solve complex scientific and engineering problems. OCT imaging system and DLW have been integrated into multiple courses such as Bioimaging Systems and Special Problems at CSU Chico, and have been utilized by undergraduate and graduate researchers working on senior capstone design and individual projects.
