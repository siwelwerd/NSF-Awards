 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plants - unlike animals- cannot escape when they find themselves in an inhospitable environment. Instead, plants cope by changing themselves, their final form or by delaying/accelerating the transition through phases in their lifecycle. Key to these coping strategies are small proteins that can move from one part of the plant to another, called florigen and antiflorigen. Florigen promotes more rapid development and flower formation, while antiflorigen has the opposite effect. The two regulators oppose each other and together act like a rheostat. What trajectory plants will eventually follow depends on the relative abundance of florigen to antiflorigen, which in turn is controlled by temperature, daylength and other cues. How does the balance of florigen and antiflorigen change plant form or the rate of its developmental transitions? Addressing this question has been hampered by technical challenges, florigen and antiflorigen can modulate accumulation of other key regulators; but, do not bind DNA to change transcription. The principal investigators have overcome these challenges and can now dissect where in the plant these developmental choice decisions are made, the precise processes put in place by antiflorigen and how it opposes florigen. Insights gained from these studies will be of broad general interest both by advancing understanding of the activity of these important regulators and by impacting agriculture. Traits modulated by florigen and antiflorigen in different crop species include such key agronomical traits such as tuberization, bulb formation, tree bud set and bud burst, seed dormancy, photoperiod-dependent flowering and flower architecture.\r\n\r\nThis project will leverage state-of the-art genetic, genomic, biochemical and cell biological approaches to provide mechanistic insight into the transcriptional pathways regulated by antiflorigen (TFL1), its repressive activity and the site of competitive action with florigen (FT). Specifically, imaging and genetic studies will probe whether FT, like TFL1, accumulates in and controls fate of axillary meristems. Standard and cell type specific RNAseq combined with network analyses will identify the pathways and the key components in each directly repressed by TFL1/FD. Finally, dual affinity purification combined with mass spectrometry (conducted in laboratory course) will uncover proteins that interact with and shape activity of the TFL1 complex. The combined activities will provide novel mechanistic insight into the question how key regulators of plant form and function execute their roles. The broader impacts, besides training of undergraduate students, graduate students and postdocs in independent research, will include mentoring of female scientists and training of 40 undergraduate students in research in laboratory courses. Students in two authentic research lab courses will conduct dual affinity purification combined with mass spectrometry, interpret the results and conduct follow-up experiments of their design. Finally, a lecture on research conducted in this proposal will be given to high school students during a summer research academy at Penn. Graduate students involved in the project will lead summer research academy lab sections, workshops and boot camps.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This developmental switch is tightly controlled by seasonal cues such as temperature and daylength. When the plant enters the reproductive phase of development, meristems - above-ground tissues that allow formation of new plant structures- &nbsp;change what types lateral organs they produce. Instead of leaves and branches they now make flowers. All lateral plant organs form at sites of local accumulation of a hormone called auxin. We showed that auxin not only activates transcription factors that promote flower formation but also represses the pluripotency gene SHOOTMERISTEMLESS by using epigenetic silencing mechanism. Indeed, a reduction in SHOOTMERISTEMLESS levels is required for initiating new plant organs such as flowers. We showed, moreover, that one transcription factor that promotes flower formation, LEAFY, can uniquely access closed chromatin region in the genome. This so-called pioneering activity allows the LEAFY transcription factor to unlock flower genes for activation precisely when the time is right for flower formation. Pioneering enables other transcriptional regulators to work together with LEAFY to promote flower formation. One of the transcriptional regulators that works together with LEAFY is FT. FT and a closely related protein called TFL1 oppose one another. &nbsp;TFL1 blocks and FT promotes the switch to flower production. We showed that the antagonism between TFL1 and FT is the result of competition for binding to regulatory regions of genes required for flower formation. When TFL1 is bound, it inhibits activation of the flower related genes; when FT is bound it activates them. This antagonism links flower formation to seasonal cues; while TFL1 is present in plants from a young age onwards, FT accumulates only when days become longer and temperatures warmer in the spring. Our combined work has shed light on a question important for plant fitness and agriculture ? how the transition to reproductive development and seed formation is tuned to the environment. More recently, we began to ask how the meristem itself is protected from the environmental signals that lead to flower formation. If this protection is not in place, the meristem becomes a flower and no new lateral organs can be produced. To execute the above studies, we developed a new method for analyzing large scale datasets that removes artifactual signals and yields more true positives. We also developed a method to visualize the activity of genes in the above-ground tissues that give rise to new organs. This allows us understand where and when they contribute to reproductive development. Both methods are of broad general interest to the scientific community.</p>\n<!-- @font-face \t{font-family:Courier; \tpanose-1:0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:auto; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:3 0 0 0 3 0;}@font-face \t{font-family:\"Cambria Math\"; \tpanose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:roman; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face \t{font-family:Calibri; \tpanose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:swiss; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-536859905 -1073732485 9 0 511 0;}p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal \t{mso-style-unhide:no; \tmso-style-qformat:yes; \tmso-style-parent:\"\"; \tmargin:0in; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:12.0pt; \tfont-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}span.apple-converted-space \t{mso-style-name:apple-converted-space; \tmso-style-unhide:no;}p.Normal1, li.Normal1, div.Normal1 \t{mso-style-name:Normal1; \tmso-style-unhide:no; \tmargin:0in; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:10.0pt; \tmso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt; \tfont-family:Courier; \tmso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";}.MsoChpDefault \t{mso-style-type:export-only; \tmso-default-props:yes; \tfont-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}div.WordSection1 \t{page:WordSection1;} --><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/04/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Doris&nbsp;Wagner</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
