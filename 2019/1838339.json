 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education Program: Education and Human Resources (IUSE: EHR), this project aims to serve the national interest by developing a validated assessment to improve the effectiveness of Student Assistants in introductory physics courses. Reforms in college-level introductory physics courses have promoted a shift from lecturing and factual recitation to interactive learning and conceptual understanding, which requires timely in-class guidance from an expanded teaching team. Many institutions use graduate or undergraduate Student Assistants (SAs) to assist the primary instructor. It is assumed that SAs contribute to improving student thinking and conceptual understanding, but there is limited evidence to support this assumption. In addition, if improvements do result, information about how the SA contributes to the improvement is also limited. One possibility is that asking good questions is important, since questioning is an effective instructional strategy used by instructors in an inquiry-based environment. This project will test the hypothesis that improving SAs' knowledge about questioning will improve their abilities to prompt student thinking and scaffold group interaction in inquiry-based classrooms. In this project, the researchers will develop both open-ended and multiple-choice versions of an instrument to assess SAs' knowledge of questioning. This important research is designed to contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the role that SAs' knowledge of questioning plays in college students' introductory physics learning. The products from this research will be made available to physics instructors across the country, and the instrument may be modified for use in other STEM disciplines. By monitoring the quality of SAs through the instrument, SAs can be better prepared to act as instructional leads in inquiry-based classrooms.  As a result, the project has the potential to enhance college-level physics and other STEM education throughout the United States.\r\n\r\nThe researchers hypothesize that SAs' Pedagogical Content Knowledge of Questioning (PCK-Q) is at the heart of SA effectiveness. This project will measure this effectiveness in three phases. In the first phase, the researchers will capture videos of SAs interacting with students during introductory physics classes. From the studying these videos, the researchers will create open-ended questions as the first version of the PCK-Q test. In the second phase, the researchers will use the responses from the first version of the PCK-Q test to develop and validate a multiple-choice version of the test. The process of developing and validating both versions of the PCK-Q test will yield qualitative data that contribute to the assessment and adjustment of SA training strategies. In the third phase of this project, the researchers will combine the data from the PCK-Q assessments and conceptual inventories of the students in their classes to build hierarchal linear models relating SAs' PCK-Q scores to improvements in their students' conceptual understanding. There will be two hierarchal linear models, one for students' conceptual understanding of physic concepts and one for student's conceptual thinking skills. The hierarchies of each level are at the student level (Level 1) and then at the class level (Level 2). This research project will benefit the field of undergraduate physics instruction by adding new insights into how SAs may best promote student learning in introductory physics classrooms. Potential long-term benefits include increased efficiency and lower costs of physics education, and adaptions for use in other STEM fields. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. This is an Engaged Student Learning proposal on the Exploration and Design Track. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Following Vygotsky&rsquo;s theory, learning involves students expanding their knowledge scheme into the zone of proximal development, where they cannot perform a task independently but with the support of more knowledgeable others (MKO). Teachers, as critical MKOs in class, play a pivotal role in facilitating this transition. Compared to direct instruction, teachers' support through questioning fosters student-paced exploration and maintains their agency in knowledge construction. However, questioning is challenging in large-enrollment college gateway courses, such as introductory physics. In response, Learning Assistants (LAs) were introduced to increase the teacher-student ratio, making timely support more practical.</p>\n<p>Research yields empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of LA programs in promoting students&rsquo; conceptual learning. However, it remains unclear which competencies of LAs specifically contribute to this promotion and the mechanisms through which they do so. Some conjectures suggest LAs use inquiry-oriented strategies like questioning in response to students&rsquo; struggles. Unfortunately, there is a scarcity of studies directly testing these conjectures. The challenges are two-fold. First, attention has been primarily cast on formats of questions, especially open-ended questions, that prompt student articulation. Limited attention is paid to content knowledge embedded in questioning and its impact on student learning, especially when teacher intervention is necessary. Consequently, novice teachers like LAs may develop a hands-off mindset of inquiry teaching that assumes students can achieve sophisticated learning merely by articulating their thoughts. Secondly, there is a lack of efficient instruments to measure LAs&rsquo; questioning competencies. Existing studies applying discourse analysis are typically conducted with limited scenarios, introducing potential bias in assessment because questioning is context contingent.</p>\n<p>In this project, we focused on one specific type of question, i.e., guiding questions, representing teachers&rsquo; intervention to student learning when it derails. Different from open-ended probing questions that gauge students&rsquo; understanding, guiding questions restrict students&rsquo; answer along a designated direction by referring to specific sources of information with guidance embedded in the answers. Guiding questions are typically in a chain that gradually directs students toward the learning objective. To ask effective guiding questions, LAs need Orientation toward questioning (O), content knowledge represented in a Curriculum (C), knowledge of Students&rsquo; strengths and difficulties in their understanding (S), and knowledge of Instructional strategies (I) to determine guiding questions that could bridge the gap in students&rsquo; understanding. Employing the theoretical framework of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), we referred to those four competencies as O-C-S-I.</p>\n<p>To assess LAs&rsquo; PCK in questioning (PCK-Q), we started by analyzing LAs&rsquo; questioning practices in their interaction with students captured by class videos. We segregated each video into vignettes regarding different learning objectives and developed codes for LAs&rsquo; utterances, such as probing question (pq) and guiding question (gq). The patterns of codes in a vignette determine the vignette level representing the method and impact of LAs&rsquo; intervention on students&rsquo; learning regarding the learning objective. For example, the pattern of &ldquo;pq(s)-gq(s)&rdquo; represents a vignette of effective intervention from LAs through guiding questions, labeled as &ldquo;Qa&rdquo;. The frequencies of vignette levels from multiple videos of an LA could indicate their PCK-Q. For instance, LAs with a strong questioning orientation may occasionally have direct-instruction vignettes, but their overall questioning vignettes (including Qa) should be more frequent across videos.</p>\n<p>Our video coding scheme enables objective assessment of questioning practices from multiple contexts. However, this method is time-consuming and unwieldy for large-scale analysis. We selected representative vignettes and converted them into written questions where LAs analyze students&rsquo; understanding from provided LA-student dialogues and determine appropriate responses. We developed rubrics to derive LAs&rsquo; O-C-S-I from their answers to these questions. We validated the free-response questions and established the connection between LAs&rsquo; PCK-Q measured by free-response questions and questioning practices captured by class videos. To further simplify written assessment, we converted free-response questions into Likert-scale ones that could be automatically graded. We applied common categories of answers to free-response questions as options for Likert-scale questions that represent different levels of PCK-Q. LAs&rsquo; preferences over these options, indicated by their ratings, suggest their PCK-Q. We preliminarily validated Likert-scale questions and suggested equations to quantify O-C-S-I from ratings.</p>\n<p>With these instruments we developed, we built models about how LAs&rsquo; PCK-Q contributed to students&rsquo; conceptual understanding and critical thinking. Meanwhile, we applied the procedure of instrument development in elementary science for preservice teachers (PSTs). We validated the elementary-science version of the instruments, compensated the limit of a small sample size of LAs with over 100 PSTs, and yielded similar findings between college LAs and elementary PSTs for cross-validation. Most importantly, we justified the feasibility of applying our procedure of instrument development in other STEM domains, providing valuable support for STEM education researchers and educators.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/24/2024<br>\nModified by: Jianlan&nbsp;Wang</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1838339/1838339_10617395_1706124314550_figure2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1838339/1838339_10617395_1706124314550_figure2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Potential impact of common teacher responses to student learning in a teaching vignette\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1838339/1838339_10617395_1706124314550_figure2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Potential impact of common teacher responses to student learning in a teaching vignette\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This image demonstrates how six categories (A-F) of common responses to students observed in this project could potentially impact student learning in a specific teaching vignette.
