 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to model, predict, and improve the mechanical performance of engineering materials such as polymers, composites, and alloys can have a significant impact on manufacturing, with important economic and societal benefits. As advanced computational algorithms and data science approaches become available, they can be harnessed to disrupt the current approaches to materials modeling, and allow for the design and discovery of new high-strength, high-performance materials for manufacturing. Bringing together multidisciplinary teams of researchers can maximize the impact of these new tools and techniques. This Harnessing the Data Revolution Institutes for Data-Intensive Research in Science and Engineering (HDR-I-DIRSE) award supports the conceptualization of an Institute to develop novel data science methods, address fundamental scientific questions of Materials Engineering and Manufacturing, and build such multidisciplinary teams. The project will apply novel data science methods to advance the analysis of large sets of structural data of composite materials and alloys from the atomic scale to correlate with and predict mechanical properties. The methods are based on machine learning techniques and uncertainty quantification, and will help uncover underlying structural features in the materials that determine the properties and performance. The methods and results will help accelerate the development of ultra-high strength and lightweight carbon-based composites for aerospace applications, and multi-element superalloys for more durable engine parts, by navigating in the large possible design space and providing faster predictions than experiments and traditional simulation methods. The project will also lead to new methods and computational algorithms that will become publicly available. The investigators will train graduate and undergraduate students from various disciplines with a focus on engaging women and minorities in STEM fields, develop short courses that integrate novel Materials Science and Engineering applications and Data Science methods, and foster vertical integration of interdisciplinary research from undergraduate students to senior scientists.\r\n\r\nThis project aims at building an effective and interpretable learning framework for materials data across scales to solve a major challenge in current data-driven materials design. The combined Materials Science and Data Science approaches will synergistically contribute to the development and use of interpretable and physics-informed data science methodologies to gain new understanding of mechanical properties of polymer composites and alloys, with the potential to be expanded into different property sets and different systems. The PIs will utilize available data efficiently through combination with physical rules and prior knowledge, to develop an interpretable augmented intelligent system to learn principles behind the association of input structures with material properties with uncertainty quantification. The interconnected tasks involve the (1) collection and curation of large amounts of computational and experimental data for polymer/carbon nanotube composites and alloys from open data sources and targeted calculations and experiments, (2) the development of geometric and topological methods incorporating physical principles to generate a better, more sensitive low-dimensional representation of the multidimensional data and characterize the parameter space related to mechanical properties, (3) the development of a Bayesian deep reinforcement learning framework to generate interpretable knowledge graphs that depict the relational knowledge among physical quantities with uncertainty quantification, and (4) the prediction of mechanical properties to reveal design principles to improve materials performance, evaluate and validate the methods, and develop software for dissemination. \r\n\r\nThis project is part of the National Science Foundation's Harnessing the Data Revolution (HDR) Big Idea activity and is co-funded by the Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Key outcomes include innovative data-driven causal discovery methods, enabling the deduction of constitutive laws for granular materials, including measures such as void ratio and fabric tensors. Within the context of Markov decision processes (MDPs) and partially observable MDPs, this project has introduced new theories and algorithms, facilitating sequential decision-making processes. Newly developed hierarchically structured graph neural networks with spatial information (HS-GNNs) allow more than 10 times faster mechanical property predictions than traditional molecular dynamics simulations, the identification of the role of defects and random 3D morphology, and high-throughput screening of 3D structures for enhanced mechanical properties. Advanced methods in Bayesian graphs and networks help to decipher relationships among physical variables to infer material laws and support designs. Notably, a significant outcome of this project is the establishment of new multidisciplinary collaborations and team efforts, involving approximately 20 participants with diverse expertise at the intersection of data science and materials science. This interdisciplinary collaboration spans research areas such as computer science, chemistry, materials science, statistics, applied math, and medicine, as evidenced by documented publications. The synergistic methods and tools developed throughout the project can be leveraged to further integrate data science and materials science methods. This integration holds the potential to accelerate the design of functional materials and composites in unconventional and innovative ways.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This interdisciplinary project has resulted in over 30 peer-reviewed publications in a wide range of venues, including top machine learning conferences and journals such as ICLR and Journal of Machine Learning Research, top Statistical journals such as JASA and Biometrika, journals in materials science, &nbsp;mechanical engineering, and general science journals.
