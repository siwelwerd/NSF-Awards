 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ocean oxygen loss (deoxygenation) is increasing due to climate warming.  This warming, together with nutrient loading, is causing many marine and freshwater systems to experience increasing episodes of hypoxia (low oxygen) of greater duration and intensity.  Impacts on fish and fisheries have been difficult to quantify; direct observation has been challenged by a lack of long-term exposure indicators.  This team has successfully refined the use of fish chemical biomarkers in fish otoliths (earstones) to directly assess lifetime hypoxia exposure in fishes.  This project will those findings to look for additional biomarkers and models, to expand our understanding of how hypoxia affects fish and their food webs, contaminant transfers, and ecosystem services including economic impacts. The project includes a unique way of training students in science communication, posing the question: What forms of media and \"messaging strategies\" about deoxygenation are most effective at raising public awareness and understanding?  Students are developing entries for PlanetForward's Storyfest, which is a contest to tell compelling stories to foster environmental understanding and solutions.  Students from historically underrepresented, economically disadvantaged backgrounds are particularly sought out to participate. The investigators will engage with regional, national, and international management agencies and other relevant stakeholder groups to share information.\r\n\r\nThis project encompasses a novel, linked set of interdisciplinary studies of food webs, and ecosystem services assessment.  The thematic questions explored in this project are: 1. How does hypoxia alter habitat use for fishes?  2. How does hypoxia-altered habitat use and habitat productivity change food webs? 3. How does hypoxia affect/enhance trophic transfer of methylmercury? 4. How do hypoxia-induced changes in food webs affect aquatic ecosystem services?  The set of linked studies will employ chemical analyses of otoliths and eye lenses, combined with chemical analyses of muscle tissues (Questions 1 and 3), physiologically-structured food web modeling informed by monitoring time-series (Questions 2 and 4), and a scoping workshop to address ecosystem services (Question 4).  The investigators are using a \"trans-basin\" comparative approach to system-specific responses, studying fishes in Lake Erie, the Baltic Sea, and a Gulf of Mexico estuary.  They study three species from each system that represent different degrees of benthic reliance, to discern differential responses to the increasingly hypoxic environment.  This research provides novel insight about variable biotic responses to oxygen loss and the impacts on ecosystem functioning.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nOxygen in the world's oceans is essential for organisms to breathe and function. However, declining oxygen can lead to stressful 'hypoxia' events when there is not enough oxygen for organisms to thrive or survive. The impacts of hypoxia can include physiological stress, changes to consumed prey, and even death. However, the impact of these hypoxia events may change depending on the species that are affected. This project used a unique combination of methods to determine what kind of impacts hypoxia has on three ecologically and economically important fish species in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico. We used the chemical signatures in parts of these fishes that naturally record environmental stress histories, such as the chemistry of their otoliths ('ear stones'), eye lenses, and other tissues. These chemical signatures provided individual records of hypoxia exposure and changes in their diets and physiological function. We found that the impacts of hypoxia were complex, and difference between individuals and between species. While some species showed impacts of hypoxia on their physiology, others appeared more resilient to stress. We also examined relationships between hypoxia exposure and the accumulation of pollutants such as mercury in fish tissues. The results show that hypoxia is one of many environmental factors that can influence how pollutants travel through marine food webs, and our results illustrate how different species can accumulate pollutants in unique ways.\r\n\n\nThis project supported a variety of outreach activities to educate stakeholders and the public about hypoxia and environmental stressors in coastal ecosystems. Results from this project were communicated through public lecture series at regional libraries as well as online platforms available to interested members of the public. Fish ear stone data were converted into 'songs' that demonstrate the unique life histories and stress patterns that individual fish can experience. This project supported the training of numerous graduate and undergraduate students who each increased their skills in cutting-edge methods, data analyses, and communication to audiences ranging from scientific specialists to interested members of the public.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/28/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: BenjaminDWalther\n"
