 "awd_abstract_narration": "Algorithms for unsupervised learning tasks are in constant use in science, engineering, medical research, etc. Progress in optimization procedures for these problems has therefore the potential for very wide adoption. One of the primary research topics of this award is unsupervised learning methods for determining causal effect in scenarios where one cannot, for practical or ethical reasons, perform controlled experiments. At present, the theory for deducing causal effects is somewhat brittle, since it relies upon unrealistic accuracy in the mathematical modeling, and, for large systems, upon unrealistic sample sizes. Scientists therefore do not have very reliable ways of advising the public about \"what-if\" scenarios. This research aims to provide, and characterize the performance of, causal-identification algorithms with the following goals: (a) Algorithms that work under weaker assumptions than current theory makes (in particular regarding the fidelity of the model to reality), yet deliver still-useful guarantees; (b) Algorithms that work under stronger structural assumptions than current theory makes and can use smaller sample sizes as a result. A related research topic concerns approximation algorithms, and inapproximability bounds, for optimization problems such as data clustering and learning of mixture models. The investigator will train students and postdocs in these and related areas of the theory of computation.\r\n\r\nCausal-inference problems will be addressed through the framework of directed probabilistic graphical models. Existing causal-identification algorithms operate with a naive parameter size because, for N-variate graphical models, the complexity parameter (and sample complexity) is exponential in N. By contrast all algorithmic methods for clustering, for learning mixtures of product distributions, or for topic models regard the dimension (i.e., the number of variables N) as a parameter that should not appear, or at worst appear poly-logarithmically, in the exponent. This project aims to provide algorithms with such complexity; however, this is not only an algorithmic question. The existing characterization of when causal identification is even possible is stated under the assumption that one has access to full knowledge of the joint distribution on the N variables. Therefore a related, statistical but not algorithmic goal is to obtain a characterization of graphical models in which causal inference is possible only from the joint distributions of sets of variables of size small relative to N. A candidate class of such models comes from mixture models, beginning with mixtures of products and extending to mixtures of Markov models. Another question concerns graphical models in which causal identification is not possible, yet the range of causal effects consistent with the data is small. In such cases, an algorithm which bounds the causal effect is an adequate replacement for full identification; providing such guarantees is another goal of this work. Finally, research will focus on clustering with squared Euclidean costs: both on the inapproximability threshold and in improving approximation factors through linear programming relaxations or other methods.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
