 "awd_abstract_narration": "This National Science Foundation award will fund 15 US students attending the 18th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC 2019), held in Auckland, New Zealand from October 26 to 30, 2019. ISWC is the premier international forum for state-of-the-art research on all aspects of the Semantic Web - the next generation World Wide Web. Student Fellowships will help cover the travel costs for US students, making it possible for them to attend the conference and discuss and disseminate their work. They will also provide an opportunity for them to interact with future national and international scientific collaborators.\r\n\r\nThe International Semantic Web Conference, which is now in its seventeenth year, is an interdisciplinary conference that includes work on Data Management, Natural Language Processing, Knowledge Representation, and Reasoning, Ontologies and Ontology Languages, Semantic Web Engineering, Linked Data, User Interfaces, and Applications. It regularly has several hundred attendees. In addition to the main technical tracks, the conference includes a variety of events that provide opportunities for more in-depth interaction amongst researchers at different institutions who are at various stages of their research careers, and researchers who are interested in many different aspects of Semantic Web Research. Students benefit from the Doctoral Consortium - a full day event where students can get critical, but encouraging, feedback on their work from senior members of the community. They also benefit from the career mentoring lunch, where experienced members of the community from both academia and industry answer questions in an informal setting. For further information see the conference web site at: http://iswc2019.semanticweb.org\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The students supported by the grant contributed various papers to the different tracks of the conferences and the workshops, thereby making ISWC 2019 a success.
