 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computer Systems Research (CSR) and the Networking Technology and Systems (NeTS) programs support a wide range of computer systems and network research, from small low-power embedded systems to large high-performance systems, from basic connectivity technologies to enable faster networking on both wired and wireless systems, from performance to availability, and from reliability to security. Nowadays, systems and networking research areas are often highly intertwined.  The purpose of the CSR and NeTS combined principal investigators meeting is to bring together researchers from both communities to exchange ideas and provide a platform for cross-fertilization of ideas.\r\n\r\nThe meeting is organized as a collection of keynote speeches, panel discussions, posters, and breakout sessions. Keynote presentations and panel discussions will offer visions for future research. Breakout sessions will focus on different subfields to identify challenges and solutions. Poster sessions will enable face-to-face discussion and promote interactions of researchers from the two communities. \r\n\r\nBy identifying major research challenges in systems and networking areas over the next decade, and their synergies, the meeting has the potential to have transformative impact on both the CSR and NeTS research communities. The organizers of the meeting plan to produce documents detailing the discussions on the research topics. The project will also provide a forum, both for learning and for disseminating ideas, for early career (aspiring) principal investigators, and those from diverse backgrounds and underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCSR and NeTS are two Core Programs within the Division of Computer and\n\nNetwork Systems (CNS) at the NSF.\n\n \n\nThe CSR Program within CNS broadly supports computer systems research,\n\nwith a focus on seamless integration with humans.  The charger ranges\n\nfrom small low-power embedded systems to large high-performance\n\nsystems.\n\n \n\nThe NeTS program supports networking research, specifically focusing\n\non the basic research for interconnecting and securing computer\n\nsystems.  The charter includes basic connectivity technologies to\n\nenable faster networking on both wired and wireless systems, ensuring\n\navailability under attack or failure to management of large and small\n\nnetworked systems.\n\n \n\nThe award funded a joint CSR and NeTS PI meeting in Washington,\n\nD.C. on November 4th and 5th, 2019, bringing together researchers from\n\nboth the NeTS and CSR communities.  The research in these areas are\n\ninter-related, and the interaction between PIs from these two programs\n\nproduced an exchange of ideas that, we believe, was beneficial to\n\nboth.\n\n \n\nThe broad theme of the meeting was ``Convergence'', both in\n\nNeTS and CSR research and with the broader CS community.  The\n\nobjective of the workshop was to provide input to NSF and the broader\n\ncommunity on two basic questions:\n\n \n\n- Focusing on integrating CSR, NeTS and broader Computer Science\n\n  research, what are the most important challenges facing the CSR and\n\n  NeTS communities over the next decade?\n\n  \n\n- What are the areas where researchers from Computer Systems and from\n\n  Networking best collaborate with each other and the broader research\n\n  community to exploit synergies in tackling these challenges?\n\n  \n\nThe attending PIs collaborated to produce a report, that\n\nincludes potential new research directions, that has been submitted to\n\nNSF.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/10/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Samrat Bhattacharjee"
