 "awd_abstract_narration": "Azinomycins are natural products from microbes that target DNA (the genetic basis of all life) and have demonstrated anti-tumor and anti-bacterial activities. The National Science Foundation, Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Coran M. H. Watanabe from Texas A&M University to determine how nature constructs the azinomycins. These studies characterize the functions and structures of the proteins that catalyze the unique biochemical steps involved in generating the chemical features of the azinomycins that are important for their biological activity. The knowledge gained from this research paves the way for future engineering of genes to synthesize azinomycins within a tumor cell to treat cancer.  This project enables graduate and undergraduate students, and postdoctoral trainees to develop broad skills in chemical biology and biotechnology.  Moreover, this research is integrated into a class that teaches how bioactive agents are derived from the environment. Students in this class collect soil samples, which are then assayed for natural products that show antibiotic activity.  In addition, local elementary, middle, and high school students learn about natural products and microbes in their lives through tailored lectures, demonstrations, and laboratory experiences.  Finally, as opportunities arise, Dr. Watanabe participates in events such as the American Cancer Society Relay for Life Events to inform the general public about cancer research and the daily work-related activities of a research active faculty member.    \r\n\r\nThe azinomycins are architecturally fascinating natural products. The natural product is densely functionalized with a naphtoate, epoxide, enol, and azabicyclic ring system.  The basic skeletal framework of the molecule is generated through a polyketide synthase/nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS/NRPS) pathway, while the aziridino[1,2-a]pyrollidine moiety is alkaloid derived.  From an enzymological perspective, this natural product represents a treasure trove of unusual biosynthetic transformations to be mined and paves the way for chemoenzymatic/synthetic biology efforts.  The goals of this project are to functionally reconstitute and characterize enzymes of the azinomycin biosynthetic pathway, and begin to develop ways to manipulate the pathway. The objectives towards these goals include 1) characterizing the enzymatic mechanism for biosynthesis of the naphthoate moiety of the azinomycins and analyze the structure-activity relationships of structurally and functionally related analogs of this mioety, 2) exploring the chemistry of the epoxide unit, and 3) functionally characterizing the enzymes for the biosynthesis of the azabicycle moiety.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These studies not only shed light on the unusual biochemical mechanisms involved in generating key structural features of the azinomycins, important for their biological activity but also served as a critical component in paving the way for future engineering of the pathway genes for therapeutic purposes.

Moreover, this research is integrated into the classroom where students learn that bioactive agents are often derived from the environment by carrying out their own field collection of soil samples, which are assayed for natural products with antibiotic activity.\n\n \nBroader Impacts \n\nOrganic Chemistry (BIO), a second-semester organic course for the life sciences student was taught.  Game/problem sessions were held outside of class time (successful with up to 200 students) until COVID shut us down.  The course was subsequently adapted to an online format, making use of Zoom and a SurfacePro.  A lecture on the organic chemistry of DNA modifying agents was given including a discussion of the azinomycins; DNA serves as the genetic basis of all life.  As azinomycin is produced by a soil bacterium, the PI additionally gave a lecture on azinomycin biosynthesis, correlating reactions in nature (those observed within the producing organism) with organic reactions.
