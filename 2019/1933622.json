 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Abstract: The millions of atmospheres of pressure that can now be produced in the laboratory can impart profound effects on atoms and molecules, molding matter to make new materials with unprecedented properties. Conventional understanding fails to predict such effects, beginning with hydrogen, the first element in the Periodic Table, and extending to other \"simple\" elements. This project explores this new world of materials when compressed up to five million atmospheres (5 megabars or 500 gigapascals). A key property to be explored is superconductivity - the ability of a material to conduct electricity without resistance - at very high temperatures, including possibly room temperature and above. Advanced experimental techniques to study materials to very high pressures while at variable temperatures are employed to synthesize and characterize these materials, and theoretical and computational methods are used to interpret the results as well as to predict new materials and their properties to guide syntheses. The results have implications for fields beyond condensed-matter physics, including chemistry, advanced technology, planetary science, and astrophysics. An important goal is education and training of graduate students and undergraduates in the field. There is also a component that impacts locally STEM education and the public understanding of science.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract: Pressure is not a simple thermodynamic parameter but an effective tool for the creation of exotic materials and phenomena not accessible at ambient conditions. Materials subjected to pressures up to several hundred gigapascals exhibit unexpected properties, including very high-temperature superconductivity, counterintuitive bonding patterns and electronic topological states, entirely new crystal structures, and potentially new physics. Investigations of materials at these conditions thus test both the limits of experimental techniques as well as fundamental theory. Addressing these questions in \"simple\" elemental and molecular systems at ultrahigh pressures, the project is divided into the following tasks: 1. Very High Tc Superconductivity; 2. Metallization and Novel Transitions in Dense Hydrogen; 3. High-Pressure Electrides;  4. Novel Interfacial Phenomena at Megabar Pressures; 5. Unconventional and Exotic Compounds; and 6. Methods and Technique Development.  Each of the tasks involve tightly integrated experiment and computational theory.  In particular, the experimental effort takes advantage of new developments in diamond-anvil techniques and capabilities at advanced radiation facilities to explore the nature of these materials in extreme conditions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We developed novel preparation techniques optimally suited for laser-heating synthesis at megabar pressure and conducted electrical transport measurements to 200 GPa (2 Mbar) that revealed <em>T</em><sub>c</sub> above 260 K, along with supporting current-voltage measurements, critical current estimates, and x-ray diffraction. The observation of near-room temperature superconductivity in the material was subsequently confirmed by an independent group after our report. We recently confirmed the previous indications of higher temperature superconductivity, with results indicating <em>T</em><sub>c</sub> of 294 K in La-based superhydride. In doing so, we found evidence for possible 'hot' superconductivity well above room temperature, analogous with theoretical predictions for a ternary hydride and predicted for pure metallic hydrogen.</p>\n<p>In a collaboration with the University of Rochester group and scientists at the Advanced Photon Source, the crystal structure and compression behavior of the recently discovered carbonaceous sulfur hydride (C-S-H) room-temperature superconductor was determined to 170 GPa (Figure 2). The study indicates that the structure of the C-S-H superconductor is derived from previously established van der Waals compounds found in the H<sub>2</sub>S-H<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>-H<sub>2</sub> systems, both of which were previously found by our group. These results are crucial for understanding the very high superconducting Tc found in the C-S-H system at megabar pressures. Additional experimental studies included the use of inelastic neutron scattering on other hydrides including hydrogen-storage applications, share some of the properties of these new high-pressure hydride materials. Novel high-pressure molecular phases, including new Xe-compounds containing N<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>4</sub> molecules were also discovered.</p>\n<p>These experiments were complemented by continued theoretical efforts. Motivated by our prediction that related very high <em>T</em><sub>c</sub> carbon compounds might be recoverable to lower pressures, &nbsp;we began a systematic exploration of additional carbon-bearing phases beginning with C-S-H ternary system. These studies led to the prediction of a new class of hydrides with intercalation of CH<sub>4</sub> in H<sub>3</sub>S, termed hydride perovskites with a predicted <em>T</em><sub>c</sub> up to 200 GPa, <em>i.e.,</em> comparable to that of pure H<sub>3</sub>S but forming at lower pressures near 100 GPa. A theoretical study of the C-S-H superconductor showed that low-level substitution of carbon in the previously observed H<sub>3</sub>S high <em>T</em><sub>c</sub> superconductor can boost the critical temperature from roughly 200 K to 289 K, as observed experimentally in the C-S-H material. This work has been followed up with calculations showing that the results can be understood in terms of local chemical bonding principles.</p>\n<p>Theoretical studies of the La-based hydrides showed that boron and nitrogen doping increases the <em>T</em><sub>c</sub> of the lanthanum-based superhydride<sub> </sub>to room temperature. We also showed that through first-principles path integral simulations that the proton diffusion in classical and quantum diffusion in clathrate hydrides such as superhydrides is remarkably high and can strongly affect the <em>T</em><sub>c</sub><em> </em>(Figure 3). Specifically, the calculations predict the coexistence of quantum and classical diffusion together with hydrogen-induced superconductivity, results that could lead to new physical phenomena. Searching for routes to lower the synthesis pressure of the superconducting superhydrides, we found using first-principles calculations that LaH<sub>10</sub>, YH<sub>10</sub>, and related high <em>T</em><sub>c</sub> materials can occur at remarkably low pressures when combined with electrochemistry.&nbsp; This prediction offers an altogether new way of making these novel materials and potentially stabilizing these phases.</p>\n<p>Additional calculations included large scale simulations revealed the surprising stability of trihydrogen oxide (H<sub>3</sub>O) at high pressures and temperatures. This surprising result suggest that this material could be present within of Uranus and Neptune and responsible for their anomalous magnetic fields. Other surprising new chemistry included the prediction of pressure-induced chemistry of hydrogen with lithium fluoride, leading to new hydrides that could be important for the interpretation of laser-driven dynamic compression experiments on hydrogen using lithium fluoride windows.</p>\n<p>Broader impacts and outcomes included the development of new experimental techniques for the broader community, including at the Advanced Photon Source, National Synchrotron Light Source-II, and National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. The work could impact energy technologies with the creation of more efficient electrical conductors. The discovery of novel pressure-induced chemistry could ultimately lead to other new technological materials. The findings could potentially revolutionize our understanding of planets beyond the solar system.
