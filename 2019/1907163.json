 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2019, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. Many species are threatened because of climate change and human impacts. By examining how species lived before human environmental influences, we can help mitigate future environmental change. This project studies Pacific kelp forests. Today, these nearshore habitats are vulnerable because of their proximity to large cities. The fellow will use chemical techniques to quantify the importance of kelp to ancient fish and marine mammals using bones collected from archaeological sites. Sites range from Alaska to southern California, and date from 12,000 years ago to modern day. Additionally, the fellow will characterize nutrient flow between kelp forests and nearby open ocean habitats. Overall, this project provides a picture of what habitats along the Pacific coast of North America looked like prior to European contact. The work is important not just for species living in kelp forests, but for human communities relying on them. The fellow will present this research to visitors at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History (NMNH), and develop learning modules for high schools and scientific researchers. \r\n\r\nThis research will examine the dynamics of Pacific kelp forest ecosystems over the Holocene and Anthropocene. Incorporating data from archaeological contexts adds to our understanding of these ecosystems by providing a pre-industrial baseline. The fellow will conduct delta13-C analysis of essential amino acids (EAA) on faunal remains from archaeological sites to reconstruct the importance of kelp-derived energy to ancient food webs. Sites span the northeast Pacific margin and past 12,000 years. At each location, the fellow will analyze fauna from three distinct functional groupings benthic, pelagic or mixed-habitat foragers to quantify kelp versus pelagically-derived energy. The fellow will compare these to analogous modern fauna to characterize ecosystem change. The fellow will work at the Smithsonian NMNH, a premier research and educational institute and popular cultural attraction. The fellow will: 1) learn important curatorial and faunal identification skills, and 2) interact directly with the general public about the importance of kelp forest ecosystems. The fellow will also develop curriculum based around historical conservation ecology for use in high schools. This research aids in understanding kelp forests dynamics, and engages scientists and the public in their protection.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
