 "awd_abstract_narration": "We have little direct information about the interiors of giant planets such as Jupiter and Saturn because they are shrouded in deep layers of clouds. There are many fundamental questions about such planets: Do they have a separate core, like the Earth? If so, what is its mass? If such a core exists, is it distinct from the thick atmosphere or mixed into it? Indirect methods must be used to answer such questions, and the work to be done here will help provide answers. The PI will use computers to generate a suite of interior models for Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; spacecraft data will be used to check the results. This work will also help in the understanding of planets around other stars. UCSC is a Hispanic-serving institution, and each year of the project an undergraduate student and two high school students will assist in the research.\r\n\r\nSince planets are fluid and rapid rotators they are oblate, causing their gravitational fields to differ from that of a spherically symmetric body of the same mass.  This fact has long been used to model the interiors of the giant planets. This work will use a minimum number of assumptions. Using Bayesian data-driven inference tools, the team will derive nearly model-independent constraints on the interior density structure of Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, and on the depth-dependent differential rotation of Saturn.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe interiors of the solar systems giant planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, remain mysterious realms, largely concealed beneath their thick atmospheres of hydrogen. Deeper within, extreme pressure and temperature conditions transform the gaseous hydrogen into a dense liquid metallic state. We would like to know how much of the interiors of these planets are made of ice and rock, which we think was the original seed core than helped to form these planets in the nebula of gas around the Sun, 4.5 billion years ago.\n\n\nIt is very difficult to understand the deep interior composition of a planet. Our best method so far is to measure the pull of the gravity (the gravity field) outside of the planet, as a function of latitude and longitude around the planet. This can only be measured by sending a space mission around the planet, and from Earth we can watch tiny changes in the spacecrafts acceleration as it orbits around the planet. This can tell us about how the density of the planet changes with depth inside of the planet.\n\n\nIn our work, we make computer models of the interior of planets. For these planets, we can compute what the gravity of each individual model planet is. We can then change the model planets parameters, like the density as a function of depth, until it exactly matches what was measured for a real planet. This shows us what the density inside the real planets must be. In our work we developed a new method to rapidly calculate a very wide range of models (hundreds of thousands of models) to compare to the spacecraft data. It is a new method to explore all possible interior structures for these planets. We learned that Saturn has a dilute core of ice and rocks partially dissolved into the overlying hydrogen. We also showed how beneficial a new space mission would be for understanding the composition Uranus and Neptune, which are much more poorly understood than Jupiter and Saturn.\n\n\nThe project involved a postdoctoral researcher, who led the work and was able to present at several national conferences. Two undergraduate students also extensively helped with the calculations that were performed. As part of the research they were able to learn how to use an NSF-funded on-campus supercomputer.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JonathanJFortney\n"
