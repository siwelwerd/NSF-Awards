 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientists are increasingly called upon to explain their research to the public, to elected officials and to members of the media. Giving presentations to a general audience requires skills that are different from those required to give a scientific presentation. Three workshops will be organized each year at scientific conferences in 2020 and 2021 to provide scientists with the opportunity to learn how to communicate with the public and other general audiences. \r\n\r\nThe following workshops will be organized at the February 2020 Aquatic Sciences Meeting run by the Association for the Science of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO) and two other oceanographic societies and the February 2021 Ocean Sciences Meeting run by ASLO: \r\n\r\n1. Science communication workshop - small group hands-on sessions where pre-registered participants will be given guidance in improved communication skills to use with lay public, elected officials, and media.\r\n\r\n2. Interdisciplinary presentation workshop - a workshop where oral presentations will be critiqued in a generic sense to help promote presentations more accessible to broad aquatic science audiences beyond the specific expertise of the presenter.\r\n\r\n3. A workshop, titled: How and why do you attempt public outreach? that will address various goals of public outreach.\r\n\r\nMembers of the aquatic sciences community are increasing interested in learning how to improve their communication skills and present their work to the public. This effort will encourage the wider dissemination of information about NSF-supported research to the public and other audiences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
