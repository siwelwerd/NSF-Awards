 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomers test their understanding of our Universe by numerical models of observations.  These models use measurements from Earth-bound labs, combined with many astronomical observations, to learn the properties of gas in star-forming clouds.   \r\n\r\nThe investigators' overarching goal is to improve their modeling program, called Cloudy, so they can faithfully simulate Nature.  When the simulation is accurate, astronomers can deduce the temperature, density and chemical makeup of these distant clouds. The planned improvements to the investigators' program will increase the accuracy of chemical and quantum models to yield more accurate understanding of our Milky Way galaxy.   The results of the investigators' model improvements will also increase our understanding of galaxies at great distances from the Earth.  \r\n\r\nThe investigators will modernize methods for including the wealth of quantum measurements used by the program.  Currently the program uses simplifying assumptions for modeling the continuum-to-line emission ratio, and the transfer of continua, including dust properties. The investigators will more accurately implement the equations for level populations. In terms of the treatment of radiative transfer, Cloudy self-consistently models the physics of optical pumping by background continua, free- and bound-electron scattering, and grain emission and absorption. \r\n\r\nAlongside this research activity, this project involves a strong outreach component. Lexington, KY is home to a significant Hispanic population. They are underrepresented in STEM disciplines.  Building on an ongoing program, the investigators will introduce these students to Science. The investigators will present their research at high schools and host an annual \"Festival del Espacio\" event on their campus open to students, their parents, and teachers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
