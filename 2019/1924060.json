 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award supports the biennial Interdisciplinary Antarctic Earth Sciences Conference (IAES) and the Antarctic Deep Field Camp Planning Workshop. IAES brings together U.S. researchers including biologists, glaciologists, geologists, and atmospheric scientists to present recent findings and data that apply to Antarctic earth sciences questions. IAES promotes a productive, interdisciplinary approach highlighting connections between research topics. IAES provides valuable development for early career scientists. Early career scientists will be invited speakers and members of the organizational committee. The field camp workshop aims at identifying the highest priority questions that are driving Antarctic science and what sectors within the continent are suited best to address the outstanding questions.  \r\n\r\nThe project will provide partial subsistence support for ~ 70 participants. The project support travel costs for up to 20 participants to attend IAES and the Field Camp Planning Workshop. Travel funds are provided for invited speakers and the organizing committee members. IAES is a unique opportunity for Antarctic scientists to present their work address fundamental Antarctic earth science questions from an interdisciplinary perspective. The Deep Field Camp Planning Workshop will deliver a ranking of field sites and scientific questions to be addressed at each site.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
