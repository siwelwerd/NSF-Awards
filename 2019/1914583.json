 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current structural systems are made of homogenous materials such as cast iron, wrought iron, bare steel, and brittle plastic, which are highly susceptible to failure and therefore require accelerated inspection and repair. Ultrasonics is a nondestructive evaluation method based on propagating elastic waves in structures, which are affected by defects in the structure and can therefore be used for damage diagnostics. However, in conventional structures, the amplitude of elastic waves decays with distance due to spreading/scattering, which limits the detectability of critical defects. In this research, new structural systems will be designed with an embedded or externally added lens so that ultrasonic signals can be focused and amplified as they propagate in the structure. In this way, ultrasonic wave energy can be transmitted and preserved over long distances. The research will allow detecting defects at their earliest stage and preventing unexpected failures. The target application will be pipeline systems due to their high susceptibility to failure. Therefore, results from this research will benefit the U.S. economy and society. This multi-disciplinary research encompasses metamaterials, sensors, additive manufacturing, structural monitoring, and design. The project features a synergistic educational component that integrates the strengths of two institutions in recruiting students who are underrepresented in engineering. In particular, female undergraduate and graduate students at both institutions will be connected via mutual workshops and the Society of Women Engineers (SWE).\r\n\r\nThis research will introduce a conformal gradient-index (GRIN) metamaterial lens as part of a structural system such that elastic waves will be amplified as they propagate through the non-planar structure. With the GRIN lens, different ultrasonic wave modes (i.e., longitudinal, flexural, or torsional) will be focused and transmitted such that higher frequencies (50-200 kHz) will be able to propagate with the increased sensitivity to structural damage. The GRIN lens will be designed by varying the refractive index of unit cells, and the existing model of the GRIN lens for flat surfaces will be modified for conformal surfaces. The metamaterial lens layer will be created with 3D printing, which will allow more practical and light weight structures to be easily integrated into the host structure. Additionally, a novel composite pipe structure, produced with multi-material additive manufacturing technologies, will be designed with the embedded metamaterial lens to address the highest risk of major incidents from the conventional materials used in pipelines.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Ultimately, the goal is to enhance structural diagnosis by transmitting and preserving wave energy over long distances, remedying the attenuation problem in nondestructive testing. To this end, we target the amplification of different wave modes (flexural, longitudinal, and torsional) that carry important structural information. The unit cells or lattices of the lens are tailored to achieve a special distribution of the refractive index in order to focus the ultrasonic wave energy at certain propagation distances. This is implemented in existing non-planar structures with a gradient-index metamaterial layer designed using varying-height solid cylinders that are externally attached to the structure. Additionally, we created a new composite metastructure by embedding metal beads with varying diameters in a polymer base structure. The graded height or diameter of inclusions causes the incident waves to be bent gradually toward the center axis where the refractive index is the highest (or the wave speed is the lowest), resulting in convergence at a focal spot. In addition to novel conformal lens concepts, we also developed a non-planar GRIN theory, which is based on ray trajectory calculations and results in better agreement with the experimentally measured and theoretically predicted focal spots. We test the theory on pipe-like and conical structures. Hence, these approaches can be further extended to other structural systems, including light poles and wind turbines. On the other hand, we also explored phononic crystal lenses based on negative refraction phenomena for subwavelength focusing. The ability of subwavelength focusing and potentially breaking diffraction limits will enable us to detect small defects. Hence, the outcomes of this project will impact other critical engineering applications, such as early detection in additively manufactured nuclear structures and components. In addition to technical outcomes, the educational impact of this research took multiple forms. The project supported several Ph.D. students and undergraduate students who delivered talks at conferences, published papers in high-impact journals, and effectively collaborated with other team members. The PI and PhD students gave guest lectures at UIC. The PI included research findings in the wave propagation course and included a guest lecture from UIC.
