 "awd_abstract_narration": "There has been a rapid increase in both the amount and type of data collected in many fields of science, technology and engineering; this requires new approaches to train graduate students to meet these needs.  The new data revolution calls for a new data-savvy workforce capable of using data effectively to answer important scientific and practical questions and to communicate the results to a broad audience. These data scientists should have strong technical and leadership skills and the ability to work in teams comprising different and complementary expertise. To meet this training need, the National Science Foundation Innovations of Graduate Education (IGE) award to Tufts University will test an innovative approach to project-based learning, teaching graduate students in data-intensive fields using real datasets to solve real-world problems. This solution-oriented, student-led, team-based, computationally-enriched (SOLSTICE) training environment will offer multidisciplinary team role-play and experience in data analytics and scientific communication. This project will evaluate the effectiveness of the SOLSTICE approach in providing an adaptable method for instructors in a range of fields that use large datasets at diverse institution types. As the SOLSTICE approach is refined, it will pave the way for students to enter the workforce with strong technical skills in data analytics and be effective members of research teams. \r\n\r\nThe project will answer two overarching research questions: (1) To what extent does the SOLSTICE approach provide opportunities for students to achieve 21st-century data intensive knowledge, skills, and attitudes? and (2) Are there variations in students' achievement over time, across different courses that use the SOLSTICE approach, and across different STEM disciplines? The approach consists of three components: (1) 3D Role Play, in which each student plays the role of Team Lead, Collaborator, and Reviewer in three different interdisciplinary teams aiming to develop, execute and communicate a research project based on authentic secondary data analyses; (2) Feedback on Feedback, which provides students with experience in giving and receiving effective critiques to their peers to strengthen inter-team communication; and (3) Data Analysis Roadmap, which offers knowledge-building guides and examples of key elements for efficient data analysis plans and other documents needed for effective communication of results. The approach will be tested and evaluated in six data-intensive courses in the Friedman School of Nutrition and in the School of Engineering, with approximately 270 participants monitored before, during, and for at least six months after participation in a SOLSTICE-based course. Educational resources will be developed based on successful components to guide replications of the training process, to train faculty in the SOLSTICE approach, and to disseminate it to other STEM fields. \r\n\r\nThe Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education. The goals of IGE are to pilot, test and validate innovative approaches to graduate education and to generate the knowledge required to move these approaches into the broader community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Each week, groups have designated instruction time for in-class discussions, peer feedback, and feedback on the quality and focus area of each other's feedback (e.g., Feedback-on-Feedback). To facilitate collaboration, course instructors developed online discussion forums where homework assignment responses were posted and commented on prior to in-class discussion.

These websites aimed to communicate research to diverse audiences and were designed to demonstrate the effects before and after addressing peer feedback comments and recommendations.

For each participating school, we reviewed all available courses prior to each academic semester to identify those suitable for participation. Of all available courses, we created an inventory of 30 courses whose syllabi met the following criteria: a) most enrolled students had graduate level standing; and b) course objectives emphasized skills to form research hypotheses and require students to examine, analyze, and/or visualize data (biostatistics, statistics, geographic information systems, remote sensing, data visualization, statistical programming, epidemiology, informatics, etc.); and c) courses with midterm and end of term projects or project-based learning opportunities prioritized student research projects.
