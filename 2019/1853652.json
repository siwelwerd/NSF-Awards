 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines the development, implementation, and geography of public information campaigns (PICs) as a strategy of border enforcement. Managing the transnational flow of people is one of the greatest challenges facing nation-states in the 21st century, requiring governments to negotiate complex issues of sovereignty, national security, and human safety and well being. PICs present a potentially promising approach to regulating transnational mobility as they are often less expensive and easier to implement than traditional enforcement strategies. However, little is known about the use of PICs as a strategy of border enforcement. This project contributes to research in the field of political geography by producing new empirical data on an under-examined enforcement mechanism, while also contributing to theoretical understandings of how nation-states govern. The findings of this project will have implications for national security, ensuring that border enforcement efforts are effective, economically efficient, and safe. The dissemination plan, including a publicly available website and StoryMap, will enable public engagement and science communication while also providing easily accessible information for migration research and education. Graduate research assistants within the project team will also promote the development and training of a diverse and competitive workforce in the geographical sciences.    \r\n\r\nThis project has three objectives: 1) to trace the development of PICs as a strategy of border enforcement; 2) to map the spatial and institutional frameworks through which PICs have been created and distributed and how these distribution networks relate to the form, content, and effectiveness of campaigns; and 3) to identify the role PICs play in producing political geographies of border enforcement.  A mixed-methods, comparative approach is used to achieve these objectives.  Research methods include textual analysis, semi-structured interviews, and geo-visualization techniques that combines quantitative and qualitative data sets. A comparative approach is useful when examining border and immigration enforcement strategies for it illustrates the nuances of enforcement in distinct contexts, while also providing insight into how national governments communicate and collaborate. Comparison of case studies in the US and Australia will enable the researchers to explore how specific cultural, economic, political, and geographic contexts affects the development and implementation of PICs as a mechanism of border enforcement, illuminating the potential of this strategy across contexts and providing insight on the best practices for effectively mobilizing PICs as an enforcement strategy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
