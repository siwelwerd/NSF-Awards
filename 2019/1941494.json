 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of the proposed conference is to carefully examine past and current research with an eye toward improving its impact on practice. This conference is designed to create concrete steps that could shape the nature and impact of mathematics education research for years to come. A diverse group of 50 participants will be invited to participate. Participants include 10 experienced K-12 educators whose perspectives will be used to anchor the conference in problems of practice. Other participants represent senior through more junior scholars who have demonstrated a commitment to addressing the disconnect between research and practice, along with technology experts to advise participants on capabilities and innovative uses of modern technologies for instruction, assessment and data management.\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal for the conference is to help the field of mathematics education think deeply about the most productive ways to answer the following questions: [1] Why hasn't past research had a more direct impact on practice? What can be learned from this historical analysis for future research? [2] What is a possible vision for research that would have a more direct impact on practice? What questions should be asked? What methods should be used? What concrete steps can be taken to launch the new research programs? [3] What are the implications of adopting new kinds of research programs? If they gain traction, how will such changes affect the broader education community and infrastructure, including preservice teacher education, teacher professional development, and the training of future researchers? How should the roles of researchers and teachers change? What incentive structures might motivate these changes? How will new programs of research interact with existing programs?\r\n\r\nThe Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In particular, as the field has gained some maturity over the last five decades, it is now an opportune time to take a step back and systematically consider how mathematics education researchers can engage in significant, impactful scientific inquiry. Looking back and reflecting on how mathematics education research has evolved, the project team generated a series of editorials at the Journal for Research in Mathematics Education (JRME) focused on the constant struggle to improve the impact of research on instructional practice. In these editorials, we described promising models for collaboration between teachers and researchers?models that change the traditional roles of researchers and teachers and encourage boundary crossing between research and practice. The ultimate goal of adopting such models of collaborative research and practice that cross boundaries is to encourage the construction and accumulation of research-based knowledge that is directly applicable to practice, that is, research that does not place the burden on teachers to have to always translate it into practice. In addition, we systematically analyzed JRME peer reviews to identify the kinds of issues that can reduce the potential impact of research that are commonly raised by the research community, including concerns about unclear research questions, vague and inappropriate research methodologies, and the lack of coherence between the theoretical framework, design and data analysis methods, and presentation of results. Looking forward, our team?s goal was to both address some of these common issues and encourage researchers to conceptualize their work in ways that are potentially more impactful on practice. To that end, we organized two conferences with junior researchers. The first conference, which was held virtually during the pandemic, involved 40+ participants, and the second conference, which was in-person, involved 15 participants. These conferences helped to directly build capacity in the field for conducting high-quality, impactful research. Moreover, drawing on our experience designing and running these conferences as well as on participant reflections and feedback from the conferences, we developed a book?a guide for conducting and communicating high-quality (mathematics) education research?that will be published open-access through Springer. Designed for early and mid-career researchers, the book is a practical manual for original research that emphasizes the importance of building knowledge and capacity in the field. It directly speaks to researchers and their communities about each phase of the process for conceptualizing, conducting, and communicating high-quality research in education.</span></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/13/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jinfa&nbsp;Cai</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1941494/1941494_10633361_1673633386225_BookCover--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1941494/1941494_10633361_1673633386225_BookCover--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Book Cover\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1941494/1941494_10633361_1673633386225_BookCover--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Book Cover\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Book Published Based on this Conference Grant</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Springer Book Series</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jinfa&nbsp;Cai</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Book Cover</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1941494/1941494_10633361_1673633521309_GroupCAS-MATH-Summer_Workshop_Early_Career_Researchers-ME-080522-108--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1941494/1941494_10633361_1673633521309_GroupCAS-MATH-Summer_Workshop_Early_Career_Researchers-ME-080522-108--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Conference Photo\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1941494/1941494_10633361_1673633521309_GroupCAS-MATH-Summer_Workshop_Early_Career_Researchers-ME-080522-108--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Conference Photo\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Attendees of the Conference Participants at the University of Delaware</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">University of Delaware</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jinfa&nbsp;Cai</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Conference Photo</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
