 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many new membrane materials have been developed in recent years; however, very few of them have made it to industrial applications, mainly due to lack of durability and robustness under realistic operating conditions. This research project aims to develop a molecular-level understanding of transport mechanisms in membrane materials and to inform the development of the next generation of membrane materials that can compete with traditional energy-intensive gas separations technologies. The types of membrane materials that will be investigated have a molecular structure that creates permanent, non-collapsible voids (free volume) in the material. The free volume is available for selective gas sorption, and the molecular structure around the voids helps the material to maintain its free volume and separation performance, unlike current separation membranes. The scientific knowledge generated by this research should enable significant advances in separation membranes that will meet the needs for a broad range of industrial applications. The research project serves as a training ground for undergraduate and graduate students to perform cutting edge research and will engage students from groups underrepresented in STEM fields. The researchers will also engage in well-structured education and outreach activities, including developing new courses, formulating educational and research components for high school students, giving presentations at a public \"research night\" event, and creating an educational video streaming for general public. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this research project is to elucidate how conformation- and configuration-based free volume contribute, individually and synergistically, to the membrane transport properties. The research hypothesis is that configurational free volume is much more stable than conformational free volume, and thus it provides unprecedented resistance to physical aging and plasticization even under harsh conditions, i.e., at high temperature and in chemically challenging environments. Iptycene-based polymers with specifically, yet systematically, varied free volume architecture will be synthesized, and the effect of configurational free volume on molecular transport will be studied. Fundamental transport properties (i.e., sorption, diffusion and permeation) will be investigated experimentally and theoretically under both ambient and harsh conditions. Finally, atomistic simulations will be performed to elucidate the underlying transport mechanism in polymers with configuration-based free volume and the effect of nano-confinement. The outcome of this project will be improved membranes for industrial gas separations, especially under harsh conditions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Membrane technology, which takes advantage of materials intrinsic selectivity rather than thermal energy to perform separations, provides a simple but powerful means to effect separations in complex streams as it consumes much less energy and is more environmentally friendly with small footprint.  The key to a successful membrane gas separation system is the membrane material.  Fast and selective transport combined with scalability and long-term durability are key attributes of an ideal separation membrane.  However, microporous polymer membranes suffer from permeability-selectivity trade-off, and more significantly, poor resistance to physical aging and plasticization.  Using a combined experimental-theoretical approach, this collaborative project explored a fundamentally new concept of configuration-based free volume microporosity as a solution to these challenges faced by existing microporous polymers, whose free volume microporosity is primarily based on transient conformational features (e.g., inefficient polymer chain packing). Instilled by shape-persistent paddlewheel-like triptycene structure units, non-collapsible, configuration-based microporous structures are constructed in corresponding triptycene-containing microporous polymers.  As a result, these innovative polymer membranes exhibited ultrahigh gas permeabilities and selectivities combinations as well as superb resistance to aging and plasticization, unattainable by most existing glassy polymer membranes with only conformational free volume microporosity. \n\nSuccessful execution of this project has established innovative macromolecular synthesis strategies that create hierarchically tunable macromolecular architectures, which show great promise to address the challenging problems of membrane gas separation technologies.  The fundamental knowledge of the connections between molecular level structures and macroscopic transport behavior obtained from this project has a transformative impact in the membrane separation field by exploring a completely new concept of configurational free volume in polymer membrane design.  This new approach holds the potential to drive both scientific and technological advancement of membrane separation technology to a new level of sophistication.  New polymer membrane materials resulted from this project will meet the needs for a broad range of critical gas separations that are responsible for a sustainable energy future (e.g., hydrogen production) and a better environment (e.g., carbon capture).\n\nEqually important, this highly interdisciplinary project that combines experimental, theoretical, and simulation approaches has a strong impact on teaching and educational experiences for all students.  The research and results from this project have produced exemplary materials and processes that enhance student learning both in the classroom and in the research laboratories.  It has served as an excellent educational tool to broaden students\u2019 perspectives well beyond their own research fields and instill in them the value of multidisciplinary approaches to problem-solving and critical thinking.  The efforts via various outreach activities have also helped excite the general public about separation membrane research that carries significant societal importance.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/15/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ruilan Guo"
