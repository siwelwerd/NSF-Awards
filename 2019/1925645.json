 "awd_abstract_narration": "Machine learning, a subset of the field of artificial intelligence, has enabled impressive progress on a range of problems from identifying objects in images to translating French into English.  At the University of Notre Dame, the Cyberinfrastructure to Accelerate Machine Learning (CAML) resource allows faculty across the university to leverage machine learning to address problems within their disciplines.  CAML uses graphical processing units (GPUs) to provide a significant boost in the speed of training machine learning algorithms, enabling researching to solve problems faster and to train more complex models capable of addressing more difficult problems.  CAML benefits a wide range of research activities, from searching for new particles at the Large Hadron Collider to exploring new chemicals leading to medical breakthroughs.  CAML also benefits the broader community as part of the Open Science Grid, serving researchers from universities and labs across the US.  Furthermore, CAML is used for education and outreach involving students ranging from high school to graduate school, helping to train the next generation to tackle data science challenges in  the public and private sector.\r\n\r\nCAML provides GPU resources for accelerating machine learning to the research community both locally at the University of Notre Dame and nationally through the Open Science Grid (OSG).  CAML physically hosts GPU resources suitable for accelerating the training of models from standard Deep Learning libraries, but also enables on-demand cloud access to more experimental architectures like FPGA resources.  Configured for both interactive and batch access, CAML supports both small-scale explorations to large-scale discovery science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was the creation of Cyberinfrastructure to Accelerate Machine Learning (CAML), a computer cluster located at the University of Notre Dame.  CAML was created to support the use of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques across scientific research domains.  The key technology enabling accelerated ML and AI is the use of graphical processing units (GPUs) that have the capability of running ML/AI computations 10 to 100 times faster than conventional CPUs.  The GPU resources provided by CAML were used to support a wide range of scientific research at the University of Notre Dame, including computational chemistry research aimed at the discovery of new drugs, bioinformatics research focused on genetics and gene editing, searching for new particles at the Large Hadron Collider, and fundamental research into the mathematics of AI.  CAML resources were also made available to researchers nationwide via the OSG Open Science Pool.  CAML resources have also enable the participation of at least a dozen undergraduate students in ML and AI related research, and have contributed to the professional development of several cyberinfrastructure (CI) engineers who have developed new skills in making CAML resources available to the Notre Dame research community.  The intellectual merit of CAML comes both from the science it enables as well as the new techniques used to provide researchers with access to GPU resources in new ways.  The broader impacts of CAML derive from breadth of research domains supported as well as through its ability to contribute to developing a workforce with advanced cyberinfrastructure skills.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/28/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kevin Lannon"
