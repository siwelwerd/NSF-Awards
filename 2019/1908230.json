This award would provide support for a three-day scientific workshop on the interactions between western boundary currents, the continental shelves they traverse, and the associated ecosystems. The workshop will gather researchers from Western Boundary Current-dominated shelf ecosystems around the world to discuss the state of knowledge of subtropical continental shelf ecosystems and to identify opportunities for initiating complementary research and modeling programs to advance understanding of the role of these environments in the global carbon cycle. Funding will support participation in the workshop of students and international researchers. The primary product of the workshop will be a paper synthesizing the results. The workshop is expected to stimulate future research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nIn all of the major ocean basins, western boundary currents (WBCs) sweep against the continental margins between ~25 and 35 N & S before turning out into the open ocean. These strong currents interact with the adjacent continental shelves, affecting shelf circulation, productivity, carbon export, sea level, and other properties. Comparative analysis of the physical forcing and biogeochemical and ecological responses among the different ocean/shelf settings has the potential to reveal common and contrasting underlying properties and their sensitivity to climatic perturbations in ways that fragmented attention to individual system idiosyncrasies cannot. To catalyze global progress in research on WBC-influenced continental shelves, a three-day workshop entitled International Workshop on Subtropical Shelf Ecosystems - Western Boundary Current Interactions was convened in Savannah, GA, in May of 2023. The objective of the workshop was to gather researchers from around the world to discuss the state of our present knowledge about WBC-STCS systems and to inquire whether an internationally coordinated approach to investigation of these regions would be valuable.\n\n\nThe meeting attracted global attention, with almost one hundred students and scientists from sixteen different countries participating in person or virtually. The Gordon Conference format allowed for extensive virtual participation from scientists scattered over nine time zones. Over the three day event, the assembled group heard presentations from three keynote speakers and eight invited speakers on Day 1, participated in 6 thematic breakout sessions (effective observational strategies, modeling, scaling of processes, cross-shelf exchange, shelf ecosystems, and future climate states) on Day 2, and contributed to a general review of breakout session outcomes and discussed potential future steps on Day 3. Although thematic categories overlapped extensively, groups brought together different perspectives to discuss common problems, potential solutions, and pathways forward for research in these critical habitats along ocean margins. In almost every session, a dearth of long-term data sets from WBC-influenced shelves was presented as a serious problem. Lack of data (particularly subsurface and biological data) confounds our ability to understand the responses of these systems to climate and other longer-term forcing.\n\n\nDiscussions on the third day revealed strong interest in maintaining the positive momentum generated by the workshop discussions. To facilitate future collaborations and to enable group members to use the outcomes of the workshop to guide their research planning, 100% of the workshop activities were video recorded and have been made available to workshop participants. Post-workshop initiatives generated within the group have included an awarded thematic session at the 2024 Ocean Science Meeting, the formation of a SCOR Working Group proposal planning committee, the drafting of a meeting report manuscript for publication.\n\n\nBecause an emphasis of the workshop was on developing future research initiatives, there was an effort to facilitate the inclusion of students, postdocs, and early career scientists in the proceedings. The workshop used targeted travel awards to ensure that junior scientists and students from around the world were able to attend in person. Seven international students and three international early career scientists received travel awards. Four of the eight invited talks were given by postdocs or early career scientists, and nine of the thirty posters were authored by students.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: WilliamBSavidge\n"
