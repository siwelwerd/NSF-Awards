Political science is one of the most male and Anglo dominated fields of study in the social sciences. Descriptive representation within the academic profession is important to perceptions of legitimacy, service to students, and development of knowledge. The goal of the conference is to provide attendees the necessary skills and networks to enter the academy, successfully achieve tenure and sustain their careers thereafter. This workshop brings together scholars from different universities, at different stages in their careers, to deepen intellectual engagement and to build coalitions that support excellence in diversifying the political science profession. \r\n\r\nDescriptive representation within the academic profession is important to perceptions of legitimacy, service to students, and development of knowledge. The goal of the conference is to provide attendees the necessary skills and networks to enter the academy, successfully achieve tenure and sustain their careers thereafter. This workshop brings together scholars from different universities, at different stages in their careers, to deepen intellectual engagement and to build coalitions that support excellence in diversifying the political science profession. The workshop includes an opening plenary session that focuses on the development of intersectionality work in the discipline and a discussion of the discipline and the role of women of color therein. It also includes a series of breakout sessions that focus on various aspects of academic development. The workshop will facilitate deep mentoring by pairing graduate students, junior, and mid-career participants by interest, with structured one-on-one mentoring time embedded into the schedule.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Building on the success of and feedback from workshops held in 2002, 2013, 2015, and 2017, the 2019 event delivered content aimed at cultivating the academic success of participants and mitigating the leaky pipeline, to the benefit of participants, their institutions, the discipline, and the public at large.</p>\n<p>Political science is one of the most male and white dominated fields of study in the social sciences.

Women of color face barriers such as lack of mentorship, financial resources, and significant familial responsibilities in their pursuit of higher education and subsequent careers. Plugging the leaks in the pipeline and building a discipline that is not only more representative but also equitable and inclusive requires commitment of time and resources to cultivate the success of those women throughout their graduate school educations and tenure.
