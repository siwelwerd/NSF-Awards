 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will enable students to attend the Logic Mentoring Workshop (LMW 2019) which will be co-located with the International Conference on Logic in Computer Science (LICS) to be held in July in Vancouver, British Columbia. LICS is the flagship conference in logic and semantics. LMW seeks to introduce and mentor students who have already shown interest in logic and semantics research by bringing them to LICS so they can learn about current research problems, make connections with their contemporaries, and interact with leaders in the field. \r\n\r\nFunded students will benefit greatly from the opportunity to engage in the critical technical, professional, and social exchanges that both conferences foster. The LMW workshop will focus on mentoring and career advice to enable undergraduate and graduate students, and especially women, and underrepresented minorities to pursue and thrive in research careers both in logic/semantics specifically and in computer science generally. This travel grant will enable career development and learning opportunities for US-based and/or US citizen graduate students. Attending conferences is an important component of graduate school education for our society's future computer science researchers. Students have the opportunity to discuss leading edge research with world-class researchers, and establish networks, connections, and mentoring relationships that will serve them well during their research careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
