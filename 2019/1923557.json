 "awd_abstract_narration": "More than 250 species in the Plantago genus are distributed throughout the world, many of which are of broad interest because of their medicinal properties and their ability to reduce toxic heavy metals from soil and water. Plantago species are also widely used as experimental model systems for both basic and applied agriculturally-relevant research. For example, Plantago was one of the first species used to study male sterility, an important reproductive trait that has been exploited for crop improvement. Despite its economic and scientific importance, efficient modern molecular tools for Plantago are lacking and represent a significant bottleneck that hampers efforts to provide an in-depth understanding of the processes and underlying regulatory mechanisms and the fundamental discoveries necessary for future crop improvement.  This project aims to provide the tools for genetically testing gene function through the development of efficient plant transformation methods in Plantago. Broader impacts of the project include the wide dissemination of protocols and other project outcomes to the broader plant research communities and the engagement and training of high school students, particularly those from underrepresented groups in science, through participation in existing programs at Purdue.    \r\n\r\nThe Plantago genus has many unique features that have led to a series of exciting discoveries, from the initial observation and description of male sterility 143 years ago to studies focused on elucidating unique aspects of sugar transport in plants, and more recently the involvement of vasculature in response to mineral deficiency. In the last two decades, a large number of research groups over the world have conducted transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and biochemical studies and identified thousands of candidate genes and proteins that likely participate in the diverse biological processes observed in the Plantago genus. This project aims to advance the direct testing of gene function in Plantago by establishing efficient transformation methods in two widely used Plantago species, broadleaf (P. major) and narrowleaf (P. lanceolata) plantains. These two species were chosen because of their popularity as model systems by the Plantago research community, their low ploidy (2x) and small genome sizes, as well as their amenability to genetic modification. All protocols and resources will be made freely available and accessible to the public through a project website, a publicly available video, multiple publications and on-site training workshops. \r\n\r\nThis project is co-funded by the Enabling Discoveries through Genomic Tools (EDGE) and the Plant Genome Research Program (PGRP) in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This genus possesses unique features that have driven numerous exciting discoveries. However, a significant bottleneck remains&mdash;the lack of an effective genetic transformation system for <em>Plantago</em>&mdash;which limits deeper investigations into genome-phenome relationships. This project seeks to address this challenge by developing efficient transformation protocols for two representative species: broadleaf plantain (<em>Plantago major</em>) and narrowleaf plantain (<em>Plantago lanceolata</em>). Through our extensive exploration of plant transformation techniques over the past few years, we have demonstrated that narrowleaf plantain is more amenable to transformation. Both <em>Agrobacterium</em>-mediated transformation (involving tissue culture) and the FastTrACC method (which bypasses tissue culture) are viable for this species. While broadleaf plantain can also be transformed using the FastTrACC method, further optimization is required to improve transformation efficiency. Successfully establishing these transformation methods will enable researchers to adopt these species for broader applications in their studies. Beyond the scientific advancements, this project has provided robust training opportunities in tissue culture and plant biotechnology for graduate students, undergraduates, and high school students, particularly those from underrepresented groups. This experience has equipped participants with valuable skills for future careers in the Ag-biotech industry, academia, or government sectors. This project also extended its impact through community engagement, training high school teachers and community educators through the university&rsquo;s summer outreach programs, which provided hands-on lab experience. Additionally, we produced a video using <em>Plantago</em> to educate the general public about the importance of biotechnology in basic scientific research. Outputs from this project include three peer-reviewed papers, one educational video, and more than ten presentations at international, national, and regional conferences, as well as university seminar series. Two more papers derived from this project are in preparation and will be submitted soon.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/29/2024<br>\nModified by: Cankui&nbsp;Zhang</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1923557/1923557_10623084_1732407793378_Outreach--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1923557/1923557_10623084_1732407793378_Outreach--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Outreach\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1923557/1923557_10623084_1732407793378_Outreach--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Outreach\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This project was used to train graduate students, undergraduate students, and high school students</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Hannah Levengood and Cankui Zhang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Cankui&nbsp;Zhang\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Outreach</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1923557/1923557_10623084_1732407169921_FastTrACC_images--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1923557/1923557_10623084_1732407169921_FastTrACC_images--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"FastTrACC transformation\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1923557/1923557_10623084_1732407169921_FastTrACC_images--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"FastTrACC transformation\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This image showed the FastTrACC method can be used to transform both narrowleaf and broadleaf plantains</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Hannah Levengood</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Cankui&nbsp;Zhang\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">FastTrACC transformation</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1923557/1923557_10623084_1732407487243_CRISPR_Plantago--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1923557/1923557_10623084_1732407487243_CRISPR_Plantago--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"CRISPR Plantago\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1923557/1923557_10623084_1732407487243_CRISPR_Plantago--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"CRISPR Plantago\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">CRISPR was used to knockout the sucrose transporter gene in Plantago.
