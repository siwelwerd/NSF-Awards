 "awd_abstract_narration": "How a predator pursues its prey may be one of the most important aspects of its behavior. Predation success determines survival for nearly all animals, be they predator or potential prey. We know little, however, about the specific movement abilities of predators and prey in nature and how they determine the outcomes of life-or-death encounters. It is difficult to study natural predation; these events are rare and difficult to anticipate. Predators use a variety of movement strategies to hunt prey: striking with great speed, sneaking up stealthily, and maneuvering quickly and repeatedly during pursuit, to name a few. This research will address how bats hunt insects using different predation strategies, dissecting the physiology and anatomy that underlie the abilities of particular species to select their form of pursuit. This research will provide rich learning opportunities for teams of students in biology, engineering and computer science. It will develop a science communication internship program at Brown University where students will transform research videos of bats hunting insects into media that will be distributed globally and that highlight the importance of bats and insects to our ecosystems.\r\n\r\nThis project uses the model system of bats and insects to link detailed understanding of the mechanistic basis of locomotion with experiments and simulations that examine how movement abilities influence predator-prey interactions. Bats and insects are highly diverse groups that have co-evolved for millions of years. The researchers will use emerging video-recording and computer vision technologies to quantify with high precision the movement abilities of several bat species as they hunt insects under natural conditions. These field studies will be complemented by studies of bats flying in a custom flight arena that allow measurement of bat flight movements in greater detail. Flight and predator-prey computer simulations will be used to test hypotheses regarding what determines bat flight abilities and how movement abilities affect predator-prey outcomes. This will lead to open-access computer software that will help scientists studying a variety of animals to predict flight abilities and the outcomes of predator-prey interactions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Answering this fundamental question is central to understanding the ecology and evolution of predatory animals. Although predation success determines survival for most animals, be they predators or potential prey, we still know little about the specific movement abilities of predators and prey in nature, how animals achieve these movements, and how movement abilities determine the outcomes of life-or-death encounters. This is because it is difficult to study natural predation, partly because of the challenges inherent in predicting where and when relatively rare predation events will occur. Researchers have observed predators hunt using multiple movement strategies, such as striking with great speed, sneaking up stealthily, or maneuvering quickly and repeatedly during pursuit. But we have little information about what determines which strategy a specific predator species will use, or, for species that can use more than one, how the choice of strategy is made and how the animal switches between pursuit modes. Understanding these topics can give us insight into predator-prey interactions occurring across the planet in all environments: air, water, and land. This research project studied how bats hunt insects using different predation strategies and learned about the physiology and anatomy that underlie the abilities of particular bat species to select a pursuit mode.</p>\n<p class=\"m-2547493174585958193p1\">We designed new methods to bring as much precision, control, and detail of laboratory-based research to natural environments as possible. Our new techniques allow researchers to place individuals from diverse species of wild-caught bats into a large flight arena seeded with hundreds of moths. Special camera and light configurations allow us to record the hunting and prey capture efforts of the bats with exceptional resolution on multiple synchronized cameras. We developed new techniques for processing the many hundreds of flight trials we observed, including adapting partially automated high-throughput video processing and markerless tracking using neural network-aided deep learning. These computational approaches decrease the time and effort required to process video data approximately ten-fold. We have applied these methods to fifteen bat species from three families. This approach reveals extraordinary details of wing movements and flight trajectories of bats during prey capture flight. One key finding from these analyses is that Townsend&rsquo;s long-eared bats use a novel flexible guidance control strategy during pursuit flight; this strategy combines, in a single predatory flight, multiple kinds of guidance control that have previously only been observed singly in flying birds and insects. Our flight performance studies also showed that bat species vary greatly in the patterned anatomical variation in the distribution of specialized sensory wing hairs that contribute to bats&rsquo; ability to sense the position and movements of the wing. These findings suggest that the sensory information a bat species acquires via the wing hair network could play a critical supporting the individual&rsquo;s choice of flight control strategies. We also observed that the bats regulate the temperature of parts of the wing and body uniquely. Although the intense exercise regime of flight increases bats&rsquo; core body temperature, the exceptionally large and unfurred surfaces of the wings dissipate heat rapidly. We studied the differences between body and wing muscle temperatures over the course of flight and subsequent resting. In a sample of nearly 70 bats from 13 species, we regularly saw that wing muscles operate below body temperature, and the further a muscle is from the body&rsquo;s core, the colder the muscle. The longer a bat flies, the cooler the muscles become, and when air temperatures are lower, this effect is magnified. When bats stop flying, blood flow from the core to the muscles begins to bring wing muscles back toward body temperature.</p>\n<p class=\"m-2547493174585958193p1\">The project also provided rich learning opportunities for teams of students in biology and engineering.
