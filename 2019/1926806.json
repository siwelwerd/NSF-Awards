 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project safeguards domestic food supply by improving honeybee health. Honeybees pollinate 1/3 of domestic food supply and contribute more than $15 billion to the U.S. economy. Although honeybee populations are at a 20-year high in the U.S., the cost to keep them alive is at its historical peak.  This project reduces labor costs for commercial beekeepers, allowing them to devote more time to restoring hives that show signs of poor health and infestation. The product can be used to optimize hive placement, allowing growers to pollinate using the smallest number of hives. As growers' demand for hives decreases, the number of hives shipped across the country to pollinate crops will be reduced, resulting in a more robust stock of commercial honeybees.\r\n\r\nThis proposed project expands on research developed in Phase I to grow the product from its first version into a scalable product, which includes predictive model improvements, additional data collection, mobile app development and additional field testing. A major component of the Phase II grant will be improving accuracy and performance of the hive strength model. Additional data collection will be important in Phase II to improve the model to perform well in a wider range of ambient conditions. By the end of Phase II, full automation of the software allows for the product to be used at all times. A major component of the Phase II work will be the development of a web-based mobile application that can take infrared pictures using smartphone camera attachments, upload images automatically to a database, and provide real time analytics on the images. This project is a breakthrough in the crop pollination space using infrared imagery that can be adapted to improve thermodynamic insights across many verticals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This funding allowed us to develop breakthrough technology for the beekeeping and pollination industries. TBC created a patented, broadly applicable infrared scanning tool initially targeted at beehives to determine hive strength for pollination.&#8239;Bee pollination is essential to 1/3 of the world food supply. The tool uses proprietary data analytics, thermal physics, infrared technology, and machine learning to verify hive strength,&#8239;more accurately and significantly faster than current alternatives. Before dissolution, TBC had customers in 8 countries on 5 continents. The technology is widely applicable to veterinary applications as well as farm management, food storage, transportation and construction use cases.&#8239;TBC dissolved and transferred the Verifli technology to the USDA Carl Hayden Bee Research Center in mid-2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany Background\n\n\n\n\nFounded in 2016, TBC pioneered infrared technology for commercial beekeepers and growers. Developed over 5 years through National Science Foundation funding, Verifli uses infrared cameras to accurately measure the strength and value of honeybee hives used for pollination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct\n\n\n\n\nTBC replaces manual hive inspections using IR imagery and data analytics to predict the size of the colony inside the hive. This is faster than manual inspections, more objective and non-invasive, so no pollination time is lost. The image is captured with an IR camera sourced through a hardware partner, and our mobile app is used to tag image metadata and upload the images to our image processing pipeline. Colony size is reported back to the user in our web app. These reports allow our users to ensure their hives are strong enough to result in good pollination in any weather. Verifli results are also used to determine whether the grower is getting what they paid for from the beekeeper and price the pollination payments. The NSF SBIR award supported the completion of accurate hive strength prediction models, automated and robust image processing pipelines, a mobile app, a web app, and two bonus internal image processing and data management apps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket\n\n\n\n\nTBC focused on US almond pollination as the beachhead market and began expanding into new markets in 2021. Through the Self-Service model, Verifli is now used by growers of 6 different crops across 8 countries. TBC has generated partnerships with major companies in the agriculture and technology spaces.\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/05/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: EleanorWSymes\n"
