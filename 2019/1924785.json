 "awd_abstract_narration": "Predictive computational models provide enormous potential to dramatically reduce the costs and development time of new products and manufacturing methods. For computational models associated with the behavior of deformable solid materials and structures, however, this potential is currently limited because rarely are they adequately and broadly proven to yield trustworthy, accurate results for which the level of uncertainty has been sufficiently quantified. Therefore, the rigorous verification and validation of such models is sorely needed; yet, it is seriously lacking. In generalized terms, verification is the process of determining that the model?s computer code accurately represents the underlying mathematics/equations, while validation represents the process of determining the degree to which a model is an accurate representation of the real, physical world. This study will assemble internationally recognized experts to develop specific action plans to help accelerate widespread implementation of robust and accurate verification and validation techniques in such computational models, which would increase the possibilities of hitherto undiscovered scientific phenomena, reduction in the lifecycle of the development process, and facilitate optimal and innovative use of materials and structures. The study will also help provide a stronger infrastructure and workforce for future application and development of these powerful models. All these effects can help enhance U.S. national security, economic competitiveness, and the quality of life and well-being of society.\r\n\r\nThe subject matter experts convened for this study will provide and/or execute detailed, short term action plans, and the final project output will be a report that addresses seven key deliverables: (1) a document which thoroughly enunciates a strong value proposition for robust and widespread verification and validation in the solid mechanics and materials science and engineering communities, (2) a state-of-the-art key/best practices document specifically designed for researchers and engineers working with these models, (3) development of new benchmark problems for application in this modelling domain, (4) recommendations for sustainable funding programs for large-scale collaborations that will greatly accelerate adoption of these methodologies, (5) development of technical society conference sessions which will jump start interest in and implementation of these methodologies, (6) recommended workshops for addressing detailed strategies in highly focused sub-domains, (7) specific strategies for connecting modelers and experimentalists in order to accelerate implementation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
