 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coral reefs are incredibly diverse ecosystems that provide food, tourism revenue, and shoreline protection for coastal communities. The ability of coral reefs to continue providing these services to society is currently threatened by climate change, which has led to increasing ocean temperatures and acidity that can lead to the death of corals, the animals that build the reef framework upon which so many species depend. This project examines how temperature and acidification stress work together to influence the future health and survival of corals. The scientists are carrying out the project in Hawaii where they have found individual corals with different sensitivities to temperature stress that are living on reefs with different environmental pH conditions. This project improves understanding of how an individual coral?s history influences its response to multiple stressors and helps identify the conditions that are most likely to support resilient coral communities. The project will generate extensive biological and physicochemical data that will be made freely available. Furthermore, this project supports the education and training of undergraduate and high school students and one postdoctoral researcher in marine science and coral reef ecology. Hands-on activities for high school students are being developed into a free online educational resource. \r\n\r\nThis project compares coral responses to acidification stress in populations experiencing distinct pH dynamics (high diel variability vs. low diel variability) and with distinct thermal tolerances (historically bleaching sensitive vs. tolerant) to learn about how coral responses to these two factors differ between coral species and within populations. Experiments focus on the two dominant reef builders found at these stable and variable pH reefs: Montipora capitata and Porites compressa. Individuals of each species exhibiting different thermal sensitivities (i.e., bleached vs. pigmented) were tagged during the 2015 global coral bleaching event. This system tests the hypotheses that 1) corals living on reefs with larger diel pH fluctuations have greater resilience to acidification stress, 2) coral resilience to acidification is a plastic trait that can be promoted via acclimatization, and 3) thermally sensitive corals have reduced capacity to cope with pH stress, which is exacerbated at elevated temperatures. Coral cells isolated from colonies from each environmental and bleaching history are exposed to acute pH stress and examined for their ability to recover intracellular pH in vivo using confocal microscopy, and the expression level of proteins predicted to be involved in this recovery (e.g., proton transporters) is examined via Western blot and immunolocalization. Corals from each pH history are exposed to stable and variable seawater pH in a controlled aquarium setting to determine the level of plasticity of acidification resilience and to test for pH acclimatization in this system. Finally, corals with different levels of thermal sensitivity are exposed to thermal stress and recovery, and their ability to regulate pH is examined over time. The results of these experiments help identify reef conditions that promote coral resilience to ocean acidification against the background of increasingly common thermal stress events, while advancing mechanistic understanding of coral physiology and symbiosis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

To do so, researchers examined the stress responses of corals living in naturally extreme habitats from Hawaii to Australia. This project revealed that coral skeletal growth was affected by daily pH fluctuations, and corals from habitats with more variable daily seawater pH conditions showed enhanced resilience to acidification stress. However, daily temperature variation had complex influences on coral heat stress tolerance and coral bleaching susceptibility. Extreme daily temperature variability led to declines in heat tolerance, while intermediate levels of variability promoted heat tolerance above that for corals in relatively stable thermal environments. This project also found that marine heatwaves lead to declines in coral metabolic rates and caused dysfunctional regulation of intracellular pH in corals, surprisingly including those that did not bleach. In addition, repetitive exposure of individual coral colonies to marine heatwaves has led to a continued loss of individuals from some coral species even without bleaching, while other species appear to be gaining resilience against heat stress following repeat exposure. Coral reproduction was also found to be sensitive to pH, as coral sperm required elevation of their intracellular pH (alkalinization) to activate motility, indicating that ocean acidification may have a significant negative impact on coral sperm function and thus corals ability to sexually reproduce. In addition, as this project found that heat stress can lead to declines (acidification) in intracellular pH, the combination of heat and seawater acidification stress resulting from climate change may have a profoundly harmful impact on the ability of coral sperm to swim to and fertilize eggs. Overall, this project supported the training of 2 postdoctoral researchers, 3 doctoral students, 1 postgraduate technician, and 8 undergraduates, and resulted in 13 peer-reviewed publications, 37 publicly available datasets, and over 20 scientific conference presentations. In addition, this project led to the development and implementation of hands-on educational activities for inner-city public high school students covering coral reef ecology and the effects of climate change on marine organisms in partnership with the Center for Aquatic Sciences in Camden, NJ. In addition, this project mentored and trained 8 Philadelphia public high school students who conducted research projects in coral reef ecology and climate change. Results of this project were also presented at over 23 outreach events for students and the general public.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 06/06/2024<br>\nModified by: Katie&nbsp;L&nbsp;Barott</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1923743/1923743_10624779_1713274752956_2023_Heron_reefscapes3--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1923743/1923743_10624779_1713274752956_2023_Heron_reefscapes3--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Heron reef slope\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1923743/1923743_10624779_1713274752956_2023_Heron_reefscapes3--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Heron reef slope\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The reef slope at Heron Reef shows signs of recovery from coral mortality 2 years following the 2020 coral bleaching event.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Katie Barott</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Katie&nbsp;L&nbsp;Barott\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Heron reef slope</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1923743/1923743_10624779_1713275182713_Mcap_pair_19_20--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1923743/1923743_10624779_1713275182713_Mcap_pair_19_20--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Pair of corals with distinct bleaching responses\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1923743/1923743_10624779_1713275182713_Mcap_pair_19_20--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Pair of corals with distinct bleaching responses\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Individuals of the rice coral Montipora capitata show consistently different bleaching responses to heat stress.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kristen Brown</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Katie&nbsp;L&nbsp;Barott\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Pair of corals with distinct bleaching responses</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
