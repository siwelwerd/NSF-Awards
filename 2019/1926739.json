 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2019 GRC/GRS on the Science of Adhesion will focus on outstanding challenges in understanding adhesion and friction in extreme conditions.  The sessions will cover theoretical/simulation models to understand adhesion/friction on rough/wet surfaces; experimental measurements under these extreme conditions; understanding gained from biological systems that have to deal with challenging environmental conditions; and novel synthetic adhesives designed for these extreme conditions.  The main objective of the meeting is to foster discussion between theorists working on new models for adhesion/friction; experimentalist testing relevant systems; and inspiration of new design/chemistry that comes from biological systems that outperform synthetic adhesives in these extreme conditions.  Some presentations will be more application driven, including bio-inspired adhesives, biomedical adhesives, and haptic sensors for robotics. \r\n\r\nThe 2019 GRC/GRS on the Science of Adhesion aims to provide a forum for cutting-edge presentations and vibrant discussion and debate about new and developing problems in Adhesion Science.  The conference will primarily focus on Adhesion and Friction in Extreme Conditions and Translation to Practical Applications.  Moreover, it will bring established strengths of the Adhesion Science community to bear on newer fields and problems.  The goal is to invite a mix of young and more experienced speakers who will present the most recent and exciting research and to achieve this goal with balanced or diverse representation among speakers and discussion leaders.  The accompanying GRS willl be organized to encourage and enhance active participation of graduate students and post-doctoral associates in the main GRC.  The GRS will also provide a unique mentoring opportunity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
