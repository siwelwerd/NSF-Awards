 "awd_abstract_narration": "Saving for retirement and the allocation of accumulated savings upon retirement are two of the most consequential financial decisions that U.S. households make.  Yet, the available evidence suggests that individuals do not save adequately for their retirement, despite access to tax deferred retirement accounts.  Further, upon retirement, households seem reluctant to make use of annuities which provide insurance against longevity risk more efficiently than self-insurance.  Finally, many households claim social security benefits at the earliest possible opportunity at a substantial reduction in their monthly benefits. This project seeks to understand such decisions and what might be done to encourage households to make better decisions using theory and experiments with paid human subjects. Thus, the goals of this project are in line with the NSF's mission to advance national prosperity and welfare.\r\nThis project consists of three main studies, each of which place subjects in a realistic, individual choice setting and explore the decisions they make in that setting, where the decisions are incentivized by monetary payments.  Experimental subjects will be a mix of university students and a broader, more demographically rich subject population recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk.  The first study explores the role of Tax Deferred Accounts (TDA) for savings decisions. The aim of this project is to understand how TDAs affect savings choices and how \"nudges\" such as automatic enrollment in TDAs might improve savings behavior. The second study explores the annuitization decision that households face at the time of retirement.  The aim of this project is to understand the factors affecting annuity take-up.  The third study explores why retirees don't delay taking social security benefits. The goal of this project is to understand both the positive and normative aspects of the retirement benefit redemption decision.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

According to the Investment Company Institute, as of the first quarter 2023, U.S. households held $22.3 trillion in TDAs, comprising 63% of U.S. total retirement assets. TDAs for retirement savings are also found outside of the U.S. among nearly all OECD countries.</p>\n<p>A considerable amount of research has been directed toward getting workers to sign up for TDAs including nudges, subsidies, automatic enrollments and default investment options.&nbsp; In this project, we take a step back and ask the bigger question of whether TDAs are in fact, beneficial to workers as vehicles for saving for retirement when the complexity of signing up and making regular contributions is eliminated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We conduct individual decision-making experiments to investigate the impact of TDAs on consumption and saving decisions. We design six different treatments to study the various channels through which TDAs may affect individual decisions. Our baseline treatment T1 includes two savings vehicles, a TDA and a regular saving account (RA), which does not have any tax advantage and is fully liquid. Treatment T2 eliminates the TDA&nbsp; but is otherwise identical to T1. &nbsp;T3 is similar to T2 but in T3 we reduce taxes on interest income so that government revenues are theoretically the same as in T1 and to understand the effect of providing a simple tax incentive for savings. Treatment T4 is the same as T1 but removes a tax calculator from the decision screen, allowing us to determine the impact of providing additional education. Treatments T5 and T6 are based on the no TDA treatment T2, but include a second savings vehicle, a commitment account (CA), which disallows early withdrawals before retirement but has no tax advantages relative to the RA. In T5, subjects are required to make a CA saving choice first followed by a consumption choice with the residual going to the RA. In T6, the consumption choice is made first followed by the CA saving decision. The difference between T6 and T2 reveals the commitment-device aspect of TDAs, and the difference between T5 and T6 reveals the effect of requiring that retirement saving decisions precede consumption.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our experiment mimics important features of real-world, lifecycle saving decisions with or without TDAs. Subjects face a life-cycle earning profile that is hump-shaped in the first 15&nbsp; \"working periods\" of their lives They receive a constant pension amount in retirement. Subjects always have access to a perfectly liquid RA. If given access to a second savings vehicle, a TDA or CA, subjects can only make contributions to that account in the working periods and take withdrawals from those accounts in retirement. We impose a progressive income tax schedule, set TDA contribution limits that mimic U.S. rules, and incorporate longevity risks. Importantly, our experiment is incentivized; subjects' monetary payments depend upon and vary with their consumption/saving decisions over the lifecycle. Within this setup, we are able to solve the model under each regime so as to provide a rational actor benchmark for comparison purposes (see Figure 1).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For our student subjects, we find that TDAs substantially increase retirement wealth defined by their net worth at the end of the working period. On average, subjects in the TDA baseline treatment T1 save about 17% of their endowment during the working phase, while subjects in the two non-TDA treatments T2 and T3 save only about 8%-10%. At the end of the working phase, the average net worth in the TDA treatment T1 is 429.3k greater than that in the no TDA treatment T2 (see Figure 2). The primary contributing mechanism for this net worth gap is the requirement that saving decisions are made first (before consumption), accounting for 49% of the gap, followed by the commitment-device aspect of TDAs, which accounts for 36% of the gap. The effect of educating subjects by providing a tax calculator on TDA contributions is minimal and insignificant. Lowering taxes on interest income (T3 versus T2) yields very little change in saving rates.</p>\n<p>We also report on a replication study where we recruit subjects from Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) online workforce, who are, on average, older and more racially diverse than our student sample. We have these MTurkers participate in the same six treatments of our original study. As shown in Figure 3, we again observe a substantial increase in retirement wealth with TDAs, an insignificant educational effect and an important order effect, whereby subjects tend to save more if they are required to make a saving decision first. The replication of our main student sample findings using the MTurk sample suggests that our findings with undergraduate students may generalize to other subject populations.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/12/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: John&nbsp;Duffy</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1918571/1918571_10618638_1691816177748_NSF_F2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1918571/1918571_10618638_1691816177748_NSF_F2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1918571/1918571_10618638_1691816177748_NSF_F2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Theory predictions and experimental means.
