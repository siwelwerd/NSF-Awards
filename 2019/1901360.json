 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a tension in neuroscience between the emergent phenomena of interested, such as learning and memory, and the level at which most data are acquired. For example, numerous experimental labs study how the strengths of synaptic connections and their dynamics affect cognition by establishing empirical correlations between in vitro electrophysiology measurements and data collected in animal behavioral experiments. However, these correlations fall short of causal explanations: to date, there exist no mechanisms connecting recordings in individual neurons and synapses with cognitive learning dynamics. The problem is not due to a lack of observations at either the neuronal or the systemic level; rather, it reflects a principal gap in our ability to link these two scales. Even if a full description of every neuron in the brain could be produced, there would still be a gap in our ability to transition from local data to making qualitative conclusions about how it combines to produce systemic cognitive outcomes. Addressing this problem requires a conceptual framework encompassing a computational model that would link the experimentally derived characteristics of individual cells with effects of those characteristics at the ensemble level.\r\n \r\nThe proposed research aims to provide a way to establish such a connection: developing a data-driven, systemic model of hippocampal spatial learning based on the parameters of the hippocampal synaptic architecture, including the parameters of synaptic plasticity, using novel topological and geometric techniques. Recent developments in Algebraic Topology will be used to integrate the parameters of synaptic connectivity and synaptic plasticity (e.g., long- and short-term potentiation and depression), to study structure of this map, the mechanisms of its formation and deterioration, and to evaluate the time required to produce a spatial map of a given environment, etc. This project is a natural evolution of prior work done by the Dabaghian group on modeling the mechanisms of spatial learning, based on algebraic topology methods developed by the M?moli group. The theory-based insight into learning phenomena will produce a qualitatively better understanding of how to interpret data, how to design new experiments, what variables should be targeted in measurements, as well as how to minimize use of animals, and in general how to optimize use physical and intellectual resources.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
