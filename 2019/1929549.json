 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project includes enabling wide spreading replacement of superconducting materials with materials with a superconductive coating. Superconductors have the promise of enabling vastly more efficient power transmission lines, better electric motors, and high-speed quantum computing, however the expense and lack of scalability in the fabrication of the materials has thus far proven problematic. This replacement with superconductive coatings will help overcome obstacles to implementing these materials in the transportation, energy, and quantum computing fields, thus accelerating technological development in these areas. The success of this project will also lower the barriers for advanced medical equipment enabled by superconducting magnets such as MRI and improve the healthcare outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project further develops an electrochemical process for the fabrication of superconducting coatings and other metal or alloy thin film coatings. The key innovation in this technology is the use of a new type of aqueous electrolyte to suppress the activity of water and proton in an aqueous electrolyte, while maintaining the ease of operation, compatibility of the process with current processes in use, as well as the environmental friendliness. This suppression directly results in an energy savings during the process and the morphology of films is significantly improved as the incorporation of the byproduct of those undesired reactions are avoided. More importantly, the superconductivity of the film deposited from this low temperature process was observed at a higher temperature than the material itself and this increased critical temperature has shown an improved stability against high temperature processing used in device fabrication.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
