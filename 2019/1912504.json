 "awd_abstract_narration": "Classical Mechanics tells us how bridges, cars, and other objects in our everyday world work. Quantum Mechanics tells us how electrons, atoms and other objects in the microscopic world work. We need to find a description of nature that works at the microscopic and macroscopic scales and everything in between. This is a century-old unsolved problem that is called the \"Quantum Measurement Problem.\"  Not only do we want to solve the problem, but we want to use \"quantumness\" at a larger scale, and not understanding the problem stops us from doing this. To solve this problem objects at an intermediate scale, in between the microscopic and macroscopic, need to be studied. This is what the project: \"Coherent Electron Control\" is aiming to do. Microscopic objects, electrons, are placed close to an everyday world object, a wall, so that the description of how the two interact is neither described by Quantum Mechanics, nor Classical Mechanics. New models and theories can be tested in this way. On the practical side, the interaction between electrons and walls has stopped the development of sensitive devices based on electrons, called electron interferometers. The walls destroy the useful quantum mechanical properties of the electrons. If this \"decoherence\" can be overcome, new electron devices can be constructed that measure, for example, small changes in magnetic fields, and may thus find application in the numerous areas of technology where magnetic fields play a key role.\r\n\r\nElectron diffraction from nanofabricated gratings will be used to split electron beams coherently into two parts. Walls will be placed close to the electron beams to partially decohere the electron beams. The electron beams are recombined and the measured amount of quantum mechanical interference tells us about the amount of decoherence. Four different existing microscopic theories have now been tested. Control of the decoherence will be explored by changing the wall from insulating copper oxide, to semi-conducting Gallium Arsenide, to conducting gold, and illuminating the walls with laser light and particles. The understanding gained will be used to control and reduce the decoherence and be applied to enlarge the size of existing electron interferometers. In this way it is attempted to construct the largest and most sensitive electron interferometer in the world. Patents will be pursued based on the new technology being developed and the inventions may be marketable. The research project provides experience to graduate students, undergraduate students and high school students in the new research area of free electron quantum optics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In this period, discoveries in quantum physics are more and more making their way into new products. It is expected that discoveries and new understanding in quantum science will remain an industry driver for the next decades. Within this context, this project made a study of new quantum phenomena and attempts to identify new avenues of industrial application. &nbsp;In this project we have reached several breakthroughs. (a) In collaboration with the Belgium group led by Prof. J. Verbeeck, we observed for the first time a phenomenon that was predicted twenty years ago by Shelankov and Berry: a quantum force (Nature Communications, 10, Article number: 1700 (2019). This provides new insight into a textbook quantum-mechanical phenomenon: the famous Aharonov-Bohm effect. This is a rare effect which was thought to occur without an accompanying classical force. The new insight is that there is something like a quantum force. (b) The machines we have built to find such new quantum phenomena push technological boundaries and force us to develop new technologies. Within this project, three examples of such technologies were developed. At the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, we observed the extremely feeble (10 pico-Newton) and short-lived (10 femto-second) force between two electrons in free flight (Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 180602 (2021). This paves the way to a new microscopy: electron-correlation microscopy. This is a technique that starts to &ldquo;see&rdquo; things when two electrons get so close that they start to see each other. And as they do so, how they see each other can in principle be influenced by what they are close to, such as a small specimen under a microscope. The vision is: where normal microscopy becomes diffraction limited and cannot resolve features anymore, that is where electron correlation microscopy begins.</p>\n<p>We also disclosed an invention using 3D-printed conductive plastics parts, and in collaboration with Prof. T.J. Gay, we developed a patented ultrafast spin-polarized electron source. Both of these developments were inspired by the technological demands of such microscopy. The 3D-printed components such as lenses and deflectors usually have a dozen parts in them, can now be made as one part. &nbsp;Additionally, in collaboration with Oak Ridge National Lab, we used optical fibers as new electron sources. By firing laser light through a flexible optical fiber to illuminate its tapered, metal-coated nanotip from within, a more easily maneuverable tool was created for probing surfaces. We were surprised to find that these sources could be operated at very low laser intensity, moving away from lasers that exceed $100k to simple diode lasers that cost less than $1k.
