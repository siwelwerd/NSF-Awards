 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 50-person, two-day 2018 Workshop: \"Integrating Neurophotonics, Statistical Physics, and Control Theory for Advancing Neuroscience\" will identify research efforts that will be needed to close the gaps between the future potential and the current state-of-the-art in neurophotonic-sensing and modulation and big data as it relates to advancing our understanding of the rules of the functioning brain. The discussions among the multi-disciplinary participants will help to define the challenges and questions that should be addressed given the recent explosive growth in neurophotonics and big data technological capabilities for studying the brain. Inclusion of young scientists in the workshop will bring fresh perspective to the discussions and foster their career development through the interactions and networking. Specific major outcomes of the workshop will include the increased awareness of research, education, and technology transfer related to neurophotonics and big data; ideas enabling the transformation of research and STEM education; partnership opportunities among government, academia, industry, and the general public; and synergism for transformative activities in the application of neurophotonics and big data technology.\r\n\r\nThe Workshop will provide a forum for disseminating information and sharing ideas about the frontiers of neuro-sensing and modulation with light and the integration with statistical modeling, machine learning, and control theory. The workshop will contribute toward defining the important topics and questions to be addressed with future research, and will identify research directions and opportunities that, if pursued, can initiate new developments in neurotechnology and computational neuroscience / big data modeling that will lead to new break-through neuroscientific studies. The workshop will result in a comprehensive publishable document that will be widely distributed in the SPIE journal Neurophotonics. This workshop will be a two-day event on October 22-23, 2018, in Alexandria, Virginia. The workshop will focus on three themes: reviewing the frontiers of neuro-sensing and modulation with light and the intersection with big data methods; exploring the opportunities for neurophotonic methods to integrate with big data methods to significantly advance the impact on neuroscientific studies; and defining novel neuroscientific studies to guide the integration and advancement of these technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
