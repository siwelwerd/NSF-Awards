 "awd_abstract_narration": "Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) is NSF's flagship cybersecurity research program. It approaches security and privacy from a socio-technical viewpoint that involves addressing deep scientific and engineering problems as well as vulnerabilities that arise from human behaviors. With the increasing importance of cybersecurity to the nation as a whole, and to the Foundation as a research area, improving communication between program officers and researchers supported by NSF and other government funding agencies, coordination among researchers from the different perspectives sponsored by SaTC, and outreach to the broader community are all increasingly important. \r\n\r\nThe SaTC program provides national visibility with the participation of the NSF Directorates for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Education and Human Resources (EHR), Engineering (ENG), Mathematics and Physical Sciences (MPS), and Social, Behavioral, and Economics Sciences (SBE). There are currently over 850 active awards in the program. The 2019 Pincipal Investigator meeting will be a major event for the community, bringing together researchers and government and industry representatives. This project covers venue and conference logistics, including conference registration, audio visual, and meeting space.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
