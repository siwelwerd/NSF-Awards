 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past several decades, isotope geochemistry has proven to be a critical tool for exploring the geologic history of the Earth, development of the solar system, past climates, and human interaction with the natural environment. The Multicollector Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) acquired through this grant will provide high-precision isotope measurements of multiple elements that may be found in minute quantities. It will support on-going research in the broad field of Earth, environmental and planetary science. Projects are currently funded by NSF and NASA. The MC-ICP-MS will allow UNLV faculty and students, as well as their collaborators in Nevada and throughout the United States, to explore new research frontiers and foster their success in current and future projects. The new instrument will be available to the entire southern Nevada community, particularly colleges and K-12 schools, who would otherwise not have access to such a state-of-the-art analytical facility. The instrument will also be used as a teaching facility to educate and train graduate and undergraduate students in state-of-the-art analytical techniques. This will help to increase the participation of women and underrepresented students in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nOver the past several decades, isotope geochemistry has proven to be a critical tool for exploring the geologic history of the Earth, development of the solar system, past climates, and human interaction with the natural environment. The cutting-edge of these studies requires accurate and precise measurement of isotope ratios for Sr, Nd, Hf and Pb as radiogenic isotope tracers, and Mg, Ca, Ti, Fe, Zn and U as stable isotope tracers. The Multicollector Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) acquired through this grant will serve as the centerpiece for a laboratory capable of measuring both stable and radiogenic isotopes at extremely high precision. Fields of study include, but are not limited to, igneous and metamorphic petrology, high and low temperature geochemistry, economic geology, tectonics, high pressure mineralogy, (geo)archaeology, paleoenvironmental changes across critical transitions, climate change, sedimentary geology, and planetary science.  It will serve both internal and external users, including the faculty and students at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) and within the Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE), as well as their collaborators from Robeson Community College, the University of North Carolina at Pembroke, Appalachian State University, University of California, Riverside, and California State University Fresno. The new instrument will be available to the entire southern Nevada community, particularly colleges and K-12 schools, who would otherwise not have access to such a state-of-the-art analytical facility. The instrument will also be used as a teaching facility to educate and train graduate and undergraduate students in state-of-the-art analytical techniques and their applications to Earth, environmental and planetary sciences. This will help to increase the participation of women and underrepresented students in STEM fields. UNLV is among the most diverse campuses in the US and is designated as an Asian-American, Native-American, Pacific Islander, and Hispanic Serving Institution.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
