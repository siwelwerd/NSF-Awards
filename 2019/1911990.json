 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: \r\nThe PIs request funds to provide training in leading and organizing research cruises to early career researchers in the areas of Biological and Chemical Oceanography. Participants in this training program would be introduced to pre-cruise planning and logistics, receive training in commonly used oceanographic sampling equipment, and conduct shipboard measurements during a 10-day oceanographic cruise to the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG). The goal of this training program is to prepare early career scientists for leading and participating in interdisciplinary oceanographic research at sea. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts \r\nThe proposed program addresses the broader impacts criteria successfully. The research cruise and follow-up reports and publications focus on interdisciplinary questions important for advancing the field. Given the rapid changes that oceanic systems are undergoing, it is important to have a cadre of junior scientists who are adept at managing interdisciplinary collaborations and conducting research at sea. The PIs are considering ways to connect with diverse audiences in recruiting participants. The impact on early career oceanographers will be very strong. This will create an experience that will be a major impact on the careers of the trainees, especially if they stay in the oceanography field. \r\n\r\nThe Statement of Merit Review \r\n This statement is non-editable and added to every proposal Abstract once it has been saved in eJacket. This statement is viewable after the Abstract has been saved, and is read-only.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project provided training in the execution and leadership of a research cruise for 18 early career scientists. The early career scientists included 9 early career faculty (Assistant Professors and Assistant Scientists), 8 post-doctoral scholars, and 1 graduate student. Project participants planned and executed a 10-day research cruise aboard the intermediate/ocean class research vessel&nbsp;<em>Kilo Moana</em>&nbsp;in the waters north of Oahu, Hawaii.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit:&nbsp;</strong>The project enabled early career oceanographic scientists to collect valuable data specific to chemical and biological oceanography. The overarching scientific focus of the project was to quantify processes linking the transfer of elements (e.g., carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus) from the well-lit upper ocean to the dimly-lit interior waters. All sampling for the cruise occurred at Station ALOHA (22&deg;45' N, 158&deg;W), the field site for the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) program. By concentrating sampling on this well-studied ecosystem, project participants benefitted from the wealth of time-resolved data and scientific infrastructure (i.e., personnel, equipment) available at this sampling location, allowing contextual framing of this project's research focus. The resulting cruise data have already resulted in one peer-reviewed publication and two other manuscripts in the final stages of peer-review. In addition, preliminary data acquired as part of this project also contributed to the development of at least 4 proposals submitted to the National Science Foundation, with two of these proposals resulting in funded awards.&nbsp;While at sea, project participants worked in research teams to address key science questions related the transfer and cycling of bioelements between the upper ocean and deeper interior waters. Project teams developed research foci that involved quantification of ocean particles, including their concentration, sinking, elemental content, and size; measurements of net and gross primary production; quantification of upper ocean bioelemental inventories; and zooplankton energetics, vertical migration, and movement of material from the upper ocean to the deep sea.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong>&nbsp;Chief scientist training for this project began with a series of pre-cruise workshops that included videoconferences and an in-person workshop held in Honolulu, Hawaii, immediately prior to the research cruise.
