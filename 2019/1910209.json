 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is part of a collaborative project to understand how massive black holes form and grow in galaxies in the early universe. The team will use computer simulations of the birth and growth of galaxies in the early universe with different black hole formation models. They will then look for differences in the predicted gravitational wave events between models. They will also search through the simulations for expected optical events that would be associated with the growth of black holes and possible gravitational wave events.\r\n\r\nThis collaborative project will look at three different black hole seeding mechanisms in cosmological simulations with galaxy formation models as in the IllustrisTNG simulations. These will be traced through hydrodynamical cosmological simulations to determine the astrophysical information that can be extracted from gravitational wave detection of merging massive black holes and electromagnetic observations of galaxies at high redshifts. The data from the simulations will be made public.\r\n\r\nThis project advances the goals of the NSF Windows on the Universe Big Idea.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMassive black holes (MBHs) are millions to billions of times the mass of the sun and live in the centers of nearly all massive galaxies.  These incredible monoliths are the most massive objects in the Universe, the brightest persistent emission sources, and in many cases are responsible for transforming the properties and evolution of entire galaxies.  None the less, there are very few observational constraints on the physics of their formation in the early Universe.  For this reason, a number of different formation pathways have been proposed: (I) the collapse of millions of solar masses of gas directly into a high mass black-hole seed, (II) the runaway merger of stars in dense stellar clusters, and (III) the runaway growth through rapid accretion of the very first stars (Population III) stars.  All three models are able to reproduce current observations with traditional telescopes.  However, in the coming years, new experiments will open an entirely new window into the evolution of MBHs by measuring the low-frequency gravitational waves they produce when binary MBHs merge.\n\nWith this grant, our group has significantly advanced the methods used in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to model the formation of MBH 'seeds' in the high-redshift Universe.  Past models have almost entirely used un-physical prescriptions that inject MBHs into galaxies once they pass a certain threshold mass across the galaxy.  Our models are instead based on the local physics of the most dense gaseous regions in early galaxies.  We have implemented different seeding criteria based on density and temperature thresholds, in addition to the angular momentum structure and radiation field all restricted to the detailed environment in which MBHs form.  Crucially, we have found that by tuning these relative criteria, we are able to reproduce the expected properties of all three classes of seed-formation scenarios.  We have also demonstrated that these models can be implemented in both cosmological \"zoom-in\" simulations to probe groups of galaxies at high-resolution, in addition to larger uniform boxes which capture the statistics of large number of galaxies.  In our on-going work, we are developing the production simulations runs that we will use to calculate the variations in gravitational wave signals produces by these different seeding prescriptions.  As gravitational waves begin to be detected by pulsar timing arrays in the next few years, and by the spaced based LISA interferometer in the next decade, these models will be used to produce pivotal constraints on how these mysterious behemoths form from infant galaxies in the early Universe.\n\nIn addition to crucial scientific advancements, this award has also supported an expansion of the Women in Physics and Astronomy program at the University of Florida Gainesville.  In particular, a popular lecture series has been developed which brings leading women scientists to discuss their work and achievements, in addition to a substantially expanded mentoring program for women and minoritized junior scientists.  These developments have been particularly important during the pandemic as many existing support structures became harder to access.  This grant also directly supported two undergraduate students who participated in the Northwestern University Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program.  Both students, one of whom is now enrolled in an astronomy graduate program, contributed to the development of black hole models in our simulations including improvements in the dynamical evolution of black hole particles in the turbulent environments of galactic nuclei.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/10/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Luke Z Kelley"
