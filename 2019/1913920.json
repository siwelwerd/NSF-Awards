 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses two key tensions in flood and drought mitigation: tradeoffs between minimizing flood and drought risk, and tradeoffs in the choice of where in the system to invest in risk mitigation. This project will study these tradeoffs through detailed case studies in distinct hydro-climatic and governance settings: Lake Mendocino, California and Danjiangkou Reservoir in Hubei Province, China. In both cases, water managers are exploring the use of streamflow forecasts to improve reservoir operations for flood control and water supply under changing conditions. This project will collect and analyze data on hydrology, infrastructure and decision making to study the impacts of operational changes and identify strategies that facilitate adaptation. A model will be developed to test how practices to reduce flood and drought impacts interact across scales (e.g., regional, municipal) and respond to change, in different environmental and social settings. The project team will work with decision makers to learn from their experiences and develop tools that fit their needs. The project will also provide education and training opportunities for the next-generation workforce in hydrology and water resources systems analysis through mentored research experiences and new course modules.\r\n\r\nThis project will address three key questions: 1) How will a change in reservoir operations propagate through the partially-engineered, partially-evolving watershed system? 2) What characteristics of the hydrological or governance system affect this propagation? 3) What institutional design choices enable adaptive management? While the case-based models developed can address the research question in two specific contexts, the project also aims to derive generalizable knowledge about the features and processes critical to mitigating flood and drought risk as well as insights into unintended fragilities. To build theory, the project will also generate a differential equation-based socio-hydrological model of a generic reservoir and watershed system. This model will be used to explore the system-level patterns that emerge in the long-run under a range of conditions, which will enable us to build theory on the hydrological and institutional factors critical to understanding the effects of reservoir operating rule changes. In summary, this work will advance knowledge of adaptive flood and drought management in four ways: 1) illustrate the tradeoffs between flood and drought mitigation goals in reservoir operations across scales; 2) identify the processes through which reservoir operation changes propagate through the system; 3) quantify the benefits and limitations of controlling streamflow variability; and 4) demonstrate the impact of institutional design choices in detecting critical changes and facilitating response. This new knowledge will address the practical challenge of planning for higher streamflow variability, while mitigating the risk of generating unintended fragilities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

To address these goals, the team investigated two cases: the Lake Mendocino Reservoir in California, USA and the Ameghino Reservoir in Chubut, Argentina. The two cases have several characteristics in common including watersheds shaped by human activity, multiple water users with diverging priorities, and recent droughts and floods which have challenged reservoir operators and water agencies. However, the cases differ in their broader regulatory environment. Rules in California have been enforced consistently, whereas enforcement in Chubut is more selective.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>To understand the hydrological variables that influence streamflow and the conditions for reservoir operation, we began with an existing method - the top-down modeling method - which incrementally develops a hydrological model of appropriate complexity to understand which processes are important in a particular watershed.&nbsp; We expanded this method to include human activities and their impact on streamflow, as seen in Figure 1. This step by step approach enables researchers to understand which human activities are shaping streamflow and what effect they have.&nbsp; This modeling approach was first developed for the Lake Mendocino watershed and then refined through application to the Ameghino Reservoir watershed. This modeling approach was also shared with our project partners through a workshop held at the Patagonic Institute for the Study of Continental Ecosystems, part of the National Patagonic Center in Argentina.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>To understand how the structure and formal processes of water management influence response to changing conditions, we conducted interviews and analyzed official documents. We conducted a series of interviews with experts involved in reservoir operation, water supply management and flood control in both cases. The interviews were complemented by an analysis of official documents describing the rules for reservoir operation, flood control and water supply provision in each case. We analyzed this data to identify the similarities and differences in governance in the two cases. This data also enabled the development of a novel method to identify and quantify the interdependence of infrastructure components through networks of rules. The utility of this is it enables us to understand how changing environmental conditions or changing operations for one infrastructure component can propagate and impact the performance of other interconnected infrastructure components. This is particularly impactful during extreme events such as flood or drought and can inform the design of infrastructure management and operation rules.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>We then developed a dynamical systems model to assess how hydrology, infrastructure and governance interact to shape the way the system responds to change. The model developed captures three key components: 1) the reservoir and its operation, 2) floodplain development and flood response of a representative downstream community, and 3) water demand and agricultural production of a representative downstream community. In the model decisions of reservoir operators are determined by pre-defined operation rules, short-term forecasts, and their memory of previous impacts experienced (e.g. flood damage, water supply reduction). In the floodplain development and agricultural water demand and production components, we considered that water users may adapt to hydrological variability while adjusting their water demand and land use patterns. Figure 2 shows these different activities across an example watershed and Figure 3 illustrates how centralized infrastructure capacity can influence adaptive capacity across the watershed over time. Figure 4 shows the model components and their relationships. We applied this model to explore the effects of different hydrological scenarios, the role of operator cognitive biases, and different operational rules in shaping flood and drought impacts.
