The symposium organizers are Eugenia Kharlampieva (University of Alabama at Birmingham), Andrew Goodwin (University of Colorado Boulder), and Jesse Jokerst (University of California, San Diego). The symposium will be open to all interested scientists/engineers actively working on topics related to acoustically-active particles for biomedical applications. NSF funding is requested specifically to partially offset the costs for  young researchers including  junior faculty, graduate students or postdoctoral fellows to attend the conference and present the results of their research efforts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Known for its excellent penetration depth and safe procedures, ultrasound imaging is a mainstay in the medical imaging world. Yet, only recently have colloidal structures been developed that can reliably interact with acoustic energies produce a defined sound output. This symposium served as a scientific forum for discussion of fundamentals of in the field of biomaterials colloidal science and acoustic interactions.

The symposium was a successful platform for scientists and engineers involved in synthesis of biologically relevant colloidal structures that can reliably interact with acoustic energies and in sharing the most recent advances made in the rapidly expanding field.  \n\nBroader Impact. The symposium brought together leading scientists working in the interdisciplinary area of biomaterials synthesis, properties, and applications. This symposium hosted one full day of fifteen oral presentations that included six newly appointed assistant professors as well as five well-established researchers in academia and industry, three postdoctoral scholars, and a graduate student who showcased their research and emphasized new trends and future directions at the interface  of colloidal science and acoustic interactions.
