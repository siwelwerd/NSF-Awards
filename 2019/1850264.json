 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern localization systems such as the Global Positioning System have widely demonstrated vulnerabilities to signal-spoofing and jamming attacks. With the advent of autonomous cyber-physical systems such as self-driving cars and unmanned aerial vehicles, the ability to securely estimate, track and verify one's location is increasingly critical, indicative of a strong need to realize localization systems that are resilient to modern day cyber-physical attacks. This project pursues this vision by evaluating and understanding the bottlenecks in realizing a secure wide-area localization system, and offering solutions to overcome them.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop methods to enhance the security of existing localization systems with both near- and long-term deployment strategies. The project seeks to design several attack detection and mitigation techniques that can be implemented on currently deployed devices without requiring significant modifications to existing infrastructure. The project will also develop novel technologies that leverage and build robust recovery mechanisms using a combination of advanced signal processing, machine learning, and sensor fusion techniques. Holistic experimental evaluations of cyber-physical attacks against popular localization systems and their fail-safe technologies will likewise be conducted, alongside the evaluation of location spoofing attacks across geographic areas and networks due to the interdependencies and retroactions of today's networked systems. The project will explore the tension that exists between building a wide-area localization system that is both scalable and secure, thereby laying a foundation for future research in this area.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBuilding a secure positioning system that is as scalable, provides wide-area coverage and as accurate as GPS is a hard problem that spans multiple layers (i.e., physical to application). The main goal of the project is to kickstart the efforts by first evaluating and securing popular wide-area localization systems such as GPS against attacks. The project consisted of three major goals: (i) Vulnerability and Impact Assessment.  (ii) Realization of Secure End-devices. and (iii) Building Resilient-Infrastructure. \n\nMerit Outcomes\n\nThe outcomes of the three major tasks are as follows:\n\ni) Vulnerability and Impact Assessment.\n\nWe performed the first security and privacy analysis of Wi-Fi FTM and analyzed its guarantees across the logical and physical layers. We find the IEEE 802.11 mc protocol vulnerable to a wide variety of distance manipulation attacks, allowing an adversary to introduce distance reductions and enlargements to any arbitrary attacker-chosen value. Our privacy analysis reveals the protocol leaks location-sensitive information,e.g., a passive eavesdropper is able to physically locate any client by learning its measured distance by simply observing Wi-Fi FTM transactions using commodity Wi-Fi hardware. \n\nWe evaluated the security guarantees of INS-aided GPS tracking and navigation for road transportation systems. We demonstrated that it is indeed possible for an attacker to hijack vehicles far away from the intended destination or take an alternate route without triggering any alarms even though the GPS location as well as inertial sensors are continuously monitored.\n\nWe investigated the security of aircraft instrument landing systems against wireless attacks. We demonstrated on aviation-grade ILS receivers that it is possible to fully and in fine-grain control the course deviation indicator as displayed by the ILS receiver, in real-time.\n\n(ii) Realization of Secure End-devices.\n\nWe designed a single-antenna GPS receiver for UAVs that autonomously recovers and continues to output legitimate location even against strong adversaries capable of stealthy and seamless takeover. \n\nWe developed V-Range, the first secure ranging system that is fully compatible with 5G standards and can be implemented directly on top of existing 5G-NR transceivers.\n\n\n\n(iii) Building Resilient-Infrastructure. \n\nThe bi-directional communication requirement of achieving secure positioning inherently leaks location information and does not scale well. To this extent, we have developed a privacy-preserving and scalable Wi-Fi positioning system. Our system design hides the presence of a client, leverages existing Wi-Fi infrastructure, requires no hardware changes, and significantly improves the overall scalability of the positioning system.\n\nBroader Impact\n\nThe security analysis of 802.11mc protocol identified several critical vulnerabilities in Qualcomm, Google, and Intel devices. All were responsibly disclosed (e.g, CVE-2020-11270, CVE-2020-11280, CVE-2020-11281, CVE-2020-11287, CVE-2021-1887).\nThe WiFi FTM analysis results and data are available for the open research community. Website\nThe design of Semper-Fi, the anti-spoofing GPS receiver has been open-sourced. Website\nThe project made key contributions toward the development of our WiFi testing framework. Website\nOur security analysis of aircraft instrument landing systems intiated discussions with several stakeholders in the aviation ecosystem and has resulted in additional ongoing projects.\nThe project largely supported two graduate students and has informed the design of pre-college cyber security and privacy courses for high-school students, specifically from under-represented minority districts. The research results have been included as part of a demonstration of the state of wireless security today to further motivate the youngsters to take up cyber-security research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Aanjhan Ranganathan"
