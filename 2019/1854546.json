 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Johns Hopkins Mathematics Department jointly with the Japan-U.S. Mathematics Institute (JAMI) plan to organize a workshop on the week of October 14-20 2019 with the title \"Riemann-Roch in Characteristic One and Related Topics.\" This meeting will be a main scientific activity for the department in the Fall semester 2019 and a principal activity of the Japan-U.S. Institute for the academic year 2019-20. The Johns Hopkins mathematics department has always been an international center for mathematical research cooperating fruitfully (since 1988) with the Japan-U.S. Mathematics Institute. JAMI is an internationally renowned scientific Institution based at Johns Hopkins University, whose main goal is to broaden the education and stimulate the research of mathematicians at all levels of seniority and to foster collaboration in mathematical research through a broad spectrum of programs in mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe interactions between the fields of noncommutative arithmetic geometry,  tropical geometry, the theory of toposes and mathematical logic, optimization and game theory have matured quite rapidly in the last few years and have produced very exciting results. It seems quite timely to organize  a workshop at Johns Hopkins University, with the goal of coordinating these diverse research areas and with a common aim that turns out to be deeply related to the Riemann Hypothesis (RH).\r\n\r\nMore information can be found at https://mathematics.jhu.edu/events/jami/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
