 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to introduce a novel and renewably resource-derived polymer, Polyacrylated Glycerol (PAG), to the asphalt road maintenance industry.  The project will demonstrate the performance and efficiency of PAG to improve the performance and life expectancy of common asphalt maintenance applications.  If successful, this project will create a pathway to new demand for glycerol, a significant byproduct of the bio-diesel industry.  Furthermore, it will create the potential to replace up to 50,000 tons per year of petroleum-derived polymers with a green product having significant renewable content. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project will explore the potential for PAG elastomers to perform as adhesion promoters, sealants, primers, and asphalt additives in asphalt roadway maintenance applications.  A series of laboratory produced PAG polymers with variations in molecular weight, average acrylic functionality, and residual acrylic acid comonomer content will be explored using  a series of laboratory-based tests designed to characterize performance of asphalt primers, seal coats, tack coats, micro surfacing, and chip seals modified with the PAG polymers.  In addition, this Phase 1 project will explore the potential to scale-up the manufacturing of the PAG polymer from a laboratory scale to pilot scale.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Most asphalt maintenance products involve asphalt emulsions--solutions formed from the stabilization of asphalt droplets using a surfactant in water.  We hypothesized that properly designed polymers can improve adhesion of asphalt to aggregate surfaces, thereby increasing performance and reducing life cycle costs associated with asphalt maintenance products, including seal coats, tack coats, micro surfacing, and chip seals.\n\nBackground Statement:  After receiving notice of its phase 1 award, Adventus Material Strategies lost access to the licensed technology for the Polyacrylated Glycerol (PAG) polymer system.  This polymer was synthesized using a proprietary Radical Addition-Fragmentation Chain Transfer (RAFT) polymerization process patented by Iowa State University Research Foundation (ISURF).1  In consultation with the program director and ISURF, the objective was shifted to evaluate a series of novel bio-polymers based on polyacrylated, epoxidized, high oleic soybean oil (PAEHOSO).2  PAEHOSO technology was not encumbered with pre-existing license agreements, enabling Adventus to secure a license.\n\nPhase 1:  Polymer Synthesis:  This phase involved synthesis of PAEHOSO bio-polymers by the team at Iowa State University, led by Professor Cochran.  The work was accomplished under a sub-award agreement and involved copolymerizing water-insoluble PAEHOSO with comonomers to render the polymer water dispersible.  Similar to the PAG polymer, acrylic acid (AA) was used to drive water dispersibility.  The polymers comprised various levels of AA , ranging from 30% to 70% AA, by mass, with the balance PAEHOSO.

Bio-polymers were introduced as mono-phase emulsions (bio-polymer first added to asphalt) or bi-phase emulsions (bio-polymer added to soap solution or post-added to asphalt emulsion).  Bio-polymers were also evaluated as neat additives applied directly to the substrate or aggregates.\n\n \n\nTable 2:  Plan for Testing Asphalt Maintenance Products with Bio-Polymers\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication Method\n\n\n\nTack Coat\n\n\n\nSeal Coat\n\n\n\nMicro Surfacing\n\n\n\nChip Seal\n\n\n\n\n\nNeat polymer\n\n\n\nASTM D711; Florida Bond Test\n\n\n\n(primer only) ASTM D2486\n\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n(primer only) ASTM D7000\n\n\n\n\n\nBi-phase emulsion\n\n\n\nASTM D711; Florida Bond Test\n\n\n\nASTM D2486; Wet Track Abrasion\n\n\n\nASTM D2486; Wet Track Abrasion\n\n\n\nASTM D7000\n\n\n\n\n\nMono-phase emulsion\n\n\n\nASTM D711; Florida Bond Test\n\n\n\nASTM D2486; Wet Track Abrasion\n\n\n\nASTM D2486; Wet Track Abrasion\n\n\n\nASTM D7000\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThe following outcomes were noted:\n\nBio-polymers showed no improvement in Tack Coat tracking resistance, nor in interlayer bond shear strength vs. controls\n\n\nBio-polymers showed no improvement in Seal Coat Wet Track Abrasion mass loss vs. controls when used as a primer nor in bi-phase emulsions by post-addition; anionic mono-phase emulsions showed chemical incompatibility with clay slips\n\n\nThe PAA/PAEHOSO polymer was inferior to controls in Micro Surfacing Wet Track Abrasion; the PEGMA/PAEHOSO variant showed lower mass loss vs. controls (a positive outcome) in bi-phase emulsions by post-addition\n\n\nBio-polymers showed no improvement in chip seal aggregate retention vs. controls using any means of application\n\n\nCationic mono-phase emulsions indicated chemical incompatibility between cationic surfactants and both bio-polymer variants\n\n\nThe PAA/PAHEOSO polymer behaved as an emulsion thickening agent when added to soap solutions with non-ionic surfactants (an unexpected, potentially useful outcome)\n\n\n \n\nReferences:\n\n1.
