 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2020 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey (CMPS) will expand the highly-successful, groundbreaking 2016 CMPS, which broadens the scope of access to high-quality national survey data with large and generalizable samples of racial and ethnic groups in the United States. These samples allow for the analysis of an individual group or comparative analysis across groups. The CMPS is changing the way data is collected and shared in the social sciences and collaboratively building a diverse and inclusive academic pipeline of scholars in political science and the social sciences more broadly. With questions that focus explicitly on race, immigration, and politics, as well as the inclusion of large samples of White and non-White individuals, U.S.-born and foreign-born respondents, voters and non-voters, the 2020 CMPS will provide essential empirical information on the state of political inclusion, democratic participation, and policy support in an increasingly diverse United States. The 2020 CMPS project will have a broad and positive impact on society in two ways. First, the collaborative and inclusive model of data collection, research and professional development activities will increase the participation of underrepresented minorities, women and first-generation scholars in academia. Second, the results of the survey will advance societal understanding of intra- and inter-group relations, policy support, and civic and political participation.  \r\n\r\nThis project will continue the Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey (CMPS). The 2020 CMPS will include an estimated total of 20,000 completed interviews among Asian (n=4,000), African American (n=4,000), Latino/a  (n=4,000), White (n=2,000), Native American (n=1,000), Native Hawaiian (n=1,000), Black immigrant (n=1,000), Afro-Caribbean (n=1,000) as well as a sample of Muslim respondents (n=1,000) and LGBTQ (n=1,000). Survey data will be collected online in a respondent self-administered format following the 2020 Presidential Election. The survey (and invitation) will be available to respondents in English, Spanish, Chinese (simplified and traditional), Korean, Vietnamese, and Arabic. The 2020 CMPS will include adult, registered and non-registered voters. The survey will include a demographic module and three additional modules: (1) group identities and intergroup attitudes; (2) immigration; and (3) political engagement and civic participation. Using the collaborative, inclusive model of resource-sharing the PIs developed in 2016, the 2020 CMPS will expand research and professional development opportunities for a larger number of junior and senior faculty, a host of outstanding undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral fellows from large research institutions, smaller liberal arts colleges, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), through direct contribution to the content and analysis of the survey. The 2020 CMPS will continue to invest time and resources in an inclusive group of scholars, but particularly women, underrepresented minority and first generation undergraduate and graduate students, junior faculty and postdoctoral fellows, through conferences, workshops, as well as sustained mentorship, research and publishing opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
