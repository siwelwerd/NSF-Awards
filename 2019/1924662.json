 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently, strawberry production in the United States is decreasing due to labor shortages and the ever-increasing cost of labor, particularly for harvesting. A high cost of production could put strawberry-growers in the U.S. at a disadvantage in comparison to countries whose cost of labor is much less. In order to make strawberry production in the U.S. competitive with the rest of the world, production costs need to be reduced. This project aims to investigate developing a small, rugged, and cost-effective co-robot system that can be used by growers, which will ultimately lower the harvesting costs and increase profitability of strawberry production. Additionally, the research results can benefit other high value specialty crops, such as tomatoes and blueberries, as they are facing similar labor shortage issues. This multi-disciplinary research will enrich course curricula which benefits a large number of students at three participating universities, and will provide research and development experiences to students of underrepresented and minority backgrounds. The outreach component of the project will educate K-12 students and the general public about robotics in agriculture via conferences, workshops, field days, and other learning engagement activities. Additionally, a graphic user interface will be developed, which is adaptable as an assistive device to benefit users with disabilities. \r\n\r\nThe project includes three primary research thrusts. The first thrust will investigate a decentralized, scalable row allocation algorithm for robots to achieve a consensus about which rows to harvest, in order to achieve an overall minimum time in harvesting. The algorithm is expected to be scalable, efficient, fast, non-conflicting, and simple. The second thrust will develop an integrated multi-exposure fusion, curvature analysis and hierarchical image processing algorithm. Supported by the end-to-end deep learning technique, the algorithm will detect strawberries, stems, and vines in field environments with a high accuracy. The third research thrust involves a study of a parallel delta robot-arm based manipulation system for picking and transporting harvested fruits. The associated amount of movements will be minimized. These three thrusts will be complemented by many other engineering tasks and a detailed cost analysis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The overall goal of this research project was to use small cooperative harvesting robots, instead of monolithic, large harvesters, in strawberry harvesting to reduce the cost and dependence on harvest labor. Three universities were involved in this NSF-funded project, and each university oversaw the development of one of the main subsystems of the robotic strawberry harvesting system. The team included PIs from the University of Central Florida (lead institute), Washington State University, and the University of California, Merced. PIs at the University of California, Merced, were in charge of developing the robotic arm and end effector for harvesting strawberries. A robot arm and end effector were designed and fabricated. It was tested under laboratory and field conditions. Tests showed it's good at picking strawberries, with a success rate of about 80% to 100% of the time without damaging the fruits. It takes about 8.5 seconds to pick each fruit, usually getting it right on the first try. This speed can be increased if needed. In addition, two special controllers for the arm were developed and tested. The controllers help the robot move and grab strawberries smoothly, even when there is a backlash in the joint of the robotic arm. The system was cost-effective and was able to work under harsh field conditions. Two harvesting robotic arms were fabricated and sent to the University of Central Florida to be integrated into the platforms that they were designed and fabricated. The robotic harvesting system for strawberries can potentially help small and large strawberry growers pick up strawberries more efficiently and potentially reduce production costs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/26/2023<br>\nModified by: Reza&nbsp;J&nbsp;Ehsani</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1924662/1924662_10637855_1703616765443_Arm_on_robot--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1924662/1924662_10637855_1703616765443_Arm_on_robot--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Robotic arm\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1924662/1924662_10637855_1703616765443_Arm_on_robot--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Robotic arm\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Strawberry harvesting arm installed on harvesting robot.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Reza Ehsani</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Reza&nbsp;J&nbsp;Ehsani\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Robotic arm</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1924662/1924662_10637855_1703616641528_Arm_componenets--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1924662/1924662_10637855_1703616641528_Arm_componenets--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Robotic arm\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1924662/1924662_10637855_1703616641528_Arm_componenets--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Robotic arm\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Components of robotic arm and end effector for harvesting strawberries</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Reza Ehsani</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Reza&nbsp;J&nbsp;Ehsani\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Robotic arm</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1924662/1924662_10637855_1703616502421_end_effector--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1924662/1924662_10637855_1703616502421_end_effector--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"End-effector\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1924662/1924662_10637855_1703616502421_end_effector--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"End-effector\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Drawing of the end effector for strawberry harvesting robot</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Reza Ehsani</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Reza&nbsp;J&nbsp;Ehsani\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">End-effector</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
