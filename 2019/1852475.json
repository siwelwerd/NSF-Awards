 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site award renews an exemplary REU site at Oakland University.   Each summer, undergraduate students from across the nation will work on challenging research problems related to cybersecurity, an area of national priority for our nation. The site includes a strong research component combined with professional development opportunities for the participating undergraduate students.  The team will continue to use successful strategies employed in past REU Sites to recruit undergraduate students from groups traditionally under-represented in computer science. A particular focus will be on recruiting women and students from institutions where there are limited research opportunities.  The ultimate goal is to contribute to the development of a diverse scientific workforce with expertise in areas critical to national security in the evolving global society of the future.\r\n\r\nThis project is led by an outstanding team offering research experiences in topics that are current and of national interest. Students will learn how to use tools and techniques to solve problems that are timely and of relevance to the field of computer science as well as to our nation.  The students are immersed into a research environment with all of its facets: participating actively in shaping a research project and in defining the solution; communicating to peers and other audiences about the research and their findings; visiting research laboratories and attending scientific and technical presentations;  and forming collegial relationships with research teams that include faculty, graduate students, and other scientific researchers.  The resulting research is often presented at professional conferences and included in technical publications thus contributing to the body of research critical to sustaining secure and trustworthy cyberspace.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The <strong>major goal</strong>&nbsp;of this REU Site is to each year engage 10 undergraduate students, particularly <em>women and Under Represented Minorities (URMs)</em>, in 10-week summer research experiences that <em>excite and motivate them to embark upon graduate studies and pursue careers in science and engineering</em>.&nbsp;The <strong>intellectual focus</strong> for the REU Site is Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC).&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>1. Diversity: </strong>We have a diverse group of REU participants during 2019-2023. A total of <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">31</span></strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> undergraduate students, <strong>12</strong> of them female, <strong>3</strong> Hispanic, <strong>6</strong> African Americans, from <strong>22</strong> different universities across the U.S.</span>, have successfully taken part in the program. The students came from a variety of institutions, including 4-year colleges, colleges with limited graduate programs, and institutions designated by the Carnegie Foundation as being research intensive and extensive universities, as well as community colleges. Most had no prior research or co-op/internship.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>2. Publications, Awards and Scholarships: </strong>The REU research projects carried out by the REU students during 2019-2023 have directly resulted in <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">3 </span></strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">conference presentations, <strong>15</strong> poster presentations, and <strong>1</strong> best paper award</span>. Some UnCoRe participants received scholarships by the graduate schools where they were admitted. Below we only list a sample publications, awards and scholarships that resulted directly from the student research at UnCoRe during 2019-2023.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Two (2) female REU participants won the Best Paper Award at the 2022 International Conference on Internet of Things.</li>\n<li>One (1) REU participant won the student scholarship to pursue a Master&rsquo;s degree at GaTech.</li>\n<li>Two (2) REU participants and Dr. Fu were interviewed by the TV7 (WXYZ-DET (ABC) - Detroit, MI) on Jul 17, 2019 to comment on the cybersecurity concerns of FaceApp. The interview ran in Detroit, Miami, Houston, Jacksonville, Orlando, San Antonio, and Roanoke.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Students Perceptions, Preparation, and Attitude: </strong>Students recruited to participate in UnCoRe come into the program with very little or no research literacy as illustrated by the answers they provide in the initial research quiz. As they leave the program, the students not only acquire literacy in all aspects of research through experience, but also gain a positive appreciation of computing, familiarity with some of the computing research literature, form a network of faculty and other researchers that they can use as mentors and resource for advice, and gain an understanding of how the research they conducted fits within the larger context. This statement is based on the answers the students provide on the exit surveys and our analysis of the data.</p>\n<p>On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being poor and 5 being excellent, students in all cohorts have consistently reported satisfaction with the program. For example, in 2021, students reported that they became <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">familiar with the relevant scientific literature for their research projects (4.8 rating), developed a sense of how their research contributes to scientific knowledge (4.3 rating), developed a mentor relationship with faculty on whom they can call for guidance in the future (4.4 rating), understood the practical applications of their research (4.3 rating), understood the overall research project and how my work will contribute to its success (4.7 rating), had the opportunity to do &ldquo;real&rdquo; engineering rather than follow a textbook or prepared assignments (4.2 rating), developed skills on making scientific presentations (4.8 rating), felt as though I am part of the intellectual effort and not just a technical assistant (4.7 rating), had the opportunity to co-author and publish a scientific paper (4.3 rating), and developed skills in writing research results (4.7 rating)</span>. All students indicated that they would recommend the program to their friends.</p>\n<p>Another measure of the UnCoRe impact on the REU student participants is the type of feedback we hear from the students <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">after they have left the program</span>. For example, a female student sent us an email stating that &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say thank you enough for all of your hard work with the applications, and for taking me in as a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">student researcher so many years ago!</span>&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m delighted to tell you that I was<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> accepted to 3 wonderful programs: The Princeton MS in CS (with thesis), the Duke Masters of Science in Economics and Computation (MSEC), and University of Michigan MS in CSE. Even more, the Princeton and Duke programs with a full tuition waiver!</span>&rdquo; Another student, wrote to us &ldquo;As an update, I have officially been awarded the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Fulbright award to study in Finland</span> for the next two years. Thank you again for all of your help!&rdquo; The students&rsquo; feedbacks like these received several years later are our ultimate reward and indicator of the impact of the UnCoRe REU
