The project at Winston-Salem State University will enhance undergraduate education by adding data science content to the urban studies and sustainability curriculum and preparing students to meet the needs of the workforce or advanced studies in fields related to data science and urban studies.  \r\n\r\nThe project spans the department of computer science and the minor program in urban studies and sustainability. The project will modify two courses through the infusion of data science content which will orient students to current trends in urban studies; develop a new course - Applied Urban Studies Lab; engage undergraduates in urban studies related research; and establish an Urban Studies Lab. Undergraduate students are involved as research assistants and as teaching assistants.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
