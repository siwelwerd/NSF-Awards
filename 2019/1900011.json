 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry is funding Professor Istvan Z. Kiss and his research group at Saint Louis University to study pattern formation of electrochemical reactions.   For most chemical reactions that occur in gaseous or liquid conditions, the reacting atoms or molecules steadily decrease in number, and the product atoms or molecules steadily increase in number until the reaction is complete (or, we say when it reaches \"equilibrium\").   Prof. Kiss is interested in so-called oscillating chemical reactions, in which the number of molecules of certain substances fall and rise with time. In other words, the reaction sometimes proceeds in the forward direction, and at other times in the reverse!  Oscillating reactions can produce solutions that switch from blue to yellow color and back to blue, or they can produce patterns of color that may resemble zebra stripes or leopard spots.   Such pattern formation is an example of chemical reaction networks, which are not yet fully understood but are very relevant to how living systems evolve and function. Prof. Kiss' research adds another twist to oscillating reactions: rather than just mixing reactants together in a beaker, he generates reactants with electrodes immersed in the solution.  For example, nickel electrodes can generate nickel ions (Ni(2+)) at a precisely controlled rate. This means that the oscillations and patterns created can be controlled, and in turn the chemical network behavior better understood.  In addition to its relevance to biological systems, this research also has implications for battery and energy technologies.  The graduate students and post-doctoral scientists involved in this project are immersed in a multidisciplinary experience that spans not only chemistry, but data science, mathematics, and biology.\r\n\r\nThe overarching objective of this project is to discover the laws that govern self-organization and pattern formation in complex, far-from-equilibrium charge transfer chemical reactions.  The project is following three tracks: 1) Spatially Organized Electrochemical Media on the Microscale.  The emergent networks that form in lab-on-chip devices are decoded. The coupling topology among the microelectrodes is used to identify novel types of dynamical structures with simple equilibrium reactions, including metal dissolution systems (Ni(0)/Ni(2+), Cu(0)/Cu(2+)) and the H2 oxidation reaction.  2)  Cathode-Anode Interactions:  The nature and structure of cathode-anode interactions are determined with bipolar electrodes and serially coupled electrochemical cells. Models of network topology developed in this study are tested for their utility in describing the dynamics of battery cells.  3)  Chimera Patterns on Designed Electrochemical Networks: Modular networks of current generating reactions are built with known network configurations. The resilience and the scalability of the localization of the synchronization patterns are explored by changing the number of elements in each module and the number of modules. In addition to the aforementioned formal training of students and post-doctoral researchers, demonstrations of nonlinear chemical dynamics are being incorporated into the undergraduate curriculum, as well as public outreach events.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

A challenge in the design of such devices is that each individual unit (e.g., a single cell out of thousands in a car battery) can behave completely differently even though they had been engineered to be as identical as possible with state-of-the-art manufacturing techniques.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The main findings of the research is twofold. First, we demonstrated that due to the interactions of the chemical reactions, even identical units can form very complex structures with completely different chemical reactivities - we called such structures as being desynchronized. An example of such structure is shown in Figure 1. The nature of these patterns were interpreted with the toolkits of chemical nonlinear dynamics and network science. The interaction among the links in the network amplify even the tiniest unavoidable differences in reaction properties, and desynchronized behavior is observed. The research identified classes of chemical reactions and some typical networks that can show such behavior. The translational nature of these findings were demonstrated with chemical cells and also in models of the circadian clock. In the latter, we showed that the network of the circadian clocks cells, which controls our sleep-wake cycle, has the capability of exhibiting the desynchronized behavior when exposed to constant light. Such desynchronized behavior can shed light on difficulties with recovery from jet-lag or shift-work.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Second, we also found an interesting means by which the above-mentioned desynchronized behavior could be avoided. We have identified chemical reactions and networks, where the synchronized behavior can be re-established by adding noise/heterogeneity, i.e., diversity to the chemical reaction properties. For example, Figure 2 shows that in a network of identical units the chemical reactivity is very different (i.e., desynchronized), however, when we engineered the units to be somewhat different, the synchronicity was maintained. In this way, we demonstrated that introducing diversity to chemical reaction properties can enhance more synchronous behaviors.
