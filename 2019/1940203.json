 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to model, predict, and improve the mechanical performance of engineering materials such as polymers, composites, and alloys can have a significant impact on manufacturing, with important economic and societal benefits. As advanced computational algorithms and data science approaches become available, they can be harnessed to disrupt the current approaches to materials modeling, and allow for the design and discovery of new high-strength, high-performance materials for manufacturing. Bringing together multidisciplinary teams of researchers can maximize the impact of these new tools and techniques. This Harnessing the Data Revolution Institutes for Data-Intensive Research in Science and Engineering (HDR-I-DIRSE) award supports the conceptualization of an Institute to develop novel data science methods, address fundamental scientific questions of Materials Engineering and Manufacturing, and build such multidisciplinary teams. The project will apply novel data science methods to advance the analysis of large sets of structural data of composite materials and alloys from the atomic scale to correlate with and predict mechanical properties. The methods are based on machine learning techniques and uncertainty quantification, and will help uncover underlying structural features in the materials that determine the properties and performance. The methods and results will help accelerate the development of ultra-high strength and lightweight carbon-based composites for aerospace applications, and multi-element superalloys for more durable engine parts, by navigating in the large possible design space and providing faster predictions than experiments and traditional simulation methods. The project will also lead to new methods and computational algorithms that will become publicly available. The investigators will train graduate and undergraduate students from various disciplines with a focus on engaging women and minorities in STEM fields, develop short courses that integrate novel Materials Science and Engineering applications and Data Science methods, and foster vertical integration of interdisciplinary research from undergraduate students to senior scientists.\r\n\r\nThis project aims at building an effective and interpretable learning framework for materials data across scales to solve a major challenge in current data-driven materials design. The combined Materials Science and Data Science approaches will synergistically contribute to the development and use of interpretable and physics-informed data science methodologies to gain new understanding of mechanical properties of polymer composites and alloys, with the potential to be expanded into different property sets and different systems. The PIs will utilize available data efficiently through combination with physical rules and prior knowledge, to develop an interpretable augmented intelligent system to learn principles behind the association of input structures with material properties with uncertainty quantification. The interconnected tasks involve the (1) collection and curation of large amounts of computational and experimental data for polymer/carbon nanotube composites and alloys from open data sources and targeted calculations and experiments, (2) the development of geometric and topological methods incorporating physical principles to generate a better, more sensitive low-dimensional representation of the multidimensional data and characterize the parameter space related to mechanical properties, (3) the development of a Bayesian deep reinforcement learning framework to generate interpretable knowledge graphs that depict the relational knowledge among physical quantities with uncertainty quantification, and (4) the prediction of mechanical properties to reveal design principles to improve materials performance, evaluate and validate the methods, and develop software for dissemination. \r\n\r\nThis project is part of the National Science Foundation's Harnessing the Data Revolution (HDR) Big Idea activity and is co-funded by the Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

From polycrystalline materials to granular matters, we introduce cross-disciplinary ideas, in particular (1) equivariant graph neural network, (2) manifold learning, and (3) causal discovery to provide us with a more precise and accurate understanding of materials of complex structures, as documented in the 12 publications in scientific journals produced from this research.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Through this project, we have collaborated with co-PI Yanxun Xu to formulate an automated modeling technique that combines recurrent neural networks and causal discovery algorithms to explain how the topological changes of granular matters affect the deformation and strengths [1]. This research has a wide range of applications, from understanding landslides to the jamming of powders. Our collaboration with co-PI Yusu Wang has led to a predictive algorithm that can take Micro-CT images and directly infer anisotropic permeability and formation factor without the spurious bias due to the choices of observers [2]. Other ideas we have pursued and led to fruitful results include: (1) manifold embedding data-driven mechanics, in which we view material data as points on a hypersurface in an N-dimensional vector space and use a neural network to turn this hypersurface into a plane to speed up the search of data. This enables us to enable model-free simulations with significantly fewer data when the inductive bias is correct [3]. For complex problems, we adopt the concept of geometric prior that enables us to a divide-and-conquer strategy that allows us to stitch together simple machine learning models (as coordinate charts) together to form an atlas [4]. Finally, we have started a new series of research articles called Geometric Learning for Computational Mechanics, in which we employ a variety of graph and manifold learnings to advance the art of material modeling and predictions [5,6]. In summary, the project is significant for the research group to derive a paradigm where machine learning techniques for physics and science are mainly focusing on improving/augmenting human knowledge in terms of learning (use data to extract patterns) and optimization (use computational to extract inferences or make the decision).</p>\n<p>Regarding the education mission, the project provided crucial funding for the PI to build the research group as he started his academic career. The project has an excellent track record in training Ph.D. students and postdocs. Two of the key team members of the research group, Nikolaos Vlassis, and Hyoung Suk Suh, will form their own research group as new assistant professors at Rutgers University and Case Western Reserve University, respectively. Meanwhile, the PI has also collaborated with Professor JS Chen to co-teach short courses on machine-learning approaches for computational mechanics and material engineering at the MMLDT-CSET conference in San Diego, the World Congress of Computational Mechanics, and the upcoming 17<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;US Congress on Computational Mechanics in which the course materials are available online.
