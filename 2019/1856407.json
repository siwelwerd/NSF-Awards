 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to document the biodiversity of marine organisms of the southern Caribbean and to train the next generation of researchers working on ecologically and economically important, but under-studied marine invertebrates (clams, sea slugs, flatworms, ribbon worms, seed shrimp, and scuds). Conceptually, this project focuses on three major challenges in understanding biodiversity: (1) documenting global biodiversity and its importance to the well-being of the nation, (2) identifying and describing new species, and (3) determining the relationships within and among animal groups. Taxonomy, the science of finding, describing and naming organisms, is vital to all biological research and to understanding and conserving biodiversity. The on-going effort to survey, inventory, and preserve the ocean's biological diversity is threatened by a shortage of taxonomic expertise. This project will train the next generation of young US STEM researchers to become experts who can document biodiversity in these groups of animals, apply novel methods to help resolve the relationships between these groups, and ultimately understand the origins of animal life. This effort will also promote conservation of marine animals, which are economically important, but are poorly documented compared to terrestrial organisms. It will also aid in the detection of invasive species. This project will produce new species descriptions for animals in the focal groups, generate species lists for Panama and the southern Caribbean, and will contribute data to an online biodiversity website and field guide. \r\n\r\nThe activities fall into three parts with complementary aims. (1) Taxonomic research will include species descriptions, taxonomic revisions, and development of regional check-lists and keys within the six taxonomic groups. This work will emphasize the integration of conventional morphological and molecular characters with non-traditional characters such as type and morphology of larvae or gametes, novel anatomical details, and 3D imaging. Established experts will work closely with experts-in-training to review and revise these animals from the Caribbean, which are in particular need of taxonomic attention. (2) The project will support six 14-day workshops mixing US and international experts and trainees at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute tropical field station in Panama. These workshops will train participants in methods for identification, improve understanding of relationships among the groups, provide hands-on experience with tropical diversity, and build lasting international collaborations to promote US biodiversity research and improve accessibility to international field locations. (3) Informatics resources will be developed to make the basic skills and vocabulary involved in taxonomy of the six groups globally accessible to expert and non-specialist workers in biodiversity and conservation. This work will involve the development of a package of online tools for each group, including a set of \"how-to\" videos, illustrated glossaries of anatomical terms, and checklists and digital keys of local species. This toolkit will be designed to facilitate rapid taxonomic documentation and to increase the precision of field identifications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Another major objective of this NSF program is to provide broad training to future students of the classification of plants and animals. Over the life of the grant, we trained one postdoctoral researcher, two masters students, one undergraduate student, one high school teacher and one high school student in writing and publishing six revisionary scientific papers and an 800-page field guide to sea-slugs of southern Africa that is aimed at a broad scientific and popular audience. &nbsp;Thirteen additional individuals, from five countries, participated in the sea-slug taxonomic workshop and gained skills to undertake systematic studies including field techniques laboratory skills and theoretical underpinnings to foster contemporary studies in the classification of marine slugs. This workshop was held at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute's (STRI) Bocas del Toro marine lab from September 18-30, 2024. The course included 21 lectures alongside daily field and laboratory work, where students mastered field observation and collecting techniques, learned species identification, and specimen preparation and dissection methods.&nbsp; During the field work, we collected 40 species of sea-slugs, including several new records for Panama and individuals of at least three undescribed species. All of these specimens were photographed alive and 69 expertly identified observations of all species were added to the iNaturalist database. A major product is the preparation of a field guide to the sea-slugs of Bocas del Toro, in both English and Spanish. All members of the workshop are working on completing this field guide. Material for study was exported from STRI to the California Academy of Sciences in May and the material was sequenced the DNA for three genes for detailed evolutionary study. Papers describing some of the new species are in preparation and will represent another contribution of new knowledge regarding the systematics, phylogenetics and biogeography of tropical Western Atlantic sea-slugs. Results from this new knowledge have not only resulted in advancing our understanding of evolutionary relationships and classification of sea-slugs, but have also altered our knowledge regional biodiversity in the Philippines, southern Africa and Panama. In the Philippines, this new knowledge has been leveraged to establish new marine protected areas and elevated the importance of using biodiversity data to inform science-based conservation decisions. The sharing of information via databases and web-based resources, with constituents in host-nations, has enabled us to help democratize science to a broad audience of individuals interested in conserving biodiversity globally.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 10/16/2024<br>\nModified by: Terrence&nbsp;M&nbsp;Gosliner</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div
