 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program research will create a fundamental understanding of ceramic material removal during nanoscale machining. Ceramics, such as sapphire, zirconia, calcium fluoride, etc., have many superior mechanical, chemical, biomedical and optical properties, but fabricating ceramic components is very difficult due to their high hardness and brittleness. However, at a microscopic scale, ceramics can be machined like metals, although the mechanism explaining this phenomenon is not yet known. General machining creates cracks on ceramic surfaces because the crystal structure of the material is prone to fracture. Each crystal structure has multiple fracture systems; each fracture system can be initiated under some conditions, especially high pressure. This study will explore how the force generated by cutting action initiates fracture and will use this understanding so that cutting can be done without generating cracks. The research will allow the use of ceramics in various industries, including consumer electronics, biomedical and defense applications, and optical elements. Thus, the research directly and favorably affects economic welfare and national security. The knowledge generated from this project will be distributed through the advanced CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machine training program, online expert system, and public media in addition to journal publication and integration into undergraduate and graduate courses.  \r\n\r\nThe project goal is to understand how the microscopic crystal structure of ceramics influences material behavior during machining. The research will identify the activation mechanisms of ductile shear and brittle fracture of ceramics. This knowledge will lead to the development of machining strategies to suppress brittle fracture and to enable ductile mode machining on ceramics for a wide range of applications. The research will initially test the role of three potential parameters (resolved shear stress, fracture energy, and stress intensity factor) in activating plastic deformation or crack initiation. Specific contributions will include: (1) data generation on critical depth of cut where ductile to brittle transition occurs for all orientations for each distinctive crystal plane of sapphire and zirconia; (2) identification of triggering parameter(s) on activation of slip system or fracture system; and (3) modeling of ceramic machining.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Their potential for functional products and harsh environment applications has drawn significant industrial and scientific interest. However, their high hardness and brittleness make shaping them difficult, limiting their use. Conventional processes like grinding, polishing, and lapping restrict geometry due to tool shape limitations and low material removal rates (MRR). Thus, creating free-form surfaces and 3D features is challenging with these methods. However, if a cutting method with proper MRR is developed, ceramics could be widely used in consumer electronics, biomedical applications, and optical elements.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Previous studies have shown that brittle ceramics can be cut in a ductile manner under specific conditions, depending on crystal orientation. However, the mechanisms behind ductile mode cutting of brittle ceramics and the influence of crystal orientation remain unclear. This study aims to map the process from machining input parameters to cutting mode by identifying the mechanisms of plastic deformation and crack formation in single-crystal ceramics. The research was divided into three steps: 1) identifying the relationship between machining input parameters and resultant forces, 2) identifying the relationship between resultant force and stress field inside the material, and 3) identifying the relationship between resultant forces and cutting mode. Various input parameters generate reaction forces at the tool-work interface, translating to stresses that activate plastic deformation or fracture.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; The research focused first on steps 2 and 3, later addressing step 1 with modeling due to the complexities of formulating theoretical relationships between machining input parameters and resultant forces. Single-crystal sapphire, widely used in electronics and biomedical fields, was selected for study. Ultra-precision orthogonal cutting was performed on different sapphire planes (C-, R-, A-, M-) at varying depths to determine the critical depth of cut (CDC), where the ductile-to-brittle transition occurs. The anisotropy and symmetries of CDC and crack morphologies were documented through cutting force profiles and optical observations. Cutting speed and rake angle also influence cutting, but direction-dependent performance was the main focus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; Two parameters, resolved shear stress and stress intensity factor, were studied to understand the material removal mechanism in terms of slip and fracture on the atomic scale. Single-crystal ceramics have specific slip and fracture systems oriented at known angles to the machining plane. Sapphire, with a hexagonal structure, has four functional planes with 12 slip/twinning systems and 10 fracture systems. Resolved shear stress and stress intensity factors were calculated from force data to rank the likelihood of plastic deformation/cleavage fracture activation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; Experimental results and mathematical analysis of force data from sapphire's crystallographic planes showed that rhombohedral twinning and basal slip mechanisms were dominant in various cutting directions. Fracture activations produced different crack morphologies, classified and investigated based on fracture mechanisms at the surface. SEM images of critical depth cracks matched the predicted fracture types. The initial slip fracture model's limitation of not considering lateral forces and stresses was addressed by extending the model to include triaxial stress fields, improving prediction accuracy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; In step 1, machine learning algorithms were used to predict cutting and thrust forces based on input parameters like depth of cut, cutting plane, and orientation. The depth of cut was the most significant factor influencing forces. A model was developed to study force generation during ultra-precision machining (UPM) of sapphire considering shear, plowing, and elastic recovery zones.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; An Excel-based expert calculator was developed to visualize plastic deformations and cleavage fractures for systematic analysis. The study's models describing force and cutting mode relationships and empirical models linking input parameters to resultant forces can be integrated to predict material removal behavior in UPM, enabling efficient machining of ceramics with complex shapes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 10/09/2024<br>\nModified by: Sangkee&nbsp;Min</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1844821/1844821_10589004_1728526128567_2024_CAREER_outcome__figure4_ver.1.0_--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1844821/1844821_10589004_1728526128567_2024_CAREER_outcome__figure4_ver.1.0_--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Step 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1844821/1844821_10589004_1728526128567_2024_CAREER_outcome__figure4_ver.1.0_--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Step 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Step 2- the relationship between force distribution and stress field</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Suk Bum Kwon</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sangkee&nbsp;Min\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Step 2</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1844821/1844821_10589004_1728526194062_2024_CAREER_outcome__figure5_ver.1.0_--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1844821/1844821_10589004_1728526194062_2024_CAREER_outcome__figure5_ver.1.0_--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Step 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1844821/1844821_10589004_1728526194062_2024_CAREER_outcome__figure5_ver.1.0_--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Step 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Step 3 -
