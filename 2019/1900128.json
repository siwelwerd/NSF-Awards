At each conference, there will be two magnet lectures by a leader researcher, and many short talks by junior conference participants.  The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.   More information will be made available at: https://sites.google.com/site/northeastanalysisnetwork/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
