 "awd_abstract_narration": "Data mining is a very effective method for doing scientific studies.  The La Silla QUEST Survey (LSQ ) made for the detection of Supernovae and Kuiper belt objects, can be repurposed to give a very useful history of the variable sky in the southern hemisphere.  In its six years operation, roughly half the sky was imaged an average of 200 times (several hundred square degrees over 1000-2000 times), making it suitable for variability timescales  studies from hours to years down to faint visibility magnitudes. The data will be particularly useful in the areas overlapped by current and future variability surveys by extending their time baseline. The available light curves for both transient and persistent variable sources will be placed in a database accessible via the Internet with precomputed \"signatures information on the variability and position\". The pipeline reprocessed imaged data will also be made available.  This data will be available to the citizen scientists like the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO), the Zooniverse, and the WorldWide Telescope by providing them with a plug-in to the AAVSO that lets their software access to LSQ light curves.\r\n\r\nThis grant will preserve the valuable data from the La Silla Quest Variable Survey (LSQ) for future time variable studies of stellar phenomena.  The data collected by the LSQ will be fully calibrated, cleaned, and reprocessed to correct for errors in photometry and astrometry caused by the CCD performance, charge effects for bright stars, and effects caused by the PSF. It will  provide a global set of reference stars to improve differential photometry and provide light curves for persistent sources with accurate error bars.  The light curve data will be made data searchable as well as in postage stamp \"movies\" for any location on the  Southern Hemisphere sky with access to raw files and made accessible to the astronomical community and the public.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

If one knows exactly when and where to look, one can find, for example, a star that explodes with enough power that it briefly outshines its host galaxy, a supermassive black hole that swallows an unlucky nearby star and generates enough light in the process to also outshine its host galaxy, or a star in another solar system that dims briefly as a planet crosses in front of it and partially blocks it light. Many of these phenomena are poorly understood, however, because they are rare, requiring us to continually monitor many objects to catch something, or subtle, requiring us to measure objects precisely many times, or both.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Measuring and monitoring the millions to billions of objects required to study such phenomena, what astronomers call \"time domain astronomy,\" has only become feasible recently with the advent of sufficiently powerful computers and modern detectors that can take pictures of significant chunks of sky in one shot and then rapidly analyze them.&nbsp;The subject of this award -- the La Silla QUEST (LSQ) project, originally designed to catch rare supernova (exploding stars) in nearby galaxies and the asteroids and minor planets that move around our solar system --&nbsp; is an example of a project that has already opened new doors in time domain astronomy. The immediate predecessor to LSQ, the Palomar QUEST project, for example, discovered several minor planets that eventually led to the unpopular demotion of Pluto to minor planet status.</p>\n<p>The LSQ&nbsp; incarnation of the QUEST project monitored the entire southern sky visible from its location in Chile for six years, taking as many as 2000 snapshots of the sky in certain specially designated areas. Although the funding for the project was narrowly focused on supernovae and solar system objects, the monitoring strategy (\"cadence\") for the LSQ survey provides information on how the brightness of sources varies on timescales from hours to years, i.e., LSQ data is in fact useful for studying for many other classes of variable objects.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, after the main supernova search project finished in 2016, the overall project shut down, the scientists working on it moved to other projects, and the hard drives storing LSQ data started failing. The main goal of this two-year award was thus to literally rescue the LSQ data and then to clean and reprocess it enough to make it useful to the general astronomical community, unlocking its full potential.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To do their time domain science, typical astronomers do not want raw image data. Rather, they need \"lightcurves,\" which tell us directly how the brightness of objects varies with time.&nbsp; Also, the individual brightness measurements that make up a lightcurve need to be precise enough to allow astronomers to pull out the phenomena they are after. Because 300TB of raw data is involved, reprocessing LSQ data to the required level of precision is a non-trivial endeavor.&nbsp;After much software development and optimization, along with several millions hours of CPU crunching, we now have the first LSQ lightcurve database which contains brightness (flux) variability information for one billion sources, ~400 million of which have enough measurements to do significant time domain science, e.g., help find new species of quasars or locate rare pulsating stars in the distant outskirts of our galaxy that help probe the environment there in ways not possible before.&nbsp; Note that other 600 million measurements or non-detections are still interesting as they provide constraints on what a particular source was doing in the past. This is particularly useful when a previously neglected source suddenly decides to do something interesting.</p>\n<p>As proof of the utility of the new LSQ data products, we used machine learning and the fact that the brightness of quasars flickers in a characteristic way to generate a catalog of ~2 million quasar candidates, the largest such catalog to date. The catalog was provided to the 4MOST collaboration, which will take spectra of them. The combination of LSQ variability data and 4MOST spectroscopy for so many objects will break new scientific ground and would not have been possible without NSF support.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Expertise gleaned from reprocessing and trying to extract science from LSQ data should also help NSF's next large time domain project, the Rubin Observatory.&nbsp; While Rubin will see objects that are much fainter and more numerous than LSQ, LSQ already sees so many objects that any analysis must be fully automated. Also, LSQ and Rubin cover the same sky. LSQ data is thus immediately useful for pre-classifying Rubin's brighter objects and extending the baseline of their time coverage by 15 years or more.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/14/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Paolo&nbsp;S&nbsp;Coppi</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1909101/1909101_10631706_1692022511344_lsq_coverage--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1909101/1909101_10631706_1692022511344_lsq_coverage--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"La Silla QUEST Sky Coverage\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1909101/1909101_10631706_1692022511344_lsq_coverage--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"La Silla QUEST Sky Coverage\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Color-coded plot showing how many times a particular region of sky was observed by the LSQ telescope.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">The La Silla QUEST collaboration</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Paolo&nbsp;S&nbsp;Coppi</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">La Silla QUEST Sky Coverage</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1909101/1909101_10631706_1692023047681_lsq_time_coverage--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1909101/1909101_10631706_1692023047681_lsq_time_coverage--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Example of LSQ Time Coverage\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1909101/1909101_10631706_1692023047681_lsq_time_coverage--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Example of LSQ Time Coverage\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">LSQ provides useful variability information on hour to year timescales.
