 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Dynamic Urban Environmental Systems and Sustainability (DUESS) REU site in Newark, New Jersey engages students in research related to the environment and sustainability in urban settings. Participants are from groups underrepresented in the Geosciences, include community college students, and either attend urban institutions or live in urban areas. The focus on urban systems allows students to conduct research relevant to their daily lives and communities, and demonstrates how scientific research can benefit society. Students are mentored by research active faculty at Rutgers University-Newark, receive professional development training, participate in enrichment activities, and interface with Newark community organizations and local government. Students are guided to pathways from community college and 4-year programs to careers in research. Creating career pathways for underrepresented students is essential, as racial minorities comprise 33% of the U.S. population, but only 14% of employed scientists and engineers. This represents an untapped human resource potential for STEM careers. Maximizing human resource potential is especially critical for urban areas, such as Newark, where there is a need for trained professionals to advance local environmental and sustainability efforts. The DUESS REU is designed to reinforce the interest of the students in Earth and Environmental Sciences, and have them appreciate the value of organized scientific research. It provides a critical link from success in college to graduate school and a potential research career. The result is improved participation and diversity in the Geosciences, and an increase in the number of appropriately trained scientists to meet the growing need nationwide.\r\n\r\nDUESS REU participants will investigate the impact of concentrated human activity on the environment (soils, water, air, biota) and sustainability in urban systems. Students develop research projects within areas of faculty research expertise in Near Surface Geophysics, Urban Geochemistry & Biogeochemistry, and Urban Ecology, Sustainability & Biodiversity. The participants are primarily underrepresented minority (URM) students from 2-year and 4-year urban institutions. Students conduct DUESS themed research with faculty mentors; participate in professional development to integrate the research experience with the educational pathway; and engage in supporting activities that promote student-student, student-faculty and student-community interactions. The DUESS REU has six goals. 1) Recruit and provide research experiences and support for 3 cohorts of 12 academically talented students who are at least 60% URM and 50% Community College students by leveraging other NSF and non-NSF-funded programs at Rutgers University-Newark. 2) Develop an integrated research program for undergraduates that exposes them to cutting edge geoscience techniques. 3) Develop a research experience that builds from learning research techniques to helping formulate research plans. 4) Develop a model to engage urban URM students in advanced research by making it pertinent to their lives and interests. 5) Establish a clear pathway to encourage students to pursue careers in science that involve research. 6) Change the culture of the program to better incorporate integrated undergraduate research into the curriculum. This project will increase the number of underrepresented students pursuing careers in research and science, through a model for group place-based research in an urban environment that may be replicated in urban areas nationwide.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Recruitment from local community colleges and minority serving institutions (MSIs) was prioritized by leveraging Rutgers-Newark affiliated NSF Garden State LSAMP (GSLSAMP) and Northern New Jersey Bridges to the Baccalaureate (NNJB2B) networks. Over 8 weeks in the summer, cohorts of 8-14 participants conducted research with DEES faculty and graduate students in three concentration areas: Near Surface Geophysics; Urban Geochemistry and Biogeochemistry; and Urban Ecology, Sustainability and Biodiversity. Participants engaged in professional development to supplement and support their research and to integrate the research experience into the educational pathway. The professional development curriculum included panels with DUESS REU alumni and scientific professionals; workshops on graduate school, fellowships and careers; preparation of research products and scientific communication; and local field trips centered on geology, climate resilience and environmental justice. In the final week of the program, the DUESS REU Research Day was held to showcase completed research projects. Participants prepared abstracts, gave oral presentations and presented posters. Research Day was attended by faculty, staff, undergraduate and graduate students in DEES.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong>&nbsp; From 2022-2024 (post-COVID) 86% of abstracts and posters prepared for Research Day were also submitted to local and national conferences, including the GSLSAMP Annual Research Day, the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Meeting and the Entomological Society of America (ESA) Conference. Program assessment indicated significant outcomes for DUESS REU participants, with gains in research skills, competence and capacity. Participants showed increased confidence in all aspects of developing and conducting a scientific study, collaboration, data analysis, scientific writing and science communication, including the ability to explain science to friends, family and non-scientists.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong>&nbsp;DUESS REU participant demographics were as follows: 64% from traditionally underrepresented groups and 71% female identifying, 54% Minority Serving Institution and 40% community college attendees, and 45% first-generation college goers. Assessment indicated participants grew their scientist and science professional networks and gained knowledge of career pathways and insight into pursuing a career in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Participants&rsquo; familiarity with graduate school and confidence in the ability to succeed in graduate school also increased significantly. The participant demographics and the positive change in attitudes towards their research capabilities, interest in graduate school and knowledge of career paths is indicative of the impact of the project. The DUESS REU at Rutgers-Newark has made inroads towards increasing the number of students from underrepresented groups, with varied life experiences, pursuing research careers, with an ultimate goal of increasing representation in the relevant STEM disciplines.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/29/2024<br>\nModified by: Ashaki&nbsp;A&nbsp;Rouff</p></div>\n<div
