 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to introduce a novel form of ultralight wearable cooling technology.  Excess weight is a key limitation of active wearable cooling technology today, restricting its adoption.  In contrast, active indoor heating and cooling, where solutions are stationary and the weight is relatively unimportant, is a multi-billion dollar market.  Significant unmet demand exists for lightweight active cooling that can work outdoors as well.  The proposed wearable cooling technology would improve performance and comfort while reducing the risk of dehydration and heat stroke.  Users who can benefit range from specialty applications to recreational uses.  For example, military personnel who are active in hot climates while wearing body armor and struggling to stay hydrated is one specialty application.  Other specialty applications include welders wearing protective gear in hot environments.  Here, extending work times, improving comfort and thus reducing errors would boost productivity.  Endurance athletes could also benefit from faster times during events of multiple hours in hot climates.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the need for a state-of-the-art Droplet Transmission Technology (DTT) for Ultralight Wearable Cooling System (UWCS) to achieve a flexible, ultralight cooling technology that allows longer-lasting, powerful cooling capabilities for the end-user. The proposed activity will demonstrate DTT, a novel transport phenomenon.  DTT enables a unique way to manage and generate cooling from two-phase flows. The design of channels utilized in the product and their dimensions will be studied using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models and tested via 3D printing of the experimental prototypes. The final UWCS design for the full torso prototype will be integrated and the cooling capabilities verified using a thermal manikin.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis NSF SBIR Phase I project demonstrated a new form of ultralight wearable cooling technology based on Droplet Transmission Technology (DTT).  Currently, excess weight, lack of efficacy and lack of duration are critical shortcomings preventing adoption of wearable cooling technologies.  If solved, workers in many ?hot jobs? where air conditioning is not available could be made safer and more productive while improving worker quality of life.  DTT has the potential to make substantial gains in these three metrics of weight, cooling power and duration.  This Phase 1 project successfully conducted design and development activities to create a functional full-torso DTT prototype.  Numerous experiments and simulations were carried out on subcomponents to design the resultant full-torso prototype.  Research was also conducted on superhydrophobic materials and their durability with respect to water impact.  Work was done to create a new method of wear testing superhydrophobic materials that is relevant both to DTT and other applications of superhydrophobic materials.  Various materials formulations were created or obtained and then tested, and the most promising materials were identified.  Ultimately, the full-torso prototype was evaluated on a thermal manikin inside an environmental chamber.  The environmental chamber provides a hot environment for the test and also controls the ambient humidity.  This manikin can then measure the amount of cooling power provided by a wearable cooling system and allow comparison to competitive systems tested on similar manikins.  The weights of all system components were tracked, and the cooling power measured at 95 F.  At the end of the project, a promising cooling power per kilogram of weight was obtained. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/17/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Terence Davidovits"
