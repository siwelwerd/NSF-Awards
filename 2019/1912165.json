 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be quicker and more reliable discovery of human burial sites.  The proposed product will help law enforcement officers at municipal, county, state and federal levels discover clandestine human burials thereby aiding in the solution of crimes and enhancing public safety.  Likewise, applications in the military arena would enable discovery of the remains of soldiers missing in action (MIAs), mass graves created during genocide, and other casualties of conflict.  Because the technology of the product has a very general capability, a product based on the same hardware and software may be customized for a variety of commercial applications.  These include: (1) environmental mapping and remediation efforts; (2) cultural resource or heritage management, e.g., by documenting Native American burial grounds; (3) characterization of soil chemistry for agribusiness applications; (4) mapping of sites in archaeology.  All of these applications would create greater demand with resulting commercial and employment opportunities.  Finally, since successful applications will receive media attention, they will provide the opportunity to educate the public about the nature of the science, the value of scientific research to the public good, and technology involved in the product.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project involves a novel adaptation of existing technologies (spectroscopy, push-probe soil tests) to a new application within forensic science.  The basic concepts of the technologies are well-established.  The product, a robotic mobile device, pushes a probe into the ground at the test locations.  The probe has a window that allows the soil to be illuminated with visible and near infrared light.  Reflected light is collected by fiber optics which carry the light to the surface to be analyzed.  The fraction of each color of light that is absorbed by the soil carries the signature of the chemical content of the soil at each underground location.  These data are then interpreted in terms of the decay products (mainly fatty acids) that indicate the presence of human cadavers.  PI?s earlier research was successful in identifying burials in both controlled mock crime scenes and in real forensic contexts involving disturbed human graves.  The proposed product will provide real-time, reliable interpretation of the data to indicate the presence of a 'hit', an essential part of the value proposition of the product for law enforcement applications.  This marks a very significant improvement over current lab-based analyses.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Current devices and methodologies are inadequate and oftentimes expensive. Our novel shallow subsurface spectroscopy technology detects burials underground by mapping chemical signatures left behind by human cadaver decomposition.</p>\n<p>This project started 02/01/2019 with participation in the NSF I-Corps program and Beat-the-Odds Bootcamp. Overall, we conducted over 200 customer discovery interviews. We interviewed end users, purchasers, and influencers in our target forensic market. We found that the overall satisfaction with the existing methods of finding clandestine bodies is exceedingly low. Most investigators interviewed use a combination of tools, but none reported acceptable overall success. Detectives report that they are hesitant to undertake attempting to recover clandestine graves. A majority of interviewees also noted that providing closure to victim's families was a strong emotional component of success. Many forensic detectives mentioned daily calls from families, and the societal impact from finding missing bodies should not be underestimated.</p>\n<p>A literature review supported these interviews. There are currently 18,000 missing civilians buried in clandestine graves in the United States. The current overall annual recovery rate of bodies is 3% of the total number of missing civilians. The rate of new cases outpaces the closure rate of existing cases. As a result, the overall number of undiscovered clandestine graves continues to increase each year. An obstacle to success is that a single police excavation site costs $100K and the effort has a 30% success rate (i.e., if there is a body buried at a site, there is a 30% chance of finding it). Cadaver dogs are reported as finding unacceptable numbers of false positives and excavations are expensive, slow, and often fail to produce human remains. Finally, site excavations can be hazardous and are a source of officer injury and illness.</p>\n<p>Our value proposition is to dramatically increase success and simultaneously decrease costs of finding clandestine burials. Our solution, Subterra Grey, is a mobile soil laboratory that employs a probe inserted into the soil to collect infrared reflectance spectra that can be analyzed by an onboard computer to map subsurface chemical concentrations (see Figure 1). Two specific spectral wavelengths related to human decay products are the primary targets: the fatty acids in adipocere (?body wax?, mostly salts of fatty acids produced by the chemical decomposition) that can persist in soil for hundreds of years (see Figure 2). Employing our proprietary forensic soil algorithms and analysis software, our goal is to target identification of subsurface human decay products with 90% overall accuracy.</p>\n<p>We envision our solution to initially be used in conjunction with other tools in investigator's evidence response kits (i.e., cadaver dogs, ground penetrating radar, etc.) to validate the presence of a body before expensive and disruptive excavations begin. In the longer-term, we expect its usage will be expanded to being a primary search tool for clandestine graves.</p>\n<p>The next phase of the project continued under an NSF SBIR Phase I grant and included the following tasks that were successfully completed between February 2020 and August 2020:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Determined scientific requirements (i.e., choice of spectroscopic component, etc.) through field tests and experiments</li>\n<li>Developed engineering requirements and design documents for core mechanical and electrical functions, and developed software requirements and design documents for data gathering and analysis</li>\n<li>Constructed a low-fidelity alpha prototype used to field validate the previous lab-based Subterra technology</li>\n<li>Field tested the low-fidelity alpha prototypes at controlled human burial sites (see Figure 3)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The final phase of the project in this grant period continued under a Ohio Third Frontier Technology Startup and Validation Fund grant and included the following tasks that were successfully completed between September 2020 and February 2021:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Constructed three beta prototypes (hardware and software)</li>\n<li>Field tested the beta prototypes at controlled forensic sites to validate product-market fit, value proposition assumptions, and confirm potential markets (see Figure 4)</li>\n<li>Completed detailed performance analysis to determine accurate measurements of sensitivity and selectivity</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Subterra Grey is innovative and transformative providing intellectual merit and broader impacts by:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Real-time discovery of the burial location and confirmation of the presence of human decomposition products underground </li>\n<li>Fundamental jump in overall accuracy (30% to 90%) with decreased time, effort, and cost to find crime victims (80% reduction in cost)</li>\n<li>Integration of several technologies to produce a device that is easy and inexpensive to use by non-technical personnel</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Further development, testing, and customer validation is underway for the Subterra Grey (see Figures 5 and 6).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/08/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: David&nbsp;S&nbsp;Perry</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1912165/1912165_10590538_1633699110237_Figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1912165/1912165_10590538_1633699110237_Figure4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4: Early Beta Prototype\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1912165/1912165_10590538_1633699110237_Figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4: Early Beta Prototype\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Field testing early beta prototype -
