 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Growing Convergence Research project is to develop emotionally-responsive computing systems that can detect human emotions and automatically deploy resources or prioritize services to meet human needs in disaster or crises situations. This research is motivated by the need to more rapidly assess the massive data flows that occur during crisis events to better respond to the situations. Through the convergence of computer and computational sciences, neurotechnology, and psychological sciences, this project will develop technologies that can monitor humans' emotions and process the emotional states to strategically deploy resources to address human needs. Emotionally-responsive computing systems could be used by 911 call-centers to prioritize calls or by first-responders responding to a public threat.\r\n\r\nThis exploratory research will a) develop and validate computational assessments of human behavior in controlled virtual reality simulation, b) develop an integrated physiological measurement package targeting electrodermal activity, heart rate, electroencephalography, and pupillometry, and c) assess whether systems that adapt to emotional states must be trained toward the individual or group types. Key research questions focus on understanding the timescale at which emotions can and should be sensed in reaction to situational changes and the diversity of human emotional responses and group dynamics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur project objective was to provide a preliminary demonstration that computational resource performance could better adapt to the needs of human users by evaluating, responding and adapting to their measured emotional states, both on a person-by-person basis, as well as via measurement of an aggregate measurement across groups or crowds.  Our exploratory award coupled together expertise in four disparate research domains: computer science, biomedical engineering, psychology, and public safety to evluate the efficacy of this mechanism from both technological and ethical standpoints.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe intellectual merit of our research demonstrated an initial foray as to how a user's emotional state might impact the outcome of a user's satisfaction when interacting with computational resources.  This approach contrasts with recently successful approaches that utilize natural language processing and other areas of artificial intelligence to make machines appear more life-like.  Our research instead was geared toward making the machines better serve their human counterparts in roles as traditional machines.  Any incident wherein emotion can help improve resource allocation is potentially impacted by our research, including applications as mundane as the reduction of drops of important phone calls, intensely-watched video feeds, or completions of high-priority computations.  Our research yielded the critical and pressing first step in defining an emerging discipline wherein human emotions directly affect computational rewswource allocations, with said allocations maximizing positive emotional states in groups (such as interest, joy, arousal, etc.).  \n\nThe  research and administrative initiatives addressed the following three overarching issues: how positive or negative emotions could be quantified and integrated into a holistic personality profile; how to fine-tune ciomputational systems to positively influence this emotional \"happiness\"; and how this  emotional \"happiness\" and computation best interact to provide a mutually- beneficial, self-contained feedback loop,.  In effect, our research explored how to design computational systems such that that emotional triggers turn the \"knobs\" appropriately to achieve maximal happiness.\n\nThe broader impacts of our project integratesdmultiple outreach and interpersonal communications initiatives to initiate a lifelong partnership between academia and first responder agencies.  Governance boards and ethics working groups were structured in such a way to provide periodic feedback about the direction in which our academic collaborations were occuring.  The research that was funded by this proposal supported roughly a half dozen PhD students, as well as a fair number of undergraduate students, several of whom belong to under-represented groups in the repsective academic areas.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/13/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dan Rubenstein"
