 "awd_abstract_narration": "Innovations in engineering and technology have significantly promoted and advanced scientific discoveries over the last few decades. These innovations have not only been rapid, but have also increased the quality and reduced the cost of healthcare and inspired new research areas, such as precision medicine. Additionally, these scientific discoveries reveal the importance of increased collaboration between researchers in medicine and engineering to address the problems and obstacles that arise in health care, and, most notably, for the development of new education directions to translate medical science and engineering concepts into curriculums and clinical research for the preparation of the next generation global healthcare workforce.  To accentuate these critical and emerging developments, the summer school 2019 will be held at the Orthodox Academy of Crete (OAC), Kolympari, Chania, Crete, Greece, June 9-15, 2019 with the participation of 30 undergraduate and graduate students and 8 faculty. The main objective of this proposed education program is to expose undergraduate and graduate biological science and bioengineering students to new approaches and advancements in the brain and life sciences, data science and artificial intelligence for biomedicine, healthcare entrepreneurship and innovation.\r\n\r\nEmerging computational tools facilitate the collection and analysis of vast amounts of biomedical data collected at multiple temporal and spatial scales using smart sensors. The investigation of complex biomedical systems requires the integration of smart sensors and analytics and an extensive collaboration between biologists, mathematicians, computer scientists and engineers to improve our understanding of processes from genes to systems to behavior. Such collaboration also allows for the development of better diagnostics and treatments for diseases, the identification of new research directions and the preparation of the next generation global healthcare workforce.  The summer school will focus on new approaches and advancements in the brain and life sciences, data science and artificial intelligence for biomedicine, healthcare entrepreneurship and innovation and the need for a paradigm shift in biomedical engineering and science education.  Also discussed will be the need for research that places an emphasis on the opportunities presented by combining translational research with the fields of data science, engineering innovation and entrepreneurship, and the potential impact on economic growth. The summer school provides an excellent learning, teaching and brain storming opportunity for students and young researchers as well as the summer school faculty. It is an opportunity for students to personally meet with leaders in the field, while enjoying a pleasant location. This summer school will further stimulate interdisciplinary research and collaborations among engineers, mathematicians, computer scientists, and medical researchers while identifying new research directions\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
