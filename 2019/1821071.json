 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solar neutrino research has already discovered massive neutrinos and flavor mixing and is moving into an era where precision measurements can provide a unique probe of the structure and composition of the Sun. The carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle is one of the fusion reactions by which stars convert hydrogen to helium, releasing electron-neutrinos. The CNO neutrino flux depends on the abundance of carbon in the core of the Sun. A measurement of the CNO flux would be the first direct measurement of the solar metallicity (the abundance of elements other than hydrogen or helium) in the core of the Sun. It could test the fundamental assumption of homogeneity in the Sun and provide crucial information regarding opacities in the solar interior that are important for helioseismology. Such studies could thus have a great impact on our understanding of the Sun, stellar astrophysics, the link between planetary and stellar formation, as well as basic neutrino physics. Borexino is a liquid scintillator detector, located at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Italy, with a unique sensitivity to solar neutrinos.\r\n\r\nThe Borexino research program has involved many undergraduate and graduate students. Mentoring and training young researchers at the collaborating institutions and other schools has always been a high priority. The three groups will continue to involve undergraduate students in this research and disseminate research to the broader community.\r\n\r\nThe research funded here plans to measure neutrinos from the catalytic reactions on 12-C and 15-N which convert four protons to 4-He, producing neutrinos from the beta decays of 13-N and 15-O. The CN neutrino flux depends directly on the abundance of 12-C and 15-N in the core of the Sun, and their measurement would be the first direct measurement of the metallicity (elements heavier than 4-He), in the core of the Sun. This result will be far reaching because the solar composition is the basis for many important topics in astrophysics, including stellar structure, stellar evolution, and stellar atmospheres, to name a few. In addition, it will address the 'solar composition problem', the apparent disagreement in metallicity determined from recent advances in analysis of solar photospheric optical spectra, which favors a low metallicity, and advances in helioseismology, which favors high metallicity. Since modifications of the Standard Solar Model to explain a non-uniform solar composition have not been very successful, the 'solar composition problem' remains an unexplained flaw in the Standard Solar Model.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

For the CNO neutrinos it was even worse, as these neutrinos sources were already spread in energy. To extract the 1% contribution due to CNO neutrinos required excellent determination of parent distribution functions, and carefull fitting. And this of a moving subregion of our fiducial volume which was particularly clean. Our recent ability to use modest directionality of the neutrino signal allowed a larger volume to be considered. The combined analysis has been reported in the literature.\n\nA technique to preserve the solar-neutrino spectral shape in the detected outcome can be achieved using neutrino capture on Indium. Here the outgoing beta reveals the full incoming neutrino energy (minus the Q-value). This makes the CNO neutrinos more cleanly separated from other backgrounds. It is still a difficult task, but the event-topology made possible by a 3D optical lattice (a 3D array of scintillating cubes where energy in any given cube produces light which is transported almost exclusively down the principle axes intersecting that cube by using total-internal reflection), is very promissing. This latice concept has come to be known as a \"Raghavan Optical Lattice\" in the community, named after the orginator of the Borexino experiment, and the proposed LENS experiment.) A small 5x5x5 cube proto-type called NuLat (itself targeting reactor anti-neutrino observation), explored this event-topology aspect for CNO use in the future. At the moment the cost for direct CNO measurement using this technique seems prohibitive.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/27/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RobertBVogelaar\n"
