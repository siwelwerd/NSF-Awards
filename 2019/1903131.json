 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Albany Conversations provide a venue for an intellectually challenging debate of topics of current interest in structural biology. The sessions dealing with cryo-electron microscopy and protein dynamics in the living cytoplasm will emphasize recent technological breakthroughs in structural biology. Lectures by young researchers (graduate students, post-doctoral fellows and starting faculty) will be based on selection from abstracts submitted for poster presentation. \r\n\r\nThe Albany Conversations will include about 400 participants, over 200 posters, and ~85 oral presentations, about one third of which will be selected from the posters. Out of all the talks, at least 34-36 will be delivered by female scientists. The final program will contain a socially responsible mix of men and women with wide ethnic origin. All presenters are expected to stay during most of the conference, eat at the community tables and be available for interactions with junior and senior colleagues.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
