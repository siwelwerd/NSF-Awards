 "awd_abstract_narration": "A wide range of important questions being studied by astrophysicists, from the habitability of exoplanets to the evolving structure of our galaxy, require that we first accurately determine the ages of stars.  While we have made great progress measuring other stellar properties, age remains the most difficult to determine.  This research team will carry out several detailed studies that use detailed observations of binary stars from ground-based and space-based telescopes to better determine their ages. Undergraduate students will participate in every aspect of this project, from data acquisition with the campus and remote-access observatories in Arizona, Chile and Spain. This project will also enable a new partnership with nearby Bethune-Cookman University (HBCU) that will enhance the educational opportunities at both institutions.\r\n\r\nGyrochronology, an empirical relation between rotation and age, is believed to be among the best current methods of stellar age determination.  This team will refine the current paradigm using over 3000 wide binaries already identified in the K2 fields. Wide pairs provide a unique opportunity to unravel and calibrate the rotation-activity-metallicity vs. age relations for main sequence stars. They span a much broader age and metallicity range than stellar clusters. Efforts will focus primarily on follow-up ground-based spectroscopy with the national observatories and CCD-based imaging with the SARA (Southeast Association for Research in Astronomy; ERAU is a member) telescopes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
