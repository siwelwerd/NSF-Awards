 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biomass, obtained from waste agricultural materials or efficiently - grown plants, has the potential to be a significant, renewable source of clean energy and chemical feedstocks if appropriate methods of chemical conversion can be developed.  Dr. Yujie Sun of Utah State University is supported by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division to pursue research into the investigation of biomass conversion using a novel electrocatalytic process.  Electrocatalysis uses electrons provided by an electric current to drive chemical reactions in the controlled and efficient process of catalysis, a chemical pathway that increases the speed and efficiency of the chemical converstion. Dr. Sun's research elucidates the chemical reaction pathways, or mechanistic steps, of the electrocatalytic oxidation of biomass molecules and establishes the relationship between the catalyst composition and its catalytic activity for 1st-row transition metal-based electrocatalysts.  For good conductivity and efficient catalytic activity, the transition metals are fabricated as very thin films known as two-dimensional ultrathin \"nanosheets\". Broader impacts of the research result from the development of an efficient biomass conversion process to produce fuels and other chemicals from renewable biomoass resources. Dr. Sun also creates broader impact opportunities in his work with students in education and outreach activities.  He is actively engaged in outreach programs focusing on attracting and mentoring students from groups that are under - represented in the STEM fields, such as Native American undergraduates and economically disadvantaged high school students, as well as creating cutting - edge research-based opportunities in experimental courses for undergraduate students at Utah State University.  \r\n\r\nEven though biomass valorization has been recognized as an attractive strategy in producing nonfossil- based chemical products, the conventional upgrading approaches often require harsh conditions, toxic regents, and/or expensive catalysts. With the support of this CAREER award from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Yujie Sun of Utah State University is developing an alternative electrocatalytic approach for biomass upgrading utilizing 1st row transition metal-based electrocatalysts. In particular, this project elucidates the mechanistic steps of the electrocatalytic oxidation of 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF, one of the top biomass-derived platform chemicals) under ambient conditions and establishes a composition - activity relationship of 1st-row transition metal oxides (TMOs) for HMF valorization. Using this information, ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) TMOs of the most promising compositions are prepared and interrogated to obtain their intrinsic electrocatalytic activities for HMF oxidation.  The ultrathin electocatalyst thickness is designed to circumvent electric resistivity problems. The experimental activities are supported with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, conducted in parallel with the experiments, and are used to aid the interpretation of measured activity trends and other variables in the composition-activity relationship. Broader impacts of the research result from the development of an efficient biomass conversion process to produce fuels and other chemicals from renewable biomoass resources. Dr. Sun also creates opportunities for broader impacts in student training and mentorship in his education and outreach activities.  He is actively engaged in outreach programs that are focused on students from groups under - represented in the STEM fields, such as Native American undergraduates and economically disadvantaged high school students, as well as creating cutting - edge research-based opportunities in experimental courses for undergraduate students in Utah.",
