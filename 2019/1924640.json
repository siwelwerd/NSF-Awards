 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently, strawberry production in the United States is decreasing due to labor shortages and the ever-increasing cost of labor, particularly for harvesting. A high cost of production could put strawberry-growers in the U.S. at a disadvantage in comparison to countries whose cost of labor is much less. In order to make strawberry production in the U.S. competitive with the rest of the world, production costs need to be reduced. This project aims to investigate developing a small, rugged, and cost-effective co-robot system that can be used by growers, which will ultimately lower the harvesting costs and increase profitability of strawberry production. Additionally, the research results can benefit other high value specialty crops, such as tomatoes and blueberries, as they are facing similar labor shortage issues. This multi-disciplinary research will enrich course curricula which benefits a large number of students at three participating universities, and will provide research and development experiences to students of underrepresented and minority backgrounds. The outreach component of the project will educate K-12 students and the general public about robotics in agriculture via conferences, workshops, field days, and other learning engagement activities. Additionally, a graphic user interface will be developed, which is adaptable as an assistive device to benefit users with disabilities. \r\n\r\nThe project includes three primary research thrusts. The first thrust will investigate a decentralized, scalable row allocation algorithm for robots to achieve a consensus about which rows to harvest, in order to achieve an overall minimum time in harvesting. The algorithm is expected to be scalable, efficient, fast, non-conflicting, and simple. The second thrust will develop an integrated multi-exposure fusion, curvature analysis and hierarchical image processing algorithm. Supported by the end-to-end deep learning technique, the algorithm will detect strawberries, stems, and vines in field environments with a high accuracy. The third research thrust involves a study of a parallel delta robot-arm based manipulation system for picking and transporting harvested fruits. The associated amount of movements will be minimized. These three thrusts will be complemented by many other engineering tasks and a detailed cost analysis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
