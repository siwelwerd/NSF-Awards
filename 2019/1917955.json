 "awd_abstract_narration": "The World Economic Forum estimates that up to 5 million jobs may be lost to disruptive labor changes by 2020, a development that leads to concerns regarding unemployment, underemployment, and the need for workers to reskill.  This project explores how to address this problem by developing methods for embedding learning opportunities within collaborative work tasks in the area of software development.  The research aims to gain insight into the differing characteristics of how work is structured and managed that affect trade-offs in terms of effort, time, learning benefit, and productivity both in the long and short term.  These insights can then be used by managers to make more strategic choices about prioritization of learning versus productivity within specific work episodes.  This project specifically focuses on embedding learning opportunities within team-based work, leveraging a new industry practice for team-based software development to create a new paradigm for shared cognition in software development.  In doing this work, the project will provide additional educational opportunities for teams in technical courses who will use the developed tools, as well as releasing the tools for public use.\r\n\r\nThe experimental work in this project will be conducted within an online software development course that connects learners on campuses on multiple continents as well as in offerings of the course content to industry professionals attempting to retrain. This specific collaborative work paradigm adopted in this research and further developed under this research will afford unique opportunities for embedding learning during work and the ability to adjust the level of priority attached to learning vs productivity and thus creates the ideal social structure in which to conduct the scientific investigation. The research goals of the planned work are: (1) Discover how to develop technology for effectively manipulating the level of interdependence within team-based work, and in so doing to manipulate the trade-off between learning and productivity, and (2) Quantify the long term positive impact of learning in the short term on productivity in the long term so that it is possible to maximize productivity overall in the face of decreases in short term productivity in favor of learning.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe goal of this project was to improve pedagogy for work-relevant skills, especially in Information Technology, including Data Science and Cloud Computing, and more recently Generative AI. The proposal aims to address the target research goals in connection with advancement within the broad field of software development since opportunities within software related jobs will increase as automation continues in its prominent role shaping the landscape of work.\n\n\nIn a nutshell, the research goals of the proposed work were:\n\n\n(1)Technology Goal:First to discover how to develop technology for effectively and efficiently engaging students in learning activities that balance conceptual and procedural learning and project success\n\n\n(2)Learning Goal:To understand better how to evaluate learning opportunities both in terms of short-term impact and long-term impact.\n\n\n\n As our work has progressed, our studies have yielded new knowledge regarding learning during reflection on worked programming examples in comparison with learning from programming. This challenges deeply held beliefs from CS education that emphasizes learning through software development, especially in advanced CS courses. We have increasingly focused on understanding these trade-offs: learning through programming vs learning through reflection, in our studies in Cloud Computing and Data Science courses.\n\n\nThe project has conducted research studies in 2 different courses, each offered 2 or 3 times per year, over the 4 years of research covered by this grant, with the total student population impacted reaching approximately 400 per year, 1600 altogether over the 4 years of the grant. The work of this project has been disseminated in 12 peer-reviewed publications and 22 invited talks. The research of this grant informed the design of a new online certificate in Computational Data Science Foundations, which was launched in Fall of 2023 and continued development of the Sail() platform, used not only in university courses, but also community college courses at 40+ community colleges.\n\n\nConnected with this research, in Summer of 2023, PI Rose lead an outreach called the Generative AI Innovation Incubator, designed to create a community of practice for society members to come together to learn from one another and together create the future of generative AI in three areas: Education and the Future of Work, Medicine and Public Health, and Finance and Economics. Over 2000 people participated in the series of 18 online events including keynote talks, tutorials, panel discussions, and hackathons. The resulting youtube playlist has gotten to date over 7070 video views to date.
