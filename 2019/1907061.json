 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2019. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Keely Elizabeth Brown is \"Fluctuating Selection in Barley Driven by Biotic and Abiotic Factors\". The host institution for the fellowship is the University of California, Riverside and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Daniel Koenig.\r\n\r\nBarley is the fourth most highly produced grain in the world and is a staple crop across many varied environments, from the mountains of Nepal to lowland regions in Northern Africa. Barley yield is expected to be dramatically impacted by climate change, potentially resulting not only in food shortages across the world, but in higher cost of luxury goods like health products and malt in more developed countries. This project aims to better understand how barley responds on a genetic level to changes in the environment by using seed from an ongoing experimental evolution study that began in 1929. The fellow will use historical weather data to identify patterns of evolution that will help us to predict how well a plant will do in a particular environment, given its genetic makeup. The broader impacts of the project include providing basic research training for undergraduates from diverse backgrounds and engaging the public in scientific discussions about climate change in casual community outreach settings. Training objectives include acquiring expertise in genomics and bioinformatic analysis of large genomic data sets and training in agriculturally-relevant research. \r\n  \r\nHow genetic variation is maintained in crop plants is a question of great intellectual and practical importance. This project will focus on temporal environmental fluctuations as a mechanism to maintain variation in barley (Hordeum vulgare, Poaceae). The project will address this question by leveraging a set of parallel evolution experiments using a collection of barley Composite Cross lines (CCs). Initiated in 1929, these experiments and the resulting datasets provides a one-of-a-kind opportunity to link phenotype to genotype under a wide variety of environmental conditions. Using existing genomic datasets, the Fellow will map genes that maintain unusually high levels of genetic diversity in different climates (e.g., that in Montana versus California), and also how yearly environmental variability drives the retention of genetic diversity. The project will also consider temporal fluctuations in both abiotic environmental factors like temperature or rainfall and biotic factors like varying pressure from the fungal pathogen Rhynchosporium secalis, which causes barley scald. The analysis will exploit the key feature of the CC populations, replication, to identify environmental drivers of allele frequency change during local adaptation. Sequencing data from this project will be archived and publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information Short Read Archive (NCBI SRA). Python or R code used for analysis will be made available through Github, and phenotype data will be archived in a public repository like Dryad.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
