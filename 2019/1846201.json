 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neurochemicals, like dopamine and serotonin, are important in the regulation of behaviors and cognitive functions. Humans have unique neurochemistry within areas of the brain involved in motivation and language. In this project, the neurochemistry of the striatum and amygdala in human and nonhuman primate postmortem brains will be analyzed to test hypotheses about the evolution of pro-social behaviors, including language. This research will include undergraduate and graduate student training and mentoring, as well as  public science outreach activities. Also, because the neurochemicals under investigation are involved in various human-specific neuropathologies, including autism and Parkinson's disease, the results have the potential to inform and advance our understanding of disease etiology and treatment. \r\n\r\nMicroscopic alterations within the brain can have major implications for cognitive and behavioral development. Accordingly, microanatomical analyses of human and nonhuman primate brains can contribute to our understanding of human brain evolution. Neurochemical changes can have a major impact on social behavior and may have been pivotal for the emergence of the human lineage. This project incorporates advanced laboratory and microscopy techniques to examine the neurochemistry associated with social and life history variables. Humans have a unique neurochemical profile within the striatum, a subcortical region of the brain that regulates behaviors involved in social reward and is a critical component of both language and personality styles. The ventral striatum is intimately connected with the amygdala, which governs aggression levels by modulating aversive stimuli. Stereologic methods will be employed for quantitative analyses of striatal and amygdala neurochemistry visualized using immunohistochemical techniques.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We discovered that regions of the human brain&rsquo;s reward pathway (i.e., the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum) have a unique neurochemistry among primates. Humans possess high amounts of dopamine within these regions, which is the ultimate \"currency\" of the reward pathway. While this increase in dopamine within the reward pathway likely plays a central role in human prosocial behavior, it also motivates creativity and inventiveness. &nbsp;Moreover, it also plays a role in our unique vulnerability to addiction and psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression. We also found that humans differ from other primates in having increased neuropeptide Y within the reward pathway. Neuropeptide Y promotes fat and sugar seeking behavior when it is injected into the nucleus accumbens. It also plays a role in alcohol and drug addiction. The increase in Neuropeptide Y specific to this region may constitute an adaptation that motivates fat intake, which is important for the growth and maintenance of our enlarged brains. However, at this same time this lends increased vulnerability to eating disorders, obesity, and alcohol and drug dependence. Our project also discovered that humans have increased acetylcholine in the ventral pallidum, a structure that communicates with our expanded cerebral cortex. This increase may facilitate synaptic transmission, plasticity, and increased coordination of \"firing groups\" of neurons, all functions that would be expected to be enhanced given the unique size of our brain. In contrast to these findings, serotonin levels were conserved in these regions of the reward pathway among human and nonhuman primates. Finally, we &nbsp;discovered that there is increased dopamine within a specific region of the human amygdala that regulates emotional responses to social contexts.
