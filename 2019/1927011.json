 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project focuses on the development of a patented radio front-end supporting multi-user MIMO capability for the 5G mm-wave infrastructure market that would enable cost efficient, high data rate access wirelessly as opposed to cost prohibitive fiber-based data connectivity. Cellular and Wi-Fi networks are hitting a spectrum bottleneck in terms of their ability to offer higher data rates to densely populated areas and the same in a cost-efficient manner to remote rural areas. Advent of 5G cellular networks with new bands in the mm-wave frequency spectrum (between 28-70 GHz) alleviates these issues. RF Pixels' innovative mm-wave radio front-end will enable spectrum efficient communication through frequency re-use to spatially separated users at a fraction of the cost compared to known solutions. Thousands of mobile internet users can enjoy high data rates simultaneously without being starved of spectrum. Data heavy paradigms connecting consumer devices and the cloud, such as wireless virtual reality headsets and robotic personal assistants can be implemented with ease. Virtual and augmented reality based remote educational programs, online health care, smart cities, smart transportation and other new low-latency services will be enhanced delivering major economic and societal impact.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes a revolutionary tile architecture that enables massive multi-user MIMO techniques for mm-wave radio systems, without the hardware and power consumption costs of full digital solutions. The radio can efficiently reuse the spectrum between spatially diverse users with active beamforming. Multitude of tiles will be used in a large array making it crucial to achieve excellent power efficiency at the tile level. Tile-to-tile variations hamper accurate beamforming requiring calibration. Beam discovery, refinement and tracking of multiple mobile users simultaneously requires investigation. In Phase I feasibility of a tile architecture that achieves multi-user MIMO and scale to large element arrays was proven. This project will investigate clock generation and coherent distribution to every tile in a large array for accurate beamforming and interference cancellation. Turnkey approach for packaging and antenna array design will be investigated. Impact of tile-to-tile variations on beamforming accuracy and calibration algorithms to mitigate variations will be studied. New algorithms will aim to achieve low-sensitivity to post-calibration errors without much downtime. Beam management algorithms for accurate tracking of mobile users compatible with guidelines of 5G NR standard will be developed.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The developed system was used to demonstrate a 5G compliant MU-MIMO capable multi-beam mmWave radio. To demonstrate compatibility to 5G NR cellular standards further validation was done using industry standard test equipment. For demonstration purposes a 1x16 phased array was used as a base-station and multiple 1x4 phased arrays were used to mimic multiple users on the field. Excellent 5G link metrics were measured not only for a single link but also for a 2x2 MIMO link consisting of two simultaneous spatial streams from a base-station to two user radio units. Less than 5% aggregate error vector magnitude (EVM) for two simultaneous 64-QAM modulated 5G NR OFDM waveforms was measured showing two-fold improvement in throughput due to enabled spatial multiplexing by this architecture. Testing was also performed to compare the performance of proposed full-aperture beam-former architecture utilizing all the 1x16 elements against the same array operating as two separate 1x8 sub-arrays. In both the scenarios the array was used to transmit / receive two simultaneous beams. The comparison was done by varying the transmitted / received power (which is similar to what one would expect when a user equipment moves physically away from a base-station) and measuring the EVM of the wireless link. For both transmit and receive scenarios &gt;3dB benefit in link margin is observed for the full-aperture array over the sub-array architecture. The result is better than the theoretical 3dB benefit due to higher inter-beam interference in the sub-array scenario leading to worse MIMO decoding performance.
