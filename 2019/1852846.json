 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, this Capacity Building project at Towson University (TU) aims to transform mathematics teaching using the practice of mathematical modeling and the emerging technology of makerspaces. Mathematical models are important because they can be used to explain systems and predict behavior.  Makerspaces, workspaces that encourage creative design using tools such as 3D printers, are becoming more common in K-12 schools.  Makerspaces can improve the mathematical learning of students because the students gain a better understanding of systems by experimenting, building, and tinkering.  However, professional development for teachers is critical for both makerspace technology and mathematical modeling to fulfill their promise of improving learning. To address this need, this project plans to establish the foundation to develop teacher leaders who can use making and modeling in their schools and mentor their colleagues in adopting them. Through this effort, this project plans to develop new graduate courses to train its students in making, modeling, and mentoring. There are also plans to create a regional network of partners to engage the community and ensure that the progress made through this project is sustained.  \r\n\r\nThis project aspires to build partnerships across the Baltimore region, bringing together TU faculty with stakeholders from Baltimore City Public Schools and Baltimore County Public Schools as well as mathematics teacher organizations and non-profit makerspaces. The primary goals of the Capacity Building project are to: (a) develop a coherent and connected sequence of courses to improve teacher knowledge and instructional practice in making, modeling and mentoring and (b) build and strengthen partnerships with local school districts and non-profit partners. The project will include a needs assessment which focuses on understanding what makerspace technology currently exists in these school districts, how it is being utilized, and the critical professional development needs of mathematics teachers. This needs assessment should inform course development as well as future plans for a Noyce Track 3 Master Teaching Fellowship program. Through a pilot implementation of the making and modeling graduate courses, this project plans to train teachers to effectively use makerspaces, iteratively improve the courses and add to the research base on technology education and mathematical modeling.  This project is important because it has the potential to serve as a national model for mathematics teacher education in makerspace technology and mathematical modeling. The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 mathematics and science teachers in high-need school districts and experienced and exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers. It also supports research on persistence, retention and effectiveness of K-12 teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
