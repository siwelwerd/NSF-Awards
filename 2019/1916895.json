 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research fills an important gap in knowledge about the genetic mechanisms by which organisms diverge over evolutionary time to form distinct species. It also provides a platform for graduate and undergraduate training in molecular genetics, developmental biology and evolution, and an exciting opportunity for under-represented high school students from the local community to participate in this research and to undertake a formal in-residence summer training program in molecular genetics designed for high school students taught at the University of Chicago.\r\n\r\n       Multicellular organisms undergo complex development processes beginning with a fertilized egg to produce the adult body plan with specialized body parts and organs. One of the great scientific achievements of the comparative genomics era is the discovery that many of the genes and genetic pathways that orchestrate this developmental process are widely shared across distantly related taxonomic groups, spanning fruit flies (the subject of this investigation) and our own species. From this discovery, it is widely assumed that the crucial regulators of shared developmental processes will be functionally conserved and will not contribute to the evolutionary divergence that accompanies speciation and adaptive change. This research challenges this assumption with a set of precise genetic experiments in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, involving conserved genes required for establishing its anterior-posterior segmented body plan. For each of three genes, Bicoid, giant, and hunchback, protein coding and noncoding cis-regulatory sequences from different fly species will be challenged to replace their orthologous counterparts in Drosophila melanogaster. Evidence of functional divergence will be sought in embryonic gene expression, protein expression, development, viability, and co-evolutionary interaction with the gene even-skipped, a shared regulatory target.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

One such process, and the subject of this research, is pattern formation in insects - the mechanism by which a fertilized egg attains its anterior-posterior axis and the positional landmarks&nbsp;&nbsp;that will define the identity of the individual segments in the head, thorax and abdomen regions. This system is set up by a network of spatio-temporally interacting regulatory genes called the Gap genes. Not surprisingly, gap genes are themselves highly conserved structurally and - it is believed - functionally. Here we challenge this latter assumption. We hypothesize that adaptive selection pressures on individual genes and compensatory changes across the network decouple the functional evolution of each gene from the conserved outputs of the pathways in which they operate. We predict, moreover, that this functional divergence occurs repeatedly and independently over short evolutionary times. The experiments test this hypothesis by replacing one of the gap gene loci in the pattern formation network, the gene&nbsp;<em>Giant,</em><em>&nbsp;</em>with whole-locus transgene orthologs derived from six other&nbsp;<em>Drosophila</em>&nbsp;species whose phylogenetic distances range from about 0.5 million years ago (MYA) to about 40 MYA (Figure 1).&nbsp;&nbsp;These whole-locus swaps include the region of the gene encoding the Giant protein as well as the full noncoding regions upstream and downstream of the coding portion of the gene that interact with other gap genes to regulate when and where in the embryo Giant is expressed. It is widely believed that changes in regulatory pathways, such as the gap gene circuit, are likely to be noncoding rather than protein coding. Noncoding (<em>cis-</em>regulatory) and protein coding changes can be distinguished by comparing functional change in whole-locus transgenes from each species with chimeric transgenes in which noncoding and coding regions have been swapped between two species. The two native and two chimeric transgenes were examined for egg-to-adult viability and for gene expression phenotypes in highly sensitized assays.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our results are as startling as they are clear-cut (Figures 2 and 3).&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of assays show that loss of transgene viability is widespread, indicating functional divergence from the&nbsp;<em>D. melanogaster&nbsp;</em>gene. Functional differences emanate from both coding and/or noncoding regions at every interspecific level of comparison in our study, including two sibling species that are genetically nearly identical. Species-specific epistasis between coding and noncoding sequences is prevalent, including negative interactions between the only two coding substitutions separating the two very closely related species. Functional divergence hidden in conserved phylotypic developmental processes require reconsideration of the prevailing view that the essential genes in conserved regulatory networks are protected from the driving forces of evolutionary change.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/16/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Martin&nbsp;E&nbsp;Kreitman</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1916895/1916895_10611182_1692205642934_Fig3WHPPJ--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1916895/1916895_10611182_1692205642934_Fig3WHPPJ--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Functional divergence\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1916895/1916895_10611182_1692205642934_Fig3WHPPJ--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Functional divergence\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 3. gt protein has evolved through non-neutral path. a, functional divergence inferred from whole-locus or chimeric transgenes.
