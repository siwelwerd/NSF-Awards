 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary focus of this project is on the development of novel and efficient computational algorithms for the solution of large scale inverse problems. Examples of the kinds of problems that are relevant for  the planned mathematical developments for this study arise in (i) medical image reconstruction from data acquired without invasive procedures and (ii) measurements of the permeability of a porous medium which is of great importance for predicting flow and transport of fluids and contaminants in the subsurface.  Improved approaches for the solution of such problems, both in terms of computational cost and efficiency, have significant societal impact. Students in applied mathematics will be trained in the techniques that are being developed and graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups will be supported for their roles in this project. As such, the project contributes to the training of the next generation of a broad group of students in the mathematical sciences. \r\n\r\nThe principal investigator will extend and enhance the linear algebra techniques that are inherent within the solvers for the large scale inverse problems. Specific goals for the project include the (i) mathematical and computational analysis of  oversampled iterative Krylov algorithms; (ii) the development and analysis of hybrid preconditioning of randomized singular value decomposition estimates for large scale under-determined problems, and (iii) assessment of  techniques that incorporate multiple regularization types that are required for the inversion of such large scale and under sampled problems. The encompassing goal of this project is the recognition that significant information of a large scale problem is contained within the dominant spectral subspace obtained via dimension reduction. Thus the  research brings together studies of resolution and rank estimation for the underlying systems of equations that are solved using the latest linear algebra techniques  and provides theoretically-justified down-sampling for data and model compression.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
