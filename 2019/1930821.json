 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides support for 20 U.S.-based graduate students to participate in the 25th Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD 2019), to be held in Anchorage, Alaska, August 4 - 8, 2019. KDD is the world's premier conference in data science. It is a prestigious interdisciplinary conference that brings together researchers and practitioners every year, around 3,000 in the year, from all aspects of data science, data mining, and knowledge discovery. A strong representation of U.S. students and researchers is essential in maintaining U.S. competitiveness in this important area today and into the future. Since 2013, the KDD conference includes a Broadening Participation in Data Mining workshop. As in various STEM fields, increasing the diversity of participants in KDD research areas is a primary goal. The selection committee will select recipients of the support based on merit and need and place emphasis on diversity in the selection process. \r\n\r\nThe KDD technical program includes oral and poster presentations of refereed papers, panel discussions, and invited talks by the world's leading experts. It provides an international forum for presentation of original research results as well as exchange and dissemination of innovative and practical development experiences, which are particularly valuable for student participants. Besides the technical program, the conference features workshops, tutorials, panels, posters, project showcases, a data mining contest (KDD Cup), social networks and job matching sessions, and a PhD forum. These events provide a comprehensive multi-faceted learning experience to students at all levels. Proceedings will be made available through the ACM Digital Library.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Based on the planning in the proposal, we aimed to support 20 students with each of $1,000. The committee selected 20 awardees, in which 6 are females (i.e., 30%) and more than 4 other awardees are newcomers according to their applications. As planned, each student should get an award of $1,000, in which $500 covers the registration fee and up to $500 for their rest expenses like transportation and lodging. However, considering the overwhelming number of attendances (i.e., over 3000), the conference needs a substantial number of student volunteers. Therefore, SIGKDD decided to offer free registration to all student awardees so that they can support the conference as volunteers. This change was made in July, 2019, when all awardees have been finalized. Therefore, each student awardee was reimbursed up to $500 and 3 students were sent to Dr. Wei Wang to use up her remaining funding in IIS-1832544.
