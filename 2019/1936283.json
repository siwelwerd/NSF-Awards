 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for participants in the 2019 East Coast Operator Algebra Symposium (ECOAS), which will be held on the campus of The Ohio State University October 12-13, 2019. The symposium expects between 50-70 participants, including many graduate students and postdocs. This will be the seventeenth annual meeting in the East Coast Operator Algebra Symposium series. The first meeting was held at Vanderbilt University in Nashville in the Fall of 2003, and since then, meetings have been held each Fall. \r\n\r\nThe conference focuses on operator algebras (C* and von Neumann algebras) and non-commutative geometry, with applications to a wide array of disciplines, including ergodic theory, number theory, representation theory, and mathematical physics. The ECOAS enables participants to become acquainted with the forefront of research in operator algebras and non-commutative geometry and neighboring disciplines, while also providing early-career researchers with the opportunity to present their own work, and network and interact with each other along with senior researchers. More information can be found at the conference website: https://people.math.osu.edu/penneys.2/ECOAS2019.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
