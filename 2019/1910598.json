 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a novel instrument to study the faint objects in our universe across cosmic time. This project will illuminate how the first astronomical objects ionized neutral hydrogen in the universe, an epoch called reionization. The project will measure the rate at which new stars formed during this epoch. The project will also engage young scientists, particularly undergraduates and high school students from backgrounds that are typically underrepresented in STEM. The project will help the students build networks of mentors and peers at a variety of institutions. Such support networks are critical for advancement in astronomy. They are often weak or absent among students from marginalized groups. Thus this project will encourage broadening participation in science among undergraduates and graduate students.\r\n\r\nThis project will build the Tomographic Ionized-carbon Mapping Experiment (TIME), a millimeter wavelength spectrometer. TIME has 16 spatial and 60 spectral pixels and spans a frequency range of 200-300 GHz. TIME will use a novel technique for studying the universe called line intensity mapping. Using this technique, investigators will robustly measure the 3D fluctuations that trace redshifted [CII] emission spanning the epoch of reionization to probe the evolution of our universe over that epoch. TIME will also detect low-redshift CO fluctuations and map the cosmic history of molecular gas, traced by the CO molecule, elucidating the role of this gas in the epoch of peak cosmic star formation (cosmic noon), which is a critical period of galaxy evolution.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
