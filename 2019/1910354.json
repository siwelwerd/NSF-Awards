 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA) is a radio interferometer dedicated to the study of the Sun located at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO). It collects microwave imaging spectropolarimetry measurements of the Sun and space weather phenomena in the microwave frequency band. The proposers seek to operate EOVSA as a community resource, making the data public to all users within hours of collection. The chief science aims of the array are the study of solar flares, the magnetic and plasma structure of solar active regions, and drivers of space weather. EOVSA provides a test bed for prototyping of antennas, feeds, analog and digital systems, calibration methods, and data management for the Frequency Agile Solar Radio Telescope (FASR), a proposed next-generation solar radio observatory.\r\n\r\nThe proposers will operate the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array, which uses radio interferometry to collect full-disk images of the Sun every second in a series of wavebands in the frequency range of 1-18 GHz, excluding 1.9-2.4 GHz due to noise. The instantaneous bandwidth is 500 MHz; it switches between each band in 20 ms, allowing full coverage of the whole frequency range in 1 second. The data they collect will be used to study solar flares, solar active regions, and sources for space weather. EOVSA consists of 13 2.1-meter radio dishes, with a 27-m dish used for high-sensitivity calibration. The array covers an area 1.1 by 1.2 kilometers in extent, and operates seven days a week, from sunrise to sunset. The proposers seek to use the Array as a community instrument, not only making the data available to the larger solar astronomy and space weather community, but also using the system a testbed for prototyping systems for potential future instrumentation in the microwave.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA) is a unique solar observing facility that makes multifrequency radio images of the Sun at hundreds of frequencies in the range 1-18 GHz.  This project was to operate the facility during the period 2019-2021.  Although many observatories experienced major disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, EOVSA was able to continue operating 7-days per week during the entire period thanks to its highly automated operating system.  The array, located in California, is operated every day remotely from New Jersey by graduate students at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT).\n\nResearchers at NJIT include professors, postdocs, and graduate students, with some participation by undergraduates as well.  The students gain first-hand experience with planning observing, and overseeing the operation and calibration of a major research facility, and then use the data in their research.  The work during this period resulted in one PhD thesis, and five other graduate students are currently working towards their degree using data from the instrument.\n\nOur work during the period resulted in 12 journal papers in major journals including Science, Nature Astronomy, and the Astrophysical Journal, and have garnered 158 citations by other researchers in just the year or two since publication.  The outcomes include the first direct measurement of the coronal magnetic field in the flaring region and how it evolves with time.  We found that it starts at a surprisingly high strength and then decays rapidly, thus releasing in a few minutes the tremendous amount of energy needed to account for the flare emission.  Our results also include the first complete quantitative measurement of plasma and particle parameters in the \"central engine\" at the very heart of the flare, which had been unobservable by other means.  Having these parameter measurements has spurred other researchers to develop new theories and simulations, which are on-going and can be done with unprecedented accuracy due to the precise knowledge of the parameters.\n\nThe EOVSA instrument, with its 13 radio antennas, is a prototype for a much larger facility called the Frequency Agile Solar Radiotelescope (FASR) with hundreds of antennas that has been studied in several community-wide surveys.  We hope that the success of EOVSA will form the basis for supporting the construction of FASR in the next decade.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/09/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dale E Gary"
