Successful recruitment efforts resulted from coordination with the department's graduate program, including participation in graduate fairs at national and regional meetings, including at the conferences organized by professional societies; graduate mentors speaking at their home institutions, and from a partnership between the co-PI and the University of Puerto Rico Cayey. Over the period from 2019 to 2023 (excluding 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic and 2023 as a no-cost extension), the program has provided funding and support to a total of 31 students. The diverse cohorts comprised 15 men, 15 women, and 1 non-binary student, reflecting a commitment to gender diversity and inclusivity. The program has achieved its objective of recruiting and increasing the representation of students from underrepresented minority (URM) groups, with 58% of trainees coming from URM communities. Students were recruited from 24 different institutions, 18 of them being PUIs, and only 3 offering PhDs in Chemistry. With an emphasis on sustainable chemistry, the REU program provided the participants with extensive research engagement on interdisciplinary projects, and the incorporation of program elements such as sustainable chemistry workshops and professional development seminars and activities, contributing significantly to the overall learning and professional growth of the students. A sustainable mentoring network has been established, comprising the students, graduate student mentors, faculty research advisors, and industrial mentors, which has created a supportive framework for guidance and collaboration within the program.</p>\n<p>Primarily working with an assigned graduate student mentor, alongside their PI, REU students actively engaged and contributed to multiple research endeavors, joining 16 distinct interdisciplinary research groups in Chemistry, addressing impactful problems in sustainable chemistry, such as the development of greener solvents and reagents; the development of more efficient reactions and processes, including through biosynthesis and catalysis; and the exploration of renewable energy resources. The Chemistry department provided support and access to facilities for X-ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, materials characterization, and molecular simulation. At the culmination of each program, all students showcased their findings at the departmental research symposium and a university-wide poster session (held virtually in 2021). Additionally, students demonstrated their commitment to effective science communication by creating general-audience videos or infographics, which were disseminated via social media. Six publications have directly resulted from students' contributions to research initiatives, with several more papers currently in preparation. The students also showcased their research findings through participation in numerous presentations at both local and national conferences, such as the ACS, NOBCChE, and the SACNAS National Diversity in STEM Digital Conference.</p>\n<p>The students' contextual understanding of their research were enriched through a weekly seminar series focused on sustainable chemistry, where both faculty members and industrial experts provided valuable perspectives and insights that enhanced their research endeavors. Weekly professional development workshops involved hands-on activities that gave awareness to the ethical and responsible conduct in research, discussions on the importance of science communication and community outreach, and workshops on making effective research posters and seminar presentations. In addition to these seminars, students joined field trips to local industry sites. These experiences were also highly appreciated by the students as they provided real-life exposure to large-scale chemical and biotechnology industries, offered behind-the-scenes insights into these industries, and showcased the diverse career paths taken by scientists they encountered during the trips. These activities also strengthened our partnership with these industries and are continuously forging mentoring relationships, ultimately reinforcing the networks that can help diversify and contribute to the creation of a competitive STEM workforce. Overall, these activities contributed to a well-rounded and practical understanding of the myriad opportunities within the field of chemistry.</p>\n<p>Currently, 9 out of the 31 students are still pursuing their undergraduate degrees, 11 have enrolled in PhD programs in Chemistry, 1 is pursuing an MD/PhD in Neuroscience, 1 is employed in the chemical industry and another is working as a nurse. Several students have built upon our REU program by participating in another research or internship program in Summer 2022 and 2023. Additionally, two who attended community colleges have transferred to research-intensive universities. These numbers show that our program serves as an exceptional pathway for students to continue their journey in STEM fields, supporting their ongoing engagement and success in these disciplines. In summary, our REU students have gained invaluable experience in all aspects of chemical research through their immersion in authentic research projects related to sustainability, gained the skills to communicate their results, and acquired the awareness of the ethics and responsible conduct required to carry out the research. Through a deep engagement in our program, students gained the confidence, experience, and connections necessary to help them persist in STEM fields which will help them be successful in graduate school and their careers in related fields.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/14/2023<br>\nModified by: Joanna Maria&nbsp;N&nbsp;San Pedro</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1851936/1851936_10594699_1699977389268_IMG_1877--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1851936/1851936_10594699_1699977389268_IMG_1877--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"2023 TAMU Summer Undergraduate Research Poster Session\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1851936/1851936_10594699_1699977389268_IMG_1877--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"2023 TAMU Summer Undergraduate Research Poster Session\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2023 TAMU Launch Undergraduate Research Poster Session</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Joanna San Pedro</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Joanna Maria&nbsp;N&nbsp;San Pedro\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2023 TAMU Summer Undergraduate Research Poster Session</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1851936/1851936_10594699_1699977478265_IMG_1911--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1851936/1851936_10594699_1699977478265_IMG_1911--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"2023 Chemistry Undergraduate Research Symposium\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1851936/1851936_10594699_1699977478265_IMG_1911--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"2023 Chemistry Undergraduate Research Symposium\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2023 TAMU Department of Chemistry REU and Summer Undergraduate Research Symposium</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Joanna San Pedro</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Joanna Maria&nbsp;N&nbsp;San Pedro\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2023 Chemistry Undergraduate Research Symposium</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
