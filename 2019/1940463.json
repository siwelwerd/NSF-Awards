 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants. This project will advance evidence-based efforts to broaden informal STEM engagement via the 2019 Inclusive Science Communication (Inclusive SciComm) Symposium, to be held September 27-29, 2019, at the University of Rhode Island in Kingston, Rhode Island. Science communication, defined as any information exchange designed to engage targeted audiences in conversations or activities related to STEM topics, is a rapidly expanding area of research and practice with the potential to significantly increase public participation and sense of belonging in STEM fields.  That said, there are few opportunities for its practitioners and scholars to convene around how to make their work both inclusive and equitable, which collectively acknowledge identity, cultural differences, and epistemologies as part of broadening participation. The 2019 symposium will address this gap through panels, workshops, and posters focused on three themes that represent critical and difficult aspects of inclusive science communication: (1) New Languages, Practices, Knowledge, and Research; (2) Changing Systems and Structures through Science Communication; and (3) Social Responsibility and Ethics. Within these themes, sessions will be organized to address major barriers of absence identified by participants in the 2018 Inclusive SciComm Symposium: skills, lessons learned, and knowledge gaps, especially with regard to facilitating difficult conversations across difference (critical dialogue). The symposium also will emphasize the need to integrate research and practice to advance inclusive, equitable, and intersectional approaches to science communication.\r\n\r\nThere is an urgent need to question assumptions and examine evidence regarding how science communicators and scholars approach efforts to broaden participation, but insufficient data exist on the inputs and outputs of inclusive and equitable practice. Critical dialogue about potentially uncomfortable topics such as privilege, power, or marginalization is an essential tool for inclusive practice and pedagogy.  Finding from the 2018 Inclusive SciComm Symposium indicated that many educators and practitioners lack the language, skills, or confidence to initiate this type of dialogue. This project supports the knowledge-building component of the 2019 Inclusive SciComm Symposium to inform future science communication training, practice, and scholarship, by building on preliminary data collected during the 2018 symposium and responding to the need for more robust evaluation of science communication activities.  Applying the Theory of Planned Behavior, the project will employ pre/post symposium surveys to investigate how 2019 symposium activities affected knowledge, attitudes, subjective norms, and efficacy (the variables of the Theory of Planned Behavior) of attendees with regard to critical dialogue. Focus groups at the symposium will be used to identify priority research areas related to inclusion, generally, and critical dialogue, specifically, that could advance inclusive science communication practice and beneficial outcomes. The project also will evaluate symposium impacts with regard to 1) attendees' opinions on utility of symposium components for advancing inclusive science communication and 2) how attendees' experience and response orientations inform their approaches to difficult science communication conversations. Qualitative data from the surveys and focus groups will be thematically coded using constant comparison.\r\n\r\nThis project will have strategic impact for inclusive science communication practice and, therefore, for informal learning and public engagement with STEM topics. Increasing awareness and effective implementation of critical dialogue by science communicators and trainers should enhance both for ethical engagement of traditionally under-represented and marginalized groups and should foster diverse types of public participation in societal debates about scientific issues. The outcomes of this research will benefit and link the complementary, but often siloed, fields of informal science learning and science communication. A final report will summarize research findings and offer specific next steps to advance inclusive science communication practice and research, especially with regard to fostering critical dialogue. The report will be posted on inclusivescicomm.org and distributed via a national network of partners working in informal science education, science communication, and public engagement.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

For this project, the term \"science communication\" is used in its broadest sense, to encompass any information exchange designed to engage specific audiences in conversations or activities about science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) topics. This conference grant from the National Science Foundation'</span>s Advancing Informal Science Learning program supported the knowledge-building component of the 2019 ISCS.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The project collected survey and focus group data to understand 1) how the 2019 ISCS affected attendees? knowledge, attitudes and self-confidence in inclusive science communication (ISC), especially regarding the process of engaging in difficult conversations across difference, or critical dialogue, and 2) how attendees approach critical dialogue in their work. These questions are important because there are few studies that examine the inputs and outputs of inclusive and equitable approaches to science communication. This project aimed to contribute to the foundational understanding of how science communicators and scholars think about, enact, and adapt their ISC and, especially, critical dialogue practices.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Project researchers conducted pre- and post-event surveys of 2019 ISCS attendees, as well as focus groups of self-selected attendees during the symposium. When asked to rate the importance of symposium outcomes, more than 80% of participants selected practical skills, networking and making new contacts, better understanding how to prioritize inclusion in their own work, and gaining resources as \"very important.\" Survey data indicate that attendees were already engaging in critical dialogue, felt it was important, and felt that it was valued in their work, even before attending the symposium.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>When asked in an open-ended survey question and focus groups about priority areas for future ISC research and funding, three dominant themes appeared: (1) systemic and institutional barriers to inclusive research and practice; (2) the need for more connection and resource-sharing across contexts; and (3) the need for more inclusive and innovative evaluation approaches for assessing science communication impact.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Project researchers conducted a follow-up survey of 2019 ISCS attendees in December 2020 to assess the potential impacts of the momentous intervening year--2020--on symposium attendees' ISC practice. Respondents shared experiences that both paralleled 2019 findings and also offered new insights. The 2020 survey showed that participants were thinking more about accessibility in many regards (e.g., multilingual resources, closed captioning, time zones, etc.) and the digital divide. Specifically, respondents commented on how the pandemic and accompanying shift to technology affects science engagement with those who might not have access to the technologies that have become indispensable and commonplace during the pandemic, such as video conferencing. Respondents' use of emotional language also was noteworthy in the 2020 survey. They shared feelings of discouragement, humility, and worry, expressed a desire for action rather than just discussion, and relayed a sense of urgency regarding social justice. Some participants reported that events in 2020 created new opportunities to engage in critical dialogue as part of larger national conversations. The follow-up survey also asked participants to suggest key topics and speakers for the 2021 Inclusive SciComm Symposium.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The ISCS is viewed as a helpful model for convening a wide variety of practitioners and researchers to move beyond identifying the shared challenges of their work to co-developing solutions and strategies. The project indicated that conferences designed to promote dialogic practice and networking are important both for professional learning and as potentially meaningful research sites that can further our understanding of and promising practices for critical dialogue and ISC.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The project also identified the demand for more accessible and meaningful evaluation strategies among science communication practitioners. Better evaluation, and the data those efforts yield, could be one of the most sustainable approaches for systematizing inclusive efforts, dismantling silos that hinder more effective integration of knowledge across disciplines, and garnering institutional support.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The survey and focus group responses were used to inform two manuscripts that are in development or under review, as well as an \"Inclusive Science Communication Starter Kit'' and related video. The Starter Kit was developed for a wide audience with the intention of summarizing this project's findings and introducing foundational ISC concepts to a broader range of potential practitioners across informal learning settings. The Starter Kit also highlights a range of relevant research and resources selected to guide readers toward more in-depth discussions of ISC and critical dialogue if they wish to learn more. A short video was created to promote the Starter Kit on social media and other channels.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>In addition to providing this better understanding of motivations, approaches, and community norms regarding inclusive science communication and critical dialogue, the project's findings were applied in designing the 2021 ISCS, which was held in October, 2021.
