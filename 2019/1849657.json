 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a doctoral dissertation research project that studies epidemic diseases in the British Empire. The researcher will develop a comparative study of three cities: Belfast, Melbourne, and Bombay. She will focus on the microbe, the colonial administrator, and the bacteriologist as the central actors in each of the three cases. She will do so by engaging in a study of archival documents and other sources to obtain a deeper understanding of the social, economic, and cultural complexities that make each region unique. She plans to show how specific features of the local environment in these three regions, when combined with plans of sanitary improvement and land use change espoused by the British Empire, served to produce unique environments in which particular microbes thrived. The proposed project draws from multiple disciplinary sources and is intended for multiple disciplinary audiences. The researcher plans to disseminate her research results at conferences and workshops sponsored by history departments, epidemiology and public health departments, public health policy centers, and organizations that engage in climate studies.\r\n\r\nThis project uses a historical frame while engaging with a number of central topics in the field of science and technology studies. It engages with the concept of nonhuman agency with its focus on the ecological specificity of microbes, and it uses Niche Construction Theory to access the localized environments and to draw out their relationship to microbial actors. Cultural construction of science and technology, particularly as it relates to imperialism and nineteenth century colonial practices, will also be an important element of consideration to this project. Using relatively new social scientific frameworks to guide this history, this project will engage with STS in its goal to induce new consideration of the agency of living objects and actor-network theory as a viable historical and social scientific frame.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It calls on historians to address the specificity and agency of nonhuman organisms, and to acknowledge the ways in which human action impacts individual members of the shared ecosystem.</p>\n<p>During the grant period, research was undertaken at three major sites ? in Belfast, Northern Ireland; London, United Kingdom; and Melbourne, Australia. Research at the Linen Hall Library and Public Records Office in Belfast, Northern Ireland, determined which social and political characteristics of the city, combined with ecological factors, likely contributed to the severity of typhoid therein. An early hypothesis ? that the Catholic/Protestant divide that characterized so much of Belfast?s political history may have influenced typhoid epidemiology ? did not hold up to further interrogation. However, the sources revealed an interesting and unexpected connection, as they drew consistent comparisons between Belfast and Dublin, the two major cities of Ireland, which upon further examination shared several ecological similarities that may have contributed to an ecological niche for <em>Salmonella enterica typhi</em>. Both cities were established in a sub-catchment basin on a large, meandering river and shared cultural traditions ? particularly cockle and mussel collection, and consumption of those wares raw ? that may have served as risk factors for high typhoid fever rates. Quantitative and qualitative data analysis indicated that these similarities, as well as differences between the cities ? Belfast?s rather fragmented public health service and its new sewer system which opened onto the major cockle beds of the city, for example ?contributed to Belfast?s continuing struggles with typhoid fever.</p>\n<p>Time spent at the British Library allowed for the collection of remaining statistics on housing, occupation, and disease in Bombay during the plague epidemic, which changed conclusions regarding the geospatial distribution of the plague and revealed new risk factors for plague mortality. Statistical analysis revealed that factors including housing density, occupation, socioeconomic status, position of house (ground floor, first floor, etc.), and location near a port all influenced risk of plague mortality. Furthermore, research undertaken at the British Library and the Wellcome Institute inspired a second chapter on plague which focused on the relationship between rat-flea etiologies of plague and the urban geography of Bombay, as well as a consideration of rats as biopolitical subjects under British colonialism.</p>\n<p>Research in Melbourne focused on questions of nonhuman agency in the form of bovine tuberculosis, drawing the project further into the historical implications of zoonotic disease. Research at the State Library and the Public Records Office of Victoria uncovered nuanced sources on the relationship between sanitation, disease, and the changing geography of livestock in the city in relation to the tuberculosis crisis. Several medical and legal sources also enriched an existing chapter on the ecology of <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> in Melbourne, demonstrating that the city suffered from fragmented public health authority well into the 1890s ? a characteristic it shared with Belfast, though resulting in different sanitary challenges. Thus, access to these sources allowed for the expansion of this section beyond the existing article on disease geography.</p>\n<p>One of the primary goals of the project was to answer a call from the public health sciences to explore the limitations of ecological and statistical approaches in discussing social-ecological systems. By approaching this project through a combination of scientific, social scientific, and historical methodologies and perspectives, the goal of the project was to speak to these disciplines and foster a connection between them. Recent events in global infectious disease in the form of the COVID-19 pandemic have elevated the significance of the project and widened its potential for broader impacts. Epidemiological and social science scholarship highlights unquantifiable structural issues ? including public health system fragmentation, occupational dynamics, and cultures of human-animal interaction, all of which are under examination in this project. Thus work done during the grant period not only led to the completion of my dissertation project, but also fostered interdisciplinary connections with working groups examining epidemic urbanism that will result in the publication of an edited volume chapter.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/16/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Emily&nbsp;L&nbsp;Webster</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1849657/1849657_10592531_1600287029077_Webster_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1849657/1849657_10592531_1600287029077_Webster_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Incidence of Plague in Different Quarters in the City of Bombay\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1849657/1849657_10592531_1600287029077_Webster_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Incidence of Plague in Different Quarters in the City of Bombay\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Mortality statistics compiled from government reports and mapped onto the neighborhoods of Bombay indicate that plague mortality was often highest in neighborhoods closest to the docks, which housed a large population of unskilled and manual laborers in tight quarters.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">National Library of Scotland</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Emily&nbsp;L&nbsp;Webster</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Incidence of Plague in Different Quarters in the City of Bombay</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1849657/1849657_10592531_1600286314579_BelfastPRONIMap--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1849657/1849657_10592531_1600286314579_BelfastPRONIMap--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Plan of the City of Belfast Shewing the Parliamentary and Extended Municipal Boundaries\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1849657/1849657_10592531_1600286314579_BelfastPRONIMap--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Plan of the City of Belfast Shewing the Parliamentary and Extended Municipal Boundaries\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This map demonstrates the boundaries of the city of Belfast at the time of the typhoid epidemic, and will form the basis of a GIS project on typhoid mortality.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Public Records Office of Northern Ireland (PRONI)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Emily&nbsp;L&nbsp;Webster</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Plan of the City of Belfast Shewing the Parliamentary and Extended Municipal Boundaries</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1849657/1849657_10592531_1600287423521_PROVTubercularLung--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1849657/1849657_10592531_1600287423521_PROVTubercularLung--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Surface of Lung With Large Low Tubercular Growths and With Irregular Ridges of Inflammatory Exudation\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1849657/1849657_10592531_1600287423521_PROVTubercularLung--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Surface of Lung With Large Low Tubercular Growths and With Irregular Ridges of Inflammatory Exudation\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">An image of a tuberculous lung extracted from a cow, as part of a report by the government of victoria inquiring as to the extent of tuberculosis infection among cattle.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Public Records Office Victoria</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Emily&nbsp;L&nbsp;Webster</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Surface of Lung With Large Low Tubercular Growths and With Irregular Ridges of Inflammatory Exudation</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
