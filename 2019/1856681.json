 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 17th annual Graduate Student Topology and Geometry Conference is to be held at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign from March 30-31, 2019. It is specifically aimed at graduate students, and many of the talks will be delivered by student participants. The conference will represent a large body of students in different stages of their Ph.D., and will provide a venue for students from a diverse collection of institutions and geographic regions to come together and interact. It aims to create a highly collaborative environment that will stimulate research and foster lasting connections between researchers at particularly crucial moments early in their careers. The structure of the conference (e.g. the lightning talk sessions and brown bag lunch) is designed to encourage future collaborations to strengthen the pool of researchers in this area. The conference will allow graduate students to hear about cutting edge research from established senior leaders and early career faculty.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this conference is to provide a venue for young researchers to be exposed to new research areas, and present their own work in a productive and welcoming environment, while having the chance to engage with experts in the field. Particular attention will be paid to ensure that a broad collection of topics are represented, so that rising generations of mathematicians are aware of the current frontiers of geometry and topology. To this end, there will also be talks by distinguished plenary speakers. These presentations will cover a range of topics in topology and geometry including homotopy theory, low dimensional topology, geometric group theory, geometric analysis, geometric topology, and dynamics. The conference website is: go.math.illinois.edu/gstgc2019\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
