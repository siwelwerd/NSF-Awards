 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marine animals must contend with ongoing environmental shifts and increased human activities in the ocean. Disturbances can affect the behavior of marine mammals, yet associated physiological costs remain unknown. Because their impressive capacity for diving is based on specialized physiology, it is likely that physiological costs limit and define the sensitivity of marine mammals to disturbances. This project will investigate variability of dive physiology in northern elephant seals by using experimental at-sea disturbances that elicit responses to noise - a stressor of global concern. The methods build on state-of-the-art logging technologies and will develop a new probe that will be capable of detecting oxygen management in the body. Cardiovascular physiology and oxygen use of the seals will be measured during routine diving, and compared with animals that experience a remote experimental disturbance while at sea. The project goal is to understand the physiological range and limits of this species, and to provide data that could predict marine mammal resilience to natural and anthropogenic stressors. These data will have wide-reaching implications for sensitive ecosystems and other species of concern that are not easily studied. It will be directly applicable to conservation and management of marine species and habitats. The project will train undergraduates, graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher, and will include extensive public outreach via state parks, and a public aquarium. \r\n\r\nEnvironmental changes, including noise pollution, represent a fundamental challenge to the structure and sustainable function of marine ecosystems. The goal of this project is to identify physiological variability in the oxygen management of a diving seal that can be directly linked to individual success in the ocean. The project's three objectives will be achieved using at-sea data collected from translocated juvenile elephant seals, via integrated measurements of cardiovascular physiology (EKG and oxygen sensors in blood or muscle) with simultaneously collected time-depth records and 3-dimensional acceleration data to interpret underwater activity. Objective 1 will provide the first comprehensive picture of the dive phenotype in the open ocean by characterizing interrelationships among heart rate, blood oxygen depletion, muscle perfusion, and fine scale dive behavior. It will also assess molecular markers of perfusion capability in muscles with different underwater oxygen demands. Objectives 2 & 3 are based on experimentally inducing the behavioral effects of acoustic disturbance observed in many aquatic species - extended dive durations and increased cost of transport. Both objectives will examine oxygen management strategies in response to stimuli. Comparing natural versus perturbed dives permits an assessment of individual plasticity in the dive phenotype, incorporating behavior and physiology. This is a critical first step in determining the capacity of a model species to extend diving, their response to at-sea disruptions in natural dive patterns, and, ultimately, to predict thresholds of disturbance beyond which they cannot compensate.",

Cardiovascular adjustments during diving help to balance the need of many critical tissues for oxygen while managing limited on-board reserves that cannot be replenished until the animal surfaces. Animals, like marine mammals, that inhabit the oceans must contend with increased human activities affecting habitat, in particular increased noise in the ocean from shipping, exploration and recreation. Disturbance is a potentially important factor affecting wildlife but we are still learning about its effects. For divers like marine mammals, it is likely that their specialized physiology defines how flexible their diving abilities and behaviors can be in the face of disturbance. We developed a technology package to track northern elephant seals swimming at sea while monitoring heart rate, blood oxygen, blood temperature, and simultaneous accelerometer recordings to build a comprehensive picture of diving in the open ocean under routine conditions and after an acoustic disturbance. Heart rate is the primary indicator of cardiovascular adjustment during dives, declining dramatically and more intensely in deeper and longer dives, even in routine conditions. Northern elephant seals extend their dives, swimming longer and deeper when they encounter an acoustic disturbance while underwater. Physiologically, disturbance while seals are underwater produces a maximum cardiovascular impact, with elephant seals exhibiting diving heart rates as low as 3 beats per minute. The purpose of heart rate reduction is to conserve circulating oxygen in the blood while the animal is underwater, so consistent with the strongest reductions in heart rate following disturbance, we also observed protection of circulating oxygen levels, suggesting that seals draw down reserves more slowly in disturbed dives. To improve our physiological toolkit for measuring how oxygen is stored, transferred and managed in diving mammals, we also developed and validated a probe capable of measuring the oxygen saturation levels in swimming muscle. We conducted initial field tests and validations in elephant seals as part of this project, which will lay the foundation for future studies in the wild. This integrative project has worked across all collaborating institutions to provide thesis research topics for 3 masters students, data for an undergraduate research topics course, and provided cross-training opportunities for two postdoctoral researchers between biomedicine and engineering.
