 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Association of American Universities (AAU) and the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU) propose to broaden and deepen awareness and understanding of public access issues across the academic research community.  The conference will capitalize on the experiences of \"early adopter\" institutions and leading stakeholder groups in the open science community; the organizers will develop and broadly disseminate a Guide to assist institutions conducting research in creating and implementing public access policies and practices. \r\n\r\nThe steps to achieving the objectives are through  1) developing a framework and strategic plan to guide the long-term engagement necessary to accelerate public access to research data; 2) convening a conference of the prior NSF-funded public access workshop participants to review the plan and prepare for discussions on shared solutions; 3) convening a second conference that brings together early adopters with less engaged institutions and stakeholders (e.g., funders, scientific and professional societies, publishers) to increase understanding of public access and develop content for a Guide to accelerating public access to research data at academic institutions; 4) creating working groups of institutions and stakeholders to explore unresolved challenges; 5) holding a follow-up event to incorporate the working group recommendations into a final Guide; and 6) disseminating the Guide to the higher education research community through a strategic education campaign to reach key leadership communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
