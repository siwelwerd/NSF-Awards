 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research links atmospheric dynamics to atmospheric chemistry through efforts to quantify the influence of atmospheric waves on the chemistry of the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere.  Changes in temperature due to these waves will be modeled using the Whole Atmospheric Community Climate Model (WACCM). This work will provide new tools for use by the broad community of atmospheric modelers.\r\n\r\nThis research is divided into 3 parts. Part 1: Evaluate the amplitude of gravity-wave induced temperature perturbations due to mesoscale gravity waves, using the Community Earth System Model (CESM) parameterizations for gravity waves, and applying these in the chemical scheme of WACCM, focusing on heterogeneous halogen chemistry effects on liquid atmospheric aerosols as well as polar stratospheric clouds.  Part 2: Evaluate the chemical composition responses to equatorial waves at low latitudes using WACCM, focusing on the effects of heterogeneous halogen chemistry and circulation changes induced by the waves. This work will target responses in NO, NO2, N2O5, HNO3, ClONO2, HCl, ozone, and related species such as OH, examining inter-annual variations, and searching for evidence of these in satellite data.  Part 3: Study the influence of gravity waves on a comprehensive range of gas-phase reactions and study the effects on atmospheric composition from the tropopause region to the stratopause.  This effort will focus on the influence of wave activity on the distributions of N2O5, NO, NO2, HNO3, and other species subject to thermal decomposition including PAN.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
