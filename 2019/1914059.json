 "awd_abstract_narration": "Particle physics focuses on understanding the most basic building blocks of Nature and the rules that bind them. The CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), located near Geneva, Switzerland is the world's most powerful particle accelerator, able to reach the highest particle energies in a laboratory setting.   The CMS detector at the LHC is a powerful and sophisticated camera, observing the collisions of protons and recording the byproducts for detailed study by CMS experimentalists. Through this project, the high energy physics group at Notre Dame University will maximize the discovery potential of the CMS experiment through contributions to data analysis, preparations and operations for the next LHC run as well as early data analysis and final R&D in preparation for the high luminosity upgrades of the LHC. \r\n\r\nThe next three years will be a challenging period as the CMS experiment presses forward on three separate fronts: analyzing the nearly 150/fb of data collected during the past run, preparing for and then beginning to analyze twice as much data from the next run, and finalizing the plans and beginning the construction for the high luminosity LHC upgrades. Notre Dame activities include contributions across several areas of the CMS detector including the electromagnetic calorimeter, the hadronic calorimeter, trigger, computing, and offline software. Their physics analysis plans leverage past investments in Higgs and top quark physics, while also establishing new directions for directly and indirectly probing for new physics. The Notre Dame group will continue to leverage their expertise in calorimetry in several Higgs analyses and searches for new phenomena, including Higgs decays to two tau leptons, two photons, or a muon lepton and a tau lepton. Additionally, they will exploit their contributions to the Phase 1 upgrades of CMS calorimetry for improved performance during the next LHC run. They will also continue to coordinate and manage the optical readout and decoding for Endcap and Barrel Hadron Calorimetry. The group has also taken on leadership roles in high-luminosity LHC upgrade projects, including the electromagnetic and hadronic barrel calorimeter upgrades, the endcap calorimeter upgrade, and the addition of a new timing layer detector for CMS. This project also includes contributions to the Level 1 Track Trigger upgrade and continuing contributions to High Level Trigger operations, Offline and Computing, and Data Preservation. \r\n\r\nThe group will engage broadly in Education and Outreach through QuarkNet and many other public-facing initiatives.  Notre Dame is lead and the managing institution of QuarkNet, which currently consists of 52 Centers in 25 States and Puerto Rico and has been expanded to include eleven different experimental programs at seven national and foreign laboratories. Their outreach efforts include development and implementation of electronic laboratories (e-Labs) for LHC data and Cosmic Ray Data, Masterclasses based on particle physics and astrophysics, and participation in programs that support summer research for undergraduates, high school teachers and high school students. Through these efforts, they continue to develop and build upon a suite of outreach materials and demonstration projects that bring particle physics to the public on a number of levels, from real physics analysis on LHC Higgs data in the classroom to a particle detector display at the Smithsonian.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe goal of particle physics is to understand nature at its most fundamental level. In our experiments, we study the basic constituents of matter  the particles  as well as the forces that govern their behavior. All of the experimental results over the past few decades are well described by our Standard Model of particle physics, including the recent discovery at CERN of the Higgs Boson. But we know that the Standard Model is incomplete, and that there must be new particles and perhaps new forces not yet discovered.\n\n\nIntellectual Merit: This grant supported the research of the University of Notre Dame group working at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory, Geneva, Switzerland. Notre Dame is a member of the CMS collaboration, one of two large multi-purpose experiments studying particle collisions at the worlds highest energies. The group supported during this period included five faculty; two research faculty; three postdoctoral researchers; 21 graduate students, 5 of whom earned their doctorate; and a large number of undergraduate physics majors.\n\n\nDuring this period, the Notre Dame group made a number of significant contributions to CMS, including physics analysis, software development, computing, detector operations, and research and development for future CMS upgrades. Building on our key role in the Higgs discovery, specifically in the analysis of the Higgs boson decaying to two photons, our group has been heavily involved in studying the Higgs boson in three main signatures. First is the continued precision study of the Higgs boson to two photons. Second is the measurement of the Higgs decays to fermions.

Our group has leadership roles in CMS software and computing. We have led efforts to evolve and improve the software CMS uses to manage central data processing, including R&D for data processing in the HL-LHC era. We have also led the effort to provide a detailed, accurate simulation of the CMS detector. Emphasis has been on simulating the effects of event pileup that will occur at the higher beam luminosities planned for future LHC running. The Notre Dame group has worked with the universitys Center for Research Computing (CRC) to develop and maintain a Tier 3 computer cluster on campus that is one of the largest in the CMS experiment. This cluster provides our groups computing needs and excess capacity is used by the broader CMS community. Through partnerships with the CRC and computer science faculty, our group has developed an innovative suite of software to enable opportunistic use of spare CRC processors, leveraging up to ten times more processing than is typically available in our dedicated Tier 3 resources.\n\n\nTo optimize the detector for future running at higher energies and higher intensities, CMS has worked on a two-phase upgrade program. The Phase I upgrade is complete and the Notre Dame group had important responsibilities and management roles for key parts of that project. We are now making significant contributions to the Phase II upgrade of CMS for operations at High Luminosity (the HL-LHC). We are leading electronics development for central calorimetry, photosensor development for Endcap Hadron Calorimetry and the Barrel Timing Layer (BTL), and are contributing to the optical design of the BTL and to the design and construction of the tracker readout and track trigger upgrade.\n\n\nBroader Impacts: During this past grant period, Notre Dame faculty served as co-PIs of the national QuarkNet program that has brought particle physics to thousands of high school teachers and students over the past 19 years. There are currently more than 50 QuarkNet centers across the United States and Puerto Rico. We also serve as mentors for our own active local QuarkNet center. Notre Dame faculty helped to lead the effort to make a subset of LHC data available to the public, and now analysis of that data is one of the activities offered to QuarkNet teachers and students. The group has worked with the LHC experiments to extend the reach of particle physics masterclasses to locations in Latin America, Africa and Asia.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/21/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MitchellRWayne\n"
