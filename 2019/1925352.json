 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human mobility can be modeled at different scales, ranging from traffic in a city to global migration patterns. Such models can describe a macroscopic, population-wide behavior or include more levels of detail up to a microscopic description in which individuals are followed. A main task in this project is to convert between the averaged mobility flows at the population level and observed individual trajectories. For example, the habits of commuters and other traffic participants in a city are extracted from records of transportation systems in order to build a model for the population-averaged flow. On the other hand, once this model is established, it permits us to classify how rare an observed pattern is in which a few individuals that were assumed to be independent behave in a very coordinated way. This project includes a similar matching between a model for global migration patterns and the behavior of a small group of migrants. Next to anomaly detection, predicting mobility is important. Once the mobility model is inferred from the observed data, it permits us to compute future events, including the detection of high-traffic areas. This helps determine an expected stress on infrastructure and find vulnerabilities, whether it is for urban traffic or global migration.\r\n\r\nThis project treats the probabilistic description of human dynamics at two levels of detail: The deterministic description of the population-averaged time evolution, and the description of the random outcomes for individual trajectories. A version of the Feynman-Kac formula for perturbations of Markov semigroups is the central element that connects the two levels of the probabilistic description. The proposed techniques for model building from sample trajectories are new developments in the emergent field of graph signal processing, together with elements of statistics and dynamical systems. The behavior of dynamics at both population-averaged and individual levels is characterized by the generator. It encodes the probabilities for observing an event and allows us to predict flows or to compute likelihood ratios between observed and most likely trajectories, which permits classifying the behavior of individuals. A main problem addressed in this project is to obtain an accurate estimate for the generator of population flows for models at different scales. This estimate is then used to predict mobility or to detect anomalies in small sets of individual trajectories. Mobility patterns considered in this project include migration, the time evolution of a global population whose members move between countries, or mobility at a smaller scale, for example the inference of traffic flows from observing individuals through GPS traces or data acquired by transportation systems in a city. This project investigates under which additional, regularizing assumptions reliable estimates of the generator can be made. In that case, anomalies in mobility patterns can be detected with desired levels for likelihood ratios. The regularization includes optimal transport plans and techniques of time-frequency analysis applied to signals on graphs. The outcomes of this project will complement models for human mobility in the engineering literature by providing performance guarantees and rigorous error estimates.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
