 "awd_abstract_narration": "Breakthroughs in low-cost photovoltaics and lighting technologies can transform global energy systems and reduce environmental impact of human activities. Hybrid halide perovskites have emerged as an important class of optoelectronic materials for a diverse range of applications, including solar energy harvesting and solid-state lighting. The objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that the reaction between an amine and a hybrid halide perovskite has a threshold amine pressure, below which the reaction can be used to reliably synthesize a nanoscale shell around the perovskite, improving its environmental stability and interfacial electrical properties.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research project aims to develop fundamental understanding of reactions between amine vapors and hybrid perovskite substrates. A custom-built glove box vacuum reactor with in situ infrared spectroscopy, quartz crystal microbalance, and mass spectrometry will be used to enable detailed studies of the chemical reaction mechanisms and identify the threshold pressure in a set of important amine-perovskite reactions. The effects of amine size, proton affinity, chemical composition and processing temperature on the threshold pressure will be studied. Operating conditions will be identified that allow precise control of the extent of reaction for reliable growth of nanometer-scale structures. The project will be used to train a PhD student on state-of-the-art experimental methods in the field of surface science and nanoscale materials synthesis and characterization. Proposed activities aimed at integrating research and education include curriculum development to incorporate surface science concepts into undergraduate and graduate courses and research opportunities for undergraduate students. Outreach activities to K-12 students are planned to promote awareness of the fields of surface science, nanotechnology and environmental sustainability, and to encourage students to pursue STEM careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
