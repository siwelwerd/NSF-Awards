 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Committee on New Researchers of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics will hold its 2019 conference at Colorado State University, July 24-27, 2019. Each participant will give a brief introduction to his/her research, as well as a poster presentation. Plenary talks will be given by established researchers. There will be panel discussions on teaching and mentoring, publishing, funding, and finding collaborators. The other workshops supported by this grant will include oral and poster presentations by new researchers, plenary talks by established researchers, and open discussions of future directions for statistics, probability, and data science.\r\n\r\nColorado State University will host a conference for new researchers in statistics and probability from July 24-27, 2019. The meeting is organized by the IMS Committee on New Researchers and held for junior researchers working in different areas of Statistics and Probability. The primary objective of the conference is to provide a platform for interaction among new researchers, as well as opportunities to seek mentorship from leading researchers in the field. This conference series is explicitly aimed at training the future leaders and researchers in probability and statistics. This funding will further support new researcher participation at subject-specific workshops and conferences throughout the year, including the Atlantic Causal Inference Conference (an annual meeting of causal inference researchers held in Montreal in May 2019) and the Preparing for Careers in Teaching Statistics and Data Science Workshop (an annual workshop for early career educators in statistics and probability to be held in Colorado in July 2019).\r\n\r\nDetails can be found at http://groups.imstat.org/newresearchers/conferences/nrc.html.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
