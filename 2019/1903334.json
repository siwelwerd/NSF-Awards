 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major objective of climate science is to evaluate ongoing planetary warming within the context of past natural variations of the climate system, such as the well-known Little Ice Age and Dark Ages cold periods, and Medieval and Roman warm periods, as well as warmer-than-present conditions in some regions registered during the early Holocene, about 8,000 to 10,000 years ago. These past climatic anomalies are best documented from the Northern Hemisphere; thus, it is not clear whether they constituted global fluctuations in the atmospheric heat budget or if they were regional in nature. This question has fundamental implications for understanding the underlying drivers of natural climate variability, and for determining whether industrial-age warming has yet exceeded the envelope of climate variability registered over the past 10,000 years. This project establishes the record of Holocene climate variations, based on glaciers and temperature-sensitive trees, in the Southern Alps of New Zealand - on the opposite side of the planet from the North Atlantic region. Mountain glaciers are among Earth's most sensitive climate recorders on timescales of decades and longer. Worldwide recession of mountain glaciers is an iconic illustration of global warming. Glacial landforms afford physical evidence of past glacier extent, and this effort will employ state-of-the-art cosmogenic dating techniques on those landforms to establish precise and accurate chronologies of glacier changes during and prior to the period of recorded observations. This work incorporates tree-ring chronologies of temperature-sensitive South Island species that afford continuous records of climatic fluctuations on annual timescales. Altogether, chronologies of glacier extent and tree growth will be used to develop a comprehensive record of past temperature variation in the Southern Alps for comparison to equivalent records in the Northern Hemisphere. The resultant temperature reconstruction will also provide a key metric for evaluating a suite of global climate and earth-system models developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, some of which are now being used for weather forecasting by the National Weather Service. This effort will afford field-based educational experiences for the next generation of scientists and science journalists. \r\n\r\nA goal of paleoclimate research is to understand patterns and drivers of natural climate variations during the Holocene. Documentation of natural climate variability on orbital, centennial, and shorter frequencies provides a contextual framework for modeling ongoing and future warming due to the effects of increasing atmospheric CO2. The most recent major natural climatic variations in the North Atlantic regime prior to the ongoing warming were those of the Roman Warm Period (~250 B.C. to ~A.D. 400), Dark Ages Cold Period (~A.D. 450 to ~A.D. 950), Medieval Warm Period (~A.D. 950 to ~A.D. 1150) and the Little Ice Age (~A.D. 1150 to ~A.D. 1850). These late-Holocene temperature variations are documented by highly resolved records of glacier-length variation in the European Alps, as well as independent, annually resolved tree-ring-based regional summer temperature reconstructions. In addition, European glaciers monitored a period of reduced ice extent during the early Holocene at the same time as tree-line altitudes were higher. Both observations signify summers that were warmer than those of today. But it is not yet clear whether these climate signatures were global or regional in scope; thus, the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain. This work will address this problem by developing a precise 10Be surface-exposure chronology of moraines constructed by glaciers during the Holocene in the Southern Alps of New Zealand - on the opposite side of the planet from the European Alps. The researchers will also develop chronology of Holocene ice retraction by 14C dating recently deglaciated organic remains. Investigators employ a well-calibrated glaciological model to convert these moraine chronologies into a glacier-derived record of temperature over the past two millennia. The proposed glacier chronology will be synthesized with an independent and complementary record of regional summer temperatures for the past 2000 years derived from South Island silver pine ring widths. The glacier and tree-ring records will be used as benchmarks to investigate results from the GFDL ESM2M preindustrial climate simulations. On the basis of this glacier, dendro, and modeling approach, the goal of this work is to determine whether Holocene climate variations were global or not, and therefore improve understanding of underlying drivers and the scope of natural climate variability in light of ongoing planetary warming.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The &lsquo;Medieval Warm Period (MWP)&rsquo; (~CE 900-1200) followed by the &lsquo;Little Ice Age (LIA)&rsquo; (~CE 1200-1850) has been a particularly complex and controversial interval with direct links to the evolution of human society. What triggered the MWP/LIA climate changes? Were the climate changes of the last 2000 years, including the MWP-LIA interval, inter-hemispherically coherent? Or does the Southern Hemisphere present an individual climate pattern distinct from the Northern Hemisphere? These fundamental climate questions have been in the focus of geoscientists for decades, but global mapping and dating these events has proven challenging to date. Novel approaches have pushed these limits and now afford for thorough experiments to test these hypothesis. Mountain glaciers on both hemispheres have been shown to be extremely sensitive to even small climate changes, and leave behind sediment deposits refered to as 'moraines', and other traces of their past configurations, that can be mapped, and since recently also precisely and consistently dated by an isotope method refered to as &lsquo;cosmogenic nuclide surface exposure dating&rsquo;. The goal of this project has been to apply the cosmogenic nuclide dating tool to establish a thorough reconstruction of mountain glaciers in New Zealand's southern Alps over the last 2 millennia, and in particular over and since the LIA period, and to compare these reconstructions to treering-based climate records and published glacier and climate records from the Northern Hemisphere, including the Swiss Alps and Scandinavia.</p>\n<p>Our team developed and established the geochemical and analytical techniques to date the rock surfaces related to the past glacier configuration, including the last millennia. Rock surfaces exposed for as little as a few decades can now be dated by cosmogenic nuclide surface exposure dating, and those cosmogenic nuclide chronologies are the analytical core of this project, are robust and reproducible and can be established in cosmogenic laboratories across the US and beyond. Multiple intense field campaigns to New Zealand's Southern Alps, lead by the University of Maine team realized the mapping of recent mountain glacier configuration together with the sampling of boulders and bedrock surfaces documenting the glacier changes of the last millennia in New Zealand. Within this project, we have produced new cosmogenic nuclide chronologies from these glacier deposits that are directly comparable to sister-chronologies from mountain glacier in the northern hemisphere.</p>\n<p style=\"text-indent: .5in;\">We can summarize the climatically critical inter-hemispheric aspects of our findings of glacier change during the last 2000 years in New Zealand as follows: While the overall pattern of glacier retreat through the Holocene period (the last 11,700 years of inter-glacial climate) appears to be inter-hemispherically distinct -with a rather steady retreat pattern of New Zealand's glaciers through the Holocene and an early Holocene period of very small glaciers followed by glacier re-advances starting about 4000 years ago culminating in the Little Ice Age in the North- there appear to be striking multi-decadal to centennial scale similarities in the glacier records of Northern and Southern mid-latitudes. The most prominent of these 'inter-hemispheric glacier and climate events of the latest Holocene' are moraine formation periods in the middle of the 'Medieval Warm Period' about 1100 years ago, and the two latest cold pulses during the Little Ice Age, about 400-300 years ago and between 250-150 years ago. We produced comparable Little Ice Age moraine records in the Swiss and Austrian Alps and published the results in 3 papers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-indent: .5in;\">These chronologic findings provide a first direct inter-hemispheric comparison of glacier dynamics over the last 2000 years, and indicated that &lsquo;hemispheric&rsquo; climate drivers were dominant during the longer-term/millennial time-scale, but that inter-hemispheric climate signals were super-imposed, triggering the inter-hemispherically coherent glacier responses. In an interval of relatively stable greenhouse-gas concentrations in the atmosphere, a possible candidate to drive these inter-hemispheric climate and glacier signals would be changes in the intensity of the solar irradiation, i.e. changes in the amount of energy the sun has provided to planet earth during the critical last two millennia. We are currently analyzing and testing this hypothesis, which could partially explain the enigma refered to as the MWP-LIA oscillation.</p>\n<!-- @font-face \t{font-family:\"Cambria Math\"; \tpanose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:roman; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face \t{font-family:Calibri; \tpanose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:swiss; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-469750017 -1040178053 9 0 511 0;}p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal \t{mso-style-unhide:no; \tmso-style-qformat:yes; \tmso-style-parent:\"\"; \tmargin:0in; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:12.0pt; \tfont-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}p \t{mso-style-noshow:yes; \tmso-style-priority:99; \tmso-margin-top-alt:auto; \tmargin-right:0in; \tmso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; \tmargin-left:0in; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:12.0pt; \tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif; \tmso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";}.MsoChpDefault \t{mso-style-type:export-only; \tmso-default-props:yes; \tfont-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi; \tmso-font-kerning:0pt; \tmso-ligatures:none;}div.WordSection1 \t{page:WordSection1;} --><!-- @font-face \t{font-family:\"Cambria Math\"; \tpanose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:roman; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face \t{font-family:Calibri; \tpanose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:swiss; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-469750017 -1040178053 9 0 511 0;}p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal \t{mso-style-unhide:no; \tmso-style-qformat:yes; \tmso-style-parent:\"\"; \tmargin:0in; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:12.0pt; \tfont-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}p \t{mso-style-noshow:yes; \tmso-style-priority:99; \tmso-margin-top-alt:auto; \tmargin-right:0in; \tmso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; \tmargin-left:0in; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:12.0pt; \tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif; \tmso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";}.MsoChpDefault \t{mso-style-type:export-only; \tmso-default-props:yes; \tfont-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi; \tmso-font-kerning:0pt; \tmso-ligatures:none;}div.WordSection1 \t{page:WordSection1;} --><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 02/29/2024<br>\nModified by: Joerg&nbsp;M&nbsp;Schaefer</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
