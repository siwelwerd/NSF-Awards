 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This project brings undergraduates to the University of Florida to conduct research on the physics of materials and their applications.  Having students conduct research while an undergraduate is one of the best ways to encourage them to continue in science, technology, and engineering education.  Applications come from across the United States, and there is a special emphasis on recruiting and accepting students from schools with limited research opportunities and from underrepresented groups in science and engineering.  For many students this is their first and perhaps only opportunity to experience advanced scientific research.  The research conducted lays the scientific foundation for the next generation of materials used in a myriad of applications.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: Each student works with a faculty mentor from physics, chemistry or materials science and engineering, alongside other members of their research group in a 10-week program.  The research topics include: measuring the electronic, magnetic, thermal, and optical properties of nanometer scale materials, growing new materials including superconductors and those with topological properties, and computational modeling of electronic and biomaterials. The research conducted lays the foundation for applications of new materials. Students in the program attend professional development workshops on written and oral communication, applying to graduate school, cutting edge scientific research, and visit scientific facilities both on and off the University of Florida campus.  The students become sufficiently knowledgeable in their research area that they give tours of their research labs during week 6 of the program. At the end of the program participants write a 10 to 20-page paper and give a presentation on their research. Many participants also present their results at scientific meetings and/or publish their results.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In addition the students participated in professional development workshops on academic and non-academic career paths, scientific writing and speaking, and talks and tours of different research areas relating to condensed matter physics and applied materials.\n\nIntellectual merit: Each student did original research and wrote a 10-20 page project report at the end of the program advancing the knowledge in the physics of materials.  Approximately 30% of the students submitted an abstract to a scientific meeting and several have been coauthors on published articles with several more in the works.

Several projects every year involved computation and simulation including using the UF HiPerGator 3.0 supercomputer, but most of the projects were hands-on experimental research.\n\nBroader impacts:This program is designed to inform and encourage students to continue their education in a STEM field to create our next generation of scientists and engineers.  Students are able to try and learn about different areas of research.  Based on tracking of over 100 students from this program and from our earlier programs going back to 2009, 88% of our students go on to graduate school after completing their undergraduate degree, and these students eventually take STEM related jobs.  The most common permanent job areas are engineering, software development, and data science.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/23/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Selman P Hershfield"
