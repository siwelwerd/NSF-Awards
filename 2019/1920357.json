 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will permit the purchase of a new Wavelength Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometer to replace an aging instrument purchased in 2002. The new instrument will open up many new research avenues.  The new analytical instrument will be an important tool in educating the next generation of scientists. These analytical instruments allow students to participate as partners in research. By having such equipment available, students can ask questions and form and test their own hypotheses, and perhaps most importantly, revise their hypotheses as they collect new data.  The researchers and students will use the instrument to address questions such as the sources of heavy metal contaminants in groundwaters of the San Joaquin Valley of central California, an area where access to clean drinking water can be problematic for many residents.\r\n\r\nThis award will fund a new X-ray fluorescence spectrometer to provide essential support for the following: (a) Studies of ancient and active volcanoes that provide tests of how and why volcanoes erupt; (b) Examination of metamorphic rocks of the California Coast Ranges, to determine how subductions zones (the collision of two tectonic plates) affect the kinds of rocks that are produced at Earth's surface; and (c) An interdisciplinary collaboration to study how soils interact with groundwater to affect the quality of drinking water in California's Central Valley.  Many small towns in the \"Valley\" rely on groundwater for drinking, but many such communities have groundwater that is contaminated by uranium, arsenic, chromium and other heavy metals. This collaborative study will combine expertise in microbiology, mineralogy and groundwater chemistry to identify how such contaminants enter groundwater, which will lead to viable mitigation efforts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Among our field samples, soils from backyards, and areas burned by the Creek Fire are gaining the most attention. As to the former, students enrolled in EES 100 (Analytical Methods in Earth and Environmental Sciences) have collected samples from their backyards; earlier this semester, we discovered that 80% show (via XRD analysis) evidence of pesticide residues. Students are investigating the depths at which that pesticide signal might disappear, and prompted our search for other kinds of contaminants, such as heavy metals. We are now analyzing these same backyard&nbsp; soil samples for trace elements, as one of our graduate students (Bryant Vandervelde)&nbsp; has just created a new calibration that will allow us to test for Pb and As, and possibly U, as well as metals such as Co, Mn, Cd, etc. On another project, a graduate student (Amanda Ausman) is studying the effects of structure fires (burned homes and outbuildings) related to the Creek Fire that swept through the Shaver Lake region in the fall of 2020. That fire burned over 800 homes/structures and potentially released heavy metals into the soil and groundwater. We are at the sample-collection stage and will study the degree of contamination at the sites of burned structures, and then test for how far-travelled such contaminants are by measuring metal concentrations as increasing distances into the local forests. Later, we plan to measure possible related groundwater contamination in the Shaver Lake area, making use of Rigaku?s sample preparation methods that allow analyses of aqueous fluids. Another soil-related project involves the study of meadows and the effect of controlled burns on indigneous species. Some evidence from controlled burns undertaken by the North Fork Mono tribe show that periodic controlled, or ?cultural? burns aid the development of deer grass and other species that support traditional cultural practice (e.g., deer grass is used for basket making). We propose to examine soil mineralogy (via XRD) and P, K and N contents via XRF, to compare soils from unburned to regularly burned meadows, to test whether cultural burning activities affect soil fertility or heavy metal contents in some way that might facilitate the growth of indigineous plant species. Finally, Mr. Vandevelde is also making use of the XRF to analyze rock samples from the Dinkey Creek pluton, alos in the Shaver Lake region. This pluton is ca. 105 Ma and is one of the largest plutons in the central Sierra Nevada, and bridges the gap On age and space) between the intensively studied Bass Lake Tonalite and Mt. Givens plutons. The Dinkey Creek pluton is virtually unstudied so we are conducting a reconnaissance study to better understand its petrologic origin and emplacement, and to better understand the development of the Sierra Nevada Batholith in this part of CA. While this investigation is fundamentally petrologic, we expect that the Kinkey Creek pluton may inform us about groundwater quality in areas of the Shaver Lake region that experience high U contents.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><br /><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The XRF has also been connected to two subsequent NSF-supported initiatives: the </span><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.agu.org/bridge-program\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #1155cc; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">AGU Bridge Program</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> and our department?s </span><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2120051&amp;HistoricalAwards=false\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #1155cc; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">GEOBOND program</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">.&nbsp; These efforts seek to support more student success and equity in the geosciences, with students recruited to the department through these programs able to take courses with an XRF course-based research component (like EES 100) and also engage in individual XRF-related research.&nbsp; Currently, an AGU Bridge graduate student (Matthew Lokatoon) is starting a project that will use the XRF to measure the geochemistry of aquifer sediments from two new wells for the City of Fresno, with the goal of using the chemical results to improve groundwater sustainability and resiliency in our critically overdrafted, drought-stricken area.&nbsp; We are currently recruiting for students interested in being mentored and using the XRF for their own undergraduate research. &nbsp; </span></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/02/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Keith&nbsp;D&nbsp;Putirka</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
