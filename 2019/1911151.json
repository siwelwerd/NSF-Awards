 "awd_abstract_narration": "The operations of the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO), for the discovery and characterization of transient events by monitoring them minutes to hours after their discovery, will be continued for the next three years.  The worldwide network of 21 robotic telescopes which allows almost constant access to the sky, will after discovery of a transient event, initiate procedures to reference its position if necessary and continuously observe it without gaps for local daytime.  LCO will observe any future transient events including IceCube alerts and any three detector Ligo-Virgo neutron star alerts which will possibly number in the tens of events. After discovery and localization for position, alerts will immediately be sent out to the scientific community.  The LCO network and an array of other facilities in conjunction with international partners will monitor the electromagnetic emission to characterize the newly discovered transients.  The postdoc and graduate student will integrate new telescopes into the LCO network increasing their STEM skills in instrumentation and robotics.  A new education module for high school students will be developed by the PI that focuses on kilonova and transients. \r\n\r\nThis grant will support the 24/7 operation of the for the operation of the LCO's world-wide network of telescopes for the next three years.  During this period, the LCO network upon receiving an alert of transient emission from Ligo/Virgo of the detection of Gravitational Waves, IceCube of a neutrino event, will detect/discover electromagnetic radiation from its optical counterpart and refine the position given by the alert, and immediately notify the astronomical community.  This will allow the LCO network and other telescope facilities to monitor the electromagnetic radiation early in the outburst to fully characterize and model the its source and understand the conditions giving rise to it.\r\n\r\nThis Project advances the goals of the NSF Windows on the Universe Big Idea\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
