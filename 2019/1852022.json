 "awd_abstract_narration": "The SURGE REU will match 10 undergraduate students to faculty in Stanford Earth (Stanford School of Earth, Energy and Environmental Sciences) that are in their area of interest. The undergraduate students will come from community colleges or four-year universities in the US with eight-week-long mentored research experiences during the summers of 2020 through 2022 in the areas of Earth System Science, Energy Resources Engineering, Geological Sciences, and Geophysics. In the selection process, priority will be given to students from underrepresented backgrounds in the Earth and environmental sciences, including students who do not have prior research experience and who come from undergraduate institutions with limited research opportunities. Within this three-year span, the SURGE program will provide research opportunities to 30 students with the aim of helping to create a diverse pipeline into Earth and environmental sciences post-graduate programs and careers. \r\n\r\nSURGE Scholars will be matched with faculty members based on research interest, application essays, letters of recommendation, and interviews. In addition to gaining scientific training in a Stanford Earth research group, students will also participate in graduate school preparation and professional development activities such as a GRE prep course that meets twice per week and workshops on applying to graduate school, planning career trajectories, and giving oral presentations. Participants will also have the opportunity to participate in coding workshops. Weekly faculty research seminars will familiarize students to a broad range of research topics in the Earth sciences, while educational field trips will provide opportunities for students to learn in the field and build a sense of community. A research symposium concludes the program, where students present their project findings through oral presentations and posters in front of faculty, mentors, and other Stanford Earth colleagues who help review the presentations. SURGE scholars will live on the Stanford campus and have access to dining halls and other Stanford amenities, sharing the residential experience with fellow scholars and thus enhancing the cohort research experience. Program success will be measured through student and faculty surveys. SURGE scholars will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths and to provide an alumni network.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The main objectives of SURGE are to: (1) provide scholars with a research experience in a SDSS laboratory and research group; (2) prepare scholars for graduate school and introduce career opportunities in geoscience- and engineering-related fields; and (3) strengthen scholars&rsquo; academic and scientific identities. Pre- and post-program surveys were administered to evaluate impact and outcomes of the program each year. Between 2020 to 2023, 63 scholars completed the program. Forty-five of the 63 scholars were funded by this NSF award.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p>\n<p>Scholars were asked each year to rank the overall quality of the program and the average between 2020-2023 was 4.75 (1-lowest, 5-highest). The high score and success of the program can be attributed to the positive outcomes that occurred each year, even with the program being completely remote in 2020 and 2021. When comparing pre- and post-program surveys for each cohort, results continuously show that SURGE scholars gain knowledge and skills in research and confidence in STEM-related skills including effective oral and written science communication and networking. Scholars also gained a greater understanding and preparedness for graduate school and careers in geosciences and engineering. Aspects of the program that ranked as highly beneficial each year included mentoring, exposure to Earth sciences research and topics, curriculum (including workshops, panel discussions and preparation courses about GRE test-taking, graduate school, statistics and coding) and community-building activities, which fostered networking, relationship building and a sense of belonging. SURGE has also positively impacted scholars beyond the SURGE program. Between 2020-2023, scholars produced 23 products based on the research conducted as part of their respective SURGE projects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p>\n<p>SURGE has attracted a diverse pool of students interested in geosciences and engineering for over 13 years. Since 2011, SURGE has received a total of 1937 applications and 197 scholars have conducted research with 54 different faculty across the seven different departments/programs in SDSS (formerly Stanford Earth). Thirteen cohorts of SURGE scholars have matriculated through the program, including 4 cohorts of NSF REU scholars since 2020. SURGE students have hailed from over 95 different universities across 34 different states and territories, including community colleges, minority serving institutions (MSIs), and non-RI colleges. For more than 70% of SURGE alumni, this program was their first experience conducting independent research. The demographic makeup of SURGE alumni reflects a range of underrepresented groups in STEM. Over half of the alumni identify as first-generation college students, two-thirds of the scholars from 2020-2023 identified as female, and nearly 80% of alumni identify as a racial or ethnic underrepresented minority (URM). Of the 63 students that have matriculated through SURGE since 2020, 29 identified as Latinx/Hispanic, 15 African American/Black, four Native American, three Pacific Islander, nine East Asian/Southeast Asian, two Arab/ Muslim/Pakistani and five White. More than 13% identified as having a disability. Since 2020, there has been one scholar with veteran status.</p>\n<p>Alumni are now making an impact in the field of geoscience and engineering by entering various academic paths and graduate programs. Eighty-four SURGE alumni have enrolled or graduated from graduate programs at more than 62 different universities, including Cornell, Johns Hopkins, Miami University, MIT, Purdue, Rice University, Stanford, University of Chicago, UConn, University of Maryland, UC Riverside, and UT Rio Grande. Of the SURGE alumni who have applied to Stanford&rsquo;s geoscience and engineering graduate school programs, 22 SURGE scholars have received admission, with six of those scholars are currently enrolled at Stanford in the Earth Systems Sciences, Geophysics and Earth &amp; Planetary Sciences departments. Thus far, SURGE alumni have reported contributing to over 45 publications, including in academic journals such as <em>the Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, the Journal of Geophysical Research, Lithosphere, and Environmental Science &amp; Technology</em>, <em>Nature Energy, and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. </em>Our alumni have also been recognized and awarded with fellowships, including an NSF-STEM Scholarship and the University of California Chancellor&rsquo;s Fellowship. They have graduated from their PhD program and are holding academic positions, including faculty positions. Alumni from the SURGE 2014 cohort are now assistant professors at Cornell University in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences and at Dartmouth College in Environmental Studies. Alumni are also diversifying the field as professionals in industry, government agencies, and nonprofits. Around 49% of alumni have entered the workforce, joining organizations including Virginia Tech Museum of Geosciences, USGS, U.S. Forest Service, Los Alamos National Lab, and companies (Microsoft, Apple, Romig Engineers).</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 02/26/2024<br>\nModified by: Jonathan&nbsp;Payne</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1852022/1852022_10615018_1707335918153_IMG_2755__1_--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1852022/1852022_10615018_1707335918153_IMG_2755__1_--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2023 SURGE Scholars\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1852022/1852022_10615018_1707335918153_IMG_2755__1_--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2023 SURGE Scholars\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2023 SURGE cohort posing in front of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability (formerly Stanford Earth) building.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sophia Gunning</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jonathan&nbsp;Payne\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2023 SURGE Scholars</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1852022/1852022_10615018_1707607287400_Take2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1852022/1852022_10615018_1707607287400_Take2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"2020 SURGE Scholars\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1852022/1852022_10615018_1707607287400_Take2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"2020 SURGE Scholars\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2020 SURGE Scholars successfully completed the program remotely.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Lupe Carrillo</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jonathan&nbsp;Payne\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2020 SURGE Scholars</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1852022/1852022_10615018_1707607777579_20220812_125603_1891--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1852022/1852022_10615018_1707607777579_20220812_125603_1891--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2022 SURGE Research Symposium\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1852022/1852022_10615018_1707607777579_20220812_125603_1891--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2022 SURGE Research Symposium\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2022 SURGE Scholar presenting research poster at the Research Symposium</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jerry Wang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jonathan&nbsp;Payne\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2022 SURGE Research Symposium</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
