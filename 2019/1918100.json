 "awd_abstract_narration": "Negative emotions happen every day and those thoughts and feelings can undermine a person's success and health. Research shows that the harmful effects of negative emotions are greater among Americans compared to East Asians. This project focuses on understanding how negative emotions assert their negative influence. It considers whether the way a person views and interprets negative emotions influences the effects of those emotions. One theory is that unfavorable beliefs about negative emotions make those negative emotions more harmful. The primary hypothesis is that negative emotions per se are not negative. How people respond to those negative emotions, however, produces the negative outcomes. Research suggests that Americans, compared to East Asians, view negative emotions as more harmful. Such differences in how people think about negative emotions produce the negative outcomes. This project lays the foundation for the design of interventions that promote more effective ways to respond to negative emotions. The research will help teachers improve the learning and success of their students and help counselors who work with patients who have mood and anxiety disorders.  \r\n\r\nThis project examines the cognitive, physiological, mental health, and performance outcomes of cultural differences in beliefs about negative emotions. Multiple behavioral experiments examine how people respond to stressful events. Measures of cognitive, behavioral, and hormonal responses are used to compare American with East Asian samples. Stress responses to emotional experiences and arousal are measured via cortisol. Participants respond to different demanding tasks (such as giving a speech or doing difficult math problems) to test for performance and physiological reaction differences to the stressors. Interpretations of one's negative emotions are measured to test for subsequent outcome differences in stress and performance. This project helps to develop more general principles about the causes and effects of negative emotions. In addition to advancing the fields of psychology and affective neuroscience, this research offers many practical and applied implications for improving student success and developing interventions for patients with mood and anxiety disorders.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
