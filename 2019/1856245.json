 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among coral reefs of the world, few are as diverse, poorly known, environmentally variable, and threatened by global climate change as those of the Indo-West Pacific marine region near Oman. Reef communities in this region survive or thrive across extremes of temperatures, salinities, pH, and oxygen, and thus offer a glimpse of biological adaptations to future global ocean conditions. This study will document the diversity of marine invertebrate animals in reefs near Oman as part of a large-scale survey utilizing an integrated set of collecting, imaging, genetic, and informatics tools. Researchers will focus on the discovery, description and analysis of understudied invertebrate phyla, which will include a high proportion of species new to science or endemic to waters around the Arabian Peninsula. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in the systematics and biogeography of selected groups and will develop a range of skills including field and genomic techniques. Researchers will create a training workshop, a graduate course, and a massive open online course to educate the next generation about biodiversity survey methods of poorly sampled marine environments. Outreach and educational initiatives will leverage institutional capacities at the Florida Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian, and California Academy of Sciences to engage diverse public audiences in understanding the value of threatened coral reef environments. \r\n\r\nResearchers will survey marine invertebrate phyla within coastal reef habitats of the Arabian Sea, Gulf of Oman, and the Arabian/Persian Gulf using targeted and broad-spectrum methods. Researchers will further document diversity through community DNA sequencing of plankton, benthic assemblages, and recruited biota on autonomous reef monitoring structures. Approximately 20,000 lots of specimens will be preserved for study in museum collections, imaged, and sequenced, and distributed to a network of collaborating taxonomists for analysis. An estimated 3000 species will be fully characterized as a consequence. Researchers will describe new species where warranted and will assess the relative roles of relictualism, basinal isolation, ecological speciation, and long-distance colonization as sources of diversity, endemism, and evolutionary novelty in the Arabian Peninsula reef communities. These data, which will be shared in public repositories, will provide baseline information regarding marine biodiversity for monitoring purposes and for comparison to other areas of the Indo-West Pacific marine region.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
