 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to accelerate the commercialization of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology.  For color displays (TV, cell phone, computer, virtual reality, watches, etc.) OLED is superior to all existing technologies in terms of energy usage, display color space, viewing angle, etc.  For lighting, OLED fixtures use very low energy, the light is soft, casts no shadow, and is architecturally flexible.  OLED is the display and lighting technology of the future.  However cost and short device lifetime has retarded commercial advancement.  The introduction of an entirely new class of materials for OLED manufacturing will enable this advancement. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project will reduce OLED cost and improve performance by utilizing a new class of photoelectric materials for the nanometer thick layers that comprise an OLED.  OLED layers utilize single-component small molecules for the charge transporting and light-emitting layers.  These molecules tend to crystallize and are poor solvents for the emitting molecules leading to decreased light emission efficiency and shortened device lifetime.  The innovation is using isomeric mixtures of designed molecules that are amorphous and non-crystallizable in all three layers.  These molecules are chemically designed to meet all the required photophysical and electrical characteristics necessary for superior OLED performance.  Preliminary device fabrication and testing has confirmed that these new materials dramatically improve both emission efficiency and device lifetime with the standard emitter molecules.  Due to the physics of charge recombination in the emitter layer there is only one technology which has the potential to harvest 100% of the injected charge as emitted light:  thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF).  OLEDs using TADF technology have demonstrated high efficiency but with very short device lifetime.  This project will couple the new non-crystallizable technology with TADF to design and fabricate OLED devices with both high efficiency and long life to meet commercialization requirements.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project was to accelerate the commercialization of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology.  In this project an entirely new class of OLED materials has been validated for use in TADF (thermally activated delayed fluorescence) based OLEDs.  Commercial OLEDs are multilayer devices with layers to transport charge and emit  light emitting.  All layers are vacuum deposited single-molecule based amorphous films.  Light emitting layers are doped with light-emitting molecules.  The physics and chemistry of these molecules, and the device architecture, must be carefully tailored to ensure high efficiency and long life.  Single-molecule based layers have the disadvantages of being prone to crystallization and are poor solvents for the light-emitting dopants which will tend to aggregate.  These are sources of poor OLED performance.  To improve OLED efficiency there are many recent research reports proposing TADF light emitting dopants as the best approach to 100% efficiency for conversion of charge into light. \n\nNon-crystallizable functional materials are isomeric mixtures which will never crystallize and because they are mixtures they are excellent solvents for the light-emitting dopants.  These advantages, when coupled with TADF emitters, will enable the more rapid commercialization of TADF-based OLEDs.  Many non-crystallizable materials were synthesized: hole-transporting, electron transporting, and ambi-polar.  These were purified and fully characterized for their relevant electrical, physical, and photophysical properties.  Research verified that the single molecule hosts will readily crystallize and that non-crystallizable materials are better solvents for emitter molecules.  The functionality of these materials as hole-transporting, electron-transporting, hole-blocking, electron-blocking, and emitter layer hosts (with the appropriate charge transport characteristics) was verified in OLED devices with both TADF and the traditional phosphorescent emitters.  The major initial focus was on the fabrication of OLEDs using TADF molecules which emit green and blue light with no attempt initially to optimize performance.  In these experiments the emitter layer had a non-crystallizable host and other layers were either non-crystallizable or single molecule.  Over 100 different devices were fabricated with a \"control\" device in each run with the emitter layer having a conventional single-molecule host.  We verified that some devices with non-crystallizable based OLEDs matched or exceeded the standard OLED performance characteristics of light emission efficiency (EQE) and electrical efficiency (Lm/Watt).  For example a blue-light TADF-based OLED had efficiency 17% EQE (17.5 Lm/Watt) and a green-light TADF based OLED had efficiency 10% EQE (32.1 Lm/Watt).  Furthermore, a 17-layer \"white\" light device using a blue TADF emitter layer with non-crystallizable materials as the hole and electron-transport layers and the emitter layer host, had efficiency 44% EQE (21 Lm/Watt, no light extraction).  However, in these non-optimized experimental OLEDs the device lifetime was sometimes comparable but often inferior to that of the control device. \n\nIn this program we have learned how to effectively synthesize and purify non-crystallizable materials in laboratory scale batches.  We have amassed a library of over 100 materials which have been fully characterized and span the range of electrical and photophysical characteristics as a customer might specify.  We have verified the functionality of many of these materials in a working OLED prototype.\n\nThe Phase II commercialization steps are to:  (1) Optimize the performance of selected non-crystallizable materials in a specific TADF device architecture with emphasis on the hole- and electron-blocking layers, which play a huge role in device lifetime.  (2) Scale up the synthesis and purification of a few selected materials and verify their performance attributes in a designed \"control\" TADF-based OLED.  (3) Supply customers with fully characterized and certified material for their evaluation in proprietary OLED designs.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/17/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David Weiss"
