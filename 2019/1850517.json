 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research seeks to understand the financial, social and ethical impacts of crime analysis algorithms. Misapplication of algorithms has the capacity for great harm and discrimination, notably when applied in sentencing decisions about criminal offenders.  Inspecting and investigating algorithmic biases for their real-world impacts is an extremely novel but increasingly important area. The current literature has mostly focused on philosophical and sociological critiques of algorithms. What is sorely needed is a mathematical and computational investigation that builds on these socio-technical critiques in order to provide contextual and quantitative evidence for actual impact. We need to know how people's biases, assumptions, norms and values play into algorithmic perceptions and applications. More specifically, governments often seek to apply algorithms to crime analysis with the usually stated justification of financial efficiencies, reducing human error and smoothening bureaucracies. Therefore, this research seeks to understand the practical, financial, social and ethical impacts of deploying algorithms in the criminal justice system in order to develop evidence-based policies.\r\n \r\nThis project has four main objectives. First, using crime mapping as a lens of inquiry, the project will investigate the perceptions of financial, social and ethical dimensions of algorithmic crime analysis, to uncover both qualitative and quantitative insights about how laypeople and experts perceive its various implications. Second, the research will deconstruct popular algorithms used in crime analysis in order to understand specific points at which bias may occur and statistically better variants that may mitigate them. Third, it will compare and contrast each biased variant with its less biased counterpart to compute metrics about financial, social and ethical impacts, providing quantitative implications for biased criminal justice policy. Fourth, as a result of the first three objectives, this proposal will help expand initial efforts to build a community of like-minded scholars, though organizing a summer workshop involving practitioners, researchers and students to educate and co-create a community of practice around ethical, fair, accountable and transparent algorithms.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In addition, outcomes were synthesized and disseminated through workshops, panels and other speaking events. Below, three main outcomes are summarized:<br /><br /><strong>Main Outcome 1</strong><br /><br />We conducted an exploratory analysis of the ways in which opacity and bias affects professional crime analysis by focusing on the practices, policies and perceptions around crime in Milwaukee,Wisconsin. We used publicly available data over a 12 year period (2005-2016) as well as interviews of 19 stakeholders (professional crime analysts and community organizers) to make our case. Moreover,our effort in involving multiple stakeholders to understand this issue is showed to be very illuminatingespecially in understanding practices of police departments around crime analysis.<br /><br /><strong>Main Outcome 2</strong><br /><br />We found that there were significant ethical, social and financial gaps in building an explainable crime mapping algorithm which has both the need for transparency andself-improvement by having the feedback from the domain experts. In our study, we built an application where the stakeholders can interact with crime mapping. We thoroughly recorded their interactions and interpretations of the system. By analyzing all of these data, our research was able to suggest more gaps and needs that are required in creating more efficient and less-biased algorithms in crime mapping.<br /><br /><strong>Main Outcome 3</strong><br /><br />We simulated how crime labs might combine traditional statistical methods with machine learning to better understand locally relevant, contextual models for analyzing crime in two urban American cities. Using census tracts as the units of analysis and controlling for several structural characteristics associated with crime, we found that in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, violent crime is associated with concentrated disadvantage, residential stability, ethnic heterogeneity, total population, and spatial lag of violent crime. In addition, we find that in Chicago, Illinois, violent crime is associated with immigration, owner-occupied housing, proportion in professional occupations, and proportion population with college degree or higher, as well as ethnic heterogeneity, total population, and the spatial lag for violent crime. Machine learning models suggest that for Chicago's violent crime, the most important variable is the spatial lag term for violent crime, followed by total population,immigration, college education or beyond, owner occupancy, ethnic heterogeneity, and employment in professional occupations. The findings for property crime are similar and show a clear difference in how the choice of modeling approaches can bias outcomes in different cases. Urban planners must consider policies that can effectively reduce nearby crime and violence in all cities that experience high crime levels, but also design locally responsive policies that make sense within a local context: in Milwaukee, residential stability matters more for violent crime than for property crime, while in Chicago, total population is similarly important for both violent crime and property crime. In Milwaukee, ethnic heterogeneity is similarly important for violent and property crime, while in Chicago, ethnic heterogeneity is not a very important variable for violent crime and it is not a significant predictor of property crime. Therefore, urban policy must differently approach social disorganization indicators and support the nuances of the local context for urban planning and policy.<br /><br />Taken together, all three main outcomes have significant implications for how crime mapping and crime analysis need to be carried out in ways that are not antithetical to legal, ethical and social policy processes.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/14/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Shion&nbsp;Guha</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1850517/1850517_10596372_1694706572994_Screenshot2023-09-14at11.48.04AM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1850517/1850517_10596372_1694706572994_Screenshot2023-09-14at11.48.04AM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2017 crime density per square mile for Milwaukee census tracts (N = 239)\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1850517/1850517_10596372_1694706572994_Screenshot2023-09-14at11.48.04AM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2017 crime density per square mile for Milwaukee census tracts (N = 239)\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2017 crime density per square mile for Milwaukee census tracts (N = 239)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Shion Guha</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Shion&nbsp;Guha</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2017 crime density per square mile for Milwaukee census tracts (N = 239)</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1850517/1850517_10596372_1694706630334_Screenshot2023-09-14at11.49.50AM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1850517/1850517_10596372_1694706630334_Screenshot2023-09-14at11.49.50AM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2017 crime density per square mile for Chicago census tracts (N = 805).\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1850517/1850517_10596372_1694706630334_Screenshot2023-09-14at11.49.50AM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2017 crime density per square mile for Chicago census tracts (N = 805).\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2017 crime density per square mile for Chicago census tracts (N = 805).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Shion Guha</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Shion&nbsp;Guha</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2017 crime density per square mile for Chicago census tracts (N = 805).</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
