 "awd_abstract_narration": "Viruses have evolved self-destruct mechanisms that allow them to release their contents when they are inside the right host. The viruses are decorated with molecules that trigger their degradation when they encounter specific enzymes found within certain biological systems. Using inspiration from how virus particles respond to their environment in highly specific ways, the research group of Professor Jessica Rouge at the University of Connecticut is developing new chemical strategies to synthesize shells of very small size that can both controllably encapsulate small molecules and release them in response to specific stimuli in complex mixtures. Such strategies are important for developing more sensitive biological sensors and more accurate drug delivery systems.  This project provides graduate and undergraduate students multidisciplinary research training in nanoscience, chemical synthesis, and biochemistry.  In addition, an initiative entitled \"Catalyzing Curie-osity\" is launched to engage high school teachers and students throughout the state of Connecticut.  Through this joint initiative with the UConn Early College Experience program, affordable lab protocols are being designed focusing on the fundamental tools and techniques of bio-nanoscience. These lab modules will be individually tailored to the needs and resources of specific high schools, giving students hands -n experience with this exciting class of nanomaterials and preparing them for future careers related to nanotechnology and chemistry. \r\n\r\nWith the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program, the Rouge Group is developing novel chemical crosslinking strategies that can be incorporated into DNA nanomaterials for controlling their assembly and disassembly in complex biological environments. Using a novel DNA-surfactant assembly strategy that generates DNA nanoshells compatible with cells and enzymes, the major goal of this work is to synthesize a combination of peptide and synthetic crosslinkages that can maintain the nanomaterials stability in biological systems while exhibiting selectivity for certain chemical and biochemical stimuli. These stimuli, including temperature and pH changes, or exposure to specific enzyme classes, will be used to gate the release of small molecules for initiating chemical and/or biochemical reactions. Through this work the following goals are addressed: 1) the design of a library of thermoresponsive crosslinkers that enables remotely controlled substrate release, 2) the design of ligand-cargo communication schemes for sensing the local environment of the DNA-nanoshells, and 3) control over solution reaction selectivity via stepwise substrate release from multi-layered peptide crosslinked DNA-nanoshells. Compartmentalization of different substrates within the DNA-nanoshell layers will allow the team to study release rates and subsequent reaction rates of diverse molecules in aqueous systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Inspired by the design of viruses, we were able to chemically construct configurations in which we could make multi-layered particles, wherein each layer opens in response to a different trigger (<strong>Figure 1</strong>), while at the same time expanding the types of stimuli that could trigger the particles programmed degradation.

We aim in the future to incorporate iron oxide nanoparticles within our nanoshells so that if a magnetic field is applied it could create localized heating and breakdown the nanoshell it would release cargo into cells without heating the entire cell.

With this discovery we were able to show that we could gate the conversion of an enzymes substrate to product formation using pH as a control as MOFs are broken down under acidic conditions. We also found that by making a multi-layered nanoshells with both inorganic and organic components that we could make a dual-gated system to triggered degradation, significantly increasing the controllable degradation of these materials.

This has important implications for the growing world of mRNA therapeutics and vaccines as it is critical to maintain the stability of mRNA when stored or transported for clinical use.</p>\n<p>From an educational point of view, we developed several outreach initiatives in which we brought high school students from the state of Connecticut to our lab to participate in science experiments related to DNA nanomaterials. We trained several high school students from local area schools in the areas of chemistry, biochemistry and materials science. A major product of this funding was the development of a virtual version of our laboratory, designed such that a high school class/student and their teacher can virtually walk through our lab, clicking on the equipment in our spaces and being able to learn about what each piece of equipment does either by reading about it or by watching a YouTube video featuring a member of our lab describing how it works and how we use it in our research (<strong>Figure 5</strong>). We hope that this new platform will allow students and teachers the ability to learn about nanoscience and research tools even if they do not have the means to physically visit our lab, broadening the participation of students in STEM related activities and inspiring them to seek future research experiences if possible.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 09/25/2024<br>\nModified by:
