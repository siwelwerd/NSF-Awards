 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many natural phenomena and man-made processes are described mathematically by differential equations.  Differential Equations and Dynamical Systems as an area of mathematics is rooted in the work of Newton and Leibniz in the 17th century. This very active area of mathematics continues to evolve and grow as a response to the demands of applications. To promote the progress of this branch of mathematics, it is important to maintain the influx of diverse groups of young researchers into the related research: this is the principal goal of the Conference supported by this award. \r\n\r\nOn September 20th through 21st of 2019, the Department of Mathematics of Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, will hold a conference on Differential Equations and Dynamical Systems and their Applications. In conjunction with the conference there will be a meeting devoted to research presentations by undergraduate students celebrating the Ohio Delta Chapter of Pi Mu Epsilon (a national mathematics student honor society). The main goals of the conference are to inspire the new generation of mathematicians by exposing students to cutting-edge research in the area of Differential Equations and Dynamical Systems, foster collaborations between participants, and encourage diversity of this research community. A broad range of topics will be presented in invited talks by Nancy Rodriguez (University of Colorado-Boulder), Bjorn Sandstede (Brown University), Arnd Scheel (University of Minnesota), and Todd Young (Ohio University). A series of parallel talks will provide an opportunity for the participants to present their research results. Participation of minorities and women is encouraged. Detailed information about the venue and the program is available at the following website: https://miamioh.edu/cas/academics/departments/mathematics/about/events/annual-mathematics-conference/index.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
