 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms-B Program supports the fundamental research by Professor Alexander Greer at the City University of New York, Brooklyn College. Professor Greer develops techniques for accurately studying the chemistry of reactive oxygen-containing species, often called reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs). ROIs are important in synthetic chemistry and are critical to understanding the aging processes in biology and in the environment. This research seeks to resolve mechanistic questions in ROI chemistry by using newly synthesized micro- and nanoparticles. Further scientific impact comes from designing materials which are resistant to aging caused by exposure to light and oxygen. The project supports training of research students.  Professor Greer cultivates STEM talent and enthusiasm for the sciences within a wider and younger audience by expanding the American Society of Photobiology's program \"Photobiology for Kids\", among other educational efforts in collaboration with Brooklyn College?s Annual High School Chemistry Day. \r\n \r\nReactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs; oxygen radicals and singlet oxygen) are prevalent in the field of aerobic photochemistry, but they have proven extremely difficult to study. Many primary light-dependent and secondary ROIs generation events remain undefined. At present, photosensitization has been used with conventional methods of production, such as homogeneous solution, which leads to complex mixtures of ROIs. This research seeks to understand the downstream reactions that follow initial photooxidation events and to control the oxidation of natural and synthetic molecules, to reduce toxicity to organisms and damage to materials, and to develop new methods for disinfection of water supplies.  This fundamental research may also lead to new processes for the rapid photodegradation of plastics in landfills and oceans.  New heterogeneous methods for the photogeneration of reactive oxygen intermediates are investigated, allowing the ROIs to be rationally manipulated with effective tuning of reactivity. The research provides a method for phase separation that facilitates the deconvolution of complex photochemical processes. One key feature of studying downstream reactions of primarily formed peroxides is the ability to gain insight into multistage oxidative events.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
