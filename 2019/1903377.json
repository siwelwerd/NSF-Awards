 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to develop a proxy-model assimilation framework for the Holocene period by combining proxy data and model simulations. The developed framework will allow to address critical questions about the temperature trends during the Holocene which show a discrepancy between observations and models. In addition, the climate dynamics underlying major hydrological changes-Drying- in western North America and Northern Africa will be investigated. To improve the model-data comparison, the researchers will use a proxy-system modeling approach in order to improve the interpretation of the climate signal recorded in the Holocene proxy-records, including seasonality of temperature and precipitation.\r\n\r\nThe potential Broader Impacts include a greater understanding of the Holocene climate dynamics, investigating the mismatch between model simulations and observation of temperature trends during the Holocene; and major hydroclimate shifts in northwestern US and North Africa. A Holocene multi-variable reconstruction at annual resolution and a curated Holocene proxy-record database will be developed and made available for the broader climate community. Two workshops on paleoclimate data assimilation will be organized for graduate students and early career scientists to train the next generation of paleoclimate scientists. The project will support three early career scientists and a graduate student.\r\n \r\nThe Holocene multi-variables reconstruction and proxy-network will be useful products that will benefit the paleoclimate community at large.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
