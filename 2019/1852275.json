 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experience for Undergraduate (RE) site award to Boston University, located in Boston, MA, supports the training of 10 students for 10 weeks. This program, funded by the Division of Chemistry in the Mathematical and Physical Science Directorate, engages participants in chemistry research projects emphasizing problems in biological chemistry at the molecular level. Alongside a full immersion laboratory experience, the program provides participants with extensive mentoring and professional development opportunities. Participants take part in a dual-mentoring plan, with graduate students and other undergraduate researchers.  The students gain contemporary scientific presentation skills and engage with numerous visiting speakers. This program trains participants in research culture and stimulates talented young scientists to pursue research careers in STEM fields. \r\n\r\nResearch projects available to participants cover a wide range of endeavors at the interface of chemistry and biology, including the design and synthesis of new nanomaterials for diagnostics and drug delivery, investigation of protein-protein interactions, design and synthesis of organic molecules, spectroscopic detection and identification of human pathogens, computational modeling of protein aggregation, and many others. This program's recruitment efforts place an emphasis on recruiting students from community colleges and four-year colleges with limited research opportunities. Through targeted recruitment, extensive professional development, and individual research projects, this site promotes STEM careers to talented students at a early stage.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nRequired 200  800 words. 181\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fourth iteration of the Boston University REU program, Addressing Problems in Biological Chemistry, has successfully empowered another three classes of REU students, selected from all over the United States. Like all programs in this time frame, it was negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the winter of 2019-20, we had recruited a class of 10 students. After accepting the necessity of a one-year delay due to the pandemic, we told this class that they were all invited to be our REU 2021 class, if their academic and personal circumstances permitted. Therefore, this program ran for ten weeks in the summers of 2021, 2022, and 2023 while planned originally for 2020 - 2022.\n\n\nEach summer we recruited ten students from well over 400 applicants. We evaluated students on their preparation and potential to succeed in the program based on (i) their academic transcripts and (ii) two letters of recommendation from college professors. We prioritized students from community colleges and public universities with little-to-no facilities for research. We also prioritized students from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds and signs of social maturity in the students, knowing that the demands of apartment-style living in Boston combined with the demands of full-time research at an R1 university are an intense experience.\n\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\n\nWe carefully placed each student in a research group from either the Chemistry or Biology Department at Boston University, which had previously committed to host potentially an REU student. We matched the students with groups based on a combination of their stated interests (e.g. biological vs organic chemistry) and their course preparation. We also carefully recruited the mentors of the REU students to be graduate students or postdoctoral associates with demonstrated skill in mentoring and an interest in helping this particular group of less well-prepared, but highly motivated, students. \n\n\nThe students contributed to a very broad range of projects in their home research groups and many of them will eventually be authors on peer-reviewed papers in the literature. The students reported their progress to each other via PowerPoint presentations in weekly group meetings, and learned how to answer questions and take constructive criticism from mentors and program leaders.\n\n\nAt the end of each summer, our students joined the students from the three or four other REU and RET programs on campus in a large poster session. Local students invited friends and family as well as their research group mentors and labmates. Students were encouraged to take their posters to their home institutions for further discussion and as advertising to potential future REU students.\n\n\nBroader Impacts\n\n\nThis fourth installment of our REU program was similarly successful to the previous three. Students continually reported (in exit interviews and through informal conversations throughout the summer) a high degree of satisfaction with their choice of our program, the scientific experiences it afforded, and their substantial growth in research skills. All students but one completed the program. One student had a personal situation (with unspecified financial difficulties) that developed between their acceptance of our offer and the first week of the program, which they chose to leave. Otherwise, the students have continued on in STEM disciplines across the board. Those at community colleges have completed their two-year degrees and continued to four-year Bachelors degree programs. Many REU alums that joined us from four-year programs have gone on to graduate programs, including several who are now enrolled in the BU Chemistry Departments PhD program.\n\n\nEach summer included several talks for the REU program from professionals in the Boston area with scientific training that are now employed in a variety of fields: pharmaceuticals, biotech, intellectual property, and environmental consulting. Students were encouraged to connect with these mentors, and the REU program leaders and mentors on LinkedIn. This website is tremendously important to students in founding and growing their professional network. It also helps us keep track of where they are and have gone in both education and employment. They keep in touch with us and become part of our REU program alums.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/30/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: LindaHDoerrer\n"
