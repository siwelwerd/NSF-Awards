 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dissolved arsenic in groundwater is a global threat to millions of people. This arsenic is released from minerals within groundwater aquifers. People that regularly drink toxic levels of dissolved arsenic are at risk of getting deadly diseases. Some rocks and sediments contain enough arsenic to contaminate groundwater under certain conditions. This project aims to understand the conditions under which arsenic is trapped or released. One setting in which great quantities of arsenic is trapped is in riverbank sediments. Rivers continue to flow during dry periods by contributions from groundwater. Groundwater that has lots of iron and arsenic carries huge amounts of these elements to the riverbank sediments. It is important to understand the fate of this trapped arsenic and iron. The goal of this study is to develop a theory on the growth and fate of these iron-arsenic deposits. This project accomplishes this goal by observing which minerals the arsenic is bound to within sediments on the edge of the Meghna River in Bangladesh. Bangladesh has some of the highest naturally occurring levels of arsenic in aquifers in the world. Laboratory experiments will test the impact of tidal fluctuations on the nature of these iron-arsenic deposits. The movement of water and elements will be measured in the field between aquifers and the Meghna River. This project supports the research of U.S.-based undergraduate and graduate students and prepares the next generation of U.S. and Bangladeshi scientists to understand the movement of toxic elements between aquifers and rivers. \r\n\r\nArsenic-contaminated water resources are prevalent in fluvio-deltaic aquifers whose sediment are the geogenic source. The fate of As in groundwater discharging to rivers, however, remains unknown despite advances in understanding the origin and transport of As in groundwater. A few observations have suggested that As is stored within shallow, permeable, riverbank sediment through sorption on iron-oxide surfaces, referred to herein as Permeable Natural Reactive Barriers (PNRB). These accumulations threaten the communities along rivers should there be a reversal in groundwater flow induced by pumping, or should this high-As sediment be scoured and then re-deposited along a segment of the river where infiltration occurs. In deltaic regions, aquifers are connected to large rivers subject to periodic forcing driven by tides and seasonal flooding. Thus, the dynamics of groundwater-borne As transported to and from rivers should also be driven by similar periodic forcing. The amplitude and period of these fluctuations will uniquely determine the properties of these PNRBs, and knowing this, combined with knowledge of the iron (Fe) and As concentrations of the aquifers, should allow regional prediction of the accumulation of As in riverbank sediment. This project investigates the dynamics of a Fe-oxide PNRB through complementary detailed field characterization of sites along the Meghna River in Bangladesh along with laboratory experimentation and advanced coupled flow and reactive transport simulations. The data-driven modeling is used to assess the occurrence of PNRBs in similar tidal river-aquifer settings through sensitivity analysis. The anticipated findings will advance the understanding of the cycling of geogenic As in shallow, reducing alluvial aquifers connected with rivers in Asia. Critical knowledge on coupled hydrologic and biogeochemical processes for the protection and management of water resources will be provided to both the local communities dealing with As contamination and the broader scientific body. Local stakeholders will be directly involved in the research and project findings will be translated for policy makers to reach affected communities. This study funds the research projects of undergraduate and graduate students, and post-doctoral investigators and expands the infrastructure for studying groundwater-river water exchange along the Meghna River in Bangladesh.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Iron is an abundant metal in rocks and in dissolved form in many groundwaters. When dissolved iron is exposed to oxygen, it precipitates on sediment surfaces. These iron oxide deposits appear as orange layers of sediments. Some of these orange sediments in streambeds are formed by groundwater with high dissolved iron concentrations seeping through the riverbank. The iron oxides have a large surface area with abundant electrostatic charge. The charged sites collect arsenic. Given their capacity to concentrate arsenic and other toxic elements, it is important to know how prevalent they are and which processes or properties determines their formation.</p>\n<p>Along the Meghna River in Bangladesh dissolved arsenic in shallow groundwater (&lt;30 m) is abundant. This groundwater flows into the river. But the rivers have far less dissolved arsenic concentrations than can be accounted for by dilution. Therefore, we hypothesized that the arsenic is removed within the oxygenated hyporheic zone through which groundwater passes as it discharges to the river. We tested this hypothesis across four riverbank sites along a 13 km reach of the Meghna River by combining 9,000 observed arsenic concentrations in shallow aquifer private wells with a hydrologic model that accounts for seasonal variation of groundwater flow towards the river. The predicted mass of accumulated arsenic approximately matched the observed mass of arsenic in the riverbanks (<strong>Fig. 1</strong>).</p>\n<p>Second, we demonstrated the ability of a buried silt layer to prevent dissolved iron and arsenic from precipitating within the tidally driven hyporheic zone (<strong>Fig. 2</strong>). In fact, the buried silt appears to convert a sandy riverbank from an arsenic sink (relative to the dissolved phase) to an arsenic source. This discovery emphasizes the role that fine layers have in generating dissolved arsenic in sand aquifers. Other studies have implicated silt and clay layers in generating plumes of dissolved arsenic in aquifers. Our study revealed the release of arsenic into an overlying sand layer on top of a silt layer from upwelling groundwater. This is the first time that upwelling groundwater has been shown to carry products of reductive dissolution from silt under the influence of compaction of the structurally weak silt layer by tides in a freshwater river (<strong>Fig. 2</strong>).</p>\n<p>Third, we developed the first programmable, bidirectional mixing column (<strong>Fig. 3</strong>). This novel apparatus, constructed with widely available components, permits the experimenter to vary the physical and chemical conditions of the river and aquifer to determine the controls on toxic metals accumulation within riverbanks. Details on its construction and validation of its performance were published in Buskirk et al. (2023). Subsequent column experiments demonstrated that the most intensive accumulation of iron oxides and arsenic occurs at the edge of the hyporheic zone (data not yet published).</p>\n<p>Our findings add new mechanisms that determine the source and fate of arsenic within a floodplain aquifer. Our field-based findings puts the spotlight on silt and clay layers in generating arsenic in aquifers - especially under settings where they are subjected to compaction. Both floodplains and silt/clay layers have been implicated in driving the most severe human exposure to arsenic in drinking water across Asian deltas (Mekong, Red, Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna). These published studies add process-level insights into phenomena observed at larger scales and this may be useful for the design of public health studies or arsenic mitigation programs.</p>\n<p>The collaborative project has generated 7 peer-reviewed publications, 2 manuscripts under review, and 21 conference presentations.

Two of these Bangladeshi students are now enrolled in graduate studies in the US. This project supported an early career faculty member (PI Knappett). The PIs gave presentations and participated in discussions with faculty and students at the University of Dhaka's Geology Department and hydrologists from the Bangladesh Water Development Board
