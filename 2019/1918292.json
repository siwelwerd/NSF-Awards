 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to address the growing challenge of mitigating global warming and air quality deterioration as a result of the present energy supply ecosystem. This challenge is further exacerbated by periods of economic prosperity due to an increase in energy consumption. With the power generation sector being the biggest consumer of primary energy and one of the largest contributors to greenhouse and air pollutant emissions worldwide, an accelerated deployment of renewable energy is needed. However, due to renewables' intermittency as an energy source, there is a need for solutions that provide a flexible and reliable supply at a competitive efficiency while also aligning with global efforts to decarbonize the economy. Today, this challenge is partially met with addition of distributed natural gas fired capacity, motivating natural gas usage to nearly double in the last two decades. This project will focus on a solution to provide flexible and benchmark efficient power while generating zero atmospheric emissions. This not only supports environmental efforts, but also aligns with basic economics, making it an appealing case for carbon capture where both the consumer and producer benefit. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corp project will explore the commercial potential of a novel power solution based on the increasingly common reciprocating engine, by which its efficiency is radically increased and both air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions are eliminated. Current solutions with traditional gas turbines and reciprocating engines fail to address air quality concerns by emitting high volumes of particulate matter and nitrous oxides. Efficiency benchmark technologies such as combined cycle gas turbines are unable to follow power demand fluctuations, nor are they able to cost effectively reduce their carbon footprint through carbon capture measures. This project will potentially address the unmet need for simultaneously flexible, efficient and clean power by proposing a retrofit technology that provides a transition into a utility scale hydrogen energy storage solution.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
