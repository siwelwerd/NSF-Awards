 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports research that contributes fundamental new knowledge in the manufacturing of three-dimensional functional nanoarchitectures with applications in light manipulation, thus promoting basic science and technology in the fields of plasmonics and advanced manufacturing. Guided manipulation of light through periodic patterns of three-dimensional plasmonic nanoarchitectures provides remarkable opportunities to harness light in a way that cannot be obtained with conventional optics. However, its practical implementation remains challenged by the low-yield, time-consuming, and limited scalability of conventional fabrication processes that largely rely on the use of nanolithography. This research studies a new nanomanufacturing process based on three-dimensional nanoassembly to fabricate the plasmonic nanoarchitectures. The integration of three-dimensional nanoarchitectures with diverse substrates is increasingly preferred for broad applications in imagers, sensors and lasers, which greatly benefits the U.S. economy and society. The project is multidisciplinary and involves mechanics, optics and advanced nanomanufacturing. It provides excellent educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and fosters interest in science and engineering in women and under-represented minority groups. \r\n\r\nThe fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) plasmonic nanoarchitectures largely relies upon the utilization of conventional nanolithography techniques that involve the use of either electron-beam, focused ion-beam, or beam interference. However, significant challenges exist in adopting these conventional techniques for diverse substrates including flexible or curved surfaces, especially, since they are principally designed to form nanopatterns on the flat surface of radiation-sensitive materials with the assistance of thermal or chemical post-treatments. This research is to develop a new nanomanufacturing technique that achieves deterministic assembly of 3D plasmonic nanoarchitectures on suitable receiver substrates in a way that allows the donor wafer to be reused for cost-savings. The process involves the use of water under ambient conditions without additional need of chemical, thermal or mechanical treatments, thereby substantially extending the type of receiver substrate to arbitrary materials. The collaborative research involves experiments to elucidate critical controlling parameters and underpinning solid-liquid interactions supported by multiscale/multiphysics computation modelling to predict manufacturing process parameters and their control with integration of atomistic simulation. The 3D plasmonic nanoarchitectures are integrated with hybrid pixel imagers to demonstrate the enhancement of their detection functionalities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These methods encompass a spectrum of strategies, from capillary mechanics-based processes to more complex electro-chemo-mechanical and bubble-mediated techniques. These varied approaches enable the versatile transfer of a diverse array of materials, including metals, soft polymers, and nanomaterial composites.

Our research objectives are manifold and clearly outlined. Initially, our focus is on the development of a scalable manufacturing technique designed for the construction of plasmonic nanoarchitectures that can be integrated onto existing optical devices. Subsequently, we aim to refine mechanical models that will facilitate the scaling of these techniques to accommodate 4-inch wafer sizes. Lastly, we strive to demonstrate the practical applicability of these nanoarchitectures, specifically in infrared bandpass filters and electro-optical sensors. To date, we have successfully fabricated and replicated quasi-three-dimensional plasmonic nanoarchitectures. These are derived from silicon molds and manufactured at room temperature, thereby obviating the need for any corrosive chemicals. Within the past year, we have replicated these architectures with high fidelity up to five times on a 4-inch wafer scale, all without inducing defects. This achievement has been validated through rigorous experimental and computational analyses. Furthermore, we have broadened the scope of our manufacturing techniques to include a wide array of functional materials. For example, we have showcased the feasibility of generating stretchable biosensors designed for non-invasive bio-signal recording on the human cornea. Additionally, we have proven the scalability of these methods to meter-sized dimensions, which has direct implications for the production of electronic textiles capable of recording physiological and electrophysiological data in real-world conditions.
