 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates site award to Michigan State University, located in East Lansing, MI, supports the training of 8 students for 10 weeks. This program, funded by the Division of Chemistry in the Mathematical and Physical Science Directorate, engages participants in independent research in sustainable chemistry and chemical processes. This program trains participants to be stewards of the environment, leading toward safer laboratories and laboratory practices and reduced volume and toxicity of chemical waste. Participants take part in a variety of professional development opportunities, including journal readings, faculty research presentations and networking dinners, and training in research ethics, basic statistics, laboratory and chemical safety, strategies for applying to graduate school, and communication skills. Incorporation of green chemistry principles can equip and inspire the next generation of chemists to solve the greatest sustainability challenges facing our planet.\r\n\r\nThe research projects available to participants encompass the theme of sustainable chemistry, including green synthesis, water purification, solar energy conversion and energy storage, environmentally-friendly coating technologies for corrosion control, computational methods for energy-related materials, advanced imaging and spectroscopy, and biocatalysis. This program generally recruits underrepresented students in their junior and senior years. Alongside developing a 'research toolbox', the participants learn how chemistry can be constructed in a sustainable and responsible manner through workshops, lectures, and webinars.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
