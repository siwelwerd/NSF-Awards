 "awd_abstract_narration": "Particles with surface heterogeneity or surface 'patchiness' are of general interest as building-blocks for the construction of hierarchical nanosystems. Of these, polymer-based nanoparticles are particularly attractive for their softer, more dynamic character, facilitating the construction process. Surface pattering of polymer particles at the nanometer scale, while challenging, can be accomplished through the use of assembling subunits with a molecular architecture that will lead to a 'clustering' effect. This award allows the exploration of the use of polymers with a bottle-brush architecture as subunits for the formation of 'patchy' nanoparticles. Unlike the more traditional linear polymers, considerably less is known about the assembly behavior of polymers with a complex architecture, opening new routes for the formation of polymer-based nanomaterials with unique functions. The research will examine solution self- and co-assembly of these polymers and establish relationships between polymer architecture, processing routes and aggregate morphology. Outreach efforts supported under this award will involve participation of undergraduate students in research, and community involvement through an education-based Latino outreach program targeting K-12 students. \r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of this award is to explore the molecular and processing determinants of assemblies from highly grafted polymers, with particular emphasis on the construction of nanoparticles exhibiting surface and core heterogeneity. Advances in controlled polymerization methods have enabled the synthesis of macromolecules with increasing functional and architectural complexity such as macromolecular brushes or bottle-brushes. In contrast to linear diblock copolymers, little is known about the factors that influence solution assembly of macromolecules. Furthermore, it has been previously shown that kinetic pathways of polymer assembly are determining factors of assembly morphologies from linear block copolymers, whereas the non-equilibrium behavior of macromolecules with more complex architectures remains unexplored. This award addresses two related objectives. First objective is to study nanoparticle formation from amphiphilic macromolecular brush copolymers by a rapid assembly process. This will allow to both elucidate the mechanism of brush copolymer assembly into multi-molecular nanoparticles, and determine absolute timescales of assembly. Second objective is to study the formation of complex heterogeneous nanosystems from amphiphilic macromolecular brush building-blocks. This involves co-assembly of families of macromolecular brushes with varying degrees of chemical dissimilarity through kinetic trapping. While there are many reported methods for fabricating composite nanoparticles exhibiting surface and/or core heterogeneity, clustering of relatively soft and adaptive building-blocks could provide the means for further intra-particle modifications.",

These are found throughout Nature, for example, on the surfaces of cells, in joints, and in mucus. The biological function of these molecules result from their highly branched structure, which allows them to store water and act as lubricants. Advances in polymer science have allowed us to fabricate a large variety of synthetic macromolecular bottlebrushes, including heterografted bottlebrushes, which are those that possess +2 different classes of side-chains. Under this award, we have explored the molecular and processing determinants of assemblies from macromolecular bottlebrushes that bear an amphiphilic character. Amphiphilicity is important as it will allow us to use these macromolecules to encapsulate hydrophobic molecules, which themselves are important as a large percentage of drugs in the pipeline exhibit low water-solubility. Our findings regarding these studies have revealed the effect of backbone length and side-chain length on the shape of these macromolecules, as well as on their ability to encapsulate hydrophobic drugs. We observed that bottlebrushes with backbones that were slightly longer than their side-chains self-assembled -through hydrophobic interactions- into multimolecular spheres with aggregation numbers that decreased with backbone length (Figure 1). Interestingly, their aggregation numbers ranged from 3 to 10, which is a unique range with a potential for hierarchical construction of larger structures. Heterografted brushes with longer backbones and side-chains were found to exist in solution as worm-like structures (Figure 2). We observed that by grafting a long hydrophilic block to the double-brush, we were able to restrict solute-induced conformational changes, thus producing drug-loaded worm-like carriers. This behavior, however, was dependent on the properties of the drug loaded.<br />Stimuli-responsive nanocarriers for the targeted delivery of therapeutics have recently attracted a great deal of attention in the field of nanomedicine. One of the advantages of environmentally sensitive delivery vehicles is their ability to undergo physicochemical changes upon exposure to external signals and to subsequently release their payload at target sites. The overproduction of reactive oxygen species (such as hydrogen peroxide) is often observed in degenerative and/or metabolic diseases, tumorous and inflamed tissue, and is known to modulate cancer metastasis. We examined the oxidative reactivity of nanoparticles from a boronic acid-installed polycarbonate and showed that nanoparticles were sensitive to biologically-relevant concentrations of hydrogen peroxide to an extent that directly reflects the amount of the oxidant present. Oxidation-triggered nanoparticle destabilization was shown to be highly dependent on the concentration of the final oxidized polymer product, and was only achieved if it fell below the critical micelle concentration of the oxidized polymer (Figure 3). Our results indicate that these nanocarriers serve as an excellent dual pH/H2O2 responsive vehicle for drug delivery and highlight the importance of polymer concentration on particle destabilization.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/28/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Margarita&nbsp;Herrera-Alonso</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1947272/1947272_10415889_1603863650278_RPPRFinalreport2020OutcomesFigure1(figureonly)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1947272/1947272_10415889_1603863650278_RPPRFinalreport2020OutcomesFigure1(figureonly)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1947272/1947272_10415889_1603863650278_RPPRFinalreport2020OutcomesFigure1(figureonly)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A.
