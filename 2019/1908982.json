 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biomass is becoming an increasingly important source of energy for the renewable manufacturing of fuels and chemicals.  Biomass feedstocks are complex, however, and their conversion to high-value fuel and chemical products relies heavily on catalysis to accelerate chemical reactions and promote the formation of desired products.  The project will explore novel catalyst designs that are capable of tandem catalysis, that is, catalysts structured such that they can carry out multiple reaction steps in a specific order in a single catalytic reactor.  Tandem catalysis is more efficient and involves lower capital costs than traditional processes based on sequential reactors, which often carry the need for costly separation steps between reactors.  To date, most research related to tandem catalysis has been done on a case-by-case basis targeting specific fuels or chemical products.  This study focuses on developing generalized design guidelines that will promote faster and wider-scale adoption of tandem catalysis throughout the chemical manufacturing and fuel refining industries.  The work will contribute to U.S. leadership in chemical and fuels manufacturing in areas as diverse as specialty chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and platform fuels and commodity chemicals.\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of the proposed work is to develop design principles for zeolite encapsulated metal (M@zeolite) catalysts to enable selective liquid phase tandem reactions, which include: 1) synthesize and characterize M@zeolite catalysts with controlled site density and distribution; 2) understand the solvent effect and the confinement effect in M@zeolite catalysts on rates and selectivities; and 3) establish correlations of the architecture, site distribution, and local environment of active sites with performance in tandem reactions.  The project will leverage a novel cationic polymer assisted synthetic strategy to prepare M@zeolite catalysts, and characterize their properties and density of active sites with liquid phase techniques recently developed in the investigator's laboratory.  In particular, the distribution of acid sites in the zeolite crystals of M@zeolite will be determined.  The study will elucidate solvent and confinement effects on model liquid phase reactions over M@zeolite via a combination of kinetic and spectroscopic investigations by determining intrinsic activation energies.  One-pot tandem reactions to upgrade furfural to C8 oxygenates/hydrocarbons, as well as pentanoic acid, will be employed as model reactions to investigate the impact of the density and distribution of acid sites in the zeolite crystal of M@zeolite on tandem catalytic processes and catalyst deactivation.  On the educational front, the investigator will develop a program to introduce the basics of 3D printing technology to high school and undergraduate students as a hands-on activity to stimulate excitement about STEM related career opportunities, especially for students from underrepresented backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nMethanol is a one-carbon molecule that is produced from methane, the main component of natural gas, a fossil fuel widely available in the US. Most of the products we use todayfrom fuels, to detergents, lubricants, and otherscontain molecules with many carbon atoms, and there has been interest in transforming methanol into more complex and valuable molecules. One alternative to this goal was discovered in the 1970s using a novel catalysts called ZSM-5 that could take methanol into a mixture of gasoline-like molecules, molecules containing six or more carbons. It took more than 25 years to understand how ZSM-5 performs the multitude of reactions needed to form complex molecules from a one-carbon reactant. Two elements are essential to the operation of the catalyst: first, this catalyst has very small pores (about 0.5 nanometers) that control the maximum size of the molecules that can form in them, and second, this catalyst contains aluminum atoms that yield an acidic environment that promotes bond formation.\r\n\n\nIn this research we investigated the effect of changing these aluminum atoms for iron. Iron has chemical properties that resemble those of aluminum, and the ZSM-5 catalyst can be prepared with iron instead of aluminum. We hypothesized that this iron-ZSM-5 materials will be less reactive than the aluminum-ZSM-5 counterpart, and that this can have some beveficial effects on the catalytic properties of ZSM-5 for the methanol-to-gasoline reaction. In particular, we were interested in making gasoline-like products that contained fewer aromatic components, because these components are more toxic than the non-aromatic alkanes and olefins that are also part of the gasoline pool of molecules. Our investigations show that the chemistry of aromatic molecule formation in iron-ZSM-5 depends on temperature: below 350C the formation of aromatic molecules is slow because hydrogen atoms (or hydride atoms, more precisely) do not jump between molecules at fast rates. This keeps the products mostly as alkanes and alkenes. Above 350C the transfer of hydride atoms increases leading to a redistribution of hydrogen in the product pool into hydrogen rich (alkanes) and hydrogen poor (aromatic) species. We also show that co-feeding of alkenes with the methanol in iron zeolites changes the relative rates of carbon-carbon bond breaking in the zeolite, which is useful to making organic molecules with higher octane (they have more branches) than otherwise, which is helpful to increase the value of the product stream.\r\n\n\nWe also investigated a related catalyst called chabazite, which is similar to ZSM-5 but has even smaller pores. We replaced the aluminum atoms in chabazite with boron (B), to reduce its acid properties even more than iron, and increase its ability to oxidize organic reagents. Because of the small pores, the only hydrocarbons that can enter this zeolite are methane (1-carbon) and ethane (2 carbons) and we investigated the transformation of ethane into the more useful ethylene in the presence of oxygen. The catayst is quite good producing ethylene with 70% selectivity and it is very stable. However, we carried out a technoeconomic study and found that the mixture of gases produced by the catalyst is more difficult to separate that the mixtures produced by existing processes, and that makes practical application difficult.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/14/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RaulFLobo\n"
