 "awd_abstract_narration": "Real world systems are often naturally constrained by physical laws or human behavioral patterns, and understanding of such systems can be significantly enhanced by incorporating said constraints into the inferential mechanism. However, the presence of multiple constraints can complicate the process of statistical learning. This project aims to develop novel statistical methods to help solve real world problems where a multitude of complex constraints pose inferential challenges. Motivations are drawn directly from three concrete applications: i) extracting the radius of proton from electric form-factor data, a fundamental problem in atomic physics which is of high relevance due to anomalies between results from different modes of experimentation, ii) describing the relationship between wind velocity and power derived from wind-turbines, which is one of the fastest growing renewable sources of energy and iii) describing the traffic flow pattern with traffic speed, a key object of research in traffic engineering. The project will bring together ideas from machine learning and Bayesian nonparametrics to develop statistically sound and computationally efficient methods of inference in constrained decision problems. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project aims to develop a principled probabilistic approach towards inference in scientific and engineering applications where various physical constraints provide a priori knowledge regarding key objects of inference. Such objects may correspond to a single curve or a collection of curves or density functions. The PI and co-PI will develop novel statistical methods for simultaneous incorporation of multiple shape constraints motivated by real scientific and engineering applications, while being broadly generalizable beyond the considered applications. Emphasis is laid on obtaining equivalent representations of various constraints within a flexible nonparametric Bayesian model, and developing novel prior distributions on these constrained spaces. The Bayesian approach is attractive to obtain uncertainty estimates, and the PI and co-PI aim to develop rigorous theoretical guarantees for the frequentist validity of Bayesian uncertainty measures in the present setting. In addition, the PI and co-PI propose to demonstrate that including the constraints diminishes the uncertainty which will subsequently lead to better scientific conclusions. The methodological developments will be accompanied by efficient computation algorithms that meet the scalability demanded by the specific applications and beyond. To maximize the impact of the methodology developed, the PI and co-PI will closely collaborate with domain experts for the specific applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nThe goal of the project is to identify key scientific problems in nuclear Physics and engineering where physical constraints are exploited to enhance model fit and inference.  As an example, the PIs provide a reconciliation of the proton radius puzzle which dates back to  a decade ago when a newer suite of high-precision muonic Lamb-shift experiments suggested a value of the proton radius (0.8408 fm) which is significantly (by 4%) different from the accepted 2010 Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA) value for the charge radius of the proton.  Despite considerable effort undertaken to explain the puzzle, the PIs found out that the lack of incorporation of the Physics constraints in existing parametric proposals is the main cause of discrepancy. Working within a constrained nonparametric Bayes framework, the PIs are able to provide a strong support to the school-of-thought in the Physics community who believe that the puzzle entirely lies in the extraction of the radius from electron- scattering data.  In a related nuclear Physics problem, the PIs are able to characterize the  impact on low-energy nuclear Physics after the discovery of the binary merger event GW190814 by constraining the prior using information gathered from previous studies.  Several other constrained staistical models are investigated motivated by engineering applications, which includes a constrained regression model for the wind-turbine data,  a constrained density regression model for traffic data, a general nonparametric Bayes model constrained to lie close to a fixed parametric density, and a fair-clustering model where fairness constraints are imposed using a novel hierarchical normalized multinomial prior.  The above projects led to publications in the Journal of the American Statistical Association, Technometrics and Physical Review C, and submissions to top-tier statistics journals. \n\n \n\n \n\n4 PhD students advised / co-advised  by PI Pati and co-PI Bhattacharya worked on the above projects as a part of their PhD dissertation.  Two of them (including one female student) obtained tenure-track Assistant professor positions and the remaining two are working in pharmaceutical sectors upon completion of their PhD.  The softwares obtained from the  research are now available at the PIs github page: https://github.com/debdeeptamu.  PI Pati developed a course on advanced Bayesian computation, where one of the focus is to develop Markov chain monte Carlo methods for sampling in constrained parameter spaces.  co-PI Bhattacharya developed a special topics courses on the theory of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.  The PIs also co-organized a session on approximate Bayesian inference  in the annual Data-Science conference at Texas A&amp;M on Oct 21-22, 2023 where world leaders working in this area were invited.
