 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for a three-year REU Site at Clarkson University, Potsdam, New York, in High Performance Computing (HPC), a field critical to national security, scientific discovery, and technological innovation. The goal of this project is to encourage 30 talented undergraduate students to pursue graduate study and careers in HPC by engaging them in exciting, ongoing research projects and by cultivating their talents during ten-week summer research experiences and beyond. Sixteen ongoing research projects available for students are innovative and share the common theme of societally relevant engineering applications that originate from disciplines as diverse as aeronautical engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, electrical and computer engineering, software engineering, and applied mathematics.  The project thus serves the national interest, as stated by NSF's mission: to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity and welfare; or to secure the national defense.\r\n\r\n\r\nStudents are recruited from targeted institutions that offer limited or no research opportunities in HPC, such as historically minority colleges and universities. Emphasis is placed on attracting underrepresented minority and female students.  Faculty with expertise in HPC applications mentor the students to be researchers and provide them with specialized training in the design and development of HPC applications that are rooted in and motivated by engaging engineering innovations. This specialized training provides the students with technical and analytical skills in mathematical modeling, algorithmic development, and parallel and distributed programming, which benefit them in future pursuits such as graduate study or industry work. The quality of this training is further reinforced by additional professional development activities, including an HPC crash course, field trips, invited speakers, weekly group meetings, and a mentor training workshop for faculty.  Seminars in career development, literature search, technical writing, and graduate school advisement, are also integrated into the program, and all student participants are given the opportunity to attend and present in professional conferences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The original program was designed to support 10 students each year for three years, targeting those who are underrepresented in STEM fields (URM) or have limited research opportunities at their home institutions. The site was focused on the topic of high-performance computing (HPC) with engineering applications. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the program was extended to four years. Despite the disruption of COVID-19, this REU site has successfully attracted a total of 187 applications. The site had mentored a total of 32 undergraduate participants, two more than the original planned number of 30. This was made possible due to the save of fund because of switching to the virtual mode.<br /><br />The demographic distribution of the 32 participants of this REU site can be summarized as follows. In terms of women and URM, there are a total of 10 female, 3 African American, and 4 Latinx students. Thirteen of the 32 participants were from 12 institutions with limited research opportunities for undergraduate students. In terms of distribution of institutions, the REU participants were recruited from 24 universities in 11 states. <br /><br />This REU site has allowed the participants to gain many highly valuable skills. First, the REU site has successfully improved the participant's attitude toward research careers and graduate studies. Specifically, eight REU participants have attended graduate schools (Clarkson University, Purdue University, Texas A&amp;M University, and University of Florida) or research institution (NASA). Second, the 14 faculty mentors at Clarkson University have provided the REU participants with exciting research experiences. The REU participants have worked on authentic research problems, which have increased their understanding of the nature of research and scientific reasoning by engaging in such processes. So far, this REU site has published a total of thirteen peer-reviewed papers, nine of which were co-authored by REU students with their mentors. Eleven of the thirteen are peer-reviewed conference papers and two journal papers. Third, this REU site has helped students improve their oral, written, and teamwork skills. In total, the REU participants have won 10 best oral and/or poster presentation awards from Clarkson?s Research and Project Showcase (RAPS) conferences. A rich set of professional development activities were organized for the participants, including seminars from four invited speakers and five professional development seminars. Lastly, students have built a long-term collegial relationship with faculty mentors as well as industry experts. For example, all participants have remained connected with the PIs on LinkedIn. Three participants have chosen to pursue graduate study with their REU mentors. Students also visited IBM and the Canadian Nuclear Laboratories to get connected with industry experts.<br /><br />An independent evaluator evaluated this REU site program each year with both surveys and focus groups. Their written evaluation reports strongly support the effectiveness of the REU site. Specifically, student participants reported satisfaction with the program, their mentors, and their colleagues through the post-surveys. Students identified experience in conducting the research project itself as the most important aspect of the program. They also identified seminars on ?Projects Overview &amp; Research Process?, ?the Research Presentations Seminars?, ?the Research Group Meetings? and ?the Ph.D. Pathways Panel? as ?significantly helpful?. Furthermore, the mean response of both student expectations and satisfactions in summer 2021 were significantly higher than the regular, in-person site before the pandemic (summer 2019), showing the positive outcome of the PIs? continuous improvement efforts. In addition, the faculty mentors gave high scores for all aspects of the program. Comments about the quality of the REU participants were positive. The mentors felt that the best aspects of the program were the mentoring experience, the mentoring workshop, the mentoring curriculum provided. Lastly, the PIs themselves published two papers in the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) annual conferences, focusing on the best practices and lesson learned from operating this REU site.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/18/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Daqing&nbsp;Hou</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852102/1852102_10590274_1684446347566_2019Group--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852102/1852102_10590274_1684446347566_2019Group--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Summer 2019 RAPS Award Ceremony\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852102/1852102_10590274_1684446347566_2019Group--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Summer 2019 RAPS Award Ceremony\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REU Site students won five awards at Clarkson University's 2019 Summer RAPS Research Conference.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Daqing Hou</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Daqing&nbsp;Hou</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Summer 2019 RAPS Award Ceremony</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852102/1852102_10590274_1684446476170_2021Group--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852102/1852102_10590274_1684446476170_2021Group--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Orientation Session of Summer 2021 Virtual Site\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852102/1852102_10590274_1684446476170_2021Group--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Orientation Session of Summer 2021 Virtual Site\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Orientation Session for the Summer 2021Virtual Site.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Daqing Hou</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Daqing&nbsp;Hou</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Orientation Session of Summer 2021 Virtual Site</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852102/1852102_10590274_1684446631446_2022Group2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852102/1852102_10590274_1684446631446_2022Group2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Field Trip to IBM Poughkeepsie in Summer 2022\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852102/1852102_10590274_1684446631446_2022Group2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Field Trip to IBM Poughkeepsie in Summer 2022\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REU Site students made field trip to IBM Poughkeepsie inSummer 2022.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Daqing Hou</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Daqing&nbsp;Hou</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Field Trip to IBM Poughkeepsie in Summer 2022</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
