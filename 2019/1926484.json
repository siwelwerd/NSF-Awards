 "awd_abstract_narration": "Innovative research on the complex interaction of socio-economic and global environmental trends on biodiversity and ecosystem services is needed to help develop more informative scenarios for addressing environmental and human development challenges. To overcome these challenges coupled natural-human systems approaches and analyses are needed. These provide improved scenarios of biodiversity and ecosystem services that couple the outputs of direct and indirect drivers such as land use, invasive species, overexploitation, biodiversity, environmental change, and pollution. The resulting models provide a methodological state-of-the art that results in more accurate quantitative assessments, better land use, and more effective ecosystem services. Employing this methodology, this research has a goal to develop a user-friendly open library of biodiversity and ecosystem service models for pollinators that stakeholders can use to deliver local and global predictive maps, based on different environmental scenarios, in particular, those associated with climate change. Motivation for the project comes from the fact that the loss of biodiversity, in particular with regard to pollinators, negatively impacts food security, agricultural and economically important plant productivity, and human well-being. Work will include the co-development of modelling software with key stakeholder communities and the comparison of results from different modelling approaches presently used to generate scenarios and impacts of evolving conditions on pollinator abundance and diversity. Broader impacts of the work include international collaboration between US scientists and those from Argentina, Spain, and The Netherlands. They also involve a strong potential for improving food security and crop productivity, world-wide, through a better understanding of the impacts of ecosystem changes on pollinators and how these might be impacted by climate change. Other impacts include the provision of science-based findings that can be used by decision and policy makers as well as non-governmental organizations and public administrators faced with declining pollinator abundance and biodiversity. The work also builds infrastructure for science by generating new co-developed predictive models with key stakeholder groups to provide increased utility and provides public outreach via social media and generation of short videos showcasing the project and its work. This project includes workforce training of a graduate student and broadens participation of underrepresented groups in sciences by supporting an investigator whose gender is underrepresented in the sciences. \r\n\r\nThis award supports US researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a coalition of 26 funding agencies from 23 countries through the Belmont Forum call for proposals on \"Scenarios of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services\". The call was a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that contribute to the development of scenarios, models, and decision-support tools for understanding and solving critical issues facing our planet. The goal of the competition was to improve and apply participatory scenario methods to enhance research relevance and its acceptance and to address gaps in methods for modelling impact drivers and policy interventions. It was also to develop and communicate levels of uncertainty associated with the models, to improve data accessibility and fill gaps in knowledge. Using this methodology, the funded project addresses the issue of pollinator biodiversity and abundance and its socio-enviro-economic impacts related to crop pollination. This research examines various scenarios of pollinator population response and impact on ecosystems services using modelling and data collection/aggregation, the development of scenarios tied to drivers related to land-use changes, changes caused by human intervention, and changes in climate and the environment. Scenarios predicting the future of biodiversity and its associated services are a powerful tool to inform conservation and agricultural resource planning. The research compares three families of models. These are based on (1) data mining, (2) statistical relationships and (3) mechanistic models. All will be parameterized using newly collected and formerly collected data available from four different countries located on three continents. The output of the independently developed models will be used to identify gaps in knowledge and provide insights about the residual uncertainties in the predictive capacity of the various models. The research employs the open source environment, k.LAB, which is a platform designed to give access to an integrated network of web-accessible models, to co-develop a user-friendly open library of modelled pollinator scenarios in collaboration with key stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
