 "awd_abstract_narration": "If proteins are overproduced, they may fold incorrectly. This often results in the formation of an insoluble protein mass called an inclusion body (IB). Harvesting functioning protein from IBs is difficult. Avoiding their formation is important and might be achieved by modifying the protein synthesis machinery, the ribosome. Computer simulations will suggest effective changes in the ribosome, and those changes will be made and evaluated. Graduate and undergraduate students will perform simulations and experiments. The PI and some graduate students will also be heavily involved in a conference which fosters participation of Chicanos and Latino Americans in science. \r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe production of large quantities of soluble bioactive proteins in bacteria is still problematic. The goal of this research project is to overcome the protein folding problem by reengineering the bacterial (E. coli) ribosomal machinery. Specifically, slowing the rate of translation termination, thereby reducing the rate of fully-synthesized protein ejected from the ribosomal exit tunnel. Intrinsic chaperone-like properties of the bacterial ribosome will be enhanced. A combination of computer simulations, CRISPR-Cas9-assisted recombineering, and fluorescence-based and colorimetric solubility assays will be employed. Accomplishing the goals of this project will benefit science and engineering alike. It will provide a vector for training the next generation of genetic engineers and chemical biologists. They will be able to combine rational and stochastic approaches, and integrate kinetic simulations, computational design and experimental genetic engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
