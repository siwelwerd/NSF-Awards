 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to study how emerging Augmented Reality (AR) and Building Information Modeling (BIM) technologies can be integrated to increase human performance by improving the retraining of construction workers for retrofitting and repurposing buildings. A widely recognized problem is the growing population of displaced construction and maintenance works due to automation and artificial intelligence. Additionally, the U.S. demolishes and replaces one billion square feet of building stock with new structures. The impact of the waste produced by the demolition of these buildings on the environment is significant and costly as such materials are often not recycled and are landfilled. Retrofitting construction projects are gaining in popularity because they increase a structure's lifespan, preserve historic elements, and minimize waste. This proposal addresses these critical needs by studying how to help workers more easily transfer trade skills and effectively increase problem-solving skills for retrofitting and repurposing building structures. The investigators will study how AR and BIM increase skill development, productivity, and efficiency to help promote the future of work at the human technology frontier in Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC).\r\n \r\nThe researchers propose a novel interdisciplinary approach to explore how AR devices superimpose BIM visual information to gain a better and safer understanding of retrofitting and maintenance issues. This grant will make significant research contributions by addressing the following research questions: (1) Will AR technology be useful and impactful for retraining displaced workers in building construction and retrofitting skills? (2) How does the type of visual presentation of building information modeling data and user-interface in the AR display aid and assist retraining skills and problem-solving retrofitting? (3) Does an AR interface help workers problem solve retrofitting tasks more accurately and more efficiently (e.g., in time and waste of materials) than without an AR interface? The study will develop a testbed of mini-labs for improving long-term problem-solving abilities of retrained workers by creating an augmented workforce through in situ training. The investigators will develop and disseminate their research outcomes both to the academic community as well as skilled workers in the building trades. This will pave the way for broad use and adoption of AR and BIM to solve building retrofitting and maintenance challenges and improve workforce capabilities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
