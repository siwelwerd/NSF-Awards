 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. Elizabeth City State University will strengthen the plant science curriculum by integrating Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) into two courses required by all biology majors. Minority and underrepresented students will be exposed to career opportunities in plant science and the application of bioinformatics. \r\n\r\nThe overall goal of the STEM Pipeline for Plant Sciences initiative is to establish a pathway for undergraduate minority students to enter plant science careers.  A comprehensive approach is used to expose and engage students and faculty in research-based projects and learning strategies that are particularly relatable to students living in a rural and economically disadvantaged region of northeastern North Carolina.  This project will serve as a foundation for curricula improvements in plant sciences. The project objectives are to increase faculty expertise in plant science research and pedagogical techniques through professional development activities, improve student competence and confidence in plant science, enhancing co-curricular and research activities and increase awareness of plant science throughout the ECSU community. The project outcomes generate knowledge on the impact of CUREs on STEM student performance and psychosocial factors within the HBCU environment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
