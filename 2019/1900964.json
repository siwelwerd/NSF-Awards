 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the Houston Summer School on Dynamical Systems (HSSDS) for graduate students, held in June 2019 at the University of Houston. The 8-day 2019 HSSDS workshop will bring together approximately 40 graduate students from institutions across the country, along with 10-15 exceptional undergraduates, who will arrive several days earlier and will receive a series of background lectures giving them some of the tools they need to attend the main event.  The goal of the 2019 HSSDS workshop is to introduce students both to fundamental techniques and recent progress in dynamical systems, emphasizing a probabilistic viewpoint.  Each lecturer in the 2019 HSSDS workshop will give students an appropriate bird's-eye view of the area in which he or she is working.\r\n\r\nExpository talks will present dynamics from a broad perspective, stressing its applications and connections with other areas of science. The school will present recent results and techniques that are not available in textbooks or in a form easily accessible to graduate students. It will introduce recent developments in probabilistic dynamics, chaotic dynamics, and dynamics of quantum systems. The 2019 HSSDS workshop will also include more specialized topics such as statistical properties of non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamics, quantum walks, and dynamics on flat surfaces and translation flows. Applications of dynamics to the modeling of complex physical systems will be a major theme. More information can be found at: https://www.math.uh.edu/dynamics/school/school2019/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
