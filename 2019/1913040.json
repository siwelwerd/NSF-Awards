 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I project will develop an engaging video game learning program useful for underserved high school students to grow their knowledge, skills, and disposition in data science and statistics, and to prepare them for college and careers in STEM related fields. This project addresses the serious shortcomings in the quality, and hence engagement and effectiveness of most of educational games in use today. Above all this project seeks to prevent American students from falling further behind in STEM education and losing access to the expanding technology and data science economy of the next several decades, where strategic sectors of our public life are affected, including scientific research, technology, engineering, medicine, finance, and artificial intelligence. The progress of science and the prosperity of this nation require U.S. citizens, in line with the statutory mission of the NSF, to find solutions to this shortage of human resources in data science. This project seeks to capitalize on the engineering and design superiority of this country's video game industry to recapture and retain global leadership in statistics and data science research and education. The full build of the learning game and the underlying platform is expected to generate jobs and the high amount of tax revenue annually. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis project develops the core video game client and server infrastructure using a hub and spoke paradigm, which maximizes efficiency across the entire creation of the game. Future games will be built upon this established core skeleton of systems, whereby only a fraction of content will need to be generated to produce a new game. The immersive 3D digital game of this project would be comparable to modern industry standards. With the principle of statistical inference, instead of asking the student to apply formulas and data that a teacher provides, the game activities will engage the student in the creation of statistical formulas, raw data and analysis on their own game data. The goals of this study are to establish technical feasibility and usability of the game and gather preliminary evidence of effectiveness of the game intervention on student performance and interest in statistic employing a mixed methods research design with iterative end-user testing trials. The impact of the game intervention will be compared with that of the traditional learning in statistics. During the intervention, summative and formative assessments and fidelity of implementation study will be conducted. Student, teacher, and expert feedback and observation findings will be used to develop the video game.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We define &ldquo;underserved high school students&rdquo; as female, economically disadvantaged (e.g., eligible for free lunch), and ethnic minorities. During ten session implementations in a 12<sup>th</sup> grade student classroom from January 28, 2020 to March 3, 2020, we collected interview, survey, and observation data from students, teachers, and experts about game development and statistics. &nbsp;Each session (six sessions with 86 minutes &amp; four with 76) was implemented with the following intervention components: Introduction, gameplay, participant feedback survey, worksheet, and a phase of differentiation. Quizzes with real world applications assessed materials covered every two lessons. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We recruited a same 12<sup>th</sup> grade teacher who instructed the control group and the intervention group. For our game usability and feasibility study, 14 intervention students participated. Our sample size for the impact study (the effectiveness of our intervention study) was 25 students: nine intervention students and 16 control students. We recruited the intervention students from a college preparatory class and the control students from an honors class. According to Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System scores in Mathematics, a raw score of 240 or higher is considered &ldquo;proficient.&rdquo; Among the intervention students, two needed improvement, three were barely above the benchmark score of 240, and four had higher scores than the benchmark score. Among the control students, one student needed improvement and the other 15 students had much higher scores than the benchmark of 240.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the intervention, underserved students who participated in the<em> </em>intervention, did not demonstrate a statistically higher level of interest in learning statistics than their counterparts who did not participate in the intervention.

Our student- level implementation was below the threshold and did not meet fidelity of implementation. The low rate of completion of all ten lessons was related to not only poor attendance of the students at school but also in class, the intervention students did not have enough time to enjoy games.
