 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the modern era of big data, although the cost of labeling and analyzing a single data sample has been decreasing rapidly, it is usually outpaced by the unrivaled fast growth of dataset size, which makes it particularly timely to design unsupervised learning algorithms that are able to discover meaningful structures of data without extensive human efforts. Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as a thriving unsupervised machine learning technique that has led to significant advances in various fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and others. GANs can generate high-quality realistic images based on unlabeled natural images and perform sophisticated tasks such as synthesizing photos from sketches and coloring images. However, there also exist challenges that need timely solutions. The training of GANs has been reportedly observed to be challenging, unstable, and not easily reproducible. This project seeks to conduct a systematic study of GANs through the fundamental formulation, generalization and optimization issues. The transformative potential of the project is in the development of foundational tools and practical guidelines through novel combinations of optimal transport, information theory, convex geometry, and empirical process theory.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is four-fold: (1) develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the generalization properties of GANs in high-dimensions; (2) suggest principled approaches to design GANs to achieve optimal statistical properties; (3) diagnose GANs when issues such as mode collapse or discriminator winning occur; (4) develop computationally efficient algorithms that can attain the statistical limits of well-designed GANs. The theory and algorithms developed within this projection will have impact on various engineering and scientific applications and provide insights for the proper usage of GANs in the real world.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
