 "awd_abstract_narration": "SUNY Geneseo will lead an NSF ADVANCE Partnership project called the COPLAC Partnering and Liaising Across the Nation (PLAN) Initiative to provide transformational institutional change strategies for COPLAC institutions.  The COPLAC (Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges) consortium includes twenty-nine, state-funded, predominantly undergraduate institutions (PUIs) across the nation.  All members of COPLAC share a mission to provide a high-quality, affordable education to their constituents.  The project will undertake two main efforts: 1) training and empowering influencers such as administrators and chairs to problem solve and create equity goals, and 2) creating facilitated virtual professional affinity groups among COPLAC faculty. The training will be integrated in the COPLAC annual meeting to support the participation of institutional leadership. The affinity groups will be tailored to support the unique needs of faculty at PUIs and create a conduit for sharing faculty equity issues with COPLAC leaders.\r\n\r\nThe project will ensure that efforts include attention to intersectional issues in STEM academic workplaces which will contribute to the effectiveness of the ADVANCE strategies that are being adapted.  The project includes a strong plan for sharing and disseminating information on the project which will be broadly applicable to many other PUIs.  In addition, COPLAC institutions that are part of state systems of higher education offer an additional avenue for sharing strategies developed with this project with the state-wide systems.  This project has the potential to reduce inequities within the COPLAC consortium institutions and may result in a useful model for other PUIs facing similar challenges across the nation. \r\n\r\nThe NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions.  Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational culture and climate.  ADVANCE \"Partnership\" awards provide support to collaborations among STEM professional societies and academic and non-academic non-profit organizations designed to broaden the implementation of evidence-based equity strategies and have a national or regional reach.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Results showed variation in the existence of equity-related policies/practices across COPLAC institutions and disagreement between administration and faculty on the extent of impact. The areas with the least adoption and greatest disagreement informed the topics of our professional development for COPLAC Chairs, Provosts, and Presidents. Multiple project interventions were created and implemented on topics of workload equity and policies/procedures to make invisible service load more equitable across faculty; on evaluation bias and tenure and promotion reform, including policies/procedures that acknowledge and value invisible service in evaluation, bias in peer and student teaching evaluation; and on resource allocation. Interventions (presentations/workshops/discussions) were conducted twice yearly for Presidents and Provosts (2021, 2022 and 2023) at the AAC&U Annual Meetings and COPLAC Annual Meetings. The Project sponsored KerryAnn O'Meara as a plenary speaker in 2021 on invisible service. For Chairs, a virtual 2-day Faculty Equity Training for Department Chairs (2022 & 2023) facilitated professional development and collaboration across institutions on faculty workload, evaluation bias mitigation, and resource allocation. Participants found it useful to discuss experiences with colleagues at other institutions and were reaffirmed in the changes they already wanted to implement; 90% said that they would recommend this training to other Chairs. A compressed Chair workshop was also implemented at the COPLAC Beard Leadership Circle in 2022, 2023 & 2024.\r\n\n\nIn 2024, the focus was on determining the project and dissemination. A census of STEM faculty by gender, rank, discipline and institution (to compare faculty demographics to pre-project) found that the proportion of women STEM faculty across faculty ranks increased over the project timeframe. We found the largest gains in women STEM faculty in Associate Professor rank (increase from 44% to 49%) and especially in Professor rank (increase from 33% to 41%). Follow-up surveys of COPLAC administrators and women STEM faculty were conducted to understand perceptions on the state of faculty equity across COPLAC PUIs and impacts of project reform efforts. Administrators reported new policy reform in student evaluation of teaching, recognition and reward of service, and increased faculty equity training for department chairs; perceived an increased knowledge about faculty equity issues; and heightened motivation to conduct faculty equity work.
