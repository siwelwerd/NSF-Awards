 "awd_abstract_narration": "PART I:  NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nTechnetium is a radioactive element, and its fundamental solid state chemistry is not well established in comparison to neighboring elements.  This lack of understanding of technetium limits what may be understood regarding the transition metals that surround it on the periodic table.  Solids composed of only technetium and either nitrogen or sulfur are nearly unexplored.  However, such compounds are both important in understanding the fundamental chemistry of the element and of importance to developing materials with exceptional hardness or useful electronic properties.  This investigation, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) uses high pressure/high temperature synthesis methods to prepare and characterize a range of new examples of technetium nitrides and sulfides.  Synthesis productivity is enhanced by using cutting-edge computational approaches to guide synthesis efforts and to assist in understanding the new solids produced. More detailed calculations using quantum mechanical methods will provide predicted spectra and other physical properties to the experimental team before they attempt to synthesize these phases, enabling quick identification and providing insights into how to begin characterizing new materials.  Outreach has been established through the National Atomic Testing Museum for school students and the general public, designed not only to inform them of the science behind radiation and nuclear processes, but to further excite their imagination about science. \r\n\r\nPART II:  TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis project fills in critical gaps in fundamental knowledge of the solid state chemistry of binary technetium compounds.  Targeted synthesis of new solid-state nitrides and sulfides relies upon diamond anvil cells (DACs), coupled with resistive heating (fully uniform up to 1200 K) and laser heating (in excess of 5000 K).  Reactions carried out in DACs are monitored in situ during synthesis through X-ray diffraction (XRD) and spectroscopic (XAS) techniques and in-house optical spectroscopy.  Crystal structure prediction searches identify which compounds are sufficiently stable that they might be synthesized. By comparing free energies across pressure ranges for competing phases computationally, very specific experimental conditions where desired compounds are likely to form can be targeted.  Machine learning approaches will be used to extract empirical, reactive potentials from this library of data which can be applied to the prediction of more compositionally and structurally complicated phases than will be initially accessible with first principles-based structure search techniques. These tools will also enable the team to accurately simulate systems at length and time scales inaccessible to conventional electronic structure methods. As simulation and experiment provide an improved picture of the kinetic and thermodynamic aspects of stability, a detailed understanding of adjusting structure and composition may be exploited to rationally design materials.  Outreach has been established through the National Atomic Testing Museum for school students and the general public, designed not only to inform them of the science behind radiation and nuclear processes, but to further excite their imagination about science.  This project is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In the case of technetium, binary technetium nitrides and sulfides are virtually unexplored compared to neighboring elements. It is critical to establish the existence and properties of simple technetium compounds in order to reliably understand and model the reactivity and mobility of technetium and to rationally design waste forms for the element. By combining a team with exceptional experience in technetium chemistry, synthesis, computational modelling/structure prediction, and experimental structure determination, we have utilized a modern approach to materials discovery that target a substantial number of new technetium compounds. Central to our synthesis efforts is the laser-heated diamond anvil cell (LH-DAC). The versatility of the LH-DAC for accessing high pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions provides the most productive and efficient route to novel Tc compounds. Thorough experimental characterization through structure determination, spectroscopy, compressibilities, melting, and physical properties have been complimented with simulation to establish a complete picture of the properties of each material discovered. We believe the results from this funded project have provided valuable, unique insight into the basic chemistry of technetium, and will be invaluable as benchmarks to validate computational studies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;As Technetium is radioactive we started this project with using Mn as an analogue as they are in the same group and show similar properties, and we used this approach as a proxy to develop the methodology we need for our study of TcS<sub>2</sub>.&nbsp;The MnS<sub>2&nbsp;&nbsp;</sub>systems undergoes a&nbsp;colossal eight order of magnitude resistance drop with&nbsp;compression&nbsp;at moderate pressures of 12&nbsp;GPa&nbsp;drives this material into a metallic state.&nbsp;This is the largest drop (or among them)&nbsp;in resistance within a single phase of any density driven system.&nbsp;Further&nbsp;compression drives&nbsp;magneto-elastic&nbsp;distortions&nbsp;in the metallic material&nbsp;showing it retains its antiferromagnetic ordering, and with enough compression&nbsp;it transforms into&nbsp;the previously reported arsenopyrite phase.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Continuing on from there, we expand our study to TcS<sub>2</sub>. This along with the pure element is another example of a Tc compound becoming more like Mn rather than Re when under pressure. However, unlike arsenopyrite MnS<sub>2</sub>, the arsenopyrite phase of TcS<sub>2</sub> is completely recoverable to ambient conditions. The transformation into the arsenopyrite structure for TcS<sub>2</sub> is accompanied by a change in oxidation state, as the S-S bond of a persulfide anion is confirmed x-ray absorption measurements and by our calculations using DFT calculations (Figure 1). The presence of the persulfide anions causes the electronic structure of arsenopyrite TcS<sub>2</sub> to resemble a negative charge transfer insulator with a valence band composed primarily of Tc d states, and a conduction band with significant S p character. This new phase is insulative with predicted indirect band gaps of 0.785 eV at 20 GPa and 0.513 eV at 0 GPa; marking TcS<sub>2</sub> as another example of a pressure and temperature driven insulator-to-metal-to-insulator transition.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our work on the synthesis and chemical stability of technetium nitrides reports the first ever realized pure technetium nitride compounds and demonstrates the necessity for high pressure-temperature pathways for such chemistry to occur.

We show that there is a rich number of technetium nitride compounds and that they do not follow the same progression as seen for the Re-N system, which is often used as an analogue (Figure 2).
