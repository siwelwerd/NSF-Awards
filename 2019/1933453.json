 "awd_abstract_narration": "Simulation models of biological and physiological systems have been increasing in number and complexity over the last 20 years, and they are an important means to truly advance understanding of these complex systems.  The impact of these models will be increased if they can be shared easily and accurately between research groups and so that they can both model and be validated with broader sets of data.  The Center for Reproducible Systems for Biomedical Modeling at the University of Washington seeks to develop tools to: 1) build reproducible models; 2) to annotate models using a unified techniques; and 3) reproducibly simulate, analyze, and visualize models online.  The outcomes of this EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award will provide the research community with tools to make published models more understandable, visualizable, and reusable.  The research team will contribute to various workshops and conferences to highlight the work and train users in the new tools and standards. In addition, the project includes a plan to host afternoon science activities at SoundBio, a maker-space organization that focuses on biology, that would include hands-on and computational exercises for high school and middle school students.\r\n\r\nThis EAGER award will support efforts of the Center for Reproducible Systems for Biomedical Modeling to: 1) develop a smart annotation editor to assist users in an unobtrusive way with the annotation of models through the addition of metadata; and 2) develop a human-readable standard for describing simulation experiments, such that the precise conditions of the experiment could be recreated through multiple platforms and systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
