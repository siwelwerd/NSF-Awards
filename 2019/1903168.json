 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports an international workshop to be held at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, USA in May 2019 to continue planning the international Synoptic Arctic Survey (SAS) program.  Through a series of coordinated international research cruises anticipated for the summers of 2020 and 2021, in different regions of the Arctic Ocean, SAS will provide important baseline information about the Arctic ocean ecosystem, carbon system, and physical environment necessary to understand and predict the impacts of ongoing environmental change on the Arctic.  This workshop will plan coordinated field sampling, international data sharing, education including graduate student participation, post field-season data synthesis, public outreach, and involvement of indigenous communities.  The workshop will sponsor the participation of a group of early career scientists.  US scientists are key participants in the planning of the SAS and will lead this workshop, promoting US leadership in Arctic science.  The SAS will engage the general public in Arctic research, increase science literacy and will include multiple audiences (early career, educators, under-represented groups) in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) research and careers. The outcomes of the SAS field effort will provide baseline understanding of the Arctic system that can be used by national and international policy makers to effectively plan and manage human activities in the Arctic, such as transportation, resource development, and, potentially, commercial fishing.  \r\n\r\nUnderstanding of the Arctic Ocean ecosystem and carbon system, their dependencies on physical drivers, and their interactions with neighboring shelves and ocean regions remains inadequate to project how environmental change may modify these systems on a Pan-Arctic scale.  The Synoptic Arctic Survey (SAS) is an international program envisioned to mount a coordinated, multi-nation, field-based effort on a Pan Arctic scale quasi-synoptically over one-two summers to achieve the baseline understanding of the fundamental structure and function of the linked carbon-ecosystem-physical systems that will permit detection of ongoing and future changes.  The SAS is focused on a single overarching question, \"What are the present state and major ongoing transformations of the Arctic marine system?\". The field effort would provide the parameters needed to project future trajectories of change both conceptually and through coupled physical-chemical-biological modeling.  It is envisioned that the effort, or parts of the effort, would be continued on decadal scales to detect change.  This grant provides resources to host an international, open-to-all 2-day planning workshop and a follow on 1-day planning and writing workshop for the US SAS Scientific Steering Committee to be held in Woods Hole, MA in May 2019. The overall goals of the workshop include promoting interest and participation in the SAS from US and international scientists (especially early career scientists), designing a concrete international implementation that expands on the present international Science and Implementation Plan, discuss the planned years of deployment, and engage interested US and international program managers. For the US only, further goals include codifying and writing a US Implementation Plan and identifying a strategy for activities and proposals that would lead to US participation in the SAS.  The planned outcomes and products of the workshop include a workshop report, a draft management plan, a blueprint/plan for nurturing the next generation of scientists, and a US implementation plan. Funding to support the participation of early career scientists would be provided both by this grant and by grants from International Arctic Science Committee Working Groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project sought to further plan for and to advance the US participation in an international, collaborative effort to improve understanding of the Arctic ocean and ecosystem. This work is important so that we can better predict how that system could respond to ongoing changing environmental conditions such as the very warm air temperatures seen during summer 2020  The international science community has designed a field program, the Synoptic Arctic Survey, that would survey far-flung regions of the Arctic ocean during summers of 2020 &ndash; 2022.  (\"Synoptic\" here meaning as close to simultaneous as possible as well as a view of a whole). Participating countries will send research ships on science cruises to study Arctic ocean currents, temperature, and salinity, Arctic ocean carbon, and the Arctic ecosystem.  The goals are to cover as much of the Arctic Ocean as possible during the same time of year, to synthesize results from the different cruises and efforts, and to compare the system status with the limited available historic information to detect changes.  This information then can be used to better predict and model the Arctic system. \n\nTo this end, an open, international workshop was held in May 2019 in Woods Hole MA with goals of further planning the international effort and to engage the US science community.  Fifty-nine scientists participated in the workshop.  A workshop was produced that describes the discussions and recommendations stemming from the workshop.  Several informational sessions and presentations were also held at later science symposia and on-line forums\n\nIntellectual Merit:  The Arctic system is chronically understudied which hampers our ability to predict how ongoing environmental changes might effect carbon transformations and ecosystem characteristics.  Also, linkages between the different regions of the Arctic are still poorly understood.  A comprehensive survey across multiple Arctic regions will go a long way toward enabling us to better model and predict these responses.  This capability will be very important as we move towards management of newly emerging Arctic opportunities such as fisheries. \n\nBroader Impacts:  The participation of early career scientists in the workshop was actively promoted by providing travel support to the workshop for seven participants (an additional eight were supported by international funds), many of whom were session co-leaders at the workshop and who assisted in the writing of the workshop report. The participation of an indigenous Alaskan community member in the workshop also helped identify opportunities to better engage local Arctic community members, from both the US and beyond, in the effort.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/06/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Carin J Ashjian"
