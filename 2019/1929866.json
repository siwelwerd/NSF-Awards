 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous observations during the 2017 solar eclipse in the weakly ionized portion of the upper atmosphere (the ionosphere) revealed a surprising result. Rather than the expected smooth response to the Moon's shadow, the electron and ion temperatures observed by two satellites traversing the topside ionosphere at 850 km in altitude showed complex and sporadic jumps between regions of cooler plasma and regions where the temperatures were nominal. This project will investigate these unexpected plasma temperature modulations by conducting a thorough analysis of the plasma observations (temperatures, density, flows) for this and other past eclipse events. This will provide important information about how the ionosphere responds to the transient changes in the illumination drivers. Knowledge of these responses is important since solar illumination is a key driver of fundamental processes of ionization and structuring. Radio propagation through the ionosphere depends on how much ionization and structuring occurs, and solar eclipses provide a controlled and quantifiable way to learn more about both positive and adverse effects of the ionosphere on global networks that use radio frequencies, for example the Global Navigation Satellite System. \r\n\r\nThis project will provide detailed characterization of the ionospheric plasma anomalies during solar eclipses using Defense Meteorological Satellite Program measurements of the plasma density, electron and ion temperatures, and plasma transport. It will also provide identification and characterization of mutual relationship between the irregular solar source regions and consequential ionospheric transient modulation. Finally, the project will identify the physical mechanisms, controlling parameters, and limiting cases of the anomalous flows and temperatures. The ultimate goal of this work is to obtain a better understanding of how short-term changes in the illumination of the dayside ionosphere can produce non-uniform responses in the ionospheric density, temperature, and drifts.\r\n\r\nThis project will contribute to the development of a highly-skilled workforce by supporting a graduate student at Boston University.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe ionosphere is the layer of charged particles (ions and electrons) in the upper atmosphere between roughly 80 and 1000 km above the Earths surface and is created by the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light from the sun on the dayside of the Earth. During a solar eclipse the moons shadow blocks this light and shuts off the production of the charged particles temporarily. We use eclipses as test cases where we can use the controlled and predictable conditions of the input of EUV to observe how the ionosphere behaves and the charged particles respond. Understanding the behavior of the ionosphere is crucial to our understanding of space weather, the interaction between the suns radiation and the solar wind with the Earths magnetosphere and upper atmosphere.\n\n\nIn the August 2017 eclipse, two DMSP spacecraft flew through the eclipses shadow at 840 km altitude and the Langmuir probe on-board showed a structured series of decreases in the electron temperatures while in the shadow. It is known that the surface of the sun has active regions on it that are significantly brighter in the EUV compared to the rest of the suns surface. As the moon covers the suns disc there would be times when an active region would be covered or uncovered, and this would lead to abrupt changes in the amount of EUV hitting a particular location in the ionosphere. Working with Dr. Sebastijan Mrak we determined the pattern of these abrupt increases and decreases along the spacecrafts passes and found they roughly corresponded to the observed decreases in the electron temperatures.\n\n\nThis project, along with a parallel NSF-funded project for Dr. Mrak, examined over a dozen other eclipses where the DMSP spacecraft passed through the moons shadow in order to characterize the temperature decreases and determine how they were tied to the moons shadow and the production of ions and electrons in the ionosphere. Our first work showed that these dips in the electron temperature were a common and repeated phenomenon that appeared in all the eclipses when the spacecraft were lucky enough to encounter the shadow. Further work into this showed that the temperature dips were not real, rather they were actually artifacts of the algorithm that calculated the electron temperature trying to analyze noisy data from the Langmuir probe. Further work on the data from the instruments showed that the Langmuir probe data were noisy in these locations because of high-energy ions and electrons striking the Langmuir probe and the spacecraft. These discrete regions of high-energy ions and electrons occur repeated inside the shadow of the eclipses we obsereved, and are not typical of the conditions in the ionosphere seen in other locations or times. We conclude that there is a connection between these regions of abrupt change in the amount of EUV shining on the ionosphere and the appearance of these high-energy particles seen by the DMSP spacecraft. However, we are still looking for a mechanism to tie together the change in EUV with the production of these high-energy particles in the ionosphere, and this will be the subject of future work and research.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/04/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MarcRHairston\n"
