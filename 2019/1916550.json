 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over half of the world's 1.8 billion websites run on Content Management Systems (CMS). Unfortunately, CMS deployments make easy targets for attackers, as they are built from an amalgam of layered software and interpreters, with varying degrees of network and system permissions, which execute on an Internet-facing web server. This project develops program-analysis-centric techniques that enable the investigation and remediation of ongoing infections as well as hardening against future CMS compromises, with the goals of 1) understanding the intent and strategy of a CMS infection and tracing their root-cause attack vector for reliable remediation, 2) revealing dynamic and sophisticated attack behaviors in malware samples in a CMS infection, 3) hardening of CMS deployments against future attacks. This project benefits national security and economic stability by creating cyber forensics and vulnerability detection techniques for CMS websites and the financial, government, and private sector operations they support. It provides server-side script code including malicious scripts and vulnerable code to help train next-generation cybersecurity experts. Students from underrepresented minority groups are involved in research activities.\r\n\r\nThis project develops Doctor WHO, a CMS analysis framework which combines rapid evidence collection and advanced program analysis techniques for the investigation and remediation of infections and hardening against future CMS compromises. Specifically, the data-driven prediction framework, called TARDIS, is developed to understand the temporal correlation of attack evidence across a corpus of real-world websites. TARDIS enables the automated discovery of the artifacts of a compromise, fingerprinting of the attack's propagation, and rapid investigation of cyberattacks against CMS deployments. The project also develops Torchwood, a cross-language and cross-environment program analysis framework to effectively analyze highly dynamic and sophisticated malware targeting CMSs. Torchwood can handle advanced obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques applied to malware and reveal hidden malicious behaviors and intentions of the malware effectively. Lastly, the project develops UNIT that enables the hardening and securing of CMS deployments against future attacks. UNIT accomplishes this by enabling automated dynamic testing of CMS-backed websites without requiring any runtime environment resources. UNIT eliminates false alerts and provide proof-of-concept exploits via a set of new methods to identify and model dependencies of runtime resources and reconstruct missing resources using instrumented script interpreter engines.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Discovery and Investigation of Cyber Attacks on CMS: Our research developed TARDIS, a forensics pipeline that discovers cyber attacks on CMS platforms and recovers the temporal evolution of the attack stages. We applied TARDIS to the nightly backups of 300K websites and found 20,591 attacks which lasted up to 1,694 days. TARDIS's findings were published at the 2020 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy. TARDIS revealed that the root cause of many attacks was plugins added to the CMS codebase. We designed YODA, a novel CMS plugin vetting system. YODA uncovered 47,337 malicious plugins on 24,931 unique websites. YODA's findings were published at the 2022 USENIX Security Symposium. Additionally, our research found and cataloged 10.1M obfuscated malware collected from over 27K production websites dating back to 2012.

Cross-Language Concolic Malware Analysis Engine: During this project, we developed MalMax, a PHP program analysis technique equipped with forced execution capability (or counterfactual execution capability). MalMax identified 1,485 malware samples that were not detected by any existing state-of-the-art tool, even after 7 months in the wild. This work was published and presented at the 2019 ACM CCS conference, a top security conference. Our evaluation of a real-world data set collected from a commercial web hosting company shows that our system, called Cubismo, is highly effective in dissecting sophisticated metamorphic malware with multiple layers of obfuscation.

Dynamic Analysis Platform for Hardening CMS: In this project, we observed that static vulnerability scanning techniques for CMS suffer from a high rate of false alarms. Our analysis of popular CMS scanning tools, including PHPScan, Oak, and KPHP, revealed that over 50% of the vulnerabilities they reported were false positives. On the other hand, we found that dynamic analysis tools frequently fail to detect vulnerabilities because of the lack of runtime resources such as a database. When testing databases lacking sufficient data, these tools are unable to reach and identify critical vulnerability points. To overcome these challenges, we developed SynthDB, a novel database generation method tailored for CMS applications with database backends. In tests conducted across 13 real-world PHP applications, including WordPress, phpBB, and OpenCart, SynthDB achieved 63.3% code coverage and 74.5% query coverage. These figures represent a significant improvement, with an increase of 14.4% in code coverage and 21.1% in query coverage, over current state-of-the-art methods.
