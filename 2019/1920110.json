 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs. Professor Roman Dembinski from Oakland University and colleagues Xiangqun Zeng, Ferman Chavez, Wei Zhang and Amitava Adhikary are acquiring a variable-temperature, continuous-wave-X-band-electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer. In general, an EPR spectrometer yields detailed information on the geometric and electronic structure of molecular and solid-state materials. It is also used to obtain information about the lifetimes of free radicals, short-lived, highly reactive species involved in valuable chemical transformations as well as the initiation of possible pathological growth. These studies impact several areas, from the synthesis of inorganic and organic molecules to the development of new solid-state materials to compounds of magnetic and biological interest. Employing examples inspired from ongoing research, this instrument is an integral part of research and teaching at the undergraduate and graduate levels at Oakland University. Additionally, the investigators are sharing the spectrometer with many interested users from the area. The instrumentation strengthens the institution's educational mission in the chemical, biochemical, and environmental sciences, which involves students from a broad range of ethnic and cultural backgrounds in southeastern Michigan.  The student users include socio-economically disadvantaged and minority students in the Detroit metropolitan area.\r\n\r\nThe award of this spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. The instrument acquisition is especially  useful in understanding the mechanisms of reactions involving free radical damage to biomolecules and its repair and/or restitution. The instrument is also employed in investigations of the roles of metallo-peptides involved in reactive oxygen species formation and in research of feromagnetic-coupled systems for materials science. The instrumentation serves researchers studying free-radical-mediated redox processes in molecules dissolved in ionic liquids, and those trying to understand the role of free radicals such as superoxide anion radical that are related to the onset of maturity of human cataracts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
