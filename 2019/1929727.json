 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a pressing need to understand the high rates of attrition from engineering careers, particularly within the first five to ten years of employment. According to the scientific literature, no existing research has systematically examined the gendered organizational socialization experiences of newcomer men and women engineers. Accordingly, this project examines gendered organizational socialization of newcomer engineers. It begins the long-term work of developing processes of acculturation to the engineering profession that are compatible with intersecting non-normative identities, by creating an empirically-supported and engineering-specific model of gendered socialization. The integrated education and research plan is likely to yield a dramatic impact on the field of engineering education by prioritizing the importance of underutilized gender theories, enrolling men in gender research and systems change, and addressing the gap in research on engineering workplaces. Ultimately, this project facilitates greater equality in the socialization of newcomer engineers to decrease attrition from engineering careers and broaden participation of underrepresented groups in engineering. \r\n \r\nThe objectives of this project are to develop a theoretical model of gendered socialization in civil engineering workplaces and to create research-based interventions for more inclusive socialization. Mixed-methods data will be collected longitudinally over four years, through twice-monthly Individual Socialization Logs (a new instrument developed during the course of this project) and twice-yearly in-depth interviews with thirty diverse newcomer engineers from around the country. Expected project outcomes include identification and characterization of facets of organizational socialization (e.g., practices, processes, relationships and social networks) that are gendered, including how they are gendered intersectionally (i.e., varying across other types of identity, such as race). The research findings and the model created from them are being utilized to create professional formation materials for graduating civil engineering students and civil engineering professionals. Materials are also being implemented nationally and locally in capstone design courses and workshops for engineering companies. Further, this project contributes, simultaneously, to the fields of engineering education, engineering studies, organizational studies, and gender studies.",

Longitudinal surveys and interviews were used to identify gendered features of socialization and help explain why men are retained at significantly higher rates than women within their first decade on the job. The project also identified advice for early career civil engineers, advice for civil engineering faculty members, advice for researchers conducting longitudinal studies, and identified occupational identity work as an important phenomenon in early career civil engineer. The project produced numerous conference papers, journal articles, and professional development workshops for engineering students and educators around the country. The conference papers were presented at the 2019 Australasian Association for Engineering Educatoin Annual Conference, the 2022 and 2023 American Society for Engineering Education annual conferences, and the 2023 Hawaii International Conference on Education. Articles were published in the Journal of Civil Engieering Education, European Journal of Engineering Education, Engineering Studies, and the International Journal of Social Reserach Methodologies. The European Journal of Engineering Education article won the award for best paper of the year for 2022.
