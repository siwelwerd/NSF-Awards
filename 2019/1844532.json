 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide a comprehensive study of the Sora language, spoken by an indigenous 'tribal' people in India with a population of over 300,000, located in several districts of southern Odisha State. This project focuses on the features of Sora's sound system, grammar and vocabulary which stand out in various significant ways, both from related languages and other languages of the region. These analyses will inform (and be informed by) current debates in language contact and language change in the South Asian and Southeast Asian regions, as well as by current work in linguistic typology, and may necessitate a reformulation of the prehistory of South Asia. Sora presents several challenging features, including a possibly unique form of noun incorporation that has been explicitly predicted to be impossible. Once these details of Sora are better understood, and its changes over time have been analyzed, new insights into the murky linguistic pre-history of South Asia will emerge. The project also offers unique opportunities for indigenous scientists to play major roles in the research as key team members, thus offering capacity building and STEM field research opportunities to some of the most underserved and underrepresented communities of scientists. It also helps promote the visibility of indigenous peoples whose histories have been missing from mainstream accounts of regional South Asian history. \r\n\r\nThe project will produce A Grammar of Sora (with texts, a comparative lexicon and grammar of the various Sora dialects) and create an exhaustive, annotated archival deposit of the Sora dialect materials. These are to be collected through a combination of spontaneous narrative recordings and targeted elicitation with speakers, recorded in audio and video format. Topics to be explored include the 'expressive' lexicon, which is a highly developed system in Sora with many attested complex reduplication patterns, as well as the systems of grammatical agreement seen in different verb classes. We will also examine the typological shifts that may have accompanied the Dravidian and Aryan migrations into South Asia that marginalized the groups already there, such as the Proto-Munda ancestors to the Sora, and the ancestral language to Kusunda to the periphery. These typological shifts may have submerged or replaced what may have been more widespread older features.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Another set of texts we collected are of the elaborate mural tradition of the Sora known as <em>idittal</em> that served as a preliterate storytelling mnemonic system. We definitively determined that the accentual system of Sora is not trochaic as claimed previously but rather has kept its older iambic structure. We determined that Sora also uses many archaic infixes and reduplication processes to form words. We determined that Sora has a very unusual system of noun incorporation that considerably expanded the word building system it inherited from its earliest known proto-Austroasiatic ancestor. As a language with complex subject and object agreement and with grammatical \"prefixes\" that are not really prefixes as they do not count as part of the word in terms of stress or vowel reduction, features also shared with the Trans-Himalayan subgroup Kiranti spoken in N. India and Nepal, and since both language groups differ in this respect from related languages and from major languages of South Asia belonging to the Indo-Aryan and Dravidian families, both Sora (which continues proto-Munda features in this regard) and proto-Kiranti likely reflect shift to a Munda and Trans-Himalayan language, respectively, by speakers of a now lost language or language family in South Asia. In summary, once the three large books we produced from this grant get published, Sora will stand among the ranks of well described languages of South Asia. Moreover, the results of our study have necessitated a revision of our understanding of South Asian linguistic prehistory. Most of the formative changes that occurred in Sora's history predate the influence of either Dravidian or Indo-Aryan languages which are the dominant language families spoken around Sora in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. These features are not inheritances from proto-Austroasiatic, and the stress shift that was allegedly the cause of all these dramatic typological changes that define Sora with respect to related languages spoken in Southeast Asia never took place. Also, there is no clear internal structural model within Munda to give rise to most of the features attested. But contact with known languages in the region cannot be used to explain the rise of such features in Munda and Sora as they do not occur in the surrounding languages. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that these features were imported from a now lost language during a shift from one language to another.
