 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part 1\r\nThe second Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's Annual Legislative Conference (ALC) Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Research Action Practice (RAP) Symposium will build on prior work to expand the influence of HBCUs on decision making with respect to national priorities for underrepresented students in STEM. Since 2018, The Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network has actively participated in the NSF INCLUDES Program and has conducted original research on HBCU STEM production. Using collective impact as a paradigm to facilitate knowledge generation and synthesis across professional sectors, this symposium will advance innovative strategies to foster social change. QEM brings nearly 29 years of leadership in STEM initiatives and conferences with the HBCU community. This conference builds on research that uses organizational learning theory and focus group research to understand the process through which HBCUs acquire knowledge and translate knowledge into dynamic capabilities.\r\n\r\nPart 2\r\nThe symposium will elevate research and institutional partnerships to advance STEM policy and decision making, and build collaborations with industry leaders, elected officials and decision makers. Giving research at HBCUs greater leverage to impact social change will contribute to national efforts to grow and diversify the STEM workforce. Though a small segment of our Nation's colleges, HBCUs disproportionately graduate African American STEM degree recipients. The conference's dissemination strategies will catalyze HBCU researchers and decision makers to collaborate to support the Nation's goal of a diversified STEM workforce. An expected outcome of the conference is a research-action-policy plan that will share what works in building a community of practice between HBCU researchers, social advocates and decision makers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
