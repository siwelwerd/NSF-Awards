 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the role of the motor system in how people perceive time.  The perception of time is fundamental to our conscious experience and critical to virtually all of our activities.  However, despite being a focus of research in experimental psychology since the 19th century, time perception is still incompletely understood. Previous work has suggested that the brain controls the timing of our actions and the motor system simply produces an output in response to these timed brain commands. That is, the brain decides when to move and the motor system produces the movement. However, recent research has shown that the motor system may have a much more critical role in timing and may be fundamentally necessary for the perception of time. The investigators will test this idea by having human participants move a robotic arm that can be perturbed by the experimenters. The investigators will explore whether changing the features of the robotic arm movement also alters the subject's perception of time and whether this paradigm can be used to improve the perception of time. The research program combines aspects of the decision-making and motor planning literatures and will provide novel training for graduate and undergraduate students in the two research areas. Finally, understanding timing and movements is critical to the development of brain-machine interfaces and neural prosthetics and may help support interventions in motor rehabilitation and motor disorders. \r\n\r\nIn most psychological research on time perception in humans, subjects must typically make a choice between two alternatives by pressing a button. This stands in contrast to most animal research, where animals must move to a response location. The investigators intend to bridge the gap between these two literatures with the proposed paradigm. To do this, subjects will be required to move a robotic arm to different locations, depending on their decision about an elapsed interval of time. A series of studies will test the effects of 1) adding resistance to the arm while subjects actively time an interval, 2) actively moving vs. planning a movement while timing an interval, and 3) the impact of moving while judging other, time-critical stimuli (e.g., pitch). In all studies, the investigators will use movement kinematics and dynamics to predict the choices subjects will make and will apply drift-diffusion modeling simulations to elucidate where and how movement parameters impact the perception of time.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe purpose of this award was to study how the motor system influences our perception of time.  Previous research has shown that our sense of time is critical for controlling our movements.  That is, our ability to perform precise motor actions, such as playing an instrument, dancing, or hitting a baseball, all require that we perform our actions at the right time.  However, little research has been done to investigate the converse - how our movements themselves might impact our sense of time.  The goal of this project was therefore to investigate how motor movements may feed back into our perceptual apparatus to influence perceived duration.  \n\nIn our first series of experiments, we had subjects move a robotic arm while listening to tones of various durations, which they then had to classify as \"short\" or \"long\".  We observed that, when the robotic arm was being moved while listening to the tones, subjects were better as perceiving the intervals then when the robotic arm was held in place.  Follow-up experiments replicated this effect across several other designs, demonstrating a robust finding.\n\nIn a second series of experiments, we had subjects perform the same task, but now increased resistance in the robotic arm, thus making the movements slower and their lengths shorter.  Here, we found that slower/shorter movements were associated with shorter perceived intervals of time.  We again replicated this effect across different experiments, and further applied sophisticated computational models to the results to try and find the source of the effect.  Here, we determined that subjects were perceiving the tones they heard as shorter, rather than being biased to say \"short\" based on their movements.  \n\nFinally, the explain these results, we searched the literature to find other examples of motor movements affecting time, and collected them in a review of the literture that ultimately led to a new model of how movements can affect timing.  \n\nAltogether, our findings pave the way for new studies that seek to investigate how our movements impact perception.  These findings are critical for us to understand how perception and action interact, with implications for how to build human-machine interfaces for producing movements.  Further, our findings have implications for disorders of movement, where patients may be impaired in how well they can move.  As part of this award, two graduate students received cross-disciplinary training at two different universities, with a unique combination of psychology, neuroscience, and bioengineering.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/05/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Martin Wiener"
