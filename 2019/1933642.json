 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to alleviate and improve the high rate of disengagement of the US workforce (i.e. alleviating the current struggle professionals face to have the right resource and guidance they need in order to find job fit). Additional societal issues that may be  resolved include the \"purpose gap\" at work and high turnover/job attrition rates. The impacts of disengagement at work include impacts to individuals' wellbeing, organizations' bottom line and level of employee productivity, and subsequent costs to the economy. The impact of this project will improve the value and ability of higher education to meet societal expectations and improve students' prospects. \r\nThis project will enable individuals to find job fit early on, avoid job hopping and be engaged and productive at work so they and their companies, economies, and societies thrive. By advancing individuals' career process, the project can enable them to play a more impactful role in society.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is exploring career coaching automation by pairing technology where it works best with human interaction where it is needed. The project leverages advanced technology to automate and scale career guidance to every professional, including cloud-based tools, chatbots, sentiment analysis and audio capabilities. The project explores how technology can learn about individuals and help them learn about themselves and their career options. This career assessment tool is based on a new methodology and format, where free-form text (user generated content) produces stronger outputs than competitors. The platform enables continuous learning and reflection by systematizing coaching through a structured, iterative, ongoing process, leading to clarity and confidence in one's path.  The platform also guides users by releasing guidance and resources as the user is ready for it coupled with on-demand and real time support. Through data science, data visualization, and machine learning, the project will empower professionals to be thoughtful at every career step.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
