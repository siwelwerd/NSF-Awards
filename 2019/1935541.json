 "awd_abstract_narration": "Groundwater is an important resource for drinking water and food production. However, groundwater is being depleted across Earth. This conference is focused on the sustainability of heavily stressed groundwater resources. The conference provides a venue to discuss groundwater hydrology and groundwater supply and demand. The goal is to identify new pathways toward groundwater sustainability.  These pathways will incorporate water law, human-induced stresses, the protection of natural resources, and data analysis tools. The conference brings together a diverse group of researchers from the hydrology, law, economics, and social science communities. The conference emphasizes the active participation and involvement of early-career scientists and underrepresented scientists from the U.S., which is well-aligned with the NSF's goal of developing the next generation of scientists.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
