 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lia Medeiros is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to conduct a program of research and education at the Institute for Advanced Study.  She will use numerical simulations to fit high-resolution black hole images obtained with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and test how gravity is modified near a black hole, as predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity.  As a complementary test of general relativity, she will simulate electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave events such as black hole mergers, and she will use these simulations to predict signatures of merger events.  Alongside this research, she will develop hands-on educational activities for middle school students to improve their potential recruitment and retention in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).\r\n\r\nThe proposed research program seeks to advance our understanding of gravity using observations of black holes and electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational waves.  Medeiros proposes to test general relativity by comparing numerical ray tracing, radiative transfer, and general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations with observations.  She will use EHT observations to derive a set of general relativistic spacetime metrics that deviate from the standard Kerr metric.  She will also use time-dependent GRMHD simulations to generate images and spectra for comparison with observations of merger events.  The educational component of her work involves computer coding classes and enrichment activities for local middle school students, with an emphasis on increasing the participation of girls in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
