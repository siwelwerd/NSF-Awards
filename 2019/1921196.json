 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"Moving Towards Action\" workshop to improve the culture and climate in the mathematical sciences will take place in conjunction with the 2020 Joint Mathematics Meeting (JMM) in Denver, Colorado on Tuesday, January 14, 2020. When members of the mathematics community are made to feel unwelcome in our profession, the success of mathematics as a whole is put into jeopardy.  This workshop is focused on understanding and creating welcoming environments--providing actionable information and process change plans to mathematics department interested in driving cultural change at their respective institutions--so as to invite more people to enter and persist in STEM disciplines.\r\n \r\nThe approach proposed through this workshop will (1) establish the impacts of sexual harassment, how climate and policies can affect the prevalence of sexual harassment, and the recommendations for improving climate and institutional structures, based on the NASEM's Sexual Harassment of Women report; (2) provide guidance to define a desired workplace climate from an interpersonal perspective, and actions towards achieving awareness and adoption; (3) supply tools, techniques and training to respond to behaviors that undermine a welcoming environment; (4) present guidance in identifying gaps in university policies that drive unwanted behaviors and provide a recommended structure for responding when such issues are discovered; (5) initiate guided development of individual action plans for implementing change at participant's home institutions. These objectives will be reached through a variety of activities, including speakers, a panel, interactive bystander intervention training, and an optional poster presentation by the participants. In particular, speakers will include experts in organizational development and sexual harassment, professionals knowledgeable about best practices in policy implementation in academia, and an expert in defining and creating inclusive work environments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
