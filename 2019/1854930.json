 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Structure Dynamics and Mechanism (CSDM-A) program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Mark Ediger of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Professor Ranko Richert of Arizona State University are using sophisticated analysis tools to study glasses of organic molecules prepared inside a vacuum chamber. Glasses are common in everyday life with applications ranging from pharmaceuticals to engineering materials to cell phone displays. Even so, glasses have many properties that are not well understood. Professors Ediger and Richert are studying glasses made of simple molecules to serve as model systems to answer fundamental questions about glasses. Answering these questions can have an impact on glassy materials used in technology.  In this project, glasses are prepared directly from the vapor phase.  This project investigates unusual molecular systems that have two distinct liquid states to understand how this is possible and how it might be used to produce new materials. A second goal of this project is to understand how the method of preparing a glass can impact the mobility of molecules in the glass. There are advanced technologies such as quantum computing that can benefit from decreased mobility in glass. The students involved in this project are being trained in a wide variety of chemical and physical analysis tools which are used to characterize thin glassy films. The skills and tools learned are valuable in many areas of science and technology beyond the specific molecules studied in this project. In addition, Professor Ediger and his group participate in a Pre-college Enrichment Opportunity Program for Learning Excellence (PEOPLE)program at University of Wisconsin that encourages careers in science and engineering of high school students from underrepresented backgrounds. \r\n\r\nThe project focuses on glasses prepared by physical vapor deposition, a process known to create glasses with unusual properties. It is likely that physical vapor deposition may serve as a shortcut to the second liquid phase of triphenyl phosphite (TPP) and other systems. AC nanocalorimetry and spectroscopic ellipsometry are used to study the stability and density of the liquids prepared by this route. X-ray scattering is used to assess the structure of the liquids. This project also seeks to understand how physical vapor deposition affects intramolecular motions in the glassy state. Dielectric spectroscopy is used to study glasses of decahydroisoquinoline (DHIQ). DHIQ displays intramolecular degrees of freedom which can alter the dipole orientation even while the molecule is trapped in a glassy solid. Measurements of DHIQ and molecules with similar intramolecular degrees of freedom provide understanding about suppression of molecular motion in vapor-deposited glasses. This project may have a broad impact on the improvement of amorphous materials used in organic electronics, since the molecules studied here serve as model systems for those materials. In addition to the aforementioned training in advanced measurement techniques and glassy organic systems, the students funded by this project also lead a summer chemistry education program in broadening participation of under-represented groups in STEM disciplines.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSupercooled liquids and glasses are an important frontier for chemistry and physics. While the formation of crystals is relatively well-understood, the formation of glass is complex and many different theories have been proposed.  On the practical side, glasses are important materials. Technologically important organic glasses include high molecular weight polymers such as \"plexiglass\" and epoxy glasses that allow the production of the Boeing 787 aircraft.  Several drugs are marketed as glassy solids because this form has higher bioavailability. Organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) used in most cell phone displays have thin films of vapor-deposited glasses of organic semiconductors as the active materials.

If we can use improved understanding to develop glasses with improved properties, this will enable new applications.  Thus research on supercooled liquids and glasses is at the intersection of basic science and materials of practical interest.\n\nFor this project, glasses and supercooled liquids prepared by physical vapor deposition (PVD) were investigated.  PVD can prepare glasses with very high kinetic stability (\"stable glasses\") and PVD also provides a useful way to prepare polyamorphic liquids. Polyamorphism is defined as the existence of at least two amorphous states with the same composition, with a first-order transition between the amorphous states. \n\nThe major results of this grant are summarized as follows:  1) PVD glasses of ethylbenzene that are very near the \"ideal glass\" state were prepared.  As glasses are not in equilibrium, they slowly evolve towards lower energy states in a process called physical aging.  The ideal glass is the lowest energy state which is not crystalline, and this state has not been possible to produce with any other method.  These new results on ethylbenzene support theories for glass formation that emphasize this ideal glass state.  2) Fast surface dynamics were directly observed during preparation of a PVD glass.  The unique properties of PVD glasses all stem from the fast dynamics of molecules at the surface of the glass during deposition.  For the first time, these dynamics could be observed in real time as the deposition proceeded.  3) Apparently polyamorphous states of 2-methyltetrahydrofuran have been observed.  Depending upon deposition conditions, liquids with more than two distinct relaxation times have been prepared.  The origin of this very unusual behavior is not yet clear.  \n\nIn addition, personnel supported by this award participated in educational outreach activities, including a two-week summer program for high school students from underrepresented groups. During the early parts of the COVID pandemic, when in-person outreach activities were not possible,  personnel supported by this grant helped to prepare \"at home science\" videos that are being used by the general public. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/21/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark D Ediger"
