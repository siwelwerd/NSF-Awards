 "awd_abstract_narration": "Supported by the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Matthew Reid and his students are studying interactions between inorganic arsenic and dissolved organic matter (DOM).  DOM is a complex mixture of biomolecules derived from plant residues and microorganisms, and is an important component of all natural environments.  DOM binds arsenic to form dissolved complexes with significantly different properties than unbound inorganic arsenic molecules. These reactions influence arsenic concentration in water and uptake into plants, with important implications for human exposure to arsenic, a human carcinogen.  However, the functional groups of DOM that react with arsenic are poorly understood.  In this project, researchers explore how the structure of DOM affects its reactivity with arsenic, and evaluate how arsenic-DOM binding influences arsenic behavior in soils.  Throughout this research, undergraduate and graduate students are trained in experimental methods and characterization techniques to address fundamental problems in environmental chemistry.  A graduate student is partnering with outreach staff from the Cayuga Nature Center to develop hands-on activities with a portable X-ray fluorescence instrument.  This outreach strengthens the student's science communication skills and engages high school teachers and the public with soil chemistry topics of societal importance.   \r\n\r\nIn this project, standard humic substances as well as hydrophobic and hydrophilic DOM fractions isolated from wetland soils with a range of sulfur concentrations are reacted with arsenite (As(III)) in order to explore As(III)-DOM coordination reactions.  In the first phase of the research, wet chemical analysis and synchrotron-based XAS are integrated with laboratory dialysis equilibrium experiments to quantify conditional distribution coefficients, characterize sulfur speciation in DOM, and determine the As coordination environment in DOM-bound As.  In the second phase of the research, impacts of As(III) binding by DOM on As(III) oxidation kinetics via abiotic and microbial pathways are evaluated using laboratory batch studies.  These research activities are designed to test the hypothesis that thiol functional moieties are high-affinity binding sites for As(III), and that As(III) bound with thiol functionalities in DOM will be stabilized in its trivalent oxidation state during oxidizing conditions.  Research outcomes are expected to improve geochemical modeling of As speciation in DOM-rich environments and provide new insight into arsenic oxidation reactions in redox dynamic environments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The mobility, fate, and toxicity of As in the environment can be affected by As interactions with organic matter (OM), but the mechanisms and impacts of these As-OM interactions require further study before predictions can be made about how variations in OM quantity and quality in the environment impact the risk that As exposure presents to human and ecosystem health. The objective of this project was to elucidate mechanisms for complexation of arsenite  the most common inorganic from of As in anaerobic environments  with dissolved organic matter (DOM), specifically thiol functional groups in DOM. We then sought to understand how these arsenite-DOM interactions impacted arsenic bioavailability and (bio)transformation in the environment, with a focus on rice paddy soil systems. We collaborated with microbiologists to develop and test several types of arsenic biosensors, engineered E. coli that fluoresce when they take up arsenite into their cells. Biosensor fluorescence provides a quantitative measure of arsenite uptake, and we used this tool to quantify how different forms of DOM impacted microbial arsenite uptake. We combined these biosensor experiments with chemical measurements of arsenite-DOM complexation using dialysis equilibrium techniques and synchrotron-based spectroscopy of As-DOM complexes, providing complementary chemical and biological measurements of how DOM quantity and quality impact arsenite behavior.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nExperimental results confirmed that sulfur (S)-rich DOM complexes a larger fraction of arsenite than S-poor DOM, supporting a role of thiol function groups in complexing DOM. EXAFS spectroscopy of arsenite bound to humic acid confirmed that As associated with humic acid molecules was bound to S. Greater complexation of As with DOM decreased the biouptake of As, confirming that As bound to DOM has lower bioavailability than uncomplexed free As. The research also examined the role of ferrous and ferric iron (Fe) on the formation of colloidal Fe-DOM-As complexes, showing that Fe(III), but not Fe(II), enhanced As complexation with DOM colloids. Some of the first biosensor-based results from this work showed that DOM decreased microbial bio-uptake of As, but the amount of the decrease was greater than what would be expected based on complexation with thiol-containing sites in DOM alone. This sparked a new line of research into how DOM impacts microbial uptake of As through mechanisms other than As-DOM complexation. This led to a novel demonstration of a carbon catabolite repression (CCR) mechanism controlling microbial As uptake, with impacts on arsenic biomethylation efficiencies. Arsenite is taken up into bacterial cells through GlpF, an aquaglyceroporin channel for uptake of glycerol and other low molecular-weight organics. The uptake and subsequent biotransformation of arsenite are therefore linked to the bacterial utilization of organics. The arsenic biosensor assay demonstrated that arsenite uptake was repressed in the presence of glucose and environmental dissolved organic matter (DOM) isolates, and RT-qPCR analysis of glpF expression linked the decrease in arsenite uptake at higher carbon concentrations to the repression of glycerol-transporting GlpF channels rather than complexation.

This result is consistent with current CCR theories that upper glycolytic substrates repress the uptake of glycerol. These results provide a new paradigm for understanding how DOM impacts arsenic methylation in the environment, challenging the conventional understanding that greater DOM should enhance methylation by fueling greater microbial activity. Instead, our results indicate that higher concentrations of certain forms of carbon  specifically sugars  will repress arsenic methylation by decreasing cellular uptake of arsenite through GlpF channels. This effect may occur simultaneously with a decrease in As uptake caused by arsenite complexation with S-rich DOM, and the combination of chemical and biological tools developed here was necessary to disentangle these distinct mechanisms. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThis project provided training to three graduate students in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Cornell University on chemical and biological characterization of arsenic in complex environmental matrices.

PI Reid partnered with the Museum of the Earth, part of the Paleontological Research Institute (PRI), to participate in two Meet the Scientist events sponsored by PRI. PI Reid conducted demonstrations with a portable X-ray fluorescence (XRF) instrument owned by PRI to determine the elemental composition of materials including fossils, painted household objects, rocks, batteries, and consumer electronics. The demonstrations included an overview of how XRF spectra are related to atomic structure, and reached approximately 50 museum visitors. PI Reid also created visual aides that the museum will use in future demonstrations.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/06/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MatthewCReid\n"
