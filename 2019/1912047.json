This archaic teaching method is seen by many of today&rsquo;s learners as dull, uninteresting, unmotivating, and unengaging, which are contributing factors to their lack of persistence in introductory STEM classes in higher education. With support from the National Science Foundation, an interdisciplinary team of Faculty Investigators consisting of Engineers, Mathematicians, and Scientists at Tuskegee University committed themselves to addressing these ubiquitous set of challenges that are impacting Colleges and Universities by developing instructional strategies that are based on immersive Virtual Reality (VR). This technology is very prevalent in other sectors. For example, the skills-training sector of engineering utilizes immersive VR to provide realistic training environments for workers to learn and enhance their skills such as assembly and disassembly of complex equipment and fault diagnosis. The entertainment industry has demonstrated its effectiveness in engaging audiences through thrilling experiences. The use of immersive VR technology was therefore identified by the Faculty Investigators as being promising for students&rsquo; skills-building in STEM as well as engaging students in the learning process. In the VR environment, the teachers&rsquo; instruction is supplemented by VR-based lessons. Students wear headsets that provide a 3-D environment where they can explore STEM concepts through interactive animations. The pace of the learning process is controlled by the students who get instant feedback on how well they are doing. Follow-up discussions amongst the student peers and the instructor are designed to further clarify STEM topics being addressed by the VR-based lessons.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Investigators focused on the development of VR-based lessons in over 20 undergraduate STEM core courses in the following five disciplines: Biology, Mathematics, Physics, Aerospace Engineering, and Electrical Engineering. With recommendations from Undergraduate Teaching Assistants (UTAs) majoring in these disciplines and who were financially supported by the project, VR-based lessons were created for six STEM concepts per discipline that students historically have found challenging to master. Working collaboratively, investigators and UTAs ensured that all thirty (30) VR-based lessons were designed to promote deep engagement of learners during the classroom instruction process as a strategy to foster active learning through an immersive experience. All 30 VR-based lessons that users experience on their VR headsets follow a uniform format: 1) A first scene that serves as an overview of the topic and provides navigation instructions; 2) Additional scenes that introduce the concept, definitions, equations, examples, and animations; 3) Scenes that show examples where the concept being illustrated through VR is applied in real-world contexts; and, 4) Scenes that are dedicated for users to self-assess their understanding of the STEM lessons they experience within the VR environment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Assessment of VR-based lessons by users reveals that these resources have strong potential to provide an improved learning experience of STEM topics over traditional instructional strategies. Over 1,000 students provided feedback related to the VR-based lessons that were implemented in the target STEM disciplines from 2020 through 2023. Students reported increased academic efficacy, more positive perceptions related to the value of the courses, and greater benefits associated with VR technology. Using a 5-point response scale (5 being in strong agreement and 1 being in strong disagreement), student responses averaged 3.90 for perceived VR outcomes, 4.11 for overall course value, and 4.16 for academic efficacy. After using VR lessons, students consistently indicated positive gains from the experience. They reported that they were motivated to learn as much as they could, that the course content would be useful for their future career, and that they were interested in taking other courses that used VR technology. After the implementation of the VR-based lessons, the students also reported that they are more interested in a STEM-related career, and they have more confidence in completing a degree in the STEM field.</p>\n<p>Feedback on the VR lessons was also provided by the faculty instructors for the courses in the target STEM areas. They reported that students were motivated to learn, improved their knowledge, had confidence in their comprehension, and had a better understanding of the course concept presented with VR.</p>\n<p>The design, development, and implementation of VR-based lessons in introductory-level college STEM courses also brought to the forefront unique challenges. The investigators observed that the use of VR in the learning environment required a careful selection of topics as every topic may not be amenable to fully utilizing the affordances of VR. The project also illuminated the critical aspects of user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) as important additional dimensions of instructional design for a VR-based lesson.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/03/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Chadia&nbsp;Affane Aji</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1912047/1912047_10622587_1696361551983_Students-OculusVR-pic1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1912047/1912047_10622587_1696361551983_Students-OculusVR-pic1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Students - Oculus VR Goggles - pic1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1912047/1912047_10622587_1696361551983_Students-OculusVR-pic1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Students - Oculus VR Goggles - pic1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students experiencing Oculus VR Goggles</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tuskegee University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Chadia&nbsp;Affane Aji</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Students - Oculus VR Goggles - pic1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1912047/1912047_10622587_1696361853056_Students-OculusVR-pic2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1912047/1912047_10622587_1696361853056_Students-OculusVR-pic2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Students - Oculus VR Goggles - pic2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1912047/1912047_10622587_1696361853056_Students-OculusVR-pic2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Students - Oculus VR Goggles - pic2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">VR implementation using Oculus VR Goggles</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tuskegee University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Chadia&nbsp;Affane Aji</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Students - Oculus VR Goggles - pic2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1912047/1912047_10622587_1696362233756_Students-ClassVR-pic3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1912047/1912047_10622587_1696362233756_Students-ClassVR-pic3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Students - ClassVR Goggles - pic3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1912047/1912047_10622587_1696362233756_Students-ClassVR-pic3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Students - ClassVR Goggles - pic3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">VR implementation using ClassVR Goggles</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tuskegee University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Chadia&nbsp;Affane Aji</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Students - ClassVR Goggles - pic3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1912047/1912047_10622587_1696362299623_Students-ClassVR-pic4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1912047/1912047_10622587_1696362299623_Students-ClassVR-pic4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Students - ClassVR Goggles - pic4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1912047/1912047_10622587_1696362299623_Students-ClassVR-pic4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Students - ClassVR Goggles - pic4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">VR implementation using ClassVR headsets</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tuskegee University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Chadia&nbsp;Affane Aji</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Students - ClassVR Goggles - pic4</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
