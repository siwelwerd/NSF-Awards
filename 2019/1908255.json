 "awd_abstract_narration": "A typical starting point for a financial model takes an asset price as given and manipulates it to determine results.  A less studied path asks what makes an asset pricing model good, and where do such good models come from?  Equilibrium theory studies the formation of asset pricing models at a fundamental level where an economy's total supply meets its total demand. This award will study two overarching equilibrium projects set in incomplete settings, where not all risk can be captured by trading.  The projects use mathematical tools that are now within reach to describe equilibrium-based \"good\" models involving (i) the formation of interest rates, and (ii) the formation of stock prices in the presence of proportional transaction costs.  Both interest rates and transaction costs are highly relevant to financial markets but currently poorly understood in incomplete equilibrium settings. The award will involve collaborations and the involvement and training of graduate students. \r\n\r\nThis award will study two related problems involving equilibrium of stochastic systems in mathematical finance.  The first goal is to prove the existence of a finite-agent Radner equilibrium in incomplete market models with stochastic interest rates and proportional transaction costs.  After obtaining existence, the investigator will analyze the effects of incompleteness on the endogenously determined asset prices.  Mathematically, the analysis draws from systems of fully coupled quadratic backward stochastic differential equations (BSDE), which are doubly reflective in the case of transaction costs.  Existence results for such BSDE systems are nonconstructive, which complicates the analysis of incompleteness effects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project studied problems in mathematical finance related to financial equilibrium theory. Financial equilibrium theory determines prices of traded securities and strategies for utility-maximizing agents when the agents interact through the clearing of supply and demand. The agents make decisions in random environments, and so stochastic analysis was heavily involved in this work.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main contributions of this project were to prove the existence of financial equilibria in two main settings: settings with proportional transaction costs, and incomplete market settings with running consumption. Trading frictions, like proportional transaction costs, are ubiquitous in practice but difficult to implement mathematically in equilibrium. This project contributed to the understanding of frictions by studying a financial equilibrium model with two simultaneous frictions and by proving the existence of an equilibrium with proportional transaction costs and an arbitrary, finite number of agents. Both results were the first of their kind.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second setting considered incomplete financial markets and agents with running consumption optimization problems, which led to the study of stochastic interest rates in equilibrium. The main contribution was a variable reduction stemming from a traded annuity acting as a state process. The traded annuity allowed for the derivation of a characterizing system of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDE) for equilibrium. The existence of a solution to the coupled, quadratic BSDE system was established in two running consumption equilibrium frameworks, which proved the existence of an equilibrium.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe broader impacts of this project included mentoring of postdocs and organizing multiple conferences. The results of this project have been presented at multiple domestic and international research conferences and seminars and have been published in top tier mathematical finance journals.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: KimberlyWeston\n"
