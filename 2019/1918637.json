 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Arctic Research Consortium (ARCUS) of the U.S. will administer and implement \"STEM at the Poles\", a program that provides opportunities for U.S. educators to participate in cutting-edge field research with polar scientists in various, and often remote, locations in the Arctic and Antarctica. During this three-year project, thirty-six participants from the field of education, including eighteen U.S. middle and high school teachers and eighteen U.S. informal science educators (e.g. educators who work outside classrooms and who work with the public or middle and high school students and/or their teachers), will participate in a research experience with scientists in the Arctic and Antarctic. Through this unique experience, ARCUS will provide a professional development opportunity for both formal and informal educators where they will: (1) connect to the polar regions and the research community; (2) develop Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) resources that help advance the basic knowledge of polar regions across a variety of learning environments; and (3) change how they teach STEM in both informal and formal learning environments. The program will provide numerous opportunities for students and the public to learn about how polar research is conducted both in the Arctic and Antarctic and will help polar researchers learn to communicate more effectively with students and the public.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the goals of the program are as follows: (1) Improve educators' STEM content knowledge of the Polar Regions and the science conducted in these regions; (2) Increase educators' knowledge and use of STEM practices with their students in their learning setting; (3) Build educators' STEM identity; (4) Increase the STEM collaborations between formal and informal educators; (5) Increase students' understanding and engagement in the polar regions and interest in polar-related STEM careers; and (6) Develop long-term professional relationships between the education and research communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
