 "awd_abstract_narration": "Duquesne University is implementing a dedicated research network and Science DMZ for the facilitation of science-driven research, education and collaboration. A vibrant and growing Duquesne research community conducts leading edge research and scientific experimentation in a broad range of science domains. The campus network is unable to support the data-intensive workflows generated by the research community. While science drivers and research workflows vary, there is a common need for fast and unrestricted data movement to internal and external research computing resources. The research-focused Science DMZ cyberinfrastructure addresses the limitations of the general purpose network by establishing a dedicated, scalable and secure network that is optimized for data-intensive science workflows. \r\n \r\nThe project objective is to establish a dedicated 120Gbps Science DMZ network to support the Duquesne research community. A critical element of the Science DMZ is a Data Transfer Node (DTN). The DTN will provide University researchers with a secure, highly-available, high-performance data exchange point to facilitate the secure and efficient sharing of research data with collaborating institutions and national computational research facilities. The Science DMZ will connect to a dedicated 10Gbps uplink to the Pennsylvania-wide education and research computing network (KINBER).\r\n \r\nThe new friction-free cyberinfrastructure not only accelerates large scale data movement, it facilitates new and more efficient workflows resulting in the acceleration and advancement of scientific discovery. The research network improves opportunities to train the next generation of research scientists and to inspire underrepresented groups to participate in scientific research activities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
