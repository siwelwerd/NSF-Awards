 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports student travel for attending the 62nd Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems (MWCAS) to be held in Dallas, TX in August 2019. The MWCAS is a premier international conference in the field of circuits and systems. Other than tutorials, keynote and plenary lectures by leading experts in the field, the conference will be attended by academic and industry researchers and students to present their recent work both in lecture sessions and poster sessions. The conference will host a student paper competition to encourage the best students to keep abreast of the most modern technologies. Recipients of this grant will selected from the pool of those students presenting papers and will be paid part of their expenses for travel and registration at the conference. US citizens and permanent residents will be given the highest priority in the selection process. The experience gained by the students in the process is going to be an invaluable component of their education. Due to a good number industrial participants in the meeting the experience will also help them to secure positions in industry, thus contributing to the much needed technological workforce of the United States. The selection committee will pay due attention to include women, minority and other underrepresented groups for providing support from this grant.\r\n \r\nThe technical areas covered by the conference will, in general, be electronic circuits and systems relevant, among other problems, to modern computing hardware technologies. More specifically, the broad spectrum of topics to be covered will include, but will not be limited to: Analog and Mixed Signal Integrated Circuits, Bio-Inspired systems and Green Technologies, Neural Networks & Neuromorphic Engineering, Artificial Intelligence including Deep Learning and Robotics, Internet of Things (IoTs), Autonomous Systems, Radio Frequency Microwave and Optical Systems, Image/Video Processing and Multimedia Systems, Power Management Energy Harvesting and Wireless Power, Trusted Electronics and Security, MEMS and NEMS Technologies, Nano-electronics and Nanotechnology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project supported the participation of 36 students in the IEEE Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems (MWSCAS).  In contrast to related programs that support travel to attend a conference, this program supported students that were committed to participating in conference activities throughout the conference.  This participation included attending tutorials, making a technical presentation or presentations, attending technical sessions, and participating in social interactions with peers and leaders in the field throughout the conference.   Though under-represented groups are invariably in the minority at the MWSCAS, there were 9 under-represented recipients of these grants comprising 7 females and 3 ethnic minorities.\n\n \n\nThe MWSCAS is the oldest conference focusing on circuits and systems and also one of the most recognized, not only in the United States but across the globe.  Recipients had the opportunity to attend tutorials given by highly regarded leaders in the field.   The MWSCAS also is noted for having an outstanding technical program with technical presentations from many of the leading experts in the circuits and systems community intermixed with presentations by students that are often making their first technical presentations in the peer community.  Unique to the MWSCAS is the strong emphasis placed on creating a constructive environment whereby\n\nconstructive feedback is provided to participants by experts in the field.  The MWSCAS is also noted for providing an opportunity to establish personal interactions of those in attendance not only with their peers but with leaders in the field.  \n\n  The intellectual merit in this Conference Participation Grant is in providing an opportunity for recipients to share their research results with peers, to interact with their peers by attending technical presentations and workshops presented by leaders in the field, and by providing an opportunity for recipients to interact with recognized leaders in the field.\n\n The broader impact is primarily in helping recipients become engaged in professional activities as a part of the educational process, in establishing peer and professional contacts that can result in future collaboration, in sharing technical contributions with others in the field, and in learning of emerging trends from leaders in the discipline.  The broader impact also includes learning from the Wi-CAS part of the program that focuses on identifying outreach activities that are effective at enhancing ethnic and gender diversity in the circuits and systems field in particular and, more generally, in STEM disciplines.   In addition to sharing of information amongst participants that have the opportunity to attend the conference, the technical impact will be enhanced through the distribution of the proceedings of the conference in IEEE Xplore and through the publication of extended versions of the top papers in a special issue of the IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems that is devoted annually to this conference.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/02/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Randall L Geiger"
