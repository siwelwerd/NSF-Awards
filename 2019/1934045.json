 "awd_abstract_narration": "A variety of consumer products are manufactured by using solvents to deposit a thin polymer film on a surface, including anti-fouling coatings, membranes for water purification, and electronic devices. Solvent-based manufacturing processes are attractive because they are fast, inexpensive, and scalable to large areas. However, as the solvent evaporates, the polymers arrange themselves in ways that are difficult to predict or control. This collaborative research award develops new solvent-based manufacturing processes where different types of polymers are spontaneously sorted into layers according to their size and shape. This unique approach can be used to decouple the surface and bulk properties of the film, allowing for independent optimization of each attribute. Furthermore, the polymers can be degradable to facilitate their disassembly and recyclability. As a result, the principles established through this research can facilitate the development of high-performing polymer films for end-use applications in biomedical devices, desalination and filtration systems, and devices for clean energy, which greatly impacts society and the U.S. economy. Laboratory research engages graduate and undergraduate students and is complemented by education and outreach programs that include new modules for undergraduate and graduate courses at collaborating institutions; short courses and symposia for the broader scientific community; activities that teach science to the blind and visually impaired; and a student exchange program between the two institutions.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this collaborative research project is to develop solution deposition processes that produce vertical stratification of bottlebrush copolymers and linear homopolymers in thin films. The research tasks are designed to test the hypothesis that bottlebrush copolymers are entropically attracted toward the vapor-liquid interface, leading to \"bottlebrush-on-top\" stratification for a broad range of material chemistries and processing conditions. Importantly, by leveraging these entropic effects during processing, the bottlebrush copolymer additives can be synthesized with \"high energy\" polar, ionic and hydrogen-bonding moieties. Such chemistries are critical for tuning a range of surface and interfacial properties, including wettability, friction, fouling resistance, adhesion strength, degradability, conductivity, and stimuli-responsiveness. The research plan examines the interplay between materials design (polymer architecture, chemistry) and processing variables (evaporation rate, diffusion rates) on stratification profiles, using existing models for vertical stratification of colloidal particles to guide experimental design. The collaboration consists of synthesis of a set of bottlebrush copolymer additives and characterization of transport-related parameters. The systematic research plan involves preparation and characterization of 400 independent samples, evenly split between the two institutions. Significantly, the principles established by this research redefines what types of polymers are characterized as \"surface active\" and transforms current approaches to surface engineering in polymeric materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Examples of such processes include spray coating, spin casting, and roll-to-roll printing, and these are relevant to diverse applications including biomedical devices, batteries, and water treatment. Although simple to implement in practice, solution-based coating processes can be difficult to control because they involve the diffusion of particles and polymers along with solvent evaporation. Additionally, when solution-based processes are used to deposit a mixture of particles or polymers, the final coating can have the particles or polymers vertically stratified. In this project, we investigated solution-based processes for the deposition of polymer and particle blends to produce coatings with desired surface properties. To control the vertical stratification, we relied on a unique type of polymer known as bottlebrush polymers. Bottlebrush polymers are molecules that have the shape of bottle brushes, and this unique molecular shape or architecture leads to a number of unexpected and potentially useful properties. We found that during the deposition and solvent evaporation process, bottlebrush polymers would be attracted to and remain at the top surface of the coating. This provided a useful way to produce coatings with desired surface properties, and we showed that we could produce coatings varying widely in properties such as wettability using bottlebrush polymers. We could also use bottlebrush polymers which were reactive or stimuli-responsive, leading to coatings with properties that changed under different environmental conditions. We performed systematic studies to understand why bottlebrush polymers migrated to film surfaces and found that their migration was governed by a dynamic process during deposition and solvent evaporation which involved attraction of the bottlebrushes to the surface due to entropic effects. We showed that we could make films and fibers that were coated with bottlebrush polymers, and additionally we developed a new approach to make bottlebrush polymers which produces fully biodegradable materials, which is of interest for food packaging, drug delivery, and other applications. The characterization of the coatings and films was conducted using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), a powerful technique that can provide three-dimensional information on the structure and chemical properties of surfaces and coatings. The results of the research were shared with the research community through conference presentations, peer-reviewed publications, and department seminars at universities. As an example, the PI was invited to present his work as part of an American Chemical Society symposium focused on bottlebrush polymers. We also produced a review article that described the technique and provided examples of the application of ToF-SIMS to study surfaces and interfaces. We also implemented a variety of educational and outreach activities designed to complement the research goals. These included a group project on surface analysis for graduate students, mentoring of undergraduate researchers, student exchange between collaborating universities, a review article on the analysis of polymer surfaces, a webinar on surface analysis applied to polymers, and mentoring of high school teachers on a summer research project. Future work will focus on developing coatings based on bottlebrush polymers for fiber-based applications and implementing fully degradable bottlebrush polymers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/03/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Rafael&nbsp;Verduzco</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1934045/1934045_10628829_1683089115981_HanqingAwardDongjoo--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1934045/1934045_10628829_1683089115981_HanqingAwardDongjoo--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Undergraduate researcher Hanqing Wang with Graduate Student Dongjoo Lee\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1934045/1934045_10628829_1683089115981_HanqingAwardDongjoo--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Undergraduate researcher Hanqing Wang with Graduate Student Dongjoo Lee\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Hanqing Wang won the top poster prize in Engineering for her work on this project at the Rice Undergraduate Research Symposiums.
