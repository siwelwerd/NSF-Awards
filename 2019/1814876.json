 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cooperation forms the cornerstone for all successful social species from ants to humans.  Yet the emergence of cooperation and fairness in biological and social systems is one of the great puzzles.  How did it arise that humans often seek fair outcomes, when natural selection is inherently unfair?  Evolutionary game theory, a mathematical framework to capture the dynamics of decisions, provides some answers.  The theory finds applications in economics, military strategy, and biology.  This project develops a more extensive theory of distributed social learning and emergent group dynamics, combining aspects of evolutionary game theory with statistical mechanics and machine learning to explain the emergence of cooperation, fairness, and other social dynamics that do not fit well into traditional approaches.  The mathematical framework developed can be applied to problems in evolutionary psychology and artificial intelligence.  In particular, some results may help to inform policy makers on the origins of differing behaviors in different societies.  Graduate students are engaged in the research of the project.\r\n\r\nThis project develops a coherent theory of distributed social learning and emergent group phenomena in complex systems, merging aspects of evolutionary game theory with statistical mechanics and machine learning.  Using public goods games and ultimatum style games as a foundation, the investigators study the evolutionary dynamics of finite populations whose encounters are described in game-theoretic terms using simple parameterized rules and random interactions.  An aspect of these evolutionary systems is convergence to non-Nash fixed points, including a sensitive dependence on initial conditions and sample paths realized.  Basins of attraction for these fixed points are characterized using techniques from topological data analysis.  Using insights from statistical mechanics, the distributions of potential population fixed points are derived and related to the information content in the dynamical system; here the speed of spatial interactions plays a role analogous to that of temperature in a gas of interacting particles.  Possible equilibrium states in these dynamical systems are categorized, along with the corresponding equilibrium point distributions.  Quantifying information transfer among interacting or moving agents is an additional goal of the project.  So also is determining the impact of commoditized information, whether beneficial or harmful, on equilibrium distributions and convergence.  Graduate students are engaged in the research of the project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These are questions that mathematicians, biologists and ecologists have asked for years. In this research, we took a step toward answering some of these questions. Using tools and techniques from evolutionary game theory and statistical mechanics. Our work began with a simple premise: individuals in a social game will imitate those who have been successful in the past. Past success can be estimated by keeping a running total of the winnings of individual players in the game. Using this approach, we found that play in the ultimatum game in which strategy evolution was mediated by past winnings, resulted in increased cooperation, but that cooperation was negatively impacted when cost-of-living was considered. Put simply, individuals who imitate successful players tend to cooperate more, just in case the cost of living is not too high. When the cost-of-living becomes higher, individuals become more selfish and cooperation decreases. We use a similar approach in studying a spatial rock-paper-scissors game. When individuals were allowed to imitate successful strategies in their local neighborhood, we found, to our surprise, stable communities of rock, paper, and scissors formed. We also found that these communities are effectively walled off by individuals who have lower wealth accumulation as they live between multiple community environments. While, these results are preliminary in nature, they suggest a potential mechanism by which communities form in general. Like individuals who derive benefit from living next to each other form, small communities, and then insulate himself by building up wealth or energy, which is then used to keep outsiders away. The result is a kind of local freezing, that allows communities to develop. Using probability theory, we were able to prove that these communities had to form, and in fact, found sufficient conditions for them to freeze in place and additional sufficient conditions for them to effectively &ldquo;slosh&rdquo; around their environment. That is, we found conditions in which the payoff to the individuals in the game cause stable communities to form that drifted around the space rather than remaining in place. Further work on this topic suggests that it may be possible to analyze these behaviors using implicit differential equations and prove community formation emerges in a broader class of payoff matrices.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to this work on spatial community formation, we also studied the emergence of cooperation in minority games. A minority game is one in which payoff diminishes when too many players choose a specific strategy. In our research, we considered the Kolkata Paise Restaurant Problem, in which multiple individuals must choose among multiple restaurants, each of which can serve only one person. This is based on a real-world scenario in Kolkata, India. When two or more individuals arrive at the same restaurant, only one can eat. This creates a natural resource utilization problem, in which the goal is to allow as many individuals to eat simultaneously as possible. In general, if all agents choose a restaurant randomly, about 63% of the population will eat at any given time. By introducing dining clubs in which individuals agree or cooperate and go to separate restaurants, we showed that the probability of eating increases for an individual in the dining club, and more importantly, we show that if the idea of the dining club spread, according to an evolutionary dynamic that joining a dining club becomes the dominant strategy. We then considered a situation, in which individuals in the dining club, were taxed with that tax translated into a cumulative pot for feeding those individuals who were unlucky enough to go to a restaurant occupied by a member of the non-dining club population. Interestingly, we show that when members of the non-club population are allowed to cheat and freeload (or steal) food from the dining club, then the resulting stable strategy of joining the dining club became unstable for certain levels of cheating. This shows an interesting result: cooperative groups can be evolutionarily stable as long as the outside costs from individuals not part of the group (cheaters), the environment and those costs associated with being inside the group do not outweigh the corresponding benefits from group membership. Well, this does not explain the emergence of multicellular organisms in a complex biological setting, it does provide a simplistic model that emulates some of their properties, leading to broader impacts for this research.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/01/2024<br>\nModified by: Christopher&nbsp;H&nbsp;Griffin</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
