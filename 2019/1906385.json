 "awd_abstract_narration": "Minimal surfaces are shapes in equilibria first studied by Lagrange in the 1700s.  Such surfaces locally minimize area and thus are in a sense optimal and ubiquitous - in chemistry, materials science, biology and general relativity (where they model apparent horizons of black holes).   In mathematics, they have been used more recently to solve problems in Geometry and Topology, such as in the proof of the Poincare conjecture.  The PI will study the construction, properties and applications of minimal surfaces in three-dimensional spaces.  A central problem is to understand the geometry and topological type of the minimal surfaces one can obtain.  In topology, a question asked by J.W. Alexander in 1932 is to find all the ways to divide a three-dimensional space into two pieces of a simpler type.  Minimal surfaces can be used as canonical surfaces to find such splittings.  The PI will also study related problems arising from variational principles, for instance the problem of Arnold which asks to find closed orbits of a particle subject to a magnetic field.  In addition to this research, the PI will focus on teaching and training of undergraduate and graduate students as well as advancing the field by organizing seminars, conferences and writing expository materials.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore precisely, the objectives of this project are to develop new techniques to study minimal surfaces arising from the smooth min-max theory of Simon-Smith.    When minimal surfaces are constructed from multi-parameter sweep-outs, a basic and important open problem is whether they come with integer multiplicities.  The PI will work to show that the multiplicities are generically equal to one in the smooth setting.  One goal in this direction is to prove the Lusternick-Schnirelman Conjecture that every Riemannian three-sphere contains at least four embedded minimal two-spheres.  Such work requires developing quantitative versions of topological theorems, such as Cerf's theorem.  The PI will also use minimal surfaces to continue the study of classifying Heegaard splittings of three-manifolds.  The PI will also investigate related variational problems involving mean curvature such as obtaining the existence of closed curves of constant curvature on Riemannian two-spheres, a problem originating from physics and dynamical systems.  The techniques to be employed in these projects combine ideas from low-dimensional topology, analysis, Morse theory, and minimal surface theory.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nMinimal surfaces, which are generalizations of soap films, model spaces in equilibrium and have applications in fields as disparate as materials science, biology, and general relativity. The PI continued his study of such surfaces and found new applications to geometric and topological problems. Together with collaborators he proved Pitts-Rubinsteins 1983 conjecture asserting that, roughly speaking, a surface that divides a three-dimensional space into two parts in the simplest possible way can be represented by a minimal surface. The PI later applied the study of minimal tori to prove the Smale conjecture for many manifolds. This conjecture asserts that the space of diffeomorphisms of a three-manifold retracts on its much more rigid isometry group.The Smale conjecture was proved by Hatcher for the three-sphere in 1982, but the case of RP^3 that the PI addressed had been open for nearly 40 years (proved a few years before using Ricci flow).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIn other directions, the PI extended his work on equivariant constructions of minimal surfaces to find examples of non-compact self-shrinkers which exhibit the phenomenon of fattening, meaning that the mean curvature flow develops non-uniqueness in finite time. Whether this ever happens was asked in the 1990s by De Giorgi. At the same time that the PI completed this work, Ilmanen-White proved similar results using new developments in the mean curvature flow. The PIalso introduced two-parameter sweep-outs of manifolds which ``flip the manifold and give rise to index 2 minimal surfaces. As a consequence of this work, he showed the number of minimal surfaces of genus g in the round three-sphere tends to infinity as g does. Later, several other authors extended these results to find even more minimal surfaces of each genus. Finally, with a collaborator the PI showed that convex balls with generic metrics contain three minimal free boundary disks. Such a result is sharp on ellipsoids in the Euclidean space, and the proof combined methods of mean curvature flow with min-max theory.\r\n\n\nIn addition to advancing the PIs research and collaborations, the grant also helped support the PIs three graduate students. One of these students is already going on to a postdoctoral position. The PI organized several NSF-sponsored conferences at Rutgers which included mini-courses to help educate the next generation of students in geometric analysis. He also delivered an eight lecture minicourse at the first European School of Differential geometry. \r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/03/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DanielJKetover\n"
