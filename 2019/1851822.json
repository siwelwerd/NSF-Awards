 "awd_abstract_narration": "Montana State University (MSU) will offer a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Program in solar and space physics. Students will conduct cutting-edge research in solar and space physics, to investigate how magnetic fields evolve on the Sun and release a large amount of energy into heliosphere, which may impact the space weather. Student research frequently results in joint professional publications and conference presentations with their MSU mentors. Students will also take introductory courses in solar physics, and tutorials in computer programming, ethics in research, and preparation and application for graduate schools. These experiences will help students develop independence, creativity, and interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) fields, strengthen practical research skills and communication skills, and make educated decisions on whether to attend the graduate school and to pursue research as a profession. The program provides an important service to the solar astrophysics discipline. With its strong space science component, the program also offers benefits to society by providing citizens and future researchers with an understanding of space weather impacts on Earth's space environment. The program is dedicated to education and training of a diverse work force in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThe main objectives of this REU program are: 1) provide a high-quality state-of-the-art research experience, 2) develop independence, creativity, and interest in physics and astronomy graduate school, 3) demonstrate how academic knowledge acquired in classes relates to real-world research problems, 4) develop and strengthen practical research skills and 5) encourage participation by women and underrepresented minorities in scientific research.  Students will carry out individual research projects for ten weeks during the summer, under the supervision of the faculty and research staff and in collaboration with the graduate students at MSU. The research projects will involve the analysis of the state-of-the-art observations from space missions and ground-based observatories, magneto-hydrodynamic modeling, as well as space hardware instrumentation. The target group of the program includes undergraduates majoring in Physics, Astronomy, Mathematics, Engineering, and Computer Sciences. The program strongly encourages participation by underrepresented groups in STEM fields and students with little access to research opportunities. This project is jointly funded by the AGS REU program (Educational Linkages), the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Solar Terrestrial program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
