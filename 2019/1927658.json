 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for travel support for young participants attending the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM) Symposium on Shape Memory Alloys, being held in Austin, Texas, from April 28 through May 2, 2019.\r\n\r\nThe Symposium will bring together scientists from very diverse backgrounds who work on different aspects of foam mechanics in order to present their work to researchers with whom they do not usually interact. The intellectual growth that results from the interactions and cross-fertilization of ideas and approaches that take place at the symposium should be a lasting experience to all attendees. The symposium will include graduate students, post-docs and young researchers who will benefit by their interaction with the best researchers in the mechanics of shape memory alloys in the world. The lectures will be video taped and be available for viewing by anyone at a dedicated website.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
