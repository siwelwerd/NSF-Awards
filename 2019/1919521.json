The request includes part-support for facility usage. The goal of the symposium is to cover state-of-the-art developments in controlling polymer structures and understanding structure property relationships to achieve novel macromolecular designs and precisely controlled materials properties and functions. There will be 34 speakers (16-US, 17-Japan) half among them world leaders in their fields and the other half younger rising stars. A total attendee of 50 is anticipated,the planned small number intended to ensure rigorous interactions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The poster session was overwhelmingly praised by all the symposium participants (speakers, observers, and industry sponsors) and student presenters. The poster session provided the students an invaluable opportunity to discuss their polymer research with academic and industrial researchers from both countries.
