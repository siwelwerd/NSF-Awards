 "awd_abstract_narration": "The engineering of microbial cells through synthetic biology promises to advance the production of high-volume commodity chemicals such as biopolymers, fuels, nutraceuticals, therapeutics, and other specialty products. Increasing understanding of metabolic and regulatory networks underlying microbial physiology hinges on developing metabolic models that capture enzymatic cellular activity. Despite significant progress in sequencing technology and model reconstruction, there are many cellular enzymatic activities that remain unknown. The hypothesis underlying this project is that undocumented promiscuous activity of enzymes results in the formation of unexpected reaction byproducts. This phenomenon is frequently observed by synthetic biologists, and sometimes exploited during design through ad hoc experimental efforts. However, there are currently limited ways to predict, analyze, or mitigate the effects of enzyme promiscuity. \r\n\r\nThis project develops tools to predict stoichiometrically balanced reactions that reflect undocumented promiscuous enzymatic cellular activities. These reactions can be utilized to augment existing metabolic models and improve design tools. Further, the project experimentally validates the augmented models by engineering a microbial host to synthesize desirable chemicals and then analyzing host-pathway interactions. The proposed work is at the intersection of computer science and biology and will advance the ability to predict and assess the impact of enzyme promiscuity on biological systems. Training will be provided to graduate and undergraduate students and the research will be incorporated into classroom teaching. Underrepresented minorities in computing will be recruited to participate in the research through various established national and local programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

As current knowledge about enzyme promiscuity is limited, the objective of this proposal is to advance computational tools to analyze the promiscuity of enzymes within natural and engineered biological systems. The impact of these tools is to advance our understanding of cellular metabolism and guide experimental works, thus advancing applications related to energy production and biological discovery. Several computational models were developed. A deep-learning model, termed ELP - Enzymatic Link Prediction, is developed to predict an enzymatic link between two compounds. A deep-learning hierarchical classifier, termed EPP -- Enzyme Promiscuity Prediction, is designed to predict enzyme classes that can act on a query molecule. A deep-learning recommender systems, termed Boost-RS, is developed to find enzymes that act on query substrates, or substrates that interact with query enzymes. A multi-view contrastive learning model, termed Contrastive Data Stratification for Interaction Prediction (CSI), is used to predict substrate-enzyme prediction likelihood. A deep-learning method, SIGMA, is developed to align molecule graphs, a task needed to extract transformation rules between substrate and products.
