 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Distributed Arrays of Small Instruments (DASI) project will support the development of a network of Personal Space Weather Stations (PSWS).  The PSWS is a ground-based, modular, multi-instrument system capable of remote sensing the geospace system. This project is to develop a protoype of an integrated PSWSS which will initially consist of a radio receiver instrument, a ground magnetometer, and a central computer. The modular nature of the system will allow for the later addition of new instruments. This prototype is being developed in collaboration between multiple universities and the ham radio community through the Ham Radio Science Citizen Investigation (HamSCI) collective and the TAPR amateur radio engineering organization, who would eventually host instruments at their local sites. A primary goal of the PSWS project is to make it affordable to individuals. In this way, the PSWS network of instruments is easily expandable and can grow organically by engaging the general public. At the same time, stations can also be sited and managed by professional institutions, guaranteeing required coverage. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the PSWS is to collect data on variety of phenomena - Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances and ionospheric absorption events, geomagnetic storms and substorms, magnetospheric ultra low frequency (ULF) pulsations, and geomagnetically-induced currents (GICs). TIDs exist over such large spatial scales that it is currently impossible to track them from source to dissipation. There is a significant lack of data on local effects of geomagnetic storms as well. The PSWS addresses this through the development of instrumentation that can easily be deployed internationally.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Both of these tasks were accomplished. The map (Map.png) shows the radios so far deployed in the U.S. (accessible at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pswsnetwork.caps.ua.edu/\">https://pswsnetwork.caps.ua.edu</a>&nbsp;).

In the image (S-Curve.png) we can see the characteristic &ldquo;S-curve&rdquo; captured by the station of W2NAF in Pennsylvania, where the shadow of the moon passes between WWV and the receiving station, creating a dip and then a rise in the received frequency of WWV. Remarkably, virtually all the stations active on that day observed a similar curve, even ones far away from the path of totality (e.g., in Canada, Florida and even in the Netherlands).</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">In more recent work, improved radios have been developed by the team; these allow collection of wider bandwidth and multiple frequency bands.

In more recent work, scientists have used the data collected by the PSWS system to calculate how Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances (TIDs) move across the continent with an eye toward better understanding what causes these waves in plasma density.
