 "awd_abstract_narration": "Every two years, the Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference brings together leading members of the scientific community, graduate students, postdocs, and early career scientists to discuss new, cutting-edge research projects in marine chemistry within an informal setting. The National Science Foundation, along with the Gordon Research Conference, will co-sponsor the participation of at least 35 graduate students/postdocs/early career scientists and 50 invited speakers/discussion leaders/chairs to the 2019 Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference. \r\n\r\nIn 2019, the Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference will be held July 14-19, 2019 at Holderness School in Holderness, New Hampshire. The theme for the conference will be \"Discovering Chemical Processes and Mechanisms in a Changing Ocean? and aims to refocus our attention on the fundamentals by discovering chemical processes and mechanisms in a changing ocean\".  The primary goal of the conference is to provide a forum that brings together scientists that are leading contributors in the field of marine chemistry along with graduate students and postdocs to exchange ideas on new, innovative research.  Presentations and discussions at the 2019 Gordon Conference will center around the following session topics: (1) Biogeochemistry at Environmental Interfaces; (2) Biogeochemical Signatures and Processes; (3) Reaction Rates in the Oceans; (4) Trace Metal Biogeochemistry and Marine Bioinorganic Chemistry; (5) Connecting Biochemical Processes to Global Biogeochemistry; (6) Complex Chemical Characterizations and Novel Instrumentation Applications; (7) The Biogeochemistry and Geochemistry of Sedimentary Environments; (8) Late-Breaking Topics; and (9) Chemical Signatures across Space and Time.  The Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference has become recognized as an important venue to exchange ideas in the interdisciplinary field of marine chemistry and to forge new scientific alliances.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
