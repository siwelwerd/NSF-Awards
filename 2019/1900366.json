 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemical Catalysis Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry is supporting the research of Professor Daniel Weix at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Dr. Eric Hansen at Pfizer to explore new methods to find better catalysts for chemical reactions. Metal-catalyzed reactions are the key to improving the stewardship of the U.S.'s vast petrochemical resources and to discovering innovative, new medicines. Existing technology is based around scarce metals, such as palladium and rhodium, but recent developments with more earth-abundant metals, such as nickel, copper, and iron, show great promise. Unfortunately, there are currently few catalysts based around these more environmentally friendly and less expensive metals. This industrial-academic partnership is discovering new catalysts by mining an untapped resource, pharmaceutical compound libraries. Using these libraries of knowledge, the team is mining data to find new catalysts and to gather information on what properties make a good catalyst. Analysis of the collected data by researchers at Pfizer and UW-Madison, with the assistance of Professor Matthew Sigman at the University of Utah, guides the prediction of new catalysts and catalyst selection. The newly discovered catalysts are being made available to researchers through a partnership with Millipore-Sigma. This combination of experimental and computational training is preparing students to advance the use of data science in chemistry, an area that is rapidly growing in importance. This training includes students who are currently underrepresented in chemistry through partnerships with existing and new UW-Madison programs: the Chemistry Opportunities Program, Partners for Graduate School Experience in Chemistry, and the American Chemical Society BRIDGE to the Doctorate program.\r\n\r\nThe UW-Madison team, led by Professor Weix, and the Pfizer team, led by Dr. Hansen, are systematically searching the very large Pfizer compound library for new ligands using an iterative experimental and computational approach inspired by fragment-based drug discovery. The goals of this collaboration are to discover new privileged ligands and to develop broadly applicable parameters and models. Diverse potential ligands sourced from the compound library are being screened against known reactions with different metal and ligand requirements to find new ligand core structures. These core structures are then being optimized using conventional methods. The data gathered is analyzed, in collaboration with Professor Sigman, to provide an understanding of which properties (if any) are universal for useful ligands and to predict improved ligands. The impacts of this this research program extend to the development of new ligands and versatile ligand precursors that are immediately made commercially available from Millipore-Sigma.  The research may also result in better parameters and models that are useful for constructing a more diverse array of ligand types.  The large data sets are helpful for developing new computational approaches made available through data repositories.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

While metal-catalyzed reactions are the key to maintaining U. S. competitiveness in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, existing technology is based around scarce metals, such as palladium and rhodium. Recent developments with more abundant metals, such as nickel, copper, and iron, show great promise, but there are relatively few catalysts based around these metals. This academic / industrial partnership between the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Pfizer explored the use of pharmaceutical compound libraries as a new source of potential catalysts and how some of the latest developments in computational tools could accelerate the discovery process (<strong>Figure 2</strong>). This latter work was supported by a collaboration with Prof. Matthew Sigman at the University of Utah, an expert in these tools. These efforts have resulted in a number of publications, two in print and several more in process, that resulted in two key findings.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it was found that the discovery of new catalysts from compound libraries could be accelerated by the use of simple computational tools (<strong>Figure 3</strong>). This is a useful finding because screening compound libraries, while easier than de novo synthesis of compounds, is still the slow step in catalyst discovery. It was not obvious that simple DFT-derived features would help in catalyst discovery because catalyst success depends upon a wide array of balanced (even opposing) qualities. Our study showed that using data derived from a small &ldquo;gauge screen&rdquo; of catalysts for a reaction, finding a correlation among those catalysts, and then using that correlation to select catalysts either qualitatively or quantitatively resulted in a much higher rate of success. More catalysts can be found with less work! Using this approach, we discovered two new catalysts that are very good for a challenging, pharmaceutically-important chemical reaction. These results are summarized in Figure 2 and reported in&nbsp;<em>J. Am. Chem. Soc.</em>&nbsp;<strong>2024</strong>,&nbsp;<em>146</em>, 6947-6954. This research resulted in new catalysts as well as a lower-cost approach to catalyst discovery from compound libraries.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the team found that computational tools could be used to predict the performance of potential catalysts and we used this approach to discover the best catalyst known for several reactions (<strong>Figure 4</strong>). While the use of computational tools in catalysis has gained momentum in the past decade, it remains difficult to predict performance outside of the training data. In plain terms, it is hard to predict very good catalysts if you don&rsquo;t already have equally good catalysts. This collaboration acquired a very high quality data set using high throughput experimentation equipment and expertise at Pfizer and high-level calculations conducted at UW-Madison of a key organonickel catalyst intermediate. Even with this advantage, it took additional human chemical understanding to identify a confounding trend and the acquisition of additional data to refine the models enough to make them predictive. The model developed allowed us to accurately assess potential catalysts using affordable computations before we undertook the more expensive synthesis and testing in a flask. This approach was successful in predicting a better catalyst in three out of three attempts. The new best catalyst is the most selective and/or highest yielding for three different reactions that we tested and they will soon be commercially available. In a forthcoming paper, we will report how one of these catalysts enables more sustainable nickel catalysis in less harmful solvents. In addition to better catalysts, this work provides a roadmap to other researchers to improve catalysts faster. Ongoing work at UW-Madison and Pfizer is applying this approach to other catalyst classes. This work was reported in&nbsp;<em>J. Am. Chem. Soc.&nbsp;</em><strong>2024</strong>,&nbsp;<em>146</em>, 3043-3051.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The studies funded by this grant resulted in three key benefits for the U. S. in the areas of training, better catalysts, and a high-quality dataset for use in developing machine learning tools. First, three graduate students and one postdoc were trained in the combined use of computational tools and organic chemistry. This field has grown rapidly and demand for these skills outstrips availability. One of these researchers is now employed by Pfizer and one is working as a researcher in data science at a US Army Research site. Second, four different catalysts were discovered that are among the best known for nickel catalyzed cross-electrophile coupling. These catalysts will be commercialized from a number of vendors (they are not patented and are free for anyone to use or sell) soon. Third, the high-quality dataset we gathered as part of this proposal will be deposited at the Open Reaction Database (ORD) where it will be freely available to groups working on developing better computational tools, models, and machine learning.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 07/31/2024<br>\nModified by: Daniel&nbsp;J&nbsp;Weix</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1900366/1900366_10621494_1722444565250_Figure_1_UW_Pfizer_GOALI--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1900366/1900366_10621494_1722444565250_Figure_1_UW_Pfizer_GOALI--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 1.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1900366/1900366_10621494_1722444565250_Figure_1_UW_Pfizer_GOALI--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 1.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Description of the UW-Madison and Pfizer GOALI collaboration.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Daniel J.
