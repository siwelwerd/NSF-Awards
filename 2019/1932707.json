 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mantas and devil rays are large fishes that feed by engulfing massive volumes of seawater, extracting plankton with a specialized filter structure, and expelling filtered water through the gill slits. These animals utilize a highly-efficient filtration mechanism, ricochet separation, that is distinct from previously-described biological or industrial filtration processes. This project will use a multidisciplinary approach to examine the fluid dynamics and filtration mechanics of this unique system. This project will characterize the anatomy of the filtering structure, identify how the shape of the structure affects the flow around the filter, and determine how the resulting flow patterns affect particle filtration. This work will provide critical insights into the physiology of an ecologically important and threatened group of animals. In addition, there is substantial need for improved filtering strategies for use in applications ranging from mitigating large-scale environmental contamination events to routine wastewater treatment. This project will elucidate the mechanics of a novel and highly-efficient filtration process, and has considerable potential to lead to advanced, bioinspired filtration systems. This research will also provide valuable training for undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral scientists and support activities to engage school-aged students and expose them to biomechanics and bioinspired engineering.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe filtering apparatus of mobulid fishes (mantas and devil rays) is a highly-specialized gill-raker structure. It has long been believed that the raker functioned as a sieve filter, simply trapping particles larger than the pore size. However, recent work has shown that the raker utilizes a unique filtration mechanism, ricochet separation, in which complex flow fields cause plankton particles to recoil off the filter surfaces and become concentrated within the buccal cavity. This filtration process has several favorable properties including that it efficiently separates particles smaller than the pore size, is highly resistant to clogging, and has low hydrodynamic resistance. This project will examine the fluid dynamic processes underlying this mechanism and the morphological factors that influence its performance. This research uses a multipronged approach that includes anatomical studies (micro computed tomography), experimental fluid mechanics (particle image velocimetry and filtration efficiency measurements), and theoretical modeling (computational fluid dynamics). Aim 1 will investigate the small-scale physical processes at the surface of the filter, identifying how individual plankton particles interact with the filter and how this interaction is affected by the morphology of the filter. Aim 2 will examine the large-scale flow patterns that develop in the mouth and will determine how this flow influences the filtration mechanics. Aim 3 will use an understanding of these processes to create and optimize bio-inspired engineered filtration systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe process of filtering solid particles from fluids is ubiquitous in both biological organisms and industrial systems. Manta rays and other mobulid fishes use a distinct, high-efficiency filtration mechanism for separating plankton from seawater during feeding. The filtering structure is comprised of an array of plates, and flow running parallel to the filter induces the formation of captive vortices in the pores between the plates. Plankton particles carried by the flow impact the filter structure and are pushed away from the pores. There has been substantial interest in the engineering community in leveraging this mechanism to design and develop improved industrial filtration systems, but such efforts are hindered by an incomplete understanding of the fluid dynamics of the filtration process. This project systematically examined the mechanics of filtration using a combination of computational simulations and experiments measuring the flow fields around the filter and the filtration efficiency. This research program employed a multi-scale approach, investigating the effects of microscopic surface textures up to organism-scale flow patterns. These studies have produced fundamental advances in our understanding of mobulid filter-feeding. While pore size is the key parameter controlling size-dependent filtration efficiency in a traditional sieve filter, the results from this project indicate that pore size has few effects on filtration performance in a mobulid filter. Instead, the data from this project indicate that the velocity over the flow over the filter and the shape of the filter microstructures dictate the filter performance. This knowledge is crucial to designing bioinspired industrial filters optimized for specific applications. This research has also provided a foundation for deciphering the morphological differences observed between fish species, and better understanding the physiology of an ecologically important group of animals. Furthermore, this project has fostered numerous efforts to encourage STEM education and public awareness of science.
