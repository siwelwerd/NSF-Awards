 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Symposium on Cloud Computing 2018 (SoCC '18) brings together researchers, developers, users, and practitioners interested in cloud computing.   ACM SoCC is the premier conference on cloud computing and a dynamic and comprehensive program for publication, education, and interaction.  The program includes research and industrial papers, poster sessions, and keynote talks by leaders in academia and industry. The scope of SoCC is broad and encompasses diverse data management and systems topics such as software as a service, virtualization, scalable cloud data services, and data management and analytics at scale. The intellectual merit of the proposal is to share scientific information. This includes the opportunity for students to showcase their research results, learn about the cutting-edge research conducted by others, and interact with experts at a premier cloud computing conference. \r\n\r\nSoCC provides a unique opportunity for students to share their knowledge and experience with internationally recognized researchers from both academia and industry. The keynotes and many paper/poster presentations provide students with invaluable learning opportunities, as well as exposure to the latest research results and the opportunity to discuss these results with the authors. It also offers an excellent environment for students to interact with industry leaders (from Microsoft, Google, IBM, Oracle, Salesforce, VMware, Facebook, and others) during regular program sessions. These opportunities will have a long-lasting impact on the future career of the participants.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
