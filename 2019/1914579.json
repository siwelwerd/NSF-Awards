 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gamma rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation. Observations of astrophysical gamma rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe and can be used to test fundamental physics.  The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS), located in southern Arizona, is a ground-based observatory designed to study high-energy gamma rays. VERITAS has unique capabilities, providing high sensitivity pointed observations of both galactic and extragalactic sources. This award supports scientists at the University of Alabama to carry out research with VERITAS.  The group will use VERITAS observations to search for gamma-ray counterparts of high-energy neutrinos detected by the IceCube observatory and of gravitational wave events detected by the LIGO observatory.  The group is involved in training and development activities for undergraduates working in multi-messenger astrophysics with particular emphasis on members of historically under-represented groups in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThe University of Alabama group will focus on the following multi-messenger astrophysics studies: a search for very high energy gamma-ray emission in coincidence with archival and newly-detected high-energy astrophysical neutrino event candidates from the IceCube observatory; a detailed study of TXS 0506+056, the first VHE gamma ray source detected in coincidence with a high energy astrophysical neutrino; a comprehensive study of gamma-ray observations of bright blazars and other types of extragalactic sources that are potential neutrino emitters to probe their emission mechanisms; and the search for very high energy gamma-ray counterparts for gravitational wave events produced by LIGO.  The group at the University of Alabama will continue efforts related to the next-generation Cherenkov Telescope Array by participating in the development and commissioning of a prototype air Cherenkov telescope at the VERITAS site in Arizona.  This work directly addresses the goals of NSF's \"Windows on the Universe: The Era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics\" Big Idea.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Very-high-energy gamma rays (VHE, indicating photons with energies beyond 100 billion electron-volts, or 100 GeV) play a unique role in this multimessenger landscape, as they enable the study of particles being accelerated up to the highest energies.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>This project provided support for a research group working on VHE gamma-ray astrophysics at the University of Alabama (UA), with a particular emphasis on multimessenger searches involving neutrinos, and the study of active galactic nuclei. The UA group supported by this grant consists of the principal investigator, a postdoctoral scientist, a graduate student, and several undergraduate students. The group uses observations collected by the VERITAS gamma-ray observatory, an array of four imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACT) located in Arizona. The group also contributes to the development of software and computing infrastructure for the prototype Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope, a proposed contribution to the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), the next generation IACT array.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>One significant result was the study of the active galaxy M87 as part of a large multiwavelength campaign in coordination with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration. During the same campaign, in 2017, EHT famously captured the first image of the event horizon of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the core of M87. The unprecedented angular resolution of EHT enabled for the first time the search for correlated emission in gamma-rays, radio and other wavebands down to the SMBH event horizon scale. The VERITAS portion of the study was led by scientists at UA and it helped deliver a broad view of the source across the electromagnetic spectrum. Results from this study were presented in J. C. Algaba et al., ApJL 911 (2021) L11. A second campaign in 2018 resulted in the detection of a VHE flare while EHT observations of the source were ongoing. The VERITAS work involved in this paper was performed as part of a graduate student thesis at UA, and has been included in a paper now submitted for publication (</span><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17623\"><span>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17623</span></a><span>).</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>One of our main efforts was to help identify the sources of the astrophysical neutrinos detected by the IceCube observatory by searching for associated VHE gamma-ray emission. Once identified, these candidate sources would be characterized. IceCube releases public alerts to the public and VERITAS is pointed in the direction of the candidate neutrino to search for gamma-ray emission. Additional candidate counterparts have been identified and studied using not only VERITAS but other multiwavelength facilities, but no significant associations so far (M. Petropoulou et al., ApJ 891 (2020) 115, F. Oikonomou et al. JCAP 10 (2021) 082, and F. Krauss et al, MNRAS (2020)). UA scientists participated in a VERITAS publication that identified a flaring AGN near the location of a more recent IceCube alert (A. Acharyya et al. 2023 ApJ 954 70). A comprehensive study of alerts followed-up by VERITAS and all other major IACT telescopes is in the final stages of preparation, and results from it have been included in the PhD thesis of the graduate student and recently presented in F. Schussler et al., ICRC 2023, PoS 444, 1501.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Another significant result was the VERITAS discovery of VHE gamma-ray emission from the blazar S3 1227+25. Only about 300 objects are known to emit VHE gamma-rays, and of those less than 100 are AGN, so every new detection of an AGN in this band is important to our understanding of these sources. VERITAS performed observations of S3 1227+25 in May 2015 following the report of a strong flare observed by Fermi and the source was detected for the first time in VHE gamma-ray. The VERITAS study, led by a UA postdoctoral scientist, enabled the determination of important properties of the gamma-ray emission region. Given the correlation in the variability of the electromagnetic brightness of the source&nbsp; it is likely the source region producing all this radiation is the same one (A. Acharyya et al., 2023 ApJ 950 152). This type of correlation study between different wavebands was again applied in a study co-led by a UA postdoctoral scientist reported in A. Acharyya et al., Galaxies 2023, 11(4), 81.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>An important outcome of the grant is the engagement of three undergraduate students in VERITAS research, and the development of Spanish-language outreach material on multimessenger astrophysics.
