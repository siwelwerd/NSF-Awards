 "awd_abstract_narration": "According to the U.S. Census Bureau by the year 2020 more than half of the nation's children will come from minority racial and ethnic groups. In response to these changing demographics, a recent report by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) has addressed the need to increase the participation of individuals from historically underrepresented groups in science and engineering to help maintain this nation's global leadership in technology and innovation and advance national prosperity. The University of South Florida (USF) will serve as the 2019-2021 Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) institutional site for the NSF Florida-Georgia Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (FGLSAMP).  This FGLSAMP BD Project seeks to build upon both FGLSAMP's prior successes and USF's preeminence as a global research university by institutionalizing evidence-based practices in the academic and social integration, comprehensive scholar development, and professionalization in the sciences of graduate students from historically underrepresented groups. The 2019-2021 FGLSAMP BD Activity will facilitate increased intellectual exchange and promote greater diversity and inclusion across all USF STEM departments. The overarching aim of this cohort will be to ensure that 100 percent of FGLSAMP BD fellows complete their STEM PhD within five years after entering their doctoral programs. \r\n\r\nThrough \"lesson learned\" from seven prior BD site awards and partnerships with four USF Colleges, the Office of Graduate Studies, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, and the Florida Education Fund's McKnight Doctoral Fellowship program, USF has been recognized as a national leader in minority STEM graduate education. Measurable objectives for the 2019-2021 USF FGLSAMP BD Activity will include: 1) recruiting twelve (12) LSAMP former participants as fellows by fall 2019 into STEM graduate programs (MS or PhD); 2) providing faculty-mentored research-training for all fellows throughout their two-year NSF fellowship tenure; 3) initiating professional development activities to facilitate competitive Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) applications from BD fellows and FGLSAMP undergraduate scholars within the Alliance; 4) supporting the 100 percent transition of USF FGLSAMP BD fellows into STEM PhD programs through interactions with supportive role model scientists and LSAMP undergraduate scholars; and 5) fostering greater inclusion within STEM graduate departments with new faculty and graduate student mentor training initiatives.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The award represented the eighth FGLSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate grant to USF with the goal of extending previous program accomplishments and student successes by recruiting, mentoring, and graduating national LSAMP participants into STEM PhD programs in the Colleges of Engineering, Arts &amp; Sciences, Marine Science and the Morsani College of Medicine.&nbsp;<br />Since the initial USF FGLSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate award in 2005, students have earned advanced STEM degrees (MS, PhD) at rates nationally by the Council of Graduate Schools. Ninety-four percent of fellows have earned STEM graduate degrees (MS and PhD), and 80 percent are expected to complete STEM doctorate degrees within 5.5 years of entering their doctoral programs.</p>\n<p>Intellectual Merit: The USF BD project recruited 14 fellows from three Colleges (Engineering, Arts and Sciences, and Marine Sciences) and 7 graduate (MS/PhD) programs (Chemistry, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Medical Engineering). In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, recognizing the need to foster strong community among the fellows, we partner with the NSF S-STEM program (DUE #2030861), in a relaunch of the BD STEM Professional Development course.&nbsp; Now, titled &ldquo;STEM Professional Development and Resilience&rdquo; for the first time, upper-level undergraduates were enrolled as course participants with the following four goals.&nbsp;<br />First, introduce first-and second-year BD fellows to the expectations of graduate school as well as university resources (USF Counseling Center, National Office of Scholars, USF Library, and others) that will support their acculturation into STEM graduate departments. Second, provide BD fellows with student success programming including personal budgeting, time management, scholarly writing, and &ldquo;nuts and bolts&rdquo; of applying to competitive fellowships (e.g., NSF GRFP, GEM, NASA, and others) that will promote their retention during critical transition points (e.g., first year and advancement to candidacy. Third, establish a community of scholars for fellows to benefit from peer-to-near-peer interactions to share lessons learned with undergraduate who are from similar backgrounds (low-income/Pell grant eligible, first-generation in college) as their own. Fourth, foster an inclusive, safe space where NSF S-STEM scholars (community-college students) would be inspired to learn about the availability of research and graduate school opportunities and potential career options for them to pursue.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Outcomes:&nbsp; Three scholars (one enrolled elsewhere) left early from the program due to illness, death of family members, and/ or social isolation from the pandemic.&nbsp; Out of 14 members of the 2019-2021 cohort, 10 are still enrolled in a doctoral program, either at USF or elsewhere.&nbsp; Additionally, 3 completed MS STEM degrees at USF or elsewhere and now working in the STEM workforce.&nbsp; Overall, 13 out of 14 are on track to complete an advanced (MS or PhD) STEM graduate degree for a completion rate of 93 percent. In a similar way, we anticipate a PhD completion of nearly 71 percent (10/14) for our scholars.</p>\n<p>Broader Impact:&nbsp;Taken together the social awakening of 2020 and COVID-19 pandemic had a clear toll on the academic and wellbeing of FGLSAMP BD fellows.&nbsp; To shift this paradigm, the BD project initiated a new hierarchical mentoring model within the &ldquo;STEM Professional Development course.&nbsp;&nbsp;Partnering with the NSF S-STEM project (DUE # 2030861), the course, led by FGLSAMP BD Project Director Sanjukta Bhanja and BD Coordinator Bernard Batson. It provided information on access to mental health and personal wellness resources, time management, strategic career planning, interviewing skills, and others.&nbsp; Moreover, FGLSAMP BD fellows were required to submit NSF formatted research proposals (abstract, project description) and participate in a one-day mock panel review session in preparation for required applications to the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship program (GRFP) during the fall semester of their first year.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />In the same spirit, the FGLSAMP BD hierarchical mentoring approach fostered a &ldquo;shared community&rdquo; in the STEM enterprise by deepening the engagement of graduate students in the career paths of undergraduate students.&nbsp; In so doing, this transformative model is building STEM identify for undergraduates while fostering an engineering community of practice that can be modeled and adapted by other institutions to align with their institutional culture and values.<br />Broader Impact outcomes included the following: FGLSAMP BD fellow Ossie Douglas (ME) awarded NASA Space Technology Graduate Opportunities) and a GEM Consortium PhD fellowship; Joshelyn Guimaray (CEE) awarded McKnight Doctoral Fellowship; FGLSAMP BD fellow Nester Marquez Rios (EE) received a GEM Fellowship and full funding for his PhD at Penn State University, Bianca Seufert (EE) awarded GEM Consortium Fellowship; Briana Jones (Chemistry) and Steven Thompson awarded a five-year McKnight Fellowship.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/27/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Sanjukta&nbsp;Bhanja</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1906518/1906518_10619241_1692547159474_20230217_132006--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1906518/1906518_10619241_1692547159474_20230217_132006--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"NSF USF FGLSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate Activity Host Central Florida STEM Alliance\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1906518/1906518_10619241_1692547159474_20230217_132006--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"NSF USF FGLSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate Activity Host Central Florida STEM Alliance\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">FGLSAMP BD project hosted the NSF Central Florida STEM Alliance (LSAMP B2B) students and faculty for a campus visit.
