 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports a year-long Faculty Learning Community (FLC) on the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) for linguists from across the United States. The primary objective is to increase the availability and quality of SoTL-related materials in the field of linguistics, leading to better pedagogical outcomes in K-12 and higher education, following many other STEM fields such as Chemistry, Engineering, and Psychology. The project will result in the training of a cohort of linguists who will promote inclusivity, mentoring, networking, and pedagogical development. This work has the potential to create a network of linguistics scholars with expertise on teaching and learning, which will benefit the field of Linguistics, as well as the academe. \r\n\r\nThe group will meet online bi-weekly throughout the 2019-2020 academic year and will have two in-person workshops. The FLC will be facilitated by the two Associate Editors of the Teaching Linguistics section of Language, the flagship journal of the Linguistic Society of America (LSA). Participants in the FLC will design a SoTL project to be carried out in one of their courses in the Spring 2020 term, and will present on their preliminary findings at the May workshop. During the workshop, participants will also consult with their peers, as well as the facilitators and project consultants, to determine best practices in disseminating their scholarship, and to create a strategy for spreading SoTL to the rest of the LSA membership, beginning with plans for the 2021 annual meeting.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
