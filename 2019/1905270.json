 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Nathan Gianneschi of Northwestern University and Lucas R. Parent of University of Connecticut examine how amphiphilic copolymers behave in water on the nanoscale.  Amphiphilic copolymers are long chain molecules possessing both water-loving and oil-loving properties.  Examples of common amphiphilic compounds include soaps and detergents.  In this work, electron microscopy is used to observe molecular-scale movement during the self-assembly of amphiphilic copolymers in water.  Experimental studies examine the pathways and intermediates for the assembly.  Control of self-assembly has promise for applications such as optimized drug or cosmetic delivery vehicles, as functional\r\nelements in composites, as optical sensors, and in the transport of catalysts and reagents in industry and biology.  Beyond research and mentoring in a laboratory, this project connects with ongoing school outreach efforts.  Activities include Exploring Engineering and Spark annual summer camps for national STEM high school students and local middle school girls.  Also, the da Vinci Program is designed to educate local secondary school teachers and administrators on increasing classroom STEM education.\r\n\r\nThis work employs in situ liquid phase transmission electron microscopy techniques to study the dynamic processes of macromolecular nanostructures involving copolymers of N,N-dimethylacrylamide, N-isopropylacrylamide and/or n-butyl acrylate.  Particular emphasis is placed on developing an understanding of the mechanisms and pathways of self-assembly/disassembly, kinetic trapping, phase changes and morphological transformations.  Polymer syntheses are conducted using reversible addition-fragmentation transfer polymerization which enables control over molecular weight and polydispersity.  Understanding control at the nanoscale has promise for the application of investigated amphiphilic copolymers as components capable of performing as optimized drug delivery vehicles and as functional elements in composites capable of mechanical or rheological responses.  Additionally, such systems also have the potential to transport catalysts and reagents.  Research associated with this award advances understanding of the fundamental process of self-assembly of discrete architectures from disperse polymers which is of significant interest not only to nanoscience community, but to polymer scientists in general.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

There are limited techniques that can directly image polymer nanostructures in the solvated state, as such formulations are often not physically amenable or are too small to resolve by optical microscopy techniques. To achieve our objectives we used Liquid-Cell Transmission Electron Microscopy (LCTEM), a nascent technique that is able to resolve nanoscale solvated polymer structures and capture solution-phase dynamics during structural evolution.</p>\n<p>During this project, we gained key insights into complex nanostructures at elevated temperatures and structural transformations of polymeric nanostructures by studying a family of thermo-responsive block copolymers. After first optimizing LCTEM imaging conditions through control experiments, we were able to gain direct insight into the transformation mechanisms and intermediate structures formed during the thermally triggered morphological transformation of the polymer assemblies, shown in <strong>Figure 1</strong>, <strong>Figure 2</strong>, and &nbsp;<strong>Figure 3</strong>. Critical to these studies was correlating LCTEM data with small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), which provided additional insight into the fundamental processes of transition in responsive tri-block polymer systems (Figure 3). Using a similar experimental approach, we also visualized a worm-to-micelle phase transformation in solvent-responsive block copolymer assemblies via mixing-LCTEM, which was triggered by a methanol-to-DMF solvent switch instead of temperature change. In this solvent-responsive system, we observed the transition from small spherical micelles in methanol into similar diameter worms upon mixing with DMF. Our general workflow, applied to both thermally-responsive and solvent-responsive polymers, shows the power of LCTEM in conjunction with SAXS, to answer fundamental questions about phase transitions and responsive-transformations in polymeric materials.</p>\n<p>In another key study that has given strong insights into both the method and the materials was the use of LCTEM videography to observe oil-in-water emulsions in the solution phase. Studying nano-to-micro scale emulsion solutions is difficult or impossible by other imaging methods, such as cryo-TEM, dry-TEM or freeze-fracture SEM, due to the sample preparation challenges of each regarding mixed phase systems. We demonstrated that LCTEM allows for the observation of emulsion evolution over time and for studies on emulsion formation (<strong>Figure 4</strong>), stability and aging. Using LCTEM, we directly monitored the ways that emulsion evolution processes change as a result of modifications to the emulsion formulation. This was a largely preliminary study to demonstrate that LCTEM can be applied to mixed-phase emulsion systems, which we plan to build upon in future work.</p>\n<p>In a study that has underpinned our efforts to understand the limits of the method, we have investigated polymer damage phenomena during LCTEM observation. Here, radiolysis modeling was combined with <em>in situ</em> LCTEM imaging and <em>post-mortem</em> mass spectrometry to elucidate sample and imaging conditions that can be tuned to safely and effectively image solvated polymers. This work raised questions about the survivability of soft/polymeric materials when imaged with gold nanoparticles (GNPs) or other inorganic nanomaterials present in the sample solution (<strong>Figure 5</strong>). The sensitizing effect of GNPs suggests that the addition of inorganic species require using far lower TEM beam fluxes than for soft matter alone. Additionally, we employed radical<strong> </strong>scavengers to mitigate damage when imaging soft materials in solution. Specifically, we demonstrated via post-mortem spectrometry that isopropyl alcohol (IPA) can be used to mitigate polymer damage. Utilizing this approach, we gained critical insight into electron-solvent interactions for DMF, methanol, and water, finding that water is the most radiolytically sensitive of the three solvents, while the organic solvents appear comparatively stable and resistant to polymer damage.</p>\n<p>In summary, during the three-years of this project, we developed a comprehensive approach for using LCTEM to directly observe nanostructures and nanostructure dynamics in responsive polymer systems. We determined LCTEM conditions where sample damage was mitigated for solvated polymer systems. We then applied LCTEM videography combined with SAXS to understand the processes of phase-transition in thermally-responsive block copolymers and in emulsion solutions. The work collectively contributes to our understanding of these specific materials, but more importantly, provides a workflow for implementing LCTEM to study complex, soft nanomaterials in the solution phase.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/09/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Lucas&nbsp;R&nbsp;Parent</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1905270/1905270_10621542_1678374850140_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1905270/1905270_10621542_1678374850140_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1905270/1905270_10621542_1678374850140_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1.
