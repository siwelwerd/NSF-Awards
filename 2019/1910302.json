 "awd_abstract_narration": "Radio astronomy lets us see an otherwise invisible side of the Universe, and in doing so allows us to study topics as diverse as the birthplaces of stars and planets, black holes and Einstein's theories, and the very fate of the Universe. Research in these areas is becoming increasingly difficult, however, because so much of the technology that we rely on in our daily lives, like cell phones and wireless internet, also emit radio waves. These can overwhelm weak cosmic signals. This project will make use of cutting edge digital technology to develop the next generation of sensitive detectors for radio telescopes. It will also improve our ability to share the radio spectrum with non-astronomers by differentiating between human-made and cosmic radio signals. This project will provide an educational experience for first-generation college students. It will give them a hands-on research experience and the skills needed for future success in technical fields.\r\n\r\nNew analog and digital technology is making it feasible to process ever larger radio bandwidths; but this comes as the radio spectrum is seeing increasing commercial, civil, and private use. This project will develop the next generation of digital technology for radio astronomy. It will lay the foundation for more stable and sensitive wide-bandwidth, high data-rate instruments on the world's most sensitive radio telescopes. At the same time, the project will develop new techniques for identifying and removing human-made radio signals while preserving scientific data. The project includes a summer internship for first-generation college students. Students will help to build a catalog of human-made radio signals while learning valuable professional and technical skills.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These signals are analogous to light pollution that we can see with our eyes, and they can easily overwhelm the weak astronomical signals that we seek to collect. For this reason, radio telescopes have typically been built in remote locations, far away from most sources of interference. However, the ubiquity of wireless technology and the growth of satellite internet make it impossible to escape all forms of wireless communications. In this project, we researched new ways to identify radio interference and remove it from astronomical data, without negatively impacting the science that astronomers need to do. We look at the statistics of the data collected by radio telescopes to find the tell-tale signs of human-made interference. Astronomical sources have different properties than human-made signals, so if we can separate the two, we can remove terrestrial sources while keeping the cosmic signals we are interested in. There are two challenges &ndash; the first is that many human-made sources turn off and on very short timescales, sometimes as fast as few milliseconds. To effectively identify and remove them, we need to process our data very quickly. The second challenge is eliminating the human signals while preserving the very, very weak astronomical signals. We use two approaches. The first involves spectral kurtosis of the signal, which is a measure of how much the statistics of our data differ from a bell-shaped curve. The second approach uses cyclostationarity &ndash; repeating statistical patterns that are common in telecommunications but rare in astronomy. We collected 10s of TBs from the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia to test our methods, and we shared this data publicly so that other scientists can also use it, and check our work. This data set allows us to try different approaches and compare the results to what we would have obtained if we weren&rsquo;t using our new techniques at all. This is essential for making sure that we aren&rsquo;t introducing errors into the data. We find dramatic improvement in the quality of our data for certain types of interfering signals, especially radar and certain types of satellite communications. After identify RFI we remove it, and then process our data as we usually would. We can recover weak astronomical signals that would otherwise be lost at certain radio frequencies where RFI is common. However, our methods don&rsquo;t work equally well on all sources of interference, so in the future, a variety of techniques will be needed to deal with interference. Our techniques also require a lot of computing power. The next steps will be to find ways of speeding them up so we can use them in real-time. Dozens of first-generation college students helped analyze our data as part of three summer internship programs, giving them valuable, real-world experience in radio astronomy and digital signal processing.
