 "awd_abstract_narration": "The outcomes of higher education are a consequence of individuals' personality traits and many\r\ndimensions of the university experience. The Caltech Cohort Study (CCS) will track the entire\r\nundergraduate student body of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) over several years. It\r\nuses repeated, incentivized surveys to elicit behavioral proxies: risk aversion, strategic sophistication,\r\ncompetitiveness, social behavior, etc. The results will be married with objective outcomes: academic,\r\nsocial, and financial. The project will examine the evolution of attributes over college years, the\r\nformation of social interactions, and ultimately how certain attributes interact to produce educational\r\noutcomes. The CCS also serves as an ideal environment for answering fundamental questions about\r\nthe external validity of incentivized surveys and laboratory experiments.\r\n\r\nThe CCS has four unique features. First, Caltech's small size makes it possible to track nearly\r\nthe entire student body over time (90% of students completed the first three surveys). Second, the\r\nsurvey design allows measurement of a large set of behavioral traits for each individual. Third,\r\nthe repeated nature of the study makes it possible to track the stability of these traits across time\r\nwith minimal selection bias. Fourth, the array of behavioral traits elicited can be tied to real-world\r\nbehaviors and outcomes. The combination of these elements should be invaluable for a large battery\r\nof basic social science questions.\r\n\r\nThe proposed study has the potential to improve the educational process in US higher education.\r\nUnderstanding what impacts social and scholastic outcomes will help design certain aspects of college\r\neducation aimed at increasing well-being and academic performance, as well as furthering gender and\r\nracial equality.\r\n\r\nThe proposal focuses on three areas. First, the dataset's longitudinal nature will allow for a careful\r\ninspection of the stability (or lack thereof) of a wide array of behavioral attributes. Second, the rich\r\ndata on different layers of interactions over time (social, academic, and geographic) combined with\r\nthe comprehensive set of elicited attributes will allow us to study network formation processes. Last,\r\nthe data can be cross-checked against Caltech's experimental laboratory data to examine the impacts\r\nof selection into experiments as well as the differences in responses occurring in the lab and outside.\r\nThe survey will also allow for a comparison of responses across other platforms and populations.\r\nUltimately, the detailed longitudinal data that will be collected have the potential to uncover\r\npredictors of academic outcomes (chosen major, grades, and graduation), and the channels affecting\r\nthe evolution of different traits.",

Specifically, we have run the Caltech Cohort Study (CCS) survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) using close to 1000 participants. We also ran the survey using Survey Sampling International (SSI), which is a platform allowing experimentation on a representative sample of the U.S.population, using over 1000 participants.

These techniques were applied to data from the CCS. In particular, items in the CCS replicate three classic experiments, through which we demonstrate that results change substantially when measurement error is accounted for. The main message of this paper is that failing to properly account for measurement error may cause a fieldwide bias leading scholars to identify \"new\" phenomena.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>Testing the Waters: Behavior across Participant Pools </strong>(joint with Erik Snowberg, published in <em>The American Economic Review</em>) In this paper, we leverage the data from the CCS survey run at Caltech, with SSI andMTurk data to address concerns about the external validity of experiments with student participants. Our results suggest that behavior in the student population offers bounds on behaviors in other populations, and correlations between behaviors are largely similar across samples. Furthermore, non-student samples exhibit higher measurement error. Adding historical lab participation data from the Social Science Experimental Laboratory (SSEL) at Caltech, we find a small set of attributes over which labparticipants differ from non-lab participants. Using an additional set of lab experiments at Caltech, we see no evidence of observer effects. This paper has been presented invarious universities (UCSD, Columbia, Maryland, etc.). It has also been presented inplenary talks in several conferences (Stony Brook Game Theory, Information and SocialEconomics Workshop at Caltech, FETS in Paris).

The longitudinal nature of the CCS offers aunique opportunity to study the formation of networks. Indeed, since we observe connections over time, we can distinguish between initial selection of friends, and convergence of certain malleable traits across connected individuals. Furthermore, we can tie friendship profiles to academic outcomes such as GPA and choice of major. Our results suggest growing densities, increasing homophily, and decreasing turnover in both social and study networks over time. Professional study networks, however, exhibit weaker homophily than social networks. We also see a strong impact of connection patterns on outcomes. In particular, linked female students of different ethnicities exhibit the greatest increases in GPA.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>Statistical Discrimination and Affirmative Action in the Lab </strong>(joint with Ahrash Dianat and Federico Echenique, published in <em>Games and Economic Behavior</em>) The data generated by the CCS regarding attitudes toward gender and race induced me to study the effectiveness of affirmative action in various settings. In this paper, we study experimentally the impacts of affirmative-action policies. We induced statistical discrimination in simple firm-worker labor market interactions. We then introduced affirmative-action policies that varied in size andduration of a subsidy firms received for hiring discriminated workers. These different affirmative-action policies had nearly the same effect and eliminated discriminatoryhiring practices.

Allocation with Diverse Preference Intensities </strong>(joint with Pietro Ortoleva and Evgenii Safonov) The CCS raises many questions about the optimal allocation of scarce resources: desirable university residences, spots in classes, etc. In general, services are often allocated to individuals who rank them similarly but differ in their preference intensities. We characterize optimal allocation rules in such settings. We show that first-best allocations may involve lotteries. Second-best allocations always involve lotteries and coincide with first-best allocations non-trivially.
