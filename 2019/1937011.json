 "awd_abstract_narration": "Central Michigan University (CMU) will implement an ADVANCE Catalyst project to undertake faculty climate campus survey, focus group interviews with STEM faculty at CMU, interviews with STEM faculty who left CMU and candidates who turned down employment offers.  The project will include document and institutional data analyses to understand the barriers to success for STEM women faculty at CMU. Furthermore, the project will analyze how these barriers are similar or different depending on the academic department, race/ethnicity, and/or world region of origin. The project team will visit other ADVANCE institutions to learn about their success and struggles with similar issues and will invite expert speakers to come to CMU. They will host a pilot implicit bias training program for faculty in STEM departments and learn more about implicit bias and how it plays out in the CMU workplace to inform the development of the faculty equity strategic plan. This two-year project will prepare the university for future data collection and data analyses of faculty equity which can be used by institutional leadership to inform decision-making.  The Catalyst work will also prepare the institution to implement evidence-based strategies to enhance the university climate for all faculty which will be outlined in a five-year faculty equity strategic plan that will be produced as part of this project.   \r\n\r\nThe NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions.  Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational culture and climate.  ADVANCE \"Catalyst\" awards provide support for institutional equity assessments and the development of five-year faculty equity strategic plans at an academic, non-profit institution of higher education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our data collection included faculty focus group interviews and individual interviews as well as an analysis of institutional data (time to tenure and promotion, salary).

Women STEM faculty at CMU face both interpersonal and structural barriers to their work at CMU and are astutely aware of the lack of resources available to them in addressing such concerns. Women face more barriers while negotiating start-up funds and navigating the RPT process. Women recognize and are frustrated with unequal workloads between men and women faculty, especially in regards to service. Women also experience a less collegial environment at CMU. Additional interviews and focus groups included: individuals that declined a faculty position offer, individuals that had recently left a CMU STEM faculty position, and STEM department chairs.
