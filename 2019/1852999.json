 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to completely change how critical\r\nanatomic structures such as the ureter are identified and protected during surgery. As surgical\r\ntechnology advances and procedures are done using robots and through millimeter-sized\r\nincisions, there is an ever-increasing need for technology that quickly and easily identifies\r\ndifferent structures in the body during surgery to increase the safety of these techniques,\r\nshorten the operations and decrease healthcare costs both from a procedure length standpoint\r\nas well as surgical complications. Precise electrical stimulation that generates targeted smooth\r\nmuscle structure contractions make them immediately visible to the surgeon without needing\r\nto perform complex and risky dissections, and eliminates the need for costly (and invasive)\r\nproducts such as ureteral stents to keep patients safe. Smooth muscle stimulation during\r\nsurgery will change how we operate both today, and in the future. It can help surgeons identify\r\ntissue structures with the push of a button, help determine healthy and unhealthy tissues from\r\neach other, and can guide clinical decision making. With an ever-increasing need to deliver\r\nquality care to patients, technology that increases surgical efficiency, patient safety and\r\ndecreases healthcare costs will have high demand and significant commercial impact.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will greatly advance the field of\r\nsurgery through design, development and clinical use of an innovative smooth muscle\r\nstimulation device. Surgeons currently spend up to 40% of their operating time looking for\r\nstructures such as the ureter to prevent accidental injury in over 3 million operations done each\r\nyear in the US alone, and injuries to this structure accounts for over $3 billion in annual\r\nhealthcare over-spending. This Phase II project will bring a unique smooth muscle stimulation\r\ntechnology into the operating room to benefit surgeons and patients. A signal generator will be\r\ndesigned and built (with safety features in place), tested, and paired with sterile surgical\r\ninstruments. These will be tested first in large animal models as well as in-silico studies to\r\nconfirm safety and efficacy, and then a clinical pilot study will be performed in the hospital\r\nsetting in patients that consent to participate. The anticipated result of this project is to have a\r\nmedical device system that passes all standard electrical safety requirement for human use that\r\nis shown to be clinically effective in assisting surgeons in identification of structures such as the\r\nureter during lower abdominal/pelvic operations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
