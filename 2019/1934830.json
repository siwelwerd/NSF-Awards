 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical\r\nThe academy often focuses on one facet of a student's identity without regard for the identity of the whole student. This over simplified view of identity leaves diverse students feeling alienated because their identity is not fully understood, recognized or supported. The objective of this workshop is to bring together geoscience diversity leaders from seven underrepresented communities (women, Native American/Alaska Native (NA/AN), Pacific Islanders, disability, first-generation, African American and Latinx) to cultivate a network poised to critically examine practices for the support and mentorship of undergraduate students who identify with more than a single diverse community. This workshop will provide participants with geoscience micro-field experiences on Alaska Native Haida tribal land, and Haida cultural activities (focused on forest, plant and marine ecology)- with the goal of prompting broader discussions about diversity in geoscience.\r\n\r\nTechnical\r\nThe purpose of this workshop is to bring together faculty and academic staff working in different aspects of diversity and geoscience to develop a 10-page toolkit outlining good practices for supporting the intersectionality of diverse undergraduate students in geoscience. The questions associated with this workshop are 1) what do faculty and academic staff need to know to support the intersectionality of diverse students in geoscience, and 2) how can the instructional and mentorship practices of faculty and academic staff be enhanced to better support intersectionality of diverse students in geoscience? In thinking about the potential of developing a toolkit, it is important to consider 1) how activities in the toolkit will boost an understanding of diversity, 2) when and where should the toolkit be used, and 3) what is the potential for action once faculty and academic staff have used the toolkit? Through the workshop activities, the participants will engage each of these questions to support their own learning, as well as engaging in curricular development to support other geoscience faculty and academic staff working with diverse undergraduates.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
