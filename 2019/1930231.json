 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides travel support for up to 15 graduate students from US institutions to participate and present their work at the 27th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO 2019). The conference will serve as a valuable occasion for US graduate students to connect with worldwide leaders in signal processing research. Outreach to underrepresented groups is integrated through contacts with the National Society of Black Engineers, the Computing Alliance for Hispanic Serving Institutions, the Institute for Mentorship for African Americans in Computer Science, and the Computing Research Association Committee on the Status of Women in Computing Research.  The workshop has also planned activities directly aimed at student participants, including a Best Student Paper competition and award, and a \"three-minute thesis\" in which students have three minutes to present a compelling oration on their thesis and its significance, so as to hone their communication skills to broader audiences.\r\n\r\nEUSIPCO 2019 is the upcoming edition of this well-established and recognized conference in the broad field of signal processing that takes place yearly and gathers worldwide experts. The 2019 edition will have a highly international profile, featuring plenary sessions delivered by renowned scientists on key topics of research and development, and oral and poster parallel scientific sessions, where participants can present their most recent results on the different topics of the conference\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
