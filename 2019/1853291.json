 "awd_abstract_narration": "Surface and upper-ocean processes in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) play an important role in ocean heat transport, air-sea gas fluxes (such as pCO2) and in sea-ice formation. The net of these in turn modulate global climate, sea level rise and global circulation.  This project  continues the field development of a surface autonomous vehicle (https://www.liquid-robotics.com/wave-glider/overview/ ) to better measure and study these processes in the remote Southern Ocean, where continuous data is otherwise very difficult to obtain. Mobile autonomous surface vehicles, powered by sunlight and wave action provide a very cost effective manner of solving the problem of obtaining  unattended observational coverage in the remote Southern Ocean. The project will support ongoing education and outreach efforts by the PIs including school presentations, visits to science centers and the development of educational materials.\r\n\r\nThe WaveGlider has an established track record of navigating successful spatial surveys and positioned time series measurements in otherwise inhospitable waters and sea-states. The study includes the addition of some new measurement capabilities such as an (upper mixed) layer profiling CTD winch, a high frequency acoustic Doppler turbulence system, and a biogeochemical chlorophyll fluorescence sensor. This augmented instrumentation package will be used for a set of Austral summer season experiments observing ocean-shelf exchange along with frontal air-sea interactions in the vicinity of the West Antarctic Peninsula.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
