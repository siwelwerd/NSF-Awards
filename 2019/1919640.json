 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tropical biomes play major roles in global water, carbon, and nutrient cycling and support a large proportion of the Earth's biodiversity. Despite their ecological importance, tropical ecosystems receive scant coverage in undergraduate biology textbooks and courses. Researchers in tropical ecology have developed a rich set of learning materials that could be adapted for the classroom, but a means for networking with undergraduate biology educators to disseminate these learning materials does not currently exist. The goals of this Incubator project are to 1) begin developing the Authentic Learning In Virtual tropical Environments (ALIVE) network by organizing and conducting a two-day workshop that brings together researchers in tropical ecology, educators, media specialists, and database engineers; and 2) write and submit a review/concept paper about authentic classroom-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) in tropical ecology. The long-term vision of the PIs is that the ALIVE network will develop a web-based platform to disseminate the tropical ecology learning materials it develops and that facilitates direct communication between students in the classroom and tropical field researchers.\r\n\r\nThis Incubator project aims to enhance undergraduate biology by integrating two practices, the use of CUREs and internationalization of curricula. Although CUREs can address the challenge of providing students research-based experiences, their development is often beyond the reach of many faculty, especially for CUREs based on international research. There is thus a need for a platform that integrates research in tropical biology with best practices in pedagogy. New educational materials and a community that fosters communication between students, educators, and tropical field researchers will enhance student engagement in undergraduate courses and broaden cultural, ethnic, and geographic perspectives. Although study-abroad programs can introduce students to tropical biology, only a relatively small proportion of students can participate. Students from underrepresented and/or socioeconomically disadvantaged groups may be the least able to participate, thus widening the opportunity gap for these students. Incorporating authentic research in tropical ecology into classroom-based activities will level the playing field, enabling all students to gain experience in international research in the classroom.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
