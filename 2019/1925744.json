 "awd_abstract_narration": "The CC* Networking Infrastructure project, Extended Vital Education Reach Multiple Organization Regional OneOklahoma Friction Free Network (EVER-MORe-OFFN), expands the network capabilities of Cameron University (CU), East Central Oklahoma University (ECU) (both upgraded to 10Gbps), and Oral Roberts University (ORU) (upgraded to 100 Gbps) by connecting them to the OneOklahoma Friction Free Network (OFFN) through community-based Science DMZ technologies.  Using 10Gb and 100Gb channels, OFFN interconnects Oklahoma's research organizations. OFFN allows the researchers at each institution to reliably connect to supercomputers and big data repositories, increase computational capabilities, and increase inter-institution collaboration.\r\n \r\nPreviously, researchers at the EVER-MORe-OFFN institutions lacked throughput speed when dealing with large data sets. The EVER-MORe-OFFN expansion of OFFN affords these researchers access to a high-speed and efficient network allowing for analyses and simulations by researchers and an expanded repertoire of course projects and assignments available to professors. Additionally, the High Performance Computing Center at ORU is open to the collaborating universities through this expansion.\r\n \r\nAdding these three institutions increases the total OFFN Institutional participation to 12 institutions.  As OFFN expands, so does the serviced population which provides new access to the necessary resources to create research opportunities previously not afforded.  This project has broader implications for the scientific community including the next generation of researchers and scientists unlocking the door to many exciting discoveries.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Cameron University (CU), East Central Oklahoma University (ECU), and Oral Roberts University (ORU).

The research initiatives are varied, including chemistry, biochemistry, biology, geosciences, engineering, mathematics, data science, and computer science.  Furthermore, this grant enabled increased utilization of advanced CI in the classroom setting.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThe addition of these universities to OFFN increased the community interactivity in Oklahoma, increasing the dialogue and engaged utilization of advanced CI amongst the OFFN institutions.  This increased activity resulted in greater awareness of the Oklahoma-based CI and its availability and approachability.  This resulted in increased course and research engagement at these predominantly undergraduate institutions, expanding the STEM support into other disciplines.  Expanding the reach of STEM training has promoted increased undergraduate interest in emerging technologies.  For example, at ORU, the enrollment in the four data science courses, all offered at the undergraduate level, has substantially increased over the timeframe of this grant.\n\nECU, CU, and ORU have each been active advocators of the OFFN CI, encouraging other institutions to become OFFN institutions through additional regional grants.  Since the beginning of this grant, three additional grants have occurred, bringing the total participation to 20 institutions.  The OFFN map image is shown in this report.
