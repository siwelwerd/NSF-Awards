 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mission of the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) Protein Data Bank (PDB) is to sustain a unique Findable-Accessible-Interoperable-Reusable (FAIR) living data resource of three-dimensional (3D) biomolecular structure information.  PDB structures are the molecules of life. Knowledge of 3D structures (shapes) of biological macromolecules, how they evolved with time, and their functions are essential for understanding critical areas of science, including fundamental biology; health and disease of humans, animals, and plants; food and energy production; and other topics of concern to global prosperity and environmental sustainability. Structure data are equally important for biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, driving discovery of new therapeutics, biomaterials, and medical devices. RCSB PDB services span the entire PDB data lifecycle.  Archive Management/Access services safeguard this single global archive of over 137,000 3D structures of biological macromolecules, with an estimated replacement cost of nearly $14 billion. Deposition/Biocuration and Data Exploration services support over 30,000 data contributors and over 1 million data users worldwide. The PDB has a 19-year history of scientific and technical leadership in sustaining an open-access global data resource that has become central to research and education in biology and medicine, by curating, integrating, and disseminating biomolecular structure information in the context of biological function, biochemical pathways, cellular processes, disease states, and molecular evolution. RCSB PDB websites supporting research (rcsb.org) and education (pdb101.rcsb.org) foster a molecular understanding of fundament biology, biomedicine, and energy in three-dimensions at the atomic level. Access to PDB data and RCSB PDB services will continue to drive patent applications, drug discovery and development, publication of innovative research, in scientific disciplines ranging from Agriculture to Zoology, development of life-changing biopharmaceutical products and formation of new US companies. \r\n\r\nRCSB PDB outreach, education, and training efforts leverage PDB data and RCSB PDB staff expertise. More than 620,000 researchers, educators, students, and members of the public use the Outreach/Education services. Online materials supporting exploration of fundamental biology; biomedicine; energy; biotechnology drug discovery; and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education, are consumed by researchers, educators, students, and the public. RCSB PDB educational resources are designed for global reuse in homes and classrooms, requiring only modest desktop computers, smartphones, or digital printers to experience the full impact of the project's online offerings.  These free-of-charge materials are hosted at pdb101.rcsb.org, including the popular Molecule of the Month series that highlights the structure and function of molecules, and the Guide to Understanding PDB Data that introduces structural biology tools to a broad audience. RCSB PDB also produces and distributes online curricular materials for high school and college educators and students, explaining how molecular structures inform fundamental biology, medicine, energy, biotechnology, and drug discovery, with a focus on global public health concerns.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It is a vanguard in the open-access data movement. Beginning with only seven protein structures, PDB holdings have grown more than 30,000-fold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow in its 53nd year of continuous operations, the PDB has global reach. Approximately 60,000 structural biologists (Depositors) working on every inhabited continent have contributed data to the archive. This information is used by many millions of PDB Data Consumers (basic and applied researchers, trainees, educators, and students) based in 200 UN-recognized sovereign countries and territories. The archive has been designated by the Global Biodata Coalition as a Global Core Biodata Resource, and CoreTrustSeal-certified.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PDB is managed by an international collaboration among data centers, called the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB). RCSB PDB is the global archive keeper and the US data center in this collaboration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRCSB PDB safeguards structural biology data generated with US research funding (Figure 1). The estimated replacement cost of current PDB archival contents exceeds US$20 billion (assuming an average cost of US$100,000 for regenerating each of the 200,000 experimental structures. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPDB data are critical to public health. Structural biologists and PDB data contributed to design and rapid Emergency Use Authorization of two highly-effective mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, and to discovery and development of Pfizers antiviral Paxlovid, saving many millions of lives worldwide (Figure 2). RCSB PDB developed many images, publications, videos and curricula to help explain the virus that were widely accessed during the pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is undeniable that the recently-announced Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based software tools for predicting protein structures from amino acid sequence information alone (computed structure models, CSMs) would not exist but for open access to PDB data. In 2022, RCSB PDB further solidified its position as the premier one-stop shop for studying 3D structures of biomolecules by enhancing its research-focused web portal (RCSB.org) to support parallel delivery of more than 1,000,000 CSMs of proteins alongside 200,000 PDB structures, enabling basic and applied research across the sciences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring this funding period (2019-2023), more than 67,000 atomic coordinate files and related experimental data files were publicly released. PDB data files were accessed more than 10.7 billion times from wwPDB data centers around the world. During 2023 alone, PDB data were accessed from RCSB PDB, the US data center, 2.6 million times. Additionally, 476 trusted external information resources repackage and distribute PDB data for the global scientific community. PDB data are also maintained as standalone copies inside for-profit company firewalls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRCSB.org supports an international community of users, including biologists (in fields such as structural biology, biochemistry, genetics, pharmacology); other scientists (in fields such as bioinformatics, software developers for data analysis and visualization); students and educators (all levels); media writers, illustrators, textbook authors; and the general public.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers access tools for query, reporting, and visualization are integrated with a database that contains data from the PDB archive, data and links from external resources, and pre-calculated data. Searches range from quick queries (author name, ID) to asking more complicated biological questions. For 2023, RCSB PDB Usage Analytics recorded RCSB.org access by ~8.2 million unique IP addresses making ~3.5 billion requests/interactions (involving delivery 622 TB of data).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRCSB PDB also supports US research funders by empowering a diverse STEM workforce through Training activities, advancing the frontiers of basic research and discovery through strategic initiatives (e.g., incorporating CSMs at RCSB.org), and enabling applied research in academe and industry with data and tools for exploring new technologies (e.g., protein engineering, de novo protein design, molecular nanotechnology).\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/15/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: StephenKBurley\n"
