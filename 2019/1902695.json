 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coastal nutrient enrichment has resulted in saltmarshes being one of the most endangered ecosystems in the world. This over enrichment has compromised the ability of saltmarshes to provide key ecosystem services such as buffering coastal cities from storms, providing habitat for fish and shellfish, and mitigating climate impacts by storing carbon. The U.S. is investing millions of dollars to reduce nitrogen to coastal regions and embarking on large-scale saltmarsh restoration costing millions to billions of dollars to restore lost ecosystem services. Currently, it is unknown how quickly or if ecosystem services will return after nutrient inputs are cut. This research will provide insight into nitrogen pollution as a cause of marsh loss and the potential for ecosystem recovery with management strategies. There are several education efforts associated with this project that will train students. The project enhances education by developing high school curriculum on \"Research and Resiliency: Investigating the Local Effects of Global Changes\" in collaboration with the Massachusetts Audubon Society. A program for mid-career journalists about environmental science will also be developed. This project will facilitate sustainability and provide a science-based foundation for state and federal nutrient standards. \r\n\r\nThis project will address how the effects of historical nutrient over enrichment influences the ability of marshes to recover their ability to provide ecosystem services. The project will use a combination of whole-ecosystem experimental manipulations, field measurements of key species, assays of genetic change, nutrient and carbon cycle processes, and food-web structure in six experimental sites to determine recovery trajectories. Researchers will measure changes in the decomposer community genetic diversity and activity by sequence amplicons of functional genes responsible for encoding key enzymes in the nitrogen cycling processes. The project will measure plant traits and genotypic diversity. The recovery of carbon and nitrogen cycling will be determined from marsh geomorphology, habitat-specific denitrification rates, nitrogen exchange with the open bay, and decomposition. Measuring the species diversity, abundance and productivity and stable isotope of invertebrates and fish will assess food web recovery.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis study was designed to examine how the salt marsh recovers from nutrient enrichment.  In a previous grant, in coming tidal water was amended with nitrate fertilizer to elevate the nitrate concentration to at least 70 umols N per liter for a period of 13 years.  Fertilization was then stopped to monitor recovery.   We made measurements of denitrification, the removal of nitrate by microbes by using the nitrate and producing N2 gas which leaves the system, at the fertilized site (Sweeney Creek) and a reference site (West Creek) and compared them to measurements which had been made during the time when the marsh was being actively fertilized.   Samples were taken in mid-summer June for both studies.  When fertilization was active (2006) there was a large difference in rates between the fertilized creek, Sweeney, and the reference creek, West.  Rates of ambient denitrification were more than 15 time higher in the fertilized creek bottom and more than 10 times higher on the marsh platform when compared to reference sites. At all sites, subtidal rates of denitrification were greater than on the marsh platform. There were similar differences in the rates of potential denitrification (Dtot) in the creek bottoms but no difference in potential rates on the marsh platform. Potential denitrification reflects rates under non-nitrate limited conditions.

Once the fertilization ceased this source of nitrate went away.  This data suggests that the denitrifying  microbial community is strongly limited by nitrate and that once the nitrate is removed, the system quickly recovers to to its previous denitrification rate.  \n\n \n\nWe also received a supplement to this grant to support a recent college grad for an internship.  Jade Fiorilla was hired for as a NSF Research Experience for Post-graduates (REPs) for 10 months.  She accomplished three tasks.  1) She worked with Giblin and TIDE researcher David Johnson to to analyze samples from the TIDE plots from 2021 for the number and biomass of marsh epifauna (snails, amphipods and isopods).  She put this data together with the long-term data base taken by David Johnson to look at patterns related to fertilization and weather.   She presented this data at the Spring meeting of the New England Estuarine Research Society in June 2022.  2) She studied marsh accretion rates by analyzeing data from Sediment Elevation Tables from both LTER sites and SETs belonging to the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS).  She found that there was an inverse relationship between elevation an accretion in low elevation marshes but not in high elevation marshes.  She also found that large deposition events, defined as an annual sedimentation rate of more than 1 cm, were fairly common and had occurred at least once in the last 20 years at 17 of our 22 sites and that a number of sites had seen up to 5 large deposition events.  This data was presented at the Spring meeting of the New England Estuarine Research Society in 2023 (see attached pdf).  3) Jade has also been involved in outreach working with the USFWS.  She has helped put together some signage and informational brochures.  She set up two Chronolog stations (https://www.chronolog.io/) for them which will create crowd-sourced timelapses that monitor the environment and engage communities in science.    \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/01/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anne E Giblin"
