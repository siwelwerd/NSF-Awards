 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the organization of a National Science Foundation Directorate for Engineering Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) Proposal Writing Workshop. The workshop will be held in Arlington, Virginia on April 1-2, 2019, and it is expected that there will be about 300 attendees. The workshop will take place over one-and-a-half days and will include interactive sessions on good proposal writing practices, seminars by previous CAREER awardees, a mock CAREER proposal panel review, and a review session during which the attendees will have a chance to obtain feedback on project summaries of their own draft CAREER proposals. The attendees will also have an opportunity to interact with current NSF Program Directors both in one-on-one and in mock panel sessions. \r\n\r\nThis workshop will help to prepare CAREER program eligible faculty for careers in education and research by giving them tools and skills of good proposal writing for submissions to the CAREER program as well as core NSF programs. The objectives of the workshop include training for junior faculty with an emphasis on women and underrepresented minorities in engineering. A special additional emphasis will be placed on encouraging CAREER program eligible faculty from non-\"Research-1\" institutions to apply for participation. The workshop will serve as an introduction NSF for many new researchers. The workshop will help participants to clarify their research and education career plans and to understand the need to clearly articulate these plans to external reviewers. In addition, the workshop includes mock panel sessions to give participants the experience of simulated panel evaluation discussions. All of the content and experiences will help attendees enrich their skills of writing successful research proposals for impactful research that benefits societal needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Furthermore, 69 participants have received their first NSF award of any kind since the conclusion of the 2019 workshop.\n\nHistorical Success of the Workshop:  2010-2019\n\nThere were 2,741 unique applicants for the NSF CAREER Proposal Workshops between 2010 and 2019.  Of that group, 1,776 people attended at least one workshop and 965 people were non-participants.  \n\nParticipants came from 274 universities and 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia.

Workshop participants were surveyed at the end of each workshop.  Figure 1 shows overall participant ratings for workshops between 2010 and 2019.  Overall, 97.1% of workshop participants were Very Satisfied (69.8%) or Satisfied (27.4%) with what they learned from the workshop.  98.2% of workshop participants said they would recommend the workshop to other CAREER proposal submitters (85.7% gave their highest recommendation).  97.1% of workshop participants gave and overall workshop rating of Excellent (69.4%) or Very Good (27.7%). Annual participant evaluations are provided in Figures 2-4. \n\nResult 2.  388 workshop participants (21.8%) compared to 208 non-participants (21.6%) subsequently earned a CAREER grant.  Furthermore, 1,016 workshop participants (57.2%) compared to 516 non-participants (53.5%) subsequently earned at least one NSF grant after the workshop.  \n\nResult 3.  952 of the applicants (34.7%) and 716 of the workshop participants (40.3%) self-identified as being from an underrepresented group.  178 of the URM workshop participants (24.9%) subsequently received an NSF CAREER grant compared to 48 CAREER award winners from among the URM non-participants (20.3%).  \n\nResult 4.  Of the 411 workshop applicants from Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), 240 were participants and 171 were non-participants.  42 of the participants from an MSI (17.5%) compared to 25 (14.6%) of the non-participants from an MSI subsequently earned CAREER awards.  \n\nResult 5.  Of the 1,907 workshop applicants from VHRA Institutions, 1,205 were participants.  326 of the participants (27.1%) compared to 175 (24.9%) of the non-participants subsequently earned CAREER awards.  \n\nResult 6.  Of the 622 workshop applicants from HRA Institutions, 436 were participants.  55 of the participants (12.6%) compared to 26 (14.0%) of the non-participants subsequently earned CAREER awards.  This is the only group analyzed in which workshop non-participants outperformed workshop participants in earning CAREER awards.  \n\nLearnings\n\nParticipants most frequently mentioned the following workshop activities as being most helpful:  1) interactive mock panel review and project summary sessions; 2) the opportunity to interact with peers and current and former NSF program officers; and 3) presentations by CAREER award winners and senior NSF program officers.\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nThese workshops would not have been possible without NSF support and the efforts of numerous NSF program officers and senior engineering faculty who invested their time to mentor early career engineering faculty.   \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/31/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bradley A Kramer"
