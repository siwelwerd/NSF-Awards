 "awd_abstract_narration": "This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project addresses the geotechnical engineering research needed to assess the feasibility of using solar thermal energy to improve the mechanical properties of soft soil deposits over different depth ranges.  Specifically, heated fluid collected from solar thermal panels circulated through closed-loop geothermal heat exchangers in the subsurface is used to induce thermal volumetric contraction and a corresponding increase in shear strength of a targeted zone of soil.  Arrays of geothermal heat exchangers in vertical and horizontal configurations will be investigated to improve soil over different depth ranges and areal distributions.  Advantages of this approach are that soil improvement can be gained in a targeted manner using renewable energy, after which the geothermal heat exchangers can be used for long-term underground thermal energy storage, yielding cost savings when compared to available soft soil improvement technologies.  The research plan seeks to better understand fundamental processes governing the thermal volume change of soft soils over different depth ranges and to improve constitutive models for soft soils needed in advanced computer simulations, addressing the NSF mission \"to promote the progress of science.\"  If feasible, solar thermal energy and geothermal heat exchangers will be important tools for the cost-effective improvement of challenging soft soil deposits encountered in civil infrastructure projects, offshore or river sediments, mine tailings dams, and coal ash impoundments.  This project will introduce undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds to research through established summer programs at UCSD like STARS and ENLACE.   \r\n \r\nA fundamental issue investigated in this study that will impact the feasibility of solar thermal soil improvement is the possible impact of the initial mean effective stress (or initial void ratio) on the magnitude of drained thermal volume change of normally consolidated soils for a given temperature increment.  Although existing thermo-elasto-plastic models indicate that all normally consolidated soils should have the same thermal volume change due to thermal hardening, limited data available for heating of normally consolidated soils indicate that soils lower in initial mean effective stress and higherin initial void ratio may experience greater thermal volume changes and greater increases in undrained shear strength after improvement.  If these limited data are valid, this would indicate that shallower soils may experience greater improvement for a given temperature increment.  The objective of this project is to better understand the thermal volume change of normally consolidated clay through a comprehensive experimental testing program in a thermal triaxial cell and to use the experimental results to enhance existing drained thermo-elasto-plastic models and undrained thermal pressurization models.  Along these lines, this project seeks to investigate potential impacts of temperature and mean effective stress on key material properties including the thermal hardening parameter, the coefficient of thermal expansion of the soil skeleton and the coefficient of compressibility of the soil.  Using the knowledge gained from this investigation, this project seeks to unify predictions from the transient coupled heat transfer and water flow process associated with solar thermal soil improvement with the observed trends in drained thermal volume change.  The unified model will be used to simulate solar thermal soil improvement process to understand the roles of heat exchanger geometry and solar thermal boundary conditions in reaching different degrees of soil improvement.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Thermal soil improvement involves transfer of heat collected from renewable sources (solar thermal panels) to the subsurface via closed-loop geothermal heat exchangers, which can be encased within a permeable drainage material to form a thermal drain. Heating of soft soils using the thermal drains leads to the generation of pore water pressures which dissipate over time and will lead to thermal contraction in normally consolidated soils. Advantages of this ground improvement approach are that volumetric contraction and increased undrained shear strength are gained in a targeted manner using renewable energy, and that the geothermal heat exchangers can be used for underground heat storage after ground improvement. The intellectual merit of this study lies in confirming the key research hypothesis that thermal soil improvement of normally consolidated clays is sensitive to the initial effective stress in the soil layer. A series of thermal triaxial tests indicate that the thermal volume change and undrained shear strength will be greater in soils with higher mean effective stress for the same change in temperature. This observation was a departure from predictions in previously-developed constitutive models for thermal volume change, so another outcome of this study was the development of a new constitutive model that can capture the effects of initial effective stress on the thermal volume change of normally consolidated clays. This constitutive model was incorporated into a coupled heat transfer and water flow analysis and was implemented to simulate the transient behavior of thermal drains in soft clay layers. Additional experiments were performed in this study to evaluate the changes in small-strain shear modulus of soft clays during drained and undrained heating, the effect of partial drainage on the thermal volume change process, and the impact of temperature changes on the mean effective preconsolidation stress. This study resulted in a total of 5 journal papers and 4 conference papers. Broader impacts include introducing undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds to research through the STARS and ENLACE summer programs at UCSD, and the participation of the female PhD student supported by this project in the NSF INTERN program through an internship with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The experimental-numerical outcomes of this study also provide a new tool for strategically applying thermal soil improvement to enhance the behavior of soft soil layers in the field, with a positive side effect of using the thermal soil improvement system for thermal energy storage after improvement is complete. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/29/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: John&nbsp;S&nbsp;Mccartney</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1941571/1941571_10632533_1664494351676_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1941571/1941571_10632533_1664494351676_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Implementation of thermal drains\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1941571/1941571_10632533_1664494351676_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Implementation of thermal drains\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This figure shows how thermal drains can be implemented to improve the mechanical properties of soft clay layers.
