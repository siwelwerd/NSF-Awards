 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF Convergence Accelerator supports team-based, multidisciplinary efforts that address challenges of national importance and show potential for deliverables in the near future.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impact and potential benefit of this Convergence Accelerator Phase I project is to facilitate easier access to the full range of court records, which should enable more effective systematic research and promote greater analysis on how the federal courts operate and are utilized. The US litigation system is the primary mechanism through which our laws are formally enforced. Understanding how effectively the litigation system operates is critical to maintaining public trust, which is one reason why the courts maintain detailed records of all federal litigation.\r\n\r\nDevelopment of the proposed Northwestern Open Access to Court Records Initiative (NOACRI) open resource brings together legal scholars, criminologist, sociologists, computer scientists, statisticians, and complexity scholars to build a unique open knowledge network that will enable the convergence of a broad range of diverse communities--including legal scholars, social scientists, economists, journalists, and public policy stakeholders to more systematically study the federal legal system. NOACRI proposes to enable both analytically savvy and inexperienced users to interrogate the court data assembled. The project proposes to create unparalleled access to both raw case data and data annotations, including data annotated by the project team and data that are community-annotated. This more accessible data should also enable development of machine-learning and artificial intelligence (AI) tools to study court data systematically.\r\n \r\nThis project proposes to expand the substantial scholarly potential of court records by bringing recent methodological advances in big data analytics to bear on the field of legal research. To date, researchers have, by necessity, tended to focus primarily on the text of judicial opinions. This project will create an open and free resource of public litigation data, linked to supplementary publicly available data, that will dramatically advance the quantitative understanding of the workings of the federal court system. Importantly, it seeks to make visible and measurable data on cases that are settled or dismissed. Settled and dismissed cases may constitute well over half of federal court activity but is rarely published on court websites or otherwise available for free, limiting systematic study. This research will also aid in the development of data federation standards and natural language querying approaches that will benefit researchers in other subject areas that have a similar need to extract systematic insights from text.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Despite the longstanding recognition of the scholarly potential contained within the granular information of these records, legal research has not yet benefited from the methodological advances in big data and analytics like other fields.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The goal of the SCALES OKN is to enable the public at large to directly observe, evaluate, and engage with the work of the courts. During the grant reporting period we made enormous progress towards this goal.&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically: (1) we obtained the input of individuals through surveys, user interviews, and group workshops; (2) we identified the characteristics of the primary users of the OKN; (3) we identified the needs of the primary OKN users; and (4) we identified the set of tools that already exist or need to be developed in order to enable systematic content analyses of litigation events.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Obtaining input.</strong>&nbsp;We initially interviewed both criminal and civil lawyers at non-profits as well as academic legal scholars and journalists. We used these data as a springboard to reimagine who our potential users were, what they needed from a resource that would enable systematic analysis of court records, and what were their common issues and needs that could form a&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">minimum viable product.</span></p>\n<p>To guide the ideation of user personas, we created a template centered around three points: (i) persona identity, (ii) persona data and legal know-how, and (iii) persona's goal for interaction with court data. The template enabled our team to create 54 user personas.&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent analysis identified many commonalities in our descriptions of empirical legal scholars and data journalists.&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating a large number of use personas enabled us to better understand our intended and potential users. It was also instrumental in rethinking the skill matrix that we use to classify OKN users. For example, legal knowledge cannot be viewed as a single dimension - bringing a case to court and analyzing the impact of case law are fundamentally different.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broadening Participation.</strong>&nbsp;Guided by our new user matrix, we developed and deployed an online survey to measure respondent proficiency along the four dimensions identified in our user matrix and to identify examples of the questions the respondent would use the OKN to investigate.&nbsp;A majority of the participants were comfortable with general keyword searching and reading graphs, and few had advanced coding skills. Based on the surveys we were able to refine the user personas further into three categories and incorporate information about their general level of technical skill in interacting with and interpreting data (Figure 1). Guided by the insights gained from survey responses, we&nbsp;conducted a second round of in-person interviews.&nbsp;Based on this data, we uncovered four main user needs: (1) easy and free access to data; (2) intuitive search interfaces; (3) help with interpretation of documents; and (4) simple enumeration of cases and downloading for research purposes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We developed and tested a wireframe prototype interface based on our research (Figure 2). The flow of the user interface incorporates many elements that address user needs, including a more robust ability to filter results, as well as novel features such as visualizations that aren't available in existing products.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on additional user interviews using the prototype, we found that users found certain elements difficult given their previous experience. Notably, moving from a search page directly to data visualizations confused users given their past experience with text-based search interfaces. Most users wanted to be able to 'see' all of the cases and be able to scroll through results first. This feedback has informed our development of the alpha user interface?one that allows for flexible searching, search history, and easy sharing (Figure 3).&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Minimum Viable Product.</strong>&nbsp;We followed the 'notebook' metaphor pioneered by&nbsp;<em>Mathematica</em>&nbsp;and popularized by the&nbsp;<em>Jupyter&nbsp;</em>notebook project. Each notebook can store multiple searches, which can be accessed using a navigation sidebar. In response to user input, we implemented a 'data focused' search model. Every new cell in a notebook starts by displaying the full set of records in the database as paginated results. This allows users to track the current composition of the database. A user can then add filters to narrow the displayed results. After adding a filter, the search results are immediately updated, enabling the user to learn how the filter restricted the data, and to determine whether the filter used produced the desired behavior. Besides displaying data, notebook cells also support basic statistical and time series analyses of the search results.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/05/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Adam&nbsp;R&nbsp;Pah</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1937123/1937123_10641146_1628089682605_figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1937123/1937123_10641146_1628089682605_figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1937123/1937123_10641146_1628089682605_figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Three primary user groups identified in user interviews.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">SCALES OKN</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Adam&nbsp;R&nbsp;Pah</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1937123/1937123_10641146_1628089764845_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1937123/1937123_10641146_1628089764845_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1937123/1937123_10641146_1628089764845_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Wireframe prototype of the visualizations page.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">SCALES OKN</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Adam&nbsp;R&nbsp;Pah</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1937123/1937123_10641146_1628089835672_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1937123/1937123_10641146_1628089835672_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1937123/1937123_10641146_1628089835672_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Alpha Prototype of SCALES OKN.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">SCALES OKN</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Adam&nbsp;R&nbsp;Pah</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
