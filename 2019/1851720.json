The group will include political scientists, economists, sociologists, ecologists, biologists, and anthropologists who all study the ability of groups to self-organize to solve social dilemmas. The goal is to better understand how individuals behave when faced with social dilemmas and how social context and institutions support or fail to support resolution of social dilemmas. Topics include the provision and protection of public goods, international conflict, and alternatives to direct government control of resource management decisions. The conference includes junior researchers, including graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and assistant professors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
