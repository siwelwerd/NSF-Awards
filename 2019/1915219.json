 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research activities of Professors S. Dubovskiy, G. Gabadadze, M. Porrati, and A. Sirlin at New York University. \r\n\r\nThe research activities of these four investigators center around several topics aimed at answering some of the truly fundamental questions in physics: How to best determine the fundamental constants of nature? What is the correct theory of gravity? What is gravity at cosmic scales? How is cosmology constrained by string theory or quantum gravity? Are there different models that explain the past and present accelerated expansion of the Universe? How can we describe strongly interacting subatomic matter? Can quantum gravity be solved in simple \"toy model\" settings? The PIs will work towards answering these questions both in parallel and in collaboration, involving postdocs and graduate students in the research process. As a result, research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of new physical laws. This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts, including the training of a new generation of scientists at all levels. Dissemination of results will also include review articles for specialized and popular science journals, organization of workshops, video- and Internet-based courses, and popular lectures. \r\n\r\nMore technically, Professor Dubovskiy will continue to study many aspects of a special deformation of quantum field theories, called \"T-T bar,\" and its applications to two-dimensional gravity, confining strings, and to a novel perspective on the hierarchy and cosmological-constant problems. Professor Gabadadze will search for possible UV-complete theories of massive gravity, and study holographic QCD as well as a theory of condensed-matter systems giving rise to equations for their sound modes that are identical to the ones Hawking solved to predict black-hole radiation.  Professor Porrati will study simple models of gravity and supergravity, the infrared dynamics of gravity and ague theories, inflation in supergravity, and the link between massive gravity in three dimensions and conformal field theories.  Professor Sirlin will apply a novel approach to evaluate electroweak corrections in important elementary particle-physics processes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
