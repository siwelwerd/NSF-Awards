 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to evaluate the concentrations and properties of atmospheric pollen particles that rupture under extreme weather conditions.  Pollen fragments can contribute significantly to atmospheric particle number and mass during spring and summer thunderstorms and rain events. There is currently little information about the size-resolved concentrations and properties of pollen fragments in the atmosphere. Because pollens pose significant health risks to populations with respiratory diseases, understanding when and why high levels of pollen fragments occur will serve as a strong scientific basis to protect sensitive populations, through early-warning systems and/or other mitigation strategies.\r\n\r\nField measurements of size-resolved atmospheric pollen fragments will be made in spring and summer in suburban Iowa City IA under a variety of meteorological conditions, leading to a better understanding of exactly when peak concentrations of airborne pollen fragments occur and how long they persist in the atmosphere. Chemical methods will be applied to quantify molecular tracers of pollens in size-resolved ambient particulate matter samples. Optical microscopy will be used to identify intact pollens based on diagnostic traits of size and shape, exine sculpturing, and features of apertures (size, number, and type) using pollen identification keys for the Midwestern United States.  Species of pollen fragments will be identified and quantified using highly-specific enzyme immunoassays in size-resolved particulate matter samples. \r\n \r\nThis EAGER project is highly exploratory as it seeks to characterize an atmospheric phenomenon of unknown frequency. The project's success depends on the precise occurrence of a combination of seasonal and meteorological factors that are conducive to producing fragmented pollen particles. The potential benefit to be gained from this research is significant, as a better understanding of the conditions under which pollen fragments are formed will enable improved predictions of high allergen content in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
