 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomers are beginning to directly image exoplanets and obtain spectroscopic data. One of the chief barriers in interpreting the data is a complete understanding of condensate clouds. Typically, the data from exoplanet atmospheres are not good enough (and the sample size is too small) for direct determination of cloud properties. The standard technique involves 'forward-modeling' of planetary atmospheres from first principles using a grid technique. This work will use isolated, young brown dwarfs as analogs for massive exoplanet atmospheres. The team will use spectral inversion techniques on data from this population to make direct interpretations of brown dwarf atmospheres. These brown dwarfs typically have properties very similar to imaged exoplanets: temperature, luminosity, age, color, spectral features. However, they lack an obscuring parent star. This makes the spectra greatly easier to collect and allows for a much larger sample size.\r\n\r\nThe team will examine a set of 26 young (5-130 Myr) isolated brown dwarfs from the same stellar associations in which large exoplanets have been discovered and imaged. They will use the BREWSTER code, developed by one of the team collaborators, to conduct spectral inversions. These inversions, along with empirical spectral energy fits and forwarding modeling using the BT SETTL code, will be used to (1) derive and compare fundamental parameters, (2) assess the dependence of cloud dynamics on environment, color and spectral features of the source object, and (3) examine compositional variations among directly-imaged exoplanets and exoplanet analogs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n \r\n\n\nThis program aimed to glean information about the atmospheres of brown dwarfs  sources that form like stars but lack enough mass for sustained nuclear fusion. The goal was to use a method called retrievals which begins with observed data and then uses input chemistry and physics to computationally model the atmospheric composition that led to the observations. Over the course of the award we set-up an open-source retrieval package called Brewster to examine numerous brown dwarfs. Our aim was to characterize the atmospheres of young brown dwarfs as those sources have complex and intriguing weather. Over the course of this award, we published several papers on benchmark young brown dwarfs including the discovery that patchy forsterite clouds were present in the atmospheres of two highly variable exoplanet analogs (Vos et al. 2023), and the discovery that enstatite and quartz clouds were a likely explanation for what was happening in the atmosphere of 2M2224-0158 (Burningham et al. 2021). We published a low-gravity retrievals framework paper as well as a lessons learned paper on how to approach low gravity brown dwarfs or giant exoplanets (Phillips et al. 2024, Whiteford et al. 2023) and we examined low metallicity or field brown dwarfs as a comparative sample for the younger/lower gravity brown dwarfs (Gonzales et al. 2022, Calamari et al. 2022). On the education and dissemination side, we worked on a collaborative database called SIMPLE which is open to the public and allows us to output observational and computational results to the full astronomical community. We worked with pre-service teachers that participate in the American Museum of Natural Historys Masters in Teaching (MAT) program each summer during this award to train them on how to work with the SIMPLE database to investigate sources that we would then perform a retrieval on. MAT alumni Deion Desir was brought on for a research education for teachers (RET) program to work with PI Faherty on disseminating the exciting scientific results of this program to the general public. Desir worked with Faherty on building results into planetarium programming so the science could be presented in an accessible format that was delivered during evening public programs over the course of this award.\r\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/12/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JacquelineKFaherty\n"
