Students and postdocs attending the summer school will be introduced to the basic mathematical theory and trained in the use of the associated computer systems.  They will also be exposed to current research and open problems, and provided with the necessary tools and resources to begin their own research, independently and in collaboration with others.  The summer school will take place over four days, followed by a research-oriented conference of 6 days.  Further information can be found at the website: https://hott.github.io/HoTT-2019.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
