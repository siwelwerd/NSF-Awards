 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many applications in the real world, such as online \r\nshopping, recommendation, social media and information \r\nsecurity, involve interactions among different \r\nentities. For example, online shopping behaviors can \r\nbe simply described by the interactions between \r\ncustomers, commodities and shopping web sites. These \r\ninteractions are naturally represented by tensors, \r\nwhich are arrays of multiple dimensions. Each \r\ndimension represents a type of entities (e.g., \r\ncustomers or commodities), and each element describes \r\na particular interaction (e.g, purchased/not \r\npurchased). The project aims to develop flexible and \r\nefficient tensor decomposition approaches that can \r\ndiscover a variety of complicated relationships \r\nbetween the entities in tensors, handle a tremendous \r\namount of data from practical applications, and adapt \r\nto rapid data growth. The developed approaches can be \r\nused to promote many important prediction and \r\nknowledge discovery tasks, such as improving the \r\nrecommendation accuracy, predicting advertisement \r\nclick rates, understanding how misinformation propagation \r\nthrough social media, and detecting malicious cell- \r\nphone apps. \r\n\r\nDespite the success of the existing tensor \r\ndecomposition approaches, they use multilinear \r\ndecomposition forms or shallow kernels, and are \r\nincapable of capturing highly complicated \r\nrelationships in data. However, complex and nonlinear \r\nrelationships, effects and patterns are ubiquitous, \r\ndue to the diversity and complexity of the practical \r\napplications. Furthermore, there is a lack of \r\nefficient, scalable nonlinear decomposition algorithms \r\nto handle static tensors nowadays at unprecedented \r\nscales, and dynamic tensors that grow fast and \r\ncontinuously. The project aims to develop scalable \r\ndeep Bayesian tensor decomposition approaches that \r\nmaximize the flexibility to capture all kinds of \r\ncomplex relationships, efficiently process static data \r\nat unprecedented scales and rapid data streams, and \r\nprovide uncertainty quantification for both embedding \r\nestimations and predictions. The research will be \r\naccomplished through: (1) the design of new Bayesian \r\ntensor decomposition models that incorporate deep \r\narchitectures to improve the capability of estimating \r\nintricate functions, (2) the development of \r\ndecentralized, asynchronous learning algorithms to \r\nprocess extremely large-scale static tensors, (3) the \r\ndevelopment of online incremental learning algorithms \r\nto handle rapid data streams and to produce responsive \r\nupdates upon receiving new data, without retraining \r\nfrom scratch, and (4) comprehensive evaluations on \r\nboth synthetic and real-world big data. The proposed \r\nresearch will contribute a markedly improved tensor \r\ndecomposition toolset that are powerful to estimate \r\narbitrarily complex relationships, scalable to static \r\ntensors at unprecedented scales (e.g., billions of \r\nnodes and trillions of entries) and to fast data \r\nstreams with efficient incremental updates. Moreover, \r\nas Bayesian approaches, the toolset are resilient to \r\nnoise, provide posterior distributions for \r\nuncertainty quantification, and integrate all possible \r\noutcomes into robust predictions. Once the toolsets are \r\navailable, the understanding of the high-order \r\nrelationships in tensors, and the mining of associated \r\npatterns, such as communities and anomalies, will be \r\nenormously enhanced; the predictive performance for \r\nthe quantify of interests, such as social links, \r\nclick-through-rates, and recommendation, will be \r\ndramatically promoted.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
