 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Instrumentation Programs. Professor William Harman from the University of California Riverside and colleague Vincent Lavallo are acquiring a single crystal diffractometer equipped with a molybdenum source. In general, an X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here impact many areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. The X-ray laboratory personnel utilize the diffractometer to foster an inclusive climate for underrepresented minority students. In addition, the laboratory plays an important role in strengthening the relationship between the University and local high school and community college students. The X-ray facility also provides service to neighboring primarily undergraduate institutions serving the region. \r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. The diffractometer is used in the exploration of small molecule activation with redox-active boranes and in studies of carborane-based ligands for use in catalysis. It is also useful for investigating high capacity magnesium batteries having carborane electrolytes and for studying olefin metathesis catalysis.  In addition, it is being utilized for the characterization of organometallic scandium complexes and metal-ligand assemblies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
