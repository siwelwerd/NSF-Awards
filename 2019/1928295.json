 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  \"Geometric and Asymptotic Group Theory with Applications\" (GAGTA) conference will be held in Bar Ilan, Israel, during May 26--30, 2019. Geometric and asymptotic group theory is an essential part of modern mathematics. It interfaces with a number of important areas of mathematics and theoretical computer science, including low-dimensional topology, geometry, graph theory, combinatorics, complexity theory, and information theory, in particular information security. The synergistic effect of the interactions between people in these areas that the conference will promote has the potential to result in significant advances in research. The technological and societal impact of the conference stems from  potential wide applications to electronic communication and information security. A special session on \"Applications to information security\" will emphasize these applications, in particular to post-quantum cryptography.\r\n\r\nThis conference will be devoted to the study of a variety of topics in geometric and asymptotic group theory, with special emphasis on interactions with other areas, including model theory, theoretical computer science, and applications to information security. The speakers include leading specialists in various aspects of the geometric, asymptotic, and algorithmic group theory. More specifically, this includes: group actions, quasi-isometries, growth, asymptotic invariants, random walks, algorithmic problems and their complexity. A special emphasis will be made on an emerging area that studies problems in group theory motivated by computer science. The conference website is http://gagta.math.biu.ac.il/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
