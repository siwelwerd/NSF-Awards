 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cleveland State University, together with the Teaching Institute for Excellence in STEM (TIES), will design and pilot ways for computer science (CS) faculty to engage with and contribute to preK-12 CS learning opportunities in their communities. The two-year project, called CompPath (for Composing Pathways for Collaboration Between Computer Science Researchers and Practitioners) will explore the creation of meaningful and authentic connections between cutting-edge computer science research and K-12. It will emphasize the translation of research products in a manner that broadens participation by being inclusive of, and appealing to, women, people of color, and other under-represented minorities. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, the project will \r\n\r\n> Create demonstrative collaborations between researchers that will serve as models to other computing researchers across the country; \r\n> Collect an inventory of opportunities that a CS researcher can leverage to incorporate outreach activities in their research project in a sustainable and authentic manner;\r\n> Design and launch a searchable clearinghouse infrastructure that will allow CS researchers and other Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)-related groups located in proximate regions to easily find each other; and\r\n> Host a series of \"design studio\" events that are focused on meaningful collaborations between CS researchers and providers of Broadening Participation in Computing resources.\r\n\r\nIn its dissemination, the project will leverage the network of the STEM Learning Ecosystems Community of Practice (SLECoP), an initiative comprising 68 communities across the US focused on dynamic, cross-sector STEM engagement\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project began with a deep dive into the relationships between high-school computer science educators and computer science professors.  We discovered that each group was highly interested in working with the other.  High School Computer Science Educators wanted learning opportunities for their students and to have access to the latest research in Computer Science.  Computer Science professors wanted opportunities to interact with high school computer science educators and students to develop pathways for increasing application/enrollment in computer science degree programs, and to broaden participation in computing degrees.\n\n\nThe workshop was built around the creation of a project that the two groups could develop and implement together that gives students a real-world experience in computer science.  While these projects were not part of the grant award, working together on a project was the vehicle for establishing long-term relationships between high school and collegiate CS professionals. \n\n\nThe first iteration of this workshop was successfully held in Cleveland, Ohio and outside of Philadelphia, PA.  In these workshops, educators worked together to learn about the benefits of ongoing collaboration and to determine local pathways for focus.  Teams created projects and were excited to develop and implement those projects.\n\n\nOne example of a project, from the Clevaland cohort, involved partnership with a professor of Data Analytics from John Carroll University.  A community participant at this particular event was a leader at the Great Lakes Science Center.  The developed project involved students from area schools engaging with over ten years of customer satisfaction data from the center.  Additionally, students would directly interview visitors to the center.  As part of planning this project, it was determined that a large portion of data analytics rests in the ability to tell a story based on the data, so english educators were pulled into the planning process.  The most exciting part, however, was that the science center committed to adding or eliminating exhibits based on the students? findings.  In other words, these high school students would be able to see tangible evidence of their own impact on a major local institution. \n\n\nAt this stage of the grant cycle, the COVID-19 Pandemic dramatically shifted education in this country.  While Cleveland still plans to execute this project, school districts disallowed students from critical components.  Further, the second round of implementation had to shift to a virtual design and platform.\n\n\nThe second round of cohorts included North Country, New York and Broward County, Florida were held during multiple virtual synchronous sessions over Zoom.  Obviously, a workshop designed about relationship building is more difficult and less effective in a virtual setting.  However, we designed this virtual experience to still have the same touchpoints and outcomes as the in-person event.  This required a complete redesign of the entire workshop.  \n\n\nThere was one major benefit  to a virtual event - it allowed for the North Country cohort.  The educators in North Country, NY were as many as 2 hours away from each other and would not have been able to participate in an in-person event.  Further, because the second round of events were run during the COVID-19 pandemic, the projects designed by these groups were able to continue even under that umbrella of restrictions.\n\n\nConversations with local leads for this work indicated that these local ecosystems found value in participation and that relationships of the participants were continuing.  The pandemic did change the event, but we learned that it is still possible, if more difficult, to create successful communities of practice in virtual and in-person environments.\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/18/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Debbie K Jackson"
