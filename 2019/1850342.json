 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fifty years of research in database systems has focused on a canonical two-tier \r\nstorage hierarchy with the volatile memory and durable storage technologies. \r\nA database system's buffer manager provides efficient access to data stored \r\non storage by migrating it to volatile memory. The data migration policy \r\nemployed by the buffer manager in existing systems is predicated on the \r\nassumptions that storage is orders of magnitude slower than volatile memory. \r\nBut emerging non-volatile memory technologies are poised to upend these design \r\nassumptions. They provide fast accesses like volatile memory but with \r\npersistent writes like storage. The traditional approaches for buffer \r\nmanagement are incompatible with this new hardware landscape. This project \r\noutlines a research agenda to study and develop novel buffer management \r\ntechniques for non-volatile memory. The project will result in algorithms for \r\nshrinking the cost of large-scale in-memory data processing. The key lessons \r\nlearned from this project will be integrated into the graduate-level course \r\non database systems at Georgia Tech, educating students about the challenges \r\nand opportunities in non-volatile memory database systems.\r\n\r\nThe technical aims of the project are divided into three interacting research \r\nthrusts. The first thrust develops a taxonomy of data migration policies for \r\nvolatile and non-volatile memory technologies. What makes this different than \r\nearlier attempts is that the buffer manager will dynamically leverage all the \r\ndata flow paths enabled by non-volatile memory to improve the database system's \r\nperformance. The second thrust develops a machine-learning model for \r\nautomatically tuning the data migration policy for an arbitrary workload and \r\nstorage hierarchy. Due to the unique price, capacity, and performance \r\ncharacteristics of non-volatile memory, it will be challenging for database \r\nadministrators to size the different levels of a multi-tier storage hierarchy. \r\nThe third thrust develops a storage system recommender to help administrators \r\nidentify the optimal hierarchy for their target workloads. These three \r\nresearch thrusts will be complemented by a comprehensive evaluation plan. \r\nThis research effort will have a profound impact on the adoption of \r\nnon-volatile memory technologies and will enable cost-effective, large-scale\r\ndata processing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
