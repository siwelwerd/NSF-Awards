 "awd_abstract_narration": "In almost every manufacturing sector, challenges exist in joining dissimilar materials due to the mismatches in their thermal, physical, and chemical properties. These challenges are exacerbated as component and system designs demand ever-increasing performance, and as interest in additive manufacturing of advanced multi-material structures continues to grow. A promising approach to prevent detrimental reactions at joint interfaces is to place an interlayer between the two metals, which can be used to improve ductility and prevent chemical diffusion of the base materials. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award supports research to establish a computational design methodology to accelerate the interlayer alloy design, providing new fundamental knowledge of the mechanisms that control diffusion and mechanical performance in these joints. This has the potential to enable joining of dissimilar and previously incompatible materials while optimizing performance for a wide range of applications in the automotive, aerospace and power generation industries. This project will also provide a platform for the education of the next generation of scientists and engineers in the field of joining and advanced manufacturing, with a focus on fundamental scientific knowledge, advanced computational skills, hands-on research experiences, and strong industrial engagement.\r\n\r\nMulti-principal element alloys have been reported to exhibit excellent mechanical properties. This work will provide critical insights to the thermodynamics, kinetics, and mechanics of multi-principal element alloys. The research program will investigate the relationships between diffusion behavior and composition, phase stability, and mechanical performance. Complex deformation mechanisms in multi-principal element alloys with a primary FCC phase will be investigated, using multiscale physics-based models and in-situ advanced characterization methods to reveal the underlying mechanisms, quantify the key parameters, and challenge existing theories.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This innovative concept opens a vast, multivariate composition design space to address longstanding manufacturing challenges existing&nbsp;&nbsp;in joining of similar and dissimilar materials due to the mismatches in their physical and chemical properties, and thus enable fabrication of complex multi-material structures. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award supported transformative research to establish a computational design methodology to accelerate the application-driven MPEA design and gain a fundamental knowledge of the mechanisms that determine the performance of the designed MPEAs themselves and the multi-material structures joined by the MPEAs. This research has demonstrated the potential to enable joining of previously incompatible materials while optimizing performance for a wide range of applications in the automotive, aerospace and power generation industries.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The underlying fundamental mechanisms investigated under this award include: (1) solidification and phase transformation behavior of select MPEAs, supporting their fabrication as standalone structural materials or fillers (i.e., transition interlayers); and (2) interface reactions between MPEAs and an array of existing advanced engineering materials (e.g., nickel-base superalloys, titanium alloys, and stainless steels), supporting the development of MPEAs for similar and dissimilar joining applications. Fristly, the state-of-the-art synchrotron X-ray diffraction technique (Fig. 1<a href=\"applewebdata://BF9B68A6-806C-4CBA-A68B-7CEC39A2FF5D#_msocom_1\">[BS1]</a>&nbsp;) at millisecond-scale temporal resolution and micron-scale spatial resolution was used to investigate the solidification behavior and phase transformations both within the MPEAs and at the multi-material interfaces. It was found that classical solidification theory for traditional alloy systems was largely applicable to single-phase MPEAs. However, there could be localized differences in composition between first and last solidifying regions, as evidenced by the difference in local inter-atomic spacings (Fig. 2<a href=\"applewebdata://BF9B68A6-806C-4CBA-A68B-7CEC39A2FF5D#_msocom_2\">[BS2]</a>&nbsp;), along with material properties. This finding accentuates the need to consider the impact of casting geometry in MPEA scale-up fabrications and MPEA composition on the ability to homogenize as-solidified material to ensure uniform properties. It also highlights the technical feasibility of MPEAs for joining applications, which only require a small volume of filler material that can be more easily homogenized than an ingot precursor to a structural component. Furthermore, within the vast MPEA design space available, it was found that certain composition subspaces display excellent tolerance to interactions with disparate base materials in that they are extremely resistant to the formation of deleterious phases upon compositional changes. This behavior was demonstrated by allowing an example MPEA to interact, by molten material intermixing, with a series of engineering alloys of varying chemical complexity. The most complex cases, using advanced nickel-base superalloys, created mixed-material zones comprising up to 13 chemical elements, which required a novel approach to analyze by synchrotron X-ray diffraction since the constituent phase compositions could be highly disparate from those in published diffraction libraries. A statistical hard sphere model (Fig. 3) was developed as part of a methodology to overcome this challenge. A thorough analysis (Fig. 4) determined that mixed material zones contained only phases that were native to the nickel superalloy, except for minor oxide contaminants from MPEA fabrication processes. This resistance to deleterious phase formation also translated to up to a tenfold ductility improvement and comparable strength when the selected MPEA was applied as brazing filler metal to solid-solution nickel alloys, in comparison to a conventional boron-containing filler that promotes deleterious phases (Fig. 5).</p>\n<p>These findings iteratively informed a&nbsp;suite of computational design<a href=\"applewebdata://BF9B68A6-806C-4CBA-A68B-7CEC39A2FF5D#_msocom_3\">[BS3]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;strategies to eliminate trial-and-error in the application-driven design of MPEA compositions. This rapid design framework became a cornerstone value for the incorporation of HYSA Fillers LLC, co-founded by the PI and two of her graduate students involved in this research. HYSA is a small business with a mission to broaden the impact of this foundational research by bringing to market MPEA compositions for industrial manufacturing use cases. In 2022, HYSA received an NSF SBIR Phase I commercialization grant, which was spent retiring critical risks in manufacturing high-quality MPEA filler with reliable composition control and low oxygen contamination and identifying specific use cases primed for early adoption. A Phase II proposal has been submitted, which focuses on tailoring MPEA fillers for early adopter cases and establishing manufacturing capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The broader impacts of this CAREER award extend beyond this commercialization effort. The research conducted on MPEAs for brazing filler metal applications spurred the PI&rsquo;s working vision to bring her institution to the forefront of brazing education in America, an area of study that has long been only accessible in one other domestic program. Further, to serve the associated professional community, the PI and members of this project&rsquo;s team are coauthoring on chapters of the next edition of the American Welding Society&rsquo;s Brazing Handbook.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 09/24/2024<br>\nModified by: Zhenzhen&nbsp;Yu</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1847630/1847630_10589355_1727230673412_fIGURE_4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1847630/1847630_10589355_1727230673412_fIGURE_4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1847630/1847630_10589355_1727230673412_fIGURE_4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 4.
