 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Summary\r\n\r\nDuring the past millennia, humans have learned how to make strong materials by mixing more than one metal, i.e alloying. The traditional method has involved adding small amounts of alloying elements to a base metal. This process led to creation of the most famous metal alloy, steel, which is responsible for the industrial revolution and consequently a giant leap forward in technological advances of the human civilization. Despite great progress in making advanced steels as well as other types of more modern alloys, such as Ni base alloys for high temperature applications and Al and Mg alloys for light weighting, there still remain numerous fundamental questions regarding the underlying mechanisms through which these materials respond to loading. The answer to this question is the most important consideration when designing load bearing structures, from buildings and bridges to cars and airplanes. Moreover, with the modern technological advances, there is an urgent need to design new materials, capable of enduring complicated and often contradictory conditions, such as strength, formability and exposure to extreme situations such as high temperature or corrosive environments. On the other hand, recent progress in metallurgy has opened up the possibility of creating multicomponent metal alloys with much more complex compositions than conventional alloys. This program seeks to establish a rigorous relationship between alloy composition, the way it is processed, and how it responds to loading, thereby providing a physics-based predictive path to design new alloys for tailored structural properties. The program combines advanced modeling and experimental approaches. Interesting compositions for study will be identified using cutting-edge computational techniques.  Experiments are designed to create predicted alloy compositions using efficient methods to rapidly explore a wide range of compositions, and characterization of internal material defects induced during deformation. In addition, this program will provide an opportunity to engage and train a diverse population of students from high school, to undergraduate and graduate levels, through hands on projects utilizing state of the art experimental and computational techniques to contribute towards educating the next generation of STEM workforce.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Summary\r\n\r\nNovel, high-throughput computations and experiments are proposed over a wide range of compositions to test the hypothesis that deformation mechanisms and consequent properties in multicomponent fcc-based alloys can be favorably tuned by composition. This proposal seeks to develop a comprehensive understanding of deformation mechanisms in a wide range of fcc solid solutions, including deviation from equiatomic compositions, and specifically to explore compositions for which twinning and hcp martensite effects may contribute to extraordinary strain hardening and ultimate strength potential.  Thus, the research objectives are to: (1) employ novel and efficient computational and combinatorial experimental approaches for creating desirable alloys; (2) understand the effect of stacking fault energy and relative fcc/hcp stability on the competing deformation mechanisms; (3) determine the evolution of deformation substructure with strain and the connection to remarkable strain hardening; and (4) characterize and model the deformation mechanisms operative at elevated temperature in association with anomalous hardening and dynamic strain aging.  An integrated computational/experimental framework will be applied to a broad range of CrCoNi ternary alloys, and to alloys beyond this ternary system, in order to make a direct, quantitative connection between the chemistry of fcc-based solid solutions, and active deformation mechanisms and mechanical behavior. A new Monte Carlo method based on density functional theory (DFT) recently developed by PI Ghazisaeidi will be employed to predict phase stability and segregation behavior.  Guided by these computations, PI Mills will conduct high-throughput experiments in order to reveal the complex relationships between composition, stacking fault energy, phase stability, and deformation mechanisms.  This proposal will challenge present measurements in low stacking fault energy alloys through in situ mechanical experiments which will enable improved correlation between experiment and DFT calculation.   Directly linking composition to phase stability and deformation mechanisms is necessary, as evidenced by the fact that TWIP steels with similar or lower stacking fault energies (when compared with CrCoNi) do not exhibit deformation-induced martensite (as does CrCoNi).  Study of these complex composition effects will be extended to higher temperatures where evidence for strong solute interaction is observed in mechanical response, such as anomalous hardening and serrated flow, but the chemical species and deformation mechanisms associated with these interactions have yet to be identified.  The proposed research will be extensible to other multicomponent alloys, including many important commercial alloys such as IN825, MP35, and Alloy 28 that share compositional commonality with the recently emerging fcc-based high entropy alloys, but presently lack detailed deformation mechanism understanding.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This program has focused on the effect of elemental additions to these alloys and provides additional space for understanding alloying effects on phase stablitilty and deformation processes in this new class of materials.&nbsp; Furthermore, correlating these compositon changes with a complete understanding of the deformation mechanisms operating under both monotonic and cyclic conditions has also been a focus of the present program.&nbsp; Three findings are highlighted in this summary:</p>\n<p><em>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Understanding the effect of modest alloying additions, specifically Al and Ti, on the stability of the FCC phase and the mechanisms of monotonic deformation of the base CoCrNi and Cantor (CrMnFeCoNi) alloys.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>The evolution of deformation substructures in a CrCoNi based medium entropy alloy with a small addition of Al and Ti was comprehensively characterized using a suite of electron microscopy techniques.&nbsp; The results show that plastic deformation in this alloy is achieved through the slip of a/2&lt;110&gt; dislocations, which are narrowly dissociated into Shockley partial dislocations on {111} slip planes. The dissociation distances of dislocations in alloyts with and without Al and Ti additions show that the stacking fault energy increases substantially for the former alloy, and that L1<sub>2</sub>-type ordered &gamma;&#697; domains exist in this alloy. As a result, dislocation slip in has strongly planar character, although no deformation twinning was observed, even at large strain levels of plastic deformation *see Figure 1). Dynamic refinement of slip bands plays an important role in strain hardening, and is surprisingly revealed to be as potent at producing strain hardening as is deformation twinning.&nbsp; We also used DFT calculations to investigate the phase stability, short range order and stacking fault energies of NiCoCr and NiCoCr+Al. Applying our newly developed multicell Monte Carlo ((MC)2) method to the NiCoCr system, showed no sign of phase separation. Further Monte Carlo simulation on individual cells revealed no short range order, indicative of the thermodynamic stability of this ternary solid solution alloy. However, with the addition of about 6 at.% Al, short range order started to occur in the same type of simulation. Moreover, we found that the average stacking fault energy of the NiCoCr+Al alloy is significantly higher than its ternary counterpart. These observations are consistent with the low twinning activity in NiCoCr+Al compared to that in NiCoCr.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Characterizing and modeling the deformation mechanisms operative beyond simple monotonic conditions at room temperature, including cyclic fatigue conditions.</em></p>\n<p>The cyclic plastic response and low cycle fatigue behavior of equiatomic CrCoNi medium entropy alloy at room temperature has been investigated related especially to the microstructural changes and microstructural mechanisms. Using multi-scale electron microscopy, down to atomic resolution imaging (see Figure 2), it was revealed for the first time that deformation twinning and localized HCP transformation can be present as a governing deformation mode in a wide interval of strain amplitudes. The twin/HCP &ldquo;embryos&rdquo; are associated with intensive dislocation slip bands comprising of mixture of defects, including extended intrinsic stacking faults of dissociated 1/2&lt;110&gt; dislocations, extrinsic stacking faults, nano-twins, and lens-shaped hexagonal-close packed regions.&nbsp; This new experimental evidence also allowed for the evaluation of existing, proposed models of twin nucleation.&nbsp; &nbsp;A modification of &ldquo;pole mechanism&rdquo; for creating the twin/HCP embryo seems to explain the results, and requires the interaction of the primary slip system with dislocation content on a secondary slip system.</p>\n<p><em>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Revealing the underlying mechanism associated with anomalous hardening in CrMnFeCoNi and CrCoNi after intermediate temperature annealing.</em></p>\n<p>Contrary to most metallic alloys that soften during post-deformation annealing, certain CrCoNi-based alloys do exhibit increases in strength and hardness (see Figure 3). This \"secondary hardening\" effect does not arise from the precipitation of additional phases, and the specific strengthening mechanism has not been conclusively determined. In our work, through advanced multiscale electron microscopy based characterization, it is shown that the annealing of CrCoNi and CrCoNi-Mo alloys causes Cr enrichment (and Co and Ni depletion) at planar faults, including deformation twins, generated during prior deformation (see Figure 3). No significant Mo segregation was observed. First-principle calculations and molecular dynamics / Monte Carlo simulations indicate that Cr segregation to nano-twins is energetically favorable. Despite minimal apparent driving force for Mo segregation, Mo may enhance Cr segregation. Additionally hardness measurements along a tensile specimen with continuously variable tensile strain before and after annealing were performed. The change in hardness was proportional to the amount of prior deformation, indicating a correlation between the amount of hardening and the density of deformation-induced planar faults. Collectively, these results prove that post-deformation annealing strengthens CoNiCr and CoNiCr-Mo alloys by facilitating Cr segregation to crystallographic defects, providing a new controllable lever to adjust the mechanical properties of compositionally complex alloys in the future.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/18/2023<br>\nModified by: Michael&nbsp;J&nbsp;Mills</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1905748/1905748_10623899_1702933720952_Outcomes_Fig3--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1905748/1905748_10623899_1702933720952_Outcomes_Fig3--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1905748/1905748_10623899_1702933720952_Outcomes_Fig3--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(a-d) Gradient strain sample and subsequent \"anomalous hardening\" after aging at 500\ufffdC.
