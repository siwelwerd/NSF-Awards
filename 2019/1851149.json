 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the response of the ocean to global warming, including changes in the renewal of ocean waters from the surface (ventilation), is important for future climate predictions. Oxygen distributions in the ocean thermocline are an effective way to infer changes in ventilation because physical processes (ventilation and circulation) that supply oxygen are primarily responsible for changes in interior oxygen concentrations. Reduced ventilation, as expected under global warming conditions, is signified by a reduction in oxygen inventories. However, natural variability such as decadal oscillations can obscure climatic trends; long-term data records are needed to fully distinguish between trends and cycles. This study will use available data, including Argo profiling floats, ship-based surveys, and satellite-derived surface densities, collected in the North Pacific over the past decades. This study is unique in that it examines physical mechanisms of ocean interior oxygen variability using a data-only approach, overcoming biases and misrepresentations possible with ocean models and reanalysis products. The team combines the expertise of two researchers in satellite oceanography and ocean hydrography respectively. Undergraduate summer interns will be incorporated into the project and trained in these fields with the goal of fostering geoscience education. Both PIs are also active in graduate student advising and outreach activities in public schools and at the Pacific Science Center. Results from this research will be included into such outreach, raising public awareness about the changing ocean environment. Monitoring ocean ventilation is important because a reduction in ventilation reduces the ocean ability to take up anthropogenic CO2 with important feedbacks to the global climate system. Declining North Pacific O2 concentrations may become stressors for marine organisms if threshold values are reached. The data methods used are transferrable to other ocean basins as well.\r\n\r\nThis project will focus on the North Pacific thermocline, where some of the world ocean's largest oxygen variations have been observed. These variations, described as bidecadal cycles on top of a small declining trend, are strongest on subsurface isopycnals that outcrop into the mixed layer the northwestern North Pacific. It has been hypothesized that changes in the isopycnal outcrop positions and area, including complete cessation of outcrop, are the cause for the subsurface oxygen changes observed downstream. Argo data will be combined with satellite sea surface data and ocean interior data from continued repeat hydrography sections, time series stations, and also emerging bio-Argo profiling floats (with O2 sensors) to examine records of North Pacific surface density over the past ~40 years, in combination with water transfer into the thermocline and ocean interior O2 variability. The study will focus on seasonal to decadal variability and long-term trends. Specific objectives are (1) computing sea surface density and isopycnal outcrop area variability in the northwestern North Pacific, (2) estimating annual subduction rates and O2 fluxes from the outcrops into the thermocline, and (3) linking subduction in the northwestern North Pacific to downstream oxygen variability in the northeast. It is hypothesized that surface densities in the northwestern North Pacific exhibit decadal cycles similar to subsurface oxygen (as well as a declining trend) and that oxygen variations in the eastern North Pacific interior (thermocline) are correlated with surface density/subduction rate variations in the northwestern North Pacific with a few year lag.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
