The addition of uncertain and variable distributed energy resources requires better understanding of potential impacts on grid operations. Direct testing on the grid is not possible, and the reliance on computer simulations for varying degrees of the distributed energy resource penetration is necessary. The companion mathematical challenge is in generating realistic scenarios of supplies and loads at the customer level, often at high spatial and temporal resolutions involving joint generation of tens of thousands of correlated space-time variables. Moreover, such processes are plagued by discontinuities due to electrical device switching in loads and microscale weather variations in distributed photovoltaics supply. This project represents an end-to-end effort developing new mathematical tools that will be applied to realistic electricity network testbeds.\r\n\r\nThis research will develop a framework for space-time jump-diffusion processes that capture realistic non-Gaussian behavior of distributed energy resources and loads at high time frequencies. Such models will yield unprecedented insights into distributed energy resource implications on current and future grids. The testbed for the new framework and methodology is a state-of-the-art distribution simulation network dataset, Smart-DS. Results of this research will have potential impacts in infrastructure and energy planning by studying grid responses to varying levels of the distributed energy resource adoption. The statistical models will be applicable to a variety of fields including financial mathematics, environmetrics, geography and ecology. Moreover, this research will support student training at the intersection of statistics and energy science, who will gain interdisciplinary and collaborative experience with domain scientists during summer internships at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Traditionally, the distribution system could be managed in a passive manner since it was designed to handle a known range of load variability and uncertainty. However, the addition of substantial amounts of uncertain and variable DERs requires better understanding of potential impacts on grid operations.

Moreover, such processes are plagued by discontinuities and jumps due to electrical device switching in loads and microscale weather variations in PV supply. This research seeks to develop frameworks for non-Gaussian and nonstationary space-time weather and climate processes with applications to energy systems and climate data science.\r\n\n\nWe developed ensemble forecasting techniques for utility-scale PV plants relying on model combinations using Bayesian model averaging (BMA).We introduced a new nonstationary moving average time series approach to downscale coarse-resolution temporal estimates of solar irradiance to high time frequencies; the proposed method additionally captured downscaling uncertainty and better captured distributional characteristics than existing alternatives.The forecast literature is moving toward multivariate forecasting, for example joint spatial forecasts.However, verification metrics typically only capture marginal behavior; we developed the fraction of threshold exceedance (FTE), a method to verify joint spatial forecasts with an application to precipitation accumulations over a portion of the southeastern United States.The spatial behavior of weather variables that affect energy systems is often highly nonstationary; we introduced the basis graphical lasso (BGL) for modeling large, nonstationary spatial processes, and extended the BGL to the multivariate setting in which multiple processes exhibit complex within- and between-variable correlation structures.These works focused on applications to weather and climate model solutions.Data assimilation is a common tool in forecasting, but can suffer from errors in the estimated correlation matrix; we developed a multivariate localization approach to reduce such errors.In energy science applications, often multiple datasets must be combined; we developed a technique for combining different spatial point cloud datasets that exhibit spatially-varying misalignment by developing a nonrigid registration procedure that registers multiple clouds, but also captures uncertainty in the procedure.High frequency irradiance data often exhibit highly nonstationary and regime-like behavior that is not well-captured by stationary models.We developed subordinated Gaussian processes to handle such regimes, where a standard Gaussian process is randomly time-changed according to a subordinator.In an application on one-second pyranometer measurements of global horizontal irradiance, the subordinated approach outperformed existing alternatives.In parallel research, we developed a technique to subordinate jump diffusion processes multiple times, resulting in a type of process termed a deep variance gamma (DVG) process.Finally, we developed experiments with a mock electrical grid software to test grid behavior and resilience on different penetration rates of distributed PV systems.\r\n\n\nBroader Impacts\r\n\n\nResearch related to this project resulted in many training opportunities for students, including nine graduate students and one undergraduate student at the University of Colorado who gained interdisciplinary training in statistics and energy science.Students gained additional collaborative experience with scientists at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Examples of student projects include solar irradiance downscaling, unconditional simulation to generate synthetic datasets, development of forecast and verification techniques and climate model emulation.The results of these projects may be useful for power grid planning studies and better understanding the effects of distributed PV systems on grid stability.The PI also taught three short courses related to research developed during this project to a wide array of statisticians and scientists interested in spatial statistical methods.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/13/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: WilliamPKleiber\n"
