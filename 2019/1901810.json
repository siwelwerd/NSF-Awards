 "awd_abstract_narration": "The international conference \"Representation theory and integrable systems\" will take place at ETH Zurich August 12-16, 2019. There will be twenty invited lectures by renowned experts, contributed talks by younger faculty, and a number of graduate student presentations. The goal of the conference is to study the recent advances in the area in the title and to educate the younger researchers. This award will fund participation of US scientists in this conference, with priority given to recent PhDs and underrepresented minorities, so they can share their research and learn about the new ideas in the field.\r\n\r\nQuantum integrable systems are large families of commuting operators (Hamiltonians) acting on a vector space. Such families naturally appear in the representation theory of reductive Lie algebras and their corresponding quantum groups. The main goal is to study the spectra of the Hamiltoninians. It turns out that this question has deep connections to various mathematical theories: differential and difference equations, equivariant cohomology and K-theory, the theory of special functions, combinatorics, and more. The conference will provide a common venue for a diverse group of researchers who study the subject using different methods with different goals to interact and share recent advances. More details about the conference are available at http://rtis2019.math.iupui.edu/  and http://www.nccr-swissmap.ch/events/representation-theory-and-integrable-systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
