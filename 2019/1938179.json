 "awd_abstract_narration": "Light emission is an important part of modern technological age.  Every major advance in the generation of light from engineered structures has had a huge impact on society and the nation's security.  Such previous advances include the semiconductor laser, the light emitting diode, and solid-state lighting.  They have revolutionized almost every aspect of life by impacting lighting, communication, information storage, entertainment, and others.  It is essential that innovation in this area continues to take place and new types and architectures of light emitting systems be realized that exceed the capabilities of previous technologies. This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award supports research that allows new types of light emitting structures to be created that combine dissimilar materials in architectures that hold promise for improved functionality. In this research, light emitting polymers are combined with atomically thin semiconductors and quantum dots using a manufacturing approach that integrates multiple materials.  This research advances the science and technology of manufacturing to create processes that facilitate such a heterogeneous integration. The availability of nanomodular systems positively impacts U.S. electronics and optoelectronics industries, thus boosting the nation's economy and prosperity.  The project involves women and under-represented groups in research and trains engineering students in advanced technologies that are important in next generation manufacturing.  The project also exposes students at all levels to cutting-edge research, thus motivating them to pursue careers in science and engineering.\r\n\r\nThe project combines bottom-up (self-assembly) and top-down (lithography) nanomanufacturing approaches to create nanomodular systems for vastly improved functionality of light-emitting structures. The structures are based on combinations of 2D semiconductors, semiconducting polymers, quantum dot nanocrystals, and insulators.  Ambipolar injection of electrons and holes by the 2D semiconductor is a crucial component of the research which leads to light emission from either the polymer or the quantum dot via combinations of charge and energy transfer. In such hybrid combinations of materials, the advantageous properties of different materials are combined. For example, 2D semiconductors have good charge injection and transport properties but poor light emission properties. Semiconducting polymers and quantum dots can possess very high light emission efficiencies but have generally poor charge transport properties. In a successful heterogeneous integration, the favorable properties are combined to create a level of performance that is very difficult to attain with the individual materials. The project directly addresses the manufacturing and design challenges that result in a successful functional integration. The design of nanomodular systems is guided by charge transport theory and numerical simulations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nNew and advanced displays are sought for a number of application areas such as augmented reality systems, smart watches, and cars. One type of display that is not sufficiently developed yet is a highly efficient display in which the light is directed normal to the surface (or vertically up), with very little going sideways. This will benefit applications in which the viewer position is fixed with respect to the display. Examples of such displays are in head-mounted displays for augmented reality systems, in smart watches that need to be clearly visible in bright sunshine, automotive displays where the driver position is almost fixed.\n\n\nIntellectual Merit:\n\n\nThe \"secret sauce\" of our work is focused on using optics developed from metamaterials (meta-optics) to control light in a manner unachievable by conventional optics.
