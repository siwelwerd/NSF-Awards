 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2019- 2021. An interdisciplinary faculty team in the biological, physical, and computational sciences will mentor students in projects that address the global question: \"How do cells and organisms perceive their environment and make life or death decisions?\" Students will use stae-of-the-art molecular, genetic, genomic, and systems biology/bioinformatics techniques to investigate how organisms across the biological kingdom sense and adapt to a changing environment. Besides independent research projects, professional development workshops on science communication, responsible research/scientific inquiry, and career options in STEM will be held.  As part of a larger Summer REU Scholars community,  students will present their work at a campus-wide science/engineering symposium.\r\n\r\nA total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program.  This program will specifically target Deaf and hard-of-hearing (D/HH) students, a population underrepresented in STEM careers nationally. In addition to D/HH students, hearing students interested in research training as well as American Sign Language (ASL) are encouraged to apply.  Students will be incorporated into a heterogeneous environment of hearing and D/HH individuals that stresses modern scientific training, research competency, and independence and communication.  In addition, to stimulate the participation of young K-12 D/HH students in STEM careers, REU students will also participate in program outreach through lab visits with students from regional Tennessee D/HH high schools.\r\nA common web-based assessment tool used by REU Site programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. Additional program assessment will determine impact on 1. Scientific knowledge development; 2. Communication and integration; and 3. Career development prospects . More program information is available at http://bcmb.utk.edu/reu, or can be obtained by contacting the PI (Dr. Daniel Roberts at drobert2@utk.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. David Smith at dsmit147@utk.edu).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Research training in molecular signaling and systems biology, complemented with professional skills workshops, provided these members of the future science workforce with a foundation in modern molecular and cellular bioscience inquiry and scientific communication.\n\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\n\nOrganisms across all biological kingdoms possess the common challenge of sensing and adapting to a changing and hostile environment. Complex arrays of molecules assembled into genetic and metabolic networks have evolved to perceive external stimuli and trigger the appropriate adaptive response that determines cell or organism survival. The unifying strength of this research training program for undergraduate cellular and molecular biology students was the common focus on the central question and intellectual theme: How Cells and Organisms make Life and Death Decisions in a Changing Environment.\n\n\nWith the rich data sets now available from genomic and bioinformatic resources, and the power of computational and mathematical modeling, we are beginning to understand and predict how molecules and networks give rise to emergent properties and behaviors of cells and organisms. This is the emerging area of systems-level biology which is at the forefront of modern cellular and molecular biology and it is poised to transform medicine and agriculture.\n\n\nTo provide student trainees training in modern quantitative systems approaches in molecular and cellular biology, we assembled a multidisciplinary team of faculty research mentors across three colleges at the University of Tennessee with broad expertise spanning biophysical, biochemical, genetic, microbial, plant science, neuroscience, mathematic/computational biology, and engineering disciplines.
