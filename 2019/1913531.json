 "awd_abstract_narration": "Core-collapse supernovae, the culmination of the lives of massive stars, are the principle actors in the story of our elemental origins. Our understanding of these events centers around a stalled explosion brought back to life by a neutrinos streaming from the newly-formed neutron star. This award will support two projects to improve our understanding of the impact that the turbulent, neutrino-driven nature of supernova explosions has on observations of supernovae  and galactic chemical evolution and the elemental history of our Galaxy. First, the PI will seek to investigate the explosions that result from the lightest stars to produce supernovae, those with cores composed initially of oxygen and neon, with much greater fidelity than has previously been achieved. Second, the investigator team will continue our prior project to determine the full range of nucleosynthesis products in the ejecta as realistically as possible within our simulations of the central engine of core-collapse supernovae and then extend these models of core-collapse supernovae beyond the initial epoch where the explosion is formed. To compare with observations, the PI will extend these simulations to the epoch when the shock reaches the surface of the star and the visible supernova is born.\r\n\r\nCore-collapse supernovae, including the collapse of iron-cored stars, but also the collapse of less massive stars with oxygen and neon cores as electron capture supernovae, are the principle drivers of galactic chemical evolution. Our understanding of both of these events, while still incomplete, centers around a neutrino-driven central engine which is highly hydrodynamically unstable.  Though the stalled shock is brought back to life by neutrino heating, the development of the supernova explosion is inextricably linked to three-dimensional fluid flows. Regrettably, this is ignored in most studies of supernova nucleosynthesis. This award supports two projects to improve our understanding of the impact that the turbulent, neutrino-driven nature of supernova explosions has on observations of supernovae and galactic chemical evolution. First, the investigator team will investigate the explosions that result from electron capture supernovae with much greater fidelity than has heretofore been achieved. Second, the investigator team will continue a prior project to realistically examine the full range of nucleosynthesis products that may be observed in the ejecta by extending state-of-the-art core-collapse supernova models to the epoch when the shock reaches the surface of the star and the supernova is born.\r\n\r\nThis project advances the objectives of \"Windows on the Universe: the Era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics\", one of the 10 Big Ideas for Future NSF Investments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nSupernovae marking the deaths of stars more than ten times the mass of our Sun are the foremost source of elements heavier than carbon in our Galaxy. While new atomic nuclei form only during the first few seconds of these events, it is many hours before the shockwave that carries them out of their progenitor star reaches the surface of the star. It is at this point that the visible supernova begins. Over the course of these same hours, these newly formed nuclei tear through the remainder of the star, propelling the rest of the star outward. In the process, the spatial distribution of the newly formed nuclei is changed. Often, bullets of newly formed nuclei penetrate far into the overlying layers of the star. The included image demonstrates this change.  Newly formed isotopes of nickel, Ni-56 (red) and Ni-60 (green), are shown at left milliseconds after their formation in a supernova model, swaddled in a layer of silicon (blue on the left) deep in the star.  The image at right is 17 hours later, just as the supernova shockwave reaches the original surface of the star. The ball of nickel at the center has expanded from 10 thousand kilometers to 100 million kilometers. In that process, bullets of nickel, now wrapped in helium (blue on the right), have penetrated into the hydrogen-rich outer layers of the star. Note that these bullets are predominantly Nickel-60 rather than Nickel-56, because the Nickel-60 formed earlier in this explosion model.\r\n\n\nProgress under this project came in 2 areas. First, we developed more sophisticated models for the first few seconds of the explosion for the lowest mass stars that can successfully supernova. These models will help determine what is this minimum mass for a star to produce a supernova and how these supernovae differ from those of higher mass stars. Second, we developed models that extend supernovae from the first few seconds when the supernova shockwave is energized and new atomic nuclei are made to the hours later that the ejecta becomes visible as a supernova.  Such models, which produced the included image, are essential if we want to compare our understanding from models of the explosion mechanism in the first seconds to observations of supernovae that occur hours or days later. \t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/21/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: WilliamRaphaelHix\n"
