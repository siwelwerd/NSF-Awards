 "awd_abstract_narration": "Excessive nutrients in surface and ocean waters cause nutrient pollution, which is responsible for water quality degradation in more than 60% of coastal rivers, bays, and seas in the U.S. With a continuous nutrient supply, certain phytoplankton species can become disproportionately abundant under distinctive environmental conditions, forming what is commonly known as \"red tides\". The economic impacts of red tides in the U.S. are estimated to be at least tens of million dollars per year. It is imperative to reduce the risk of red tides and to increase the associated resilience of coastal communities. Research results of this project will be disseminated to a broad audience in multiple communities through outreach to the public and by collaborating with researchers, practitioners, and decision-makers in county, state and federal agencies. This project will support two undergraduate students and one postdoctoral researcher who will be recruited from underrepresented groups in science. The PIs will incorporate the research results into their classroom teaching and curriculum development.\r\n\r\nThis project will conduct innovative interdisciplinary research across the coastline boundary between terrestrial and ocean systems and across the disciplinary boundaries between geosciences, natural, and social sciences. This project will explore the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) for simulating nutrient fluxes from a terrestrial system to an ocean system and for linking E3SM-simulated nutrient fluxes to red tide occurrence in support of socio-economic impact assessment. The goal of this project is to explore whether E3SM can be used as a new software to simulate nutrient fluxes at multiple scales for estimating red tide development and persistence and for assessing socio-economic impacts of red tides under various environmental and management scenarios. Additionally, the research team will evaluate whether E3SM can be used as a community tool to facilitate coastal management. The State of Florida has been chosen as the primary study site for this project, yet the model can be used along the US coastline. E3SM and its uses for nutrient pollution study and socio-economic impact assessment can be an emerging software infrastructure for coastal researchers, decision-makers, practitioners, and stakeholders to address coastal nutrient pollution problems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The economic impacts of red tides in the U.S. are estimated to be at least tens of million dollars per year. It is imperative to reduce the risk of red tides as a geohazard and to increase the associated resilience of coastal communities. The needs of simulating red tides and estimating their socio-economic impacts may be addressed by using recently developed Earth System Models (ESMs), because ESMs provide simulation results for various Earth system phenomena at multiple scales (e.g., global and regional) and the results may be&nbsp;used directly for understanding red tide occurrence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This interdisciplinary project explored for the first time whether the ESMs can be used as a ready-to-use software infrastructure for simulating red tide occurrence. This project also explored whether Earth system modeling results can be used to fill a data gap for estimating socio-economic impacts of red tides, which has not been attempted. This project used the State of Florida as a study site, where red tides have been a serious threat to the ecosystem and economy of many coastal communities. A benchmark problem selected&nbsp;for Earth system modeling was the loop current at the west Florida shelf, because previous research found that the loop current is a necessary condition for a large red tide bloom to occur. Our project found that, while the loop current can be simulated by ESMs with the resolution of 10km, it cannot be simulated by ESMs with the resolution of 100km. It is therefore necessary to select the appropriate ESMs for red tide simulation. We thus developed a prescreening-based subset selection method to first select a subset of ESMs and then use an ensemble modeling approach for improving red tide simulation. We further developed an optimal model weighting approach for estimating ESMs weights to improve simulation results of red tide occurrence. Since the research approaches are mathematically general, they can be used for studying the red tide problems not only in Florida but worldwide, given that ESMs results are readily available for the entire Earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our project also laid out three approaches of using ESMs results for environmental management of red tide problems at the regional scale. There are still knowledge and data gaps for directly using ESMs results for environmental management, and one of them is related to using ESMs results for socio-economic impact assessment. To fill the gap, we developed an exposure-response model that predicts emergency department visits due to respiratory disease caused by red tides. Using this model, we estimated for years with &ldquo;high,&rdquo; &ldquo;medium,&rdquo; and &ldquo;low&rdquo; HAB activity, and developed multiple scenarios related to climate changes. Using the average cost to patients of an emergency department visit, we modeled the impact of respiratory emergency department visits on the economy using REMI. We predicted that average annual respiratory ED visits from all causes will be between 5,365 and 5,877, and the average annual reduction in GDP will be between $19.8 million and $22.5 million.</p>\n<p>This project supported one post-doc, three (two female) graduate students, and four (three female) undergraduate students, and they received interdisciplinary training when working on the project.
