 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dominican amber is famous for the beautifully preserved fossils it contains - ancient animals, plants, fungi, and even bacteria, dating back to the Miocene epoch approximately 16-18 million years ago. To date, over 1,000 species have been discovered in this remarkable amber. Scientific study of Dominican amber began with an NSF-funded expedition by Illinois Natural History Survey (INHS) entomologist Milton Sanderson, who visited the island in 1959 to study beetles. Having learned of rich amber deposits he set out to find them with the help of local guides and collected a large sample that he brought back to the INHS. The following year he published a short paper reporting his discovery, thereby kickstarting scientific study of this ancient ecosystem. Sanderson's collection is therefore, tremendously important both scientifically and historically, yet remains unstudied, still unsorted and unprocessed in the original five-gallon buckets in which it was collected. Years of substandard storage has taken its toll on the amber, which has undergone significant oxidation and is now incredibly fragile. This project will allow the collection to finally be screened for inclusions, conserved using state-of-the-art resin embedding techniques, curated, and digitized. This will unlock a wealth of important data concerning ancient biodiversity, ecology, and climate that is currently hidden and inaccessible within the collection.  In addition to making this data available to the scientific community and the public for the first time, it will also provide valuable experience to graduate and undergraduate students beginning their careers in science.\r\n\r\nThe Illinois Natural History Survey (INHS) at the University of Illinois is home to the Milton Sanderson Dominican Amber Collection (MSDAC).  In addition to its historical importance as the first substantial collection of Dominican amber, the MSDAC is hugely significant scientifically.  It comprises a large (ca. 70 kg) bulk sample of amber that remains almost entirely unprocessed; i.e., it still resides in the five-gallon buckets in which it was collected and has yet to be screened for fossils.  Aside from its size, the unscreened nature of the collection means that it has not been subject to collector bias and no inclusions have been discarded, as typically happens in collections made commercially and sold to museums or private collectors.  As a result, the MSDAC presents a unique opportunity to study an unbiased collection that promises to deliver a more complete picture of the paleobiodiversity and paleoecology of the Early Miocene Dominican amber forest. Unfortunately, decades of substandard storage have resulted in substantial oxidation damage putting the collection at significant risk. This project will focus on the stabilization, conservation, curation and digitization of the MSDAC. A state-of-the-art vacuum resin embedding technique, in which specimens are embedded in a high-quality synthetic resin, will be used to stabilize the oxidized amber. Trimming and polishing of stabilized specimens will allow identification of inclusions and facilitate photomicrography of specimens for inclusion in an online database. Undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in every step of the process, thereby helping to train the next generation of scientists.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Collected in 1959, the MSDAC comprises approx. 70kg (~140,000 pieces) of unprepared amber stored in 5-gallon metal buckets. Unlike all other major Dominican amber collections worldwide, the MSDAC represents a bulk sample from a single locality and has not been cherry picked to contain only the most interesting specimens. It is the only collection that has not been subject to significant collector bias in this regard. It represents the only collection of its kind with the potential to shed light not only on the diversity and ecology of the Dominican amber paleobiota, but also on natural taphonomic biases associated with preservation in amber. A profile of the collection indicates that around 10% of pieces contain well-preserved fossils (arthropods, plants, rare vertebrates), suggesting that there are at least 14,000 fossiliferous pieces in the collection. However, 55 years of poor storage in steel buckets has caused significant oxidation and deterioration of the amber and the collection requires urgent conservation.</p>\n<p class=\"xmsonormal\">At the conclusion of the grant, the MSDAC is approximately 80% screened for fossil inclusions and 1,418 pieces have been identified to their lowest taxonomic level possible at this time. These pieces that have already been curated contain multiple fossils within, for example, one piece has approximately 45 mites in an area roughly the size of a dime. There is a significant portion of the collection left to screen, embed, cut, polish, and photograph.&nbsp;The MSDAC represents the only collection of its kind with the potential to shed light not only on the diversity and ecology of the Dominican amber paleobiota, but also on natural taphonomic biases associated with preservation in amber. Of similar merit is our preparation, curation, and digitization of the fossils themselves, which will not only preserve the specimens indefinitely but will also make specimens and associated metadata widely available to both the scientific community and the public via the web. Digitized data (including images) will be distributed to a number of web-based portals, including iDigBio and iDigPaleo. Both specimens and digitized data will also be immediately integrated into ongoing research projects being explored by PI Heads, his collaborators, and students. These include questions related to the systematics, evolution, historical biogeography and paleoecology of fossil insects and their use in understanding climate change through deep time.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/04/2023<br>\nModified by: Michael&nbsp;J&nbsp;Thomas</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1756405/1756405_10593713_1701747314262_NSF_MSDAC_public_report_figures_1_Page_2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1756405/1756405_10593713_1701747314262_NSF_MSDAC_public_report_figures_1_Page_2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"MSDAC Outcomes Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1756405/1756405_10593713_1701747314262_NSF_MSDAC_public_report_figures_1_Page_2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"MSDAC Outcomes Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figures 3a - 3e showing deterioration of the MSDAC amber.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Danielle Ruffatto</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michael&nbsp;J&nbsp;Thomas\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">MSDAC Outcomes Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1756405/1756405_10593713_1701747448037_NSF_MSDAC_public_report_figures_1_Page_3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1756405/1756405_10593713_1701747448037_NSF_MSDAC_public_report_figures_1_Page_3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"MSDAC Outcomes Figures 4 and 5\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1756405/1756405_10593713_1701747448037_NSF_MSDAC_public_report_figures_1_Page_3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"MSDAC Outcomes Figures 4 and 5\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 4.
