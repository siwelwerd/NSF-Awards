 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the eleventh Gordon Research Conference (GRC)on Radiation and Climate, to be held at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, 21-26 July 2019.  Additional support is provided for the fifth Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), convened the weekend prior to the GRC.  The GRS is a pre-conference meeting targeted specifically at students and early-career scientists, intended to provide a comfortable environment in which participants with comparable levels of experience and education come together to discuss their current research and build informal networks for long-term collaboration.  The theme of the GRC and GRS is \"Bridging Spatial and Temporal Scales in Radiation and Climate\", and specific topics include the the changing Arctic, atmospheric dynamics and climate from gravity wave to global circulations, ice processes from microscale to global scale, cloud observations, aerosols and radiation, climate sensitivity from current cloud processes to paleo-climate, greenhouse gases, and the radiation budget from cloud to global scale.\r\n\r\nThe GRC and GRS have scientific broader impacts by serving as a venue for the exchange of results and ideas among researchers attempting to understand the radiative processes that govern weather and climate.  The meeting is expected to be particularly advantageous for early-career scientists, as it is formulated to promote in-depth interactions among junior and senior scientists over the course of a week, in a conducive setting of manageable size with few distractions.  The topics to be addressed are of societal interest given the key role of radiative effects in controlling and regulating climate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
