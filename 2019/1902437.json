 "awd_abstract_narration": "Additive manufacturing (3D printing) has become an increasingly common manufacturing production method.  As a result, industries in eastern Kentucky and Tennessee have begun to shift their production to additive manufacturing. However, this region has a shortage in the skilled technicians needed to meet the resulting workforce demands. Also, manufacturers and potential workers in rural and underserved areas in this region might benefit from increased awareness of the advantages that additive manufacturing can provide. In this project, Somerset Community College (Kentucky) and Tennessee Technological University will work together to help address these workforce and education needs. Specifically, this project aims to help educate a new generation of qualified employees for the region's manufacturing workforce.  To achieve this goal, the project partners will update the curriculum for an existing certificate in additive manufacturing to include advanced concepts and design methods for 3D printing. A mobile equipment platform for additive manufacturing will also be developed. This mobile additive manufacturing platform will enable learning activities in additive manufacturing to be brought to high schools, community colleges, and workplaces across the region. Through these efforts, the project aims to help the regional population and companies to become more familiar with additive manufacturing, and to create a generalizable approach that can be adapted by other rural communities. The project will also provide pathways for more community college students and workers to obtain credentials in additive manufacturing. \r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of the project is to enhance workforce development opportunities in additive manufacturing for high school students, community college students, incumbent workers, and manufacturers in underserved regions of Kentucky and Tennessee. Two courses will be developed to include advancements in powder-based printer and metal printer applications.  These courses will be integrated into the existing curriculum for the 3D Printing Technician-Level 1 certificate at the institutions. These courses will cover topics such as improved product topology, metal sintering production, advanced composite materials, and generative design concepts and techniques. Customized curriculum on these topics will also be developed and offered in workshops for high school students and incumbent workers. A mobile additive manufacturing platform will be designed to provide hands-on learning experiences using high-grade industrial materials and state-of-the-art 3D printing equipment. The use of this transportable equipment will enable students and incumbent workers across the region to directly interact with a full range of production techniques and capabilities. The project team will study the effectiveness of this mobile educational delivery method in achieving desired learning objectives and benchmark the results against traditional educational approaches. The project materials, best practices, and results will be shared on the project website, through Advanced Technological Education Centers, and at regional and national venues. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The goals set included expanding and improving Somerset Community Colleges' (SCC) web-based curriculum to ensure graduates are prepared for the AM workforce, raising AM interest in high school students and preparing K-14 teachers to provide the instruction, and generating increased interest in AM from businesses in the area.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>General Project Outcomes:</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Mobile AMP had several notable outcomes, significantly impacting the region. Business leaders and K-14 teachers were successfully educated on how AM can foster innovation. More businesses than ever contacted SCC for AM development assistance and enrolled portions of their workforces in SCC AM courses. The results this had on teachers was also revolutionary. The AM Technician Certificate curriculum was updated in collaboration with industry professionals, which allowed teachers to better understand the big picture and inspired more high school students to pursue AM skills aligning with their career goals. Southeastern Ohio has now joined the fold and is enrolling K-12 teachers in SCC AM programs. Other states are also considering this action.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Curriculum Development: Research and collaboration was conducted throughout the life of the Mobile AMP project to ensure that existing courses would be updated and new courses would be developed to meet industry job requirements. New courses that were developed include topics such as powder-based AM and supply-chain reinforcement utilizing AM. Updates to existing courses include topics such as 3D scanning for manufacturing and medical purposes, state-of-the-art slicing processes, and AI workflow integration. These materials included cloud-based curriculum and instructions, making it easier for teachers to integrate AM concepts into their courses and specific Large Language Models (a form of Artificial Intelligence).</p>\r\n<p>Student and Teacher Training: Through this project and collaboration with AdvanceKentucky, 216 K-14 educator participants enrolled in at least the first AM course from Fall 2020 to Fall 2024. 977 high school students (46.8% of total) enrolled in dual credit AM courses. 2,087 students enrolled in AM courses across all KCTCS institutions from Fall 2020 to Fall 2024. SCC and Tennessee Tech University also conducted numerous training workshops for high school and community college teachers. These workshops provided hands-on experience with AM equipment and software, helping participants develop the skills and knowledge needed to utilize AM in their classrooms and careers effectively.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Research and Dissemination: The project conducted research on the impact and efficiency of the Mobile AMP learning environment. Findings were used to continually update the curriculum and assist in targeting specific ventures. One great example is SCC's expansion into concrete printing, which is leading to advanced developments and potential copyright and trademark applications within the industry. The research findings were shared through publications, presentations, and workshops. This helped to share best practices and promote the adoption of AM in education and industry. Due to the project's success, Eric Wooldridge and Sheri McGuffin won the National Science Board's Science in Society award.</p>\r\n<p>Partnerships and Collaboration: Mobile AMP fostered partnerships and collaborations between educational institutions, industry, and government agencies. These partnerships helped to leverage resources, share expertise, and promote the growth of the AM ecosystem in the region and beyond. A few examples of these collaborations include SCC&rsquo;s Additive Manufacturing lab being granted permission by state officials to serve as an essential facility during COVID, where over 7,000 face shields were 3D printed thanks to a statewide AM network developed by SCC, an SCC additive manufacturing undergraduate student who developed an automation process for embedding near-field communication chips in 3D printed objects, an SCC additive manufacturing undergraduate student intern who collaborated with a military contractor company in Kentucky to 3D print prototype insulation clips, and SCC partnered with Outdoor Venture Corporation to develop a new product line for the national defense industry that can only be manufactured through AM technologies.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Project Conclusion:</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The Mobile AMP project successfully positioned the Kentucky/Tennessee region as a leader in additive manufacturing (AM) by achieving significant educational, industrial, and research milestones. The project expanded SCC&rsquo;s AM curriculum and capabilities, allowing the introduction of powder-based AM, concrete printing, and low-cost metal printing while training over 200 educators and over 2,000 students.
