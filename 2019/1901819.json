 "awd_abstract_narration": "The field of arithmetic geometry focuses on the study of shapes (called varieties) that are defined by polynomial equations and the number of solutions to those equations.  The PI will investigate properties of curves and related varieties that are of particular interest to number theorists. The project includes studying Fermat curves (connected to the celebrated proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Andrew Wiles), curves with a large set of symmetries (for which the interplay between the arithmetic and the geometry provides a rich structure), and arithmetic invariants of more general curves. The PI also proposes two projects to train students in number theory.  The first is to train undergraduates at Colorado State University in mathematics research during summer 2020.  The second is to host a video-conference training seminar in arithmetic geometry, with world-wide open access.  This will train graduate students in this field and build connections among researchers in this area.  The PI will continue to mentor and train students and to provide service to the math community.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe PI plans to study 3 topics: (1) Galois cohomology of Fermat curves: The proof of Fermat's Last Theorem determined all of the points on the Fermat curves that are defined over the rational field Q. The PI proposes to study a map in Galois cohomology that measures an obstruction for rational points and to show that this obstruction does not vanish for the Fermat curves defined over cyclotomic fields.  (2) Special Shimura varieties for Jacobians and Pryms: For curves of genus g < 3, the image of the Torelli morphism is open and dense in the moduli space of abelian varieties of dimension g. The PI proposes to study families of curves with extra automorphisms for which the image of the Torelli morphism is open and dense in an associated Shimura variety; these families are called special. The PI proposes to find and analyze more special families of curves and Prym varieties. The PI also proposes a method to deduce results about non-special families, working inductively starting with the input of special families. (3) Variation of p-torsion invariants for Galois covers: An elliptic curve defined over a finite field can be ordinary or supersingular, as studied by Hasse, Deuring, and Igusa. For g > 1, there are invariants that generalize the supersingular property for a curve of genus g or an abelian variety of dimension g. For example, the Newton polygon characterizes information about the Frobenius operator on the cohomology. Measuring these invariants is important because they determine arithmetic and geometric information about the curve. It is a tantalizing open question to determine which of these invariants occur for curves. The PI proposes numerous projects about the Newton polygon and p-torsion group scheme of Jacobians of curves.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "The main outcome of this grant was new research by the PI in the field of arithmetic geometry.  The PI published 13 new papers between 2019-2021 and finished an additional 5 preprints.  The PI also gave 16 research talks and co-authored an open educational research book on combinatorics.\nThe major theme on the PI's research was the action of automorphisms and operators on the homology of curves.  The results of the PI during this grant led to deeper connections between the PI's research program and other strands of research in arithmetic geometry, including the research fields of absolute Galois groups, Newton polygons of curves, and unitary Shimura varieties.\n The PI wrote several research papers about the action of absolute Galois groups on the homology of curves.  Understanding Galois extensions of the field of rational numbers is a major open problem in number theory.  By the theory of Grothendieck, this problem can be translated into a question about the action of absolute Galois groups on Beyli curves.  The PI and co-authors have results about the Galois module structure of quotients of the fundamental groups of Fermat curves.\n The PI wrote several research papers about the Newton polygons and Ekedahl--Oort types that occur for Jacobians of curves.  The outcomes of these papers were many existence and non-existence results for curves with unusual zeta functions and torsion group schemes.  More generally, a major topic of the PI's research is about how the Torelli locus intersects the Newton polygon and Ekedahl--Oort stratifications of the moduli space of abelian varieties. The PI has new results about this question in the context of the modulo $p$ reduction of unitary Shimura varieties.  As an application, this work provides support for a conjecture of Oort about smooth curves whose Newton polygons are an amalgamate sum of two others.\nThis grant also supported numerous broader impacts; three of these are described here.\nThe first is that the PI developed a new virtual seminar VaNTAGe on open conjectures in number theory and arithmetic geometry.  The seminar started in January 2020 and developed rapidly because many mathematicians were looking for virtual talks during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Most of the talks can be seen on the VaNTAGe YouTube channel, which has over 21,000 views. \nAs the second broader impact, this grant supported a Sonia Kovalevsky day at Colorado State University (CSU) in March 2022.  The PI was the faculty advisor for this event.  About 160 high school students and 30 high school teachers from 19 high schools came to CSU to celebrate the accomplishments of women in math.  The students participated in math activities and networking and heard a key note talk from a mathematician at a national lab.  Approximately one sixth of the students were from underrepresented minority groups and one third were first generation students.\nAs the third broader impact, this grant supported a summer REU experience for a student who was advised by the PI.  The topic of the REU was applications of elliptic curves to cryptography.  The student learned about several cryptosystems and attacks that involve elliptic curves and implemented many algorithms in JavaScript.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rachel J Pries"
