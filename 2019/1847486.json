 "awd_abstract_narration": "Humans vary in body size and proportions, and the underlying drivers of this variation are not fully understood. Differences in body form can be adaptive for certain environments, such as assisting in thermoregulation of the body through the dissipation or retention of heat, but can also be related to factors such as genetic drift and population history.  This doctoral dissertation research will examine human skeletal variation to understand the impact of various environmental factors on human body form across a wide geographical range.  The project will help to elucidate how environmental factors may have complex, differential effects in males versus females and across different parts of the skeleton. Skeletal data from the project will be compiled into a freely accessible online database. The addition of data for groups and regions of the world that are currently underrepresented in biological and forensic studies will increase understanding of human variation and global diversity.  The project will also foster international research collaborations and student training at the undergraduate and graduate levels. \r\n\r\nAsia has diverse climates, high population densities, and a long history of human habitation.  Using a multidisciplinary methodological approach, this study of Asian populations will meaningfully quantify proportional differences resulting from environmental variables in a way not possible with previous ecogeographic methods.  Standard skeletal measurements and landmarks will be collected to allow for comparisons across geographic regions as well as further examination of variation in the size and shape of the face, cranial vault, and birth canal between the sexes and populations. The analyses will account for the potential influence of nonadaptive forces such as drift and migration on body form by pairing skeletal measurements with appropriately matched genetic data and local weather station information for statistical analysis.  Linear mixed effects models testing for evidence of adaptation due to environmental factors will contain both head and body data of male and female individuals from each population.  Differences in the size and shape of the pelvis between the sexes along with population differences in pelvic morphology will be evaluated using Procrustes fit and principal components analyses as well as size and shape dimorphism indices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFunding of this project by NSF allowed for Elizabeth Cho to travel to seven countries in Asia to amass a sample size of 957 individuals originating from 11 different populations for her dissertation research.  At each research location, skeletal measurements were taken on bones of the limbs, hands, and feet and three-dimensional landmark data gathered on the skull and articulated pelvis.  Osteological data was then combined with appropriately matched climate and autosomal genetic data for analysis to discern trends in human adaptation to climate in Asia while considering the potential influences of shared population history and sexual dimorphism.\n\nPostcranial measurements were found to be more influenced by minimum temperature than those of the skull.  However, this association was not found in the hands or feet which suggests that cultural buffering or functional constraints on covarying traits may be muting any adaptive pressure placed on these most distal body parts.  While the sexes often exhibited the same pattern of association with climate, they did not always respond with the same intensity.  These findings support differences in environmental sensitivity between the sexes.  Overall, East Asians increased in overall size and body mass with decreased temperature and decreased in overall size and body mass with increased temperature.  Population dimorphism analyses support a correlation between body mass and temperature, as expected based on Bergmann\u2019s rule.  Despite identifying shared trends of the most and least dimorphic traits of the cranium and pelvis across populations, the level of dimorphism within populations did not exhibit gradual variation in a single direction when associated with climate.\n\nIntellectual merit: The results of this project have been disseminated at national anthropology conferences (earning a student prize for most outstanding presentation on bones), via a podcast episode to a general audience, as part of a university research seminar series, and at the successful defense of the Co-PI\u2019s dissertation.  The inclusion of shape and measurement data throughout the body allowed for the holistic assessment of adaptive trends within the same individual, something that has been lacking in a number of past ecogeographic studies solely centered on the skull or postcrania.  This work also improves understanding of global diversity through representation of a geographic region that has been largely absent in studies of human variation, adaptation, and evolution.\n\nBroader impacts: This research has created the largest East Asian dataset of cranial and postcranial skeletal measurements and shape data to date.  Each population has male and female samples of roughly similar size, which not only better represents skeletal variation of each population within the geographical region but provides a much-needed increase in female representation for morphological and ecogeographic studies.  During data collection, students and professionals at several Asian universities were taught how to gather and analyze three-dimensional landmark data so that they can utilize this approach in their own future research.  International travel and the presentation of project findings has assisted in the building of future research collaborations (domestically and internationally), professional development of the Co-PI, and led to an early career opportunity testing thermoregulatory principles in an effort to link anatomical variation and physiology to the skeletal structure of living individuals.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/24/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Elizabeth C Cho"
