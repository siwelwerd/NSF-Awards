 "awd_abstract_narration": "Insects are one of the most diverse groups of organisms on Earth, and yet they appear to be under threat from human-caused environmental disturbances. It is imperative that we understand how these environmental changes affect interactions between insect species, especially because insects provide essential services to humans (e.g. pollination of our major food crops, decomposition of dead matter). Scientists from around the world who are studying questions related to how environmental change affects insects will meet in Helsinki, Finland in July 2020 at the 26th International Congress of Entomology (also called the ICE meeting). The researchers are organizing a symposium at ICE with scientists who study how environmental change affects insect food webs and will provide travel awards to graduate students and post-docs, including underrepresented groups in science. Thus, this project will help to increase diversity of early- and mid-career scientists at the ICE meeting and will thus ensure that a diversity of views are represented in ongoing investigations into how global change affects natural ecosystems. Further, this project will facilitate the professional development and collaboration opportunities for scientists from underrepresented groups in science.  \r\n\r\nGlobal environmental change appears to be affecting insect communities worldwide. Insect communities form food webs and interactions with other species, including predators, greatly affect those species. How the strength of selection from these interactions will be altered by environmental change is unknown. Species interactions drive population abundances and community diversity; thus, understanding the impacts of global change on population dynamics, ecological communities, biodiversity, and ecosystem processes requires a multi-trophic perspective. Insights will be gained into how insect food webs are affected by global environmental change from the symposium. After the meeting, the researchers will convene a workshop to synthesize the current understanding and propose solutions for the impact of global change on insects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Even though insects have been historically viewed as a nuisance because some of them are disease vectors or agricultural pests, most insects are extremely important in our ecosystems. For instance, many insects are important pollinators or decomposers, and other insects are important food sources for many other animals. Thus, it is important to understand what is causing insect declines and take actions to curb this trend. Another systemic problem in academia is that people from underrepresented groups in STEM (women, minorities) are also underrepresented at important, global conferences where new research collaborations are formed. The impetus for our proposal was to increase the diversity of scientists able to attend the International Congress of Entomology (ICE), the largest global meeting for people studying insects, and incentivize new collaboration conveyed through publications. Women and minorities are underrepresented at international meetings. Their underrepresentation happens for a variety of reasons such as: not being invited, lack of financial resources in early career stages, lack of ability to travel because of family commitments, etc. Our first goal was to support the travel of early career and underrepresented scientists to an international conference in order to highlight their important research related to how global change affects insects. Our second goal was to work as a group to write a synthesis paper to summarize what we already know about how global change is affecting insects and identify research gaps that should be addressed.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Goal 1: For early- and mid-career scientists, travel expenses to international meetings often prohibit minorities and women, especially mothers with childcare responsibilities, from attending.

This international meeting occurs every four years, attracts a wide variety of scientists, and is an exceptional opportunity for US-based ecologists to present their work to an international audience, meet new colleagues, and develop international collaborations. This grant funded travel of early-career graduate students, postdocs, and faculty; our awardees for travel funds were 100% female, 83% early-career, 33% members of under-represented groups, and 25% women with children.

We are synthesizing 92 published meta-analyses that consider an array of global change stressors. Our original plan was to have an in-person workshop, but COVID restrictions made this impossible. Notably, by changing our synthesis writing group to meet regularly on Zoom, it became possible for more participants to be included, especially people with children for whom it is often difficult to travel without childcare to be included as well. This grant supported the participation of underrepresented scientists in our synthesis writing group; our awardees for the synthesis group were 93% female, 77% early-career, 23% members of under-represented groups, and 38% women with children. All of our participants will be co-authors on the final published paper.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Broader Impacts: The diversity in Biology does not follow the diversity in US society. For instance, more than 70% of scholars with a doctorate in Biology self-identify as white, while only 3% are black or african american, and 4% are latinx or hispanic. Additionally, there are 1.3x more male assistant professors in biology relative to female, and there are 3x more male than female full professors. Reasons for this low diversity include many factors, including implicit bias, systemic racism, lack of support to pursue a career in science, barriers in graduate school and in early career. Scholars that are women and/or minorities are invited less often to symposia, which are important forums to disseminate research and form new research collaborations. By awarding travel funds to women and minorities in order to attend an important international meeting, we were able to help increase diversity in STEM. This is extremely important because one of the major ways to incentivize minoritized students to pursue science is for them to have representation. Thus, it is of ultimate need that we increase the representation of minorities in our field by highlighting their work, giving financial support for them to be successful in traveling to international conferences, and incentivizing collaborations.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/22/2023<br>\nModified by: Shannon&nbsp;M&nbsp;Murphy</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1939338/1939338_10623709_1703289389119_IMG_2787--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1939338/1939338_10623709_1703289389119_IMG_2787--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Presenters at ICE 2022\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1939338/1939338_10623709_1703289389119_IMG_2787--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Presenters at ICE 2022\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A photo of 10 of the awardees at the ICE meeting in Helsinki after our special symposium about global change and insects.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Audience member</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Shannon&nbsp;M&nbsp;Murphy\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Presenters at ICE 2022</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1939338/1939338_10623709_1703289455693_Screenshot_2023_12_22_at_4.04.36__8239_PM--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1939338/1939338_10623709_1703289455693_Screenshot_2023_12_22_at_4.04.36__8239_PM--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Synthesis writing group\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1939338/1939338_10623709_1703289455693_Screenshot_2023_12_22_at_4.04.36__8239_PM--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Synthesis writing group\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A photo of 12 of the participants on a zoom working group meeting on April 10, 2023.
