 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a tool to measure joint mobility. There are a large number of orthopedic injuries and a significant need to quantitatively assess and treat these injuries.  An earlier attempt to address this market using a large, expensive, and cumbersome to use device developed in the 1980's is no longer on the market.  Since that time, technology has significantly evolved, and the device under development will demonstrate that it can provide a better, smaller, cheaper solution with greater orthopedic utility.  This device will be valuable to both educational and clinical venues. There are over 820 educational programs in medicine, chiropractic, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and athletic training.  A device to provide feedback will support joint mobility professionals; the clinical market totals over 1.1 M professionals with projected growth of 14-34% over the next decade.  These clinicians need tools to quantify techniques to enhance the practice of orthopedics. This device will help to transform the ability to collect data on joint measurement procedures to provide literature on examination and treatment efficacy and begin to develop \"best practice\" protocols.\r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop an orthopedic device to precisely quantify joint mobility.  The proposed device is able to quantify joint laxity to contribute to the clinical decision-making regarding injury management to consistently render therapeutic treatments, improving quality of care.  The proposed technology is a design for a simple, portable, and economical device used between the hands of the clinician and the joint of the patient to measure the linear displacement of the joint's bones.  Aligning the device's axis with the indicated joint results in translation of the device's distal component on the stabilized proximal segment. A display of the linear translation appears immediately.  The device represents a \"first-to-market\" technology for arthrokinematic/linear assessment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "The Mobil-Aider: A transformative device to assess joint laxity (Grant # 1923614)\nFinal Outcomes Report\n\n \n\nOver the span of the NSF Phase II SBIR Grant, Therapeutic Articulations has taken a proof of concept for a multi-joint arthrometer and has produced viable prototypes.  The prototype was taken through failure mode analysis and validity testing. Modifications were made prior to the creation of injection molds within very tight tolerances. We have met the challenges of covid and supply chain issues.  Version 1 was produced into four custom kits: deluxe (5 joints, 14 techniques), knee (1 joint, 2 techniques), shoulder (1 joint, 3 techniques), and ankle (1 joint, 4 techniques).  We have even begun to work on version 2 to enhance the electronics to activate a touch-screen and address data storage. \n\nA commercialization plan has been implements that includes, website development, informational flyers, franchise decks, explainer videos, and social media. This commercialization plan has been grounded by peer-reviewed disseminations:  eight published studies, one study in review, one study in data collection, one conference presentation, and five poster presentations.  The intent is to substantiate the clinical need for reliable, objective orthopedic data.\n\nIn addition to this development process, FDA clearance was obtained (class 1 exempt), a complete quality management system has been developed, and a USA patent has been issued (#11,123,007).\n\nFinally, with the assistance of supplemental funding (TECP), we were able to explore the possibility of sterilizing the device for use in the operating room.  We have examined the possible sterilization processes and know the compatibility issues.  By compartmentalizing the process, we can sterilize the only the attachments in contact with the patient\u2019s skin.  This will reduce cost to the user and generate recurring revenue.\n\nIn summary, orthopedics is about precision.  The Mobil-Aider Arthrometer is a versatile, portable, and affordable device to achieve the goal of enhancing patient care.  All goals of this Phase II NSF SBIR grant have been achieved.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/02/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dawn T Gulick"
