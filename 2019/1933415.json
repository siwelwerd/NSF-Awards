 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for participants of the \"Current Developments in Mathematics\" conference to be held November 22-23, 2019 and annually thereafter at the Harvard University Science Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The CDM conference is jointly sponsored by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Prominent speakers are invited to report on recent breakthroughs in various fields of mathematics. The conference is advertised widely to students and early-career researchers, and provides an excellent opportunity for them to interact with world-leading researchers and with the Boston area mathematics community. More information can be found on the conference website: http://www.math.harvard.edu/cdm/\r\n\r\nThe format of the conference aims to maximize the benefit for a wide range of participants. The speakers are asked to divide their lectures into two parts, one of which is intended to be accessible to a broader audience and giving a general idea of the recent work, while the other part contains more details. The conference can be thus regarded as an intensive two-day colloquium style overview of various exciting developments, providing an opportunity for mathematicians to learn about advances in fields other than their own area of specialization. The results presented at the conference are collected in manuscripts beforehand and are distributed to the participants during the conference. The proceedings are later published.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
