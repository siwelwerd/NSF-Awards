One area where new materials are sorely needed is that of energy generation based on standard steam cycles. There, one way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is to increase the thermodynamic efficiency of the plants. This can be done by developing materials that can sustain higher operating temperatures than the current standard set by nickel-based superalloys. High-entropy alloys are one such class of materials that hold the promise of increasing the operating temperature by up to 300~500 degrees. High-entropy alloys are made up of four or more chemical elements (specifically transition metal elements) in equal proportions, and thus have a very complex chemistry. This project focuses on understanding the deformation behavior and strength of these alloys at high temperatures using the most advanced computational and experimental tools at the atomic scale. The goal is to discover the mechanisms that make these systems strong at high temperature so that we can design yet better alloys and use them to replace current materials in power generation plants to increase their efficiency. For this, a diverse group of students and scientists will be engaged, including women, latino students from the Los Angeles area, and military veterans, which bring discipline, focus, and familiarity with high-precision machinery and computers. This project will be able to advance our goals towards reducing the carbon footprint of existing power plants, and contribute to other applications such as improved jet and rocket engines and safer nuclear power plants.    \r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nRefractory high entropy alloys (RHEA) are a class of materials consisting of four or more refractory metal elements in equiatomic proportions. These alloys show great promise for high temperature applications due to their high strength and ductility in a wide temperature range, potentially superior to even Ni-based superalloys. These systems usually crystallize in a body-centered cubic (bcc) alloy, which suggests that their plastic response is controlled by thermally activated  motion of screw dislocations. However, the high strength of these systems at high temperature does not fit standard theories of lattice resistance and solid solution hardening. In this project, a kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) model of screw dislocation glide will be developed. The alloy will be represented as an effective medium characterized by an atomic averaging of all the alloy elements, and where each atom then is treated as a solute in this effective environment. The project focuses on the NbMoTaW system as a representative RHEA. The computational approaches will be validated using in-situ transmission electron microscopy nanomechanical tests of single-crystal specimens, which will be used to study the temperature, orientation and strain rate dependence of the alloy. Ultimately, the tools developed under this proposal will be useful to assess how refractory high entropy alloys deform as a function of temperature and strain rate, with the goal of improving the high temperature behavior of these systems and evaluating their potential to increase the efficiency of power plants. The proposal contains a plan to involve both undergraduate students and students of underrepresented minorities in the research activities. As well, the proposal investigators will reach out to minority students and Armed Forces veterans pursuing undergraduate degrees in science and engineering. The results of this proposal will be used to enhance the content of several courses at UCLA where dislocations, strengthening mechanisms, and metals plasticity are a central part of the syllabus.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The type of alloys considered in this project are known as 'refractory' HEA because their constituent elements are all refractory transition metals that crystallize in a body-centered cubic structure. They display exceptional high temperature strength, which makes them attractive candidates for applications in the power industry, nuclear reactors, or aerospace. They are however generaly brittle at and below room temperature, which is a shortocming inherited from their constituting metals (with the exception of Ta). In this project we work with a model alloy developed a decade ago by researchers at the Air Force Research Laboratory composed of four elements in equal proprtions: Mo-Nb-Ta-W. To avoid having to deal with low-temperature brittleness, one can machine micron-sized pillars using ion-beam 'shaving' techniques to work with single crystals at very small scales.</p>\n<p>Fluctuations are known to play an important role in any type of HEA. These fluctuations can have atomic-size wavelengths because all elements mix in a random solid solution thought to be homogeneous at the macrsocopic level. However, one of our main findings is that in micron-sized single crystal specimens machined for observation under the transmission electron microscope (TEM), fluctuations can have wavelengths of several nanometers (i.e., tens of atomic distances) due to the particular affinity between pairs of elememts within the four in&nbsp;Mo-Nb-Ta-W. For example, Mo atoms prefer to be surrounded by W atoms (and vice versa), while Ta atoms prefer to be with Nb atoms. Note that this is not the same as precipitation, but akin to a phenomenon known as 'medium range ordering'. We have been able to confirm this using both atomistic simulations and a technique known as electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), which allows us to extract very precise composition line profiles inside the material. At room temperature, the implicatios of this ordering is that the strength of these alloys is now defined not by a homogeneous mixture of four elements at the atomic scale, but by regions enriched in two of the four elements on a scale of tens of times larger than atomic distances. As such, one of the main outcomes of this project is the realization that, when interpreting the strength of these alloys, we must be careful in ascribing the correct causes to it based on this new understanding of the underlying microstructure.</p>\n<p>Another important outcome that has emerged from this project is related to our modeling work. One puzzling feature of Mo-Nb-Ta-W alloys is that their strength remains constant with temperature in a wide temoerature window between 1000 and 2000 Cesius. This runs counter to our understanding of deformation mechanisms in most metallic materials, which generally soften with temperature (which can be a severe limitation some times). We have found that the chemical peculiarities of HEA result in the presence of vacancies (empty atomic lattice sites) at dislocation cores (line defects responsible for plastic deformation in metals). These vacancies distort dislocation lines locally, making their motion more difficult. More diffcult dislocation motion results in a higher material strength. Because the higher the temperature the higher the likelihood of finding vacancies, this now provides a mechanism for thermal strengthening, as opposed to thermal softening. We believe this discovery can lead to new design guidelines for refractory HEA strength at high temperature.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/07/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jaime&nbsp;Marian</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1905822/1905822_10635163_1665144622733_pillars--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1905822/1905822_10635163_1665144622733_pillars--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Deformed micropillar of Nb-Mo-Ta-W\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1905822/1905822_10635163_1665144622733_pillars--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Deformed micropillar of Nb-Mo-Ta-W\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Electron microscopy images of a Nb-Mo-Ta-W micropillar before and after compression.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Marta Pozuelo/Jaime Marian</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jaime&nbsp;Marian</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Deformed micropillar of Nb-Mo-Ta-W</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1905822/1905822_10635163_1665116139716_wiggles1000b--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1905822/1905822_10635163_1665116139716_wiggles1000b--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Wiggled screw dislocation line\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1905822/1905822_10635163_1665116139716_wiggles1000b--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Wiggled screw dislocation line\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The image shows the existence of 'wiggles' on a screw dislocation line as a consequence of a complex chemical energy landscape.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Xinran Zhou and Jaime Marian</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jaime&nbsp;Marian</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Wiggled screw dislocation line</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1905822/1905822_10635163_1665115784118_vol-strain--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1905822/1905822_10635163_1665115784118_vol-strain--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Double-jog on an edge dislocation from vacancy relaxation\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1905822/1905822_10635163_1665115784118_vol-strain--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Double-jog on an edge dislocation from vacancy relaxation\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The image shows a color map representing the local volumetric strain resulting from the relaxation of one vacancy on an edge dislocation core position.
