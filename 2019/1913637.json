 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I project develops a collaborative augmented reality (AR) learning platform to build knowledge and skills targeted by Next Generation Science Standards through early, hands-on design of scientific systems. Troubleshooting - diagnosing, explaining and fixing errors - is an element of the design process often missing from educational activities as it is difficult to execute with large groups of students, but AR can address elegantly. Furthermore, expert instructors and peers need not be in the same room to collaboratively solve problems presented as interactive three-dimensional system models. Collaborative AR, requiring only common devices, will substantially increase affordability and access to substantive and engaging science, engineering, technology and math (STEM) within formal and informal, as well as classroom and home learning environments. Without the barriers of expensive equipment, dangerous materials or trained facilitators, educational AR is poised for dramatic growth, commanding an estimated $12B globally by 2020. Earlier and more effective STEM education provides fundamental knowledge to motivate the scientists and engineers of tomorrow to aspire and contribute to leading-edge discoveries and innovations. At the highest level, this work will benefit society by increasing the supply of collaborative, STEM-proficient, critical thinkers who are poised to prosper in the workforce of the future. \r\n\r\n\r\nCollaborative AR must surmount technical hurdles in image recognition, integration and pedagogy to achieve acceptance in elementary education. Capabilities of existing AR technologies suffer shortcomings in the functionality required for real-time recognition of three-dimensional space with common devices, including issues with the camera, image projection, and processing. Technical innovations are required for new methods to identify and place targets within the uniformity of learning environments. The additional challenge of implementing live collaboration in a multi-user setting requires technical innovations around the seamless integration of various devices as well as the development and testing of intuitive user interfaces from both student and instructor perspectives. These include how to measure behaviors, handle conflicting actions, and how to give, receive and respond to the dynamic instructor feedback. Understanding, measuring and reporting the educational advantages and shortcomings in motivating and developing diverse learners in distinct learning environments cannot be overlooked in implementing technology tools. Meaningful pedagogical innovations must occur to effectively leverage the new power of AR without overlooking unintended impacts on students or their educational outcomes. These specifications require novel curriculum design both to achieve the cross-disciplinary understanding through increasingly complex problems and to deliver the full impact promised by educational AR.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
