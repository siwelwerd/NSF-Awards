 "awd_abstract_narration": "Catalyst Projects provide support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities to work towards establishing research capacity of faculty to strengthen science, technology, engineering and mathematics undergraduate education and research. It is expected that the award will further the faculty member's research capability, improve research and teaching at the institution, and involve undergraduate students in research experiences. This project at Johnson C. Smith University will explore the ability of natural compounds to permanently inhibit or prevent the progression of cell death via apoptosis in neuronal cells. The project will increase the exposure and engagement of underrepresented students in hands-on, inquiry-based research in the biology of aging and prepare them for graduate and pre-professional programs in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis project forwards the trajectory to find natural compounds that impact molecular switches that may permanently slow or stop the progression of apoptosis in neuronal cells. The central hypothesis is that flavonoids may inhibit, block or prevent the progression of apoptosis in HT22 neuronal cells. Cell death via apoptosis leads to the activation of molecules such as caspases which have been shown to induce apoptosis. Although studies show that flavonoids are able to inhibit apoptosis in human normal astrocytes, few studies have focused on this aspect of flavonoid bioactivity or the molecular targets impacted in this role. This project is an in-vitro study with the primary goal of assessing the effects of flavonoids on neuronal cell death via apoptosis, an issue that is critically associated to the fields of systems biology, neurobiology, and nutrition science.  The neuronal cell line HT22, will be used in this study for the purpose of assessing the impact of quercetin and macluraxanthone on gene and protein expression of molecular targets (caspases 3, 8, 9; iROS; iNOS) and to measure the impact of antioxidant compounds on the rate of cell death via apoptosis in vitro. The findings from this study will increase knowledge of inhibition of cell death via apoptosis in neuronal cells.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Phytochemicals (antioxidants) such as flavonoids are metabolic products from plants and are found in wine, berries, cocoa, tea, onions, parsley and other foods that are regularly consumed in the human diet. Flavonoids have been shown to possess antibacterial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. More importantly, intake of flavonoids have been associated with improved cognitive performance over a 10 year period, and in vitro studies have shown malcluraxanthone and quercetin to be specific and potent inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase  one of the main molecules targeted for treatment of neurological disorders. Antioxidants such as flavonoids have also been shown to induce apoptosis in a dose dependent manner in cancer cells and to inhibit growth of cancer cells by upregulation of molecular markers that lead to apoptosis such as caspases and iROS. However, few studies have focused on the role of antioxidants to prevent ageing and inhibit cell death in normal cells. This study focused on the role of quercetin (AchE inhibitors and cognition supporters) and (Tetrahydrocannabinol) THC to inhibit apoptosis in a normal, neuronal cell line. \r\n\n\nCaspases (3, 8, 9), iROS and iNOS are well studied molecular targets that induce apoptosis in different cell lines. Several studies have shown that antioxidants can inhibit cell signaling mechanisms that lead to activation of caspases (and other intracellular molecules) thereby inhibiting apoptosis in neuronal cells. We assessed whether or not natural compounds could prevent or halt the process of apoptosis in RT4 and HT22 cell lines. We hypothesized that flavonoids may exhibit neuroprotective effects in HT22 cells. Therefore, we attempted to observe the expression of Caspases 3,8,9 in these experiments since these molecules have been linked to intrinsic mitochondrial breakdown in the apoptotic pathway. This was an in-vitro study created to elucidate the effects of flavonoids on neuronal cell death via apoptosis- an issue that is critical to the field of cell biology and neurobiology. We found that quercetin and THC provide some protective effects on RT4 cells, and had initiated studies on HT22 neuronal cells. Using RT4 cells allowed us to initiate processes, trains students and gain skills to study apoptosis and neuronal cell death in vitro. The results gave some insight into how antioxidants, that are commonly found in food, and THC may provide possible protection against apoptosis in neuronal cells.
