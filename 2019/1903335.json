 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rapidly flaring gamma-rays and other radiative signals from blazar jets and pulsar wind nebulae indicate that standard models for energy dissipation and particle acceleration in relativistic cosmic plasmas, which invoke shock waves and hydromagnetic diffusion, are probably incorrect.  This project uses powerful new computational tools to study a promising alternative: the direct dissipation of magnetic energy through reconnection and turbulence in collisionless relativistic plasmas.  The study will explore relativistic particle acceleration and the associated radiation in a much more realistic astrophysical context than the idealized configurations used to obtain encouraging preliminary results.  This work will yield insights into the interactions of black holes with their cosmic environments.  The innovative approaches to PIC simulation can be applied to a broad range of problems in space physics and laboratory plasmas.  There is a range of associated research experiences for undergraduates, as well as support, training and mentorship for a postdoctoral researcher.  Contribution to public scientific literacy comes through collaboration with the Fiske Planetarium, using visually arresting graphics and animations from the simulations.\r\n\r\nSimulations which have started from idealized configurations have shown robust nonthermal particle energy distributions and variability characteristics.  The particle distributions correlate with the initial magnetization of the plasma, which is the ratio of magnetic energy density to relativistic plasma enthalpy.  Surprisingly, similar correlations develop in systems with different compositions (pairs or electron-ion plasma) and in setups ranging from idealized reconnecting current sheets to three-dimensional driven turbulence.  A vertical kinetic study will follow unstable magneto-hydrodynamic pinch configurations through their nonlinear development to the resulting turbulence, reconnection, particle acceleration, and radiation.  The well-tested Zeltron radiative Particle-in-Cell (PIC) code, developed by this team and publicly available since 2014, enables a thorough analysis of \"kinetic beaming,\" and a study of the relationships between microscopic kinetic processes and macroscopic features such as secondary flux ropes, current sheets, and bulk flows.  State-of-the-art computational tools allow kinetic and radiative plasma phenomena to be related to macroscopic magnetohydrodynamic instability, under relativistic conditions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nPowerful, fast jets of hot ionized gas (plasma) are often produced just outside the horizons of black holes that are in the process of swallowing matter. These jets can be modeled as a fluid whose dynamics is modified by strong magnetic fields in the presence of a spinning black hole's gravity. But to observe these flows, one must rely on detecting the radiation from ultra-energetic particles embedded in the gas. The existence of these particles, while evident observationally, cannot be predicted using the fluid models for the jets themselves. Instead, one must delve into the microscopic structure of the jet plasma, using particle-by-particle simulations known as \"kinetic\" methods.\n\n\nThis project applied kinetic \"Particle-In-Cell\" simulations to an idealized representation of the jet interior called a magnetic pinch. A pinch is a configuration - well known in laboratory plasmas - in which an electric current propagating along the jet creates magnetic fields that confine or \"pinch\" the plasma toward the jet axis. Such configurations are notoriously unstable to twisting themselves into disruptive kinks. This kinking, and the turbulence that results, can be followed to some extent using fluid methods. The objective of our kinetic approach was to go further, attempting to follow how the turbulence can generate a population of ultra-energetic, \"nonthermal\" particles responsible for the observed radiation.\n\n\nWe were able to elucidate the relationship between the fluid-like background properties of the pinch and the resulting nonthermal particles, learning how to diagnose the underlying plasma in terms of its observable radiation. The connections deduced from our simulations will prove valuable in modeling and understanding the results from the NSF-sponsored Event Horizon Telescope, which has produced the first direct images of black holes. We also learned about the role of narrow current sheets and associated electric fields, and the roles played separately by electrons and protons in the long-term development of the pinch. Such processes are not accessible to fluid approaches.\n\n\nWhile our research was specialized to the extreme velocities (close to the speed of light) and magnetic field strengths thought to exist near black holes, our results could be useful for other studies of plasmas in the laboratory and space. For example, laser-generated plasmas - which provide one approach to controlled fusion - can exhibit similar configurations and kinetic processes. Moreover, Earth's Solar System environment contains plasmas undergoing analogous turbulent and particle acceleration processes. Understanding \"space weather\" is a critical element for protecting satellites and global communications.\n\n\nThis project involved several educational and outreach components. Graduate students and postdocs were involved in the research, becoming adept at state-of-the-art plasma simulation techniques and analysis methods. They also learned valuable professional skills through leadership on supercomputing proposals and co-supervision of undergraduate research projects. Material from the project was integrated into a lower-division undergraduate course on Black Holes, developed and taught by the PI. We also worked with the University of Colorados Fiske Planetarium to visualizations of plasma processes for use in full dome shows\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/22/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MitchellCBegelman\n"
