 "awd_abstract_narration": "Navigating the New Arctic (NNA) is one of NSF's 10 Big Ideas. NNA projects address convergence scientific challenges in the rapidly changing Arctic. The Arctic research is needed to inform the economy, security and resilience of the Nation, the larger region and the globe. NNA empowers new research partnerships from local to international scales, diversifies the next generation of Arctic researchers, and integrates the co-production of knowledge. This award fulfills part of that aim.\r\n\r\nPermafrost is ground that remains frozen for at least two consecutive years. It occurs under approximately one fourth of the northern hemisphere's land surface. In the far north, the permafrost is continuous across the landscape and contains large amounts of ice in its upper few meters. Thawing of permafrost has been observed at several locations across the Arctic in recent decades, yet the complete extent of permafrost degradation is not yet described. This is because it is difficult to directly measure permafrost. However, the presence and health of permafrost can be inferred from characteristic ground surface features. For example, permafrost can be detected from detailed satellite images through the presence of 30-meter-wide ice-wedge polygons. It is important to detect areas with thawing permafrost to identify challenges for infrastructure that depend on a foundation of solid ground. This project is developing the Permafrost Discovery Gateway, an online platform that makes permafrost information more accessible and discoverable by the public. The public includes industry, non-profit organizations, and people living and working in the Arctic. Future workforce development includes the training of graduate students and postdocs in remote sensing technology. Five early career researchers are the lead investigators. The K-12 education community are receiving virtual resources to help them interact with the Permafrost Discovery Gateway. In addition, a collaborative art exhibition, an interactive digital story, and an online Earth as Art gallery are displaying Arctic landscapes to the general public. These tools enable diverse peoples of different technical backgrounds to interact with permafrost knowledge across the entire Arctic. This project informs the economy, security, and resilience of the U.S., the larger region, and the globe with respect to Arctic change. \r\n\r\nThe main goal of this project is to develop supporting cyberinfrastructure to harness information from high-resolution satellite imagery. This approach is advancing the understanding of permafrost degradation across the entire Arctic. This project is: (1) utilizing existing Big Imagery, (2) refining and developing new automated remote sensing classification tools based on machine and deep learning techniques, (3) applying the mapping tools to Arctic satellite imagery, (4) making permafrost map products and tools publicly accessible, and (5) enabling discovery through visualization and analysis tools designed with users of the Permafrost Discovery Gateway. The project is producing a cyberinfrastructure framework that also includes existing Arctic map products. This framework, along with an engaged user community, is allowing researchers to better quantify the spatial extent of permafrost degradation across the Arctic. Potential controls (weather, topography, vegetation, soil properties) on permafrost degradation are also being evaluated. The Permafrost Discovery Gateway helps ensure information access to the broader research community and encourage new partnerships around knowledge of Arctic permafrost.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Permafrost, defined as ground that is continuously frozen for 2 or more years, has been rapidly changing across the Arctic, but previously we have not fully quantified that change across the entire Arctic region at the small scales at which permafrost exists. Using high-resolution satellite imagery, we trained machine learning models to extract structural permafrost features across the entire Arctic from the vantage of space. Permafrost features in the landscape vary in size from the very small, such as ice wedge networks a few meters in size, to the very large, such as thaw slumps that can be kilometers in size. Researchers on the project produced the first pan-Arctic map of ice wedge permafrost features across the entire Arctic (previous maps had focused at local or regional levels), as well as other critical landscape maps such as changes in total surface water, changes in lake sizes, the presence of rapid lake-drainage events, and maps of Arctic carbon release. <br /><br />These novel maps and the data backing them were published to the Arctic Data Center through the Permafrost Discovery Gateway, which we developed as an interactive and user-friendly web platform to share, view, and interact with permafrost information across the entire Arctic. This science gateway provides data and access to permafrost information across the Arctic to both research and public users, while also connecting different user groups around questions and problems that can be addressed with the data and tools available in the gateway. For example, permafrost thaw has been observed at many locations across the Arctic in recent decades, yet the pan-Arctic extent and local variations in thaw were poorly described. By quantifying and visualizing permafrost changes with satellite imagery, both local communities and we as a broader society improve our knowledge of changes in the Arctic and can use that information to improve people&rsquo;s lives. Now, local communities can use permafrost maps from the gateway to better understand where permafrost is melting in their communities, and plan to mitigate some of the worst effects of these changes, such as building and road damage, coastal erosion, and changes in surface water flows across the region. <br /><br />By developing the computing and modeling infrastructure in this project, and by producing new scientific data products on the distribution and impacts of permafrost landscape features,&nbsp; we created new capabilities to map, understand, and mitigate Arctic-wide changes in permafrost that will have major impacts on society.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 04/07/2025<br>\nModified by: Kenton&nbsp;McHenry</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1927729/1927729_10642439_1744059306613_2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1927729/1927729_10642439_1744059306613_2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1927729/1927729_10642439_1744059306613_2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Permafrost Discovery Gateway global imagery viewer, here showing a polar view of the newly visualized pan-Arctic dataset depicting average terrestrial net carbon dioxide balance at 1km resolution.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Anna Liljedhal</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kenton&nbsp;McHenry\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1927729/1927729_10642439_1744059414321_1--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1927729/1927729_10642439_1744059414321_1--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1927729/1927729_10642439_1744059414321_1--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Permafrost Discovery Gateway global imagery viewer, showing permafrost ice wedge features around Cape Blossom, AK which has experienced strong coastal erosion.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Anna Liljedhal</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kenton&nbsp;McHenry\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1927729/1927729_10642439_1744059368172_3--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1927729/1927729_10642439_1744059368172_3--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1927729/1927729_10642439_1744059368172_3--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Gateway features for allowing PDG portal visitors to quickly navigate to stories of interest using a Viewfinder interface.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Anna Liljedhal</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kenton&nbsp;McHenry\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
