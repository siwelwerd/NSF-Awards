 "awd_abstract_narration": "Racial, ethnic and gender diversity enhances creativity and is essential for sustained innovation, entrepreneurial activity and global competitiveness. However, diversification at the graduate level remains a major challenge for many universities. What is needed is a comprehensive, scalable and cost-effective approach that can address: low ethnic/racial diversity; low doctoral degree completion rates, and inadequate preparation to succeed in graduate school and pursue academic, private sector and professional careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to the University of Nevada, Reno will test a novel recruitment, retention and career preparedness approach for increasing the representation of first-generation college students and students from historically underrepresented groups in STEM graduate education.  Students will be engaged in two 3-week summer boot camps as well as additional professional development, mentoring, and social network support activities during the first 1.5 years of graduate school.  Unique elements of this project include (1) intentional development of a recruitment/retention positive feedback loop, (2) family/community involvement to enhance support groups, and (3) training in marketable skills (e.g. communication via virtual reality platforms). Outcomes from this project will generate new knowledge concerning best practices for recruitment and retention of historically underrepresented populations.  \r\n\r\nWhile this project is broadly focused on recruitment, retention and career preparedness for historically underrepresented groups of graduate students, there are five major areas being addressed.  Specifically, the project will test interventions and compare results across control and test groups to examine potential changes in: (1) academic performance and research quality, (2) non-financial family support, (3) ease of navigation toward degree completion and career placement, (4) recruitment and retention, and (5) student research and communication skills. Interventions include quantitative disciplinary and transferrable skills modules, social support networks and enhanced mentoring and mentor training.  Formative/summative assessment and hypothesis testing procedures will include surveys, academic performance comparisons, course evaluations, focus groups, one-on-one interviews, social network interviews, FIG (Family Involvement in Graduate School) assessment of students/family members and National Resource Mentoring Network surveys of faculty members. Interventions will be evaluated individually and collectively to determine whether student and faculty participation enhanced graduate education outcomes, improved mentor/mentee relationships and enhanced recruitment of historically underrepresented groups and first-generation students through positive feedback loops.  \r\n\r\nThe Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education. The goals of IGE are to pilot, test and validate innovative approaches to graduate education and to generate the knowledge required to move these approaches into the broader community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
