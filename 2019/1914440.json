 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum mechanics describes the subatomic world in ways that seem counterintuitive to our everyday experience.  Recently, researchers have discovered innovative ways to harness these surprising features for use in information processing technologies.  Quantum systems are now understood as possessing certain resources such as entanglement, coherence, and nonlocality, which can be applied in next-generation devices.  This research project will study the general mathematical theory of quantum resources.  It seeks to advance the understanding of how non-classical features of quantum mechanics can be measured and manipulated using physical processes that are conducive for experimental implementation.  Ultimately the results of this project will help lay the theoretical foundation for future quantum-based technologies, which include cryptographic, computational, and communication devices.  In attaining its results, this project will help prepare the next generation of scientists by supporting a diverse student workforce. \r\n\r\nThis research will study quantum resource theories from two complementary perspectives.  First, it will investigate general mathematical features that are present in many different types of quantum resource theories.  Specifically, it will identify and study a general mathematical feature, known as full physical consistency, that naturally arises in resource theories strongly compatible with realistic experimental implementations.  In addition, it will investigate structural properties and resource measures in non-convex theories.  As a second research thrust, this project will examine the specific resource theories of quantum nonlocality and generalized quantum measurements.  Rigorous frameworks for these resource theories will be developed that focus on their operational natures.  Furthermore, nonlocality and measurement incompatibility, two fundamental features of quantum mechanics, will be unified as equivalent resources in semi-quantum nonlocal games.  As a practical application, a novel method for constructing measurement device-independent dimensionality witnesses will be introduced.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nQuantum information science studies potentially revolutionary ways in which the fundamental properties of quantum mechanics can enhance computation and communication technologies.  Properties such as entanglement and nonlocality have no direct classical analog, and they can be interpreted as resources for quantum information processing.  This sponsored project has focused on quantum resource theories, which is a general framework for quantifying different quantum resources and understanding how they can be manipulated in operationally restricted environments.  Four specific types of resource have been studied: entanglement, coherence, nonlocality, and measurement incompatibility. For entanglement, three-party entangled states were considered, and a new optimal protocol was obtained for decoupling one party from the other two when all three are working together.  This protocol is feasible for experimental demonstration in near-term quantum networks.  Entanglement was also studied in a dynamical setting, and we introduced the concept of an entanglement-breaking superchannel, which is a deleterious process that eliminates any quantum channel\u2019s ability to distribute entanglement.  The resources of coherence and nonlocality were also studied in a dynamical setting.  For coherence we quantified how non-classical a given channel can be in terms of its ability to distribute quantum coherence.  Our work on nonlocality resolved a very fundamental question on the difference between entanglement and Bell nonlocality.  By adopting a resource-theoretic perspective, we rigorously showed that Bell nonlocality is a special form of entanglement.  Namely, it is an instantaneous quantum process that cannot be generated using local quantum operations and classical communication, the basic free operations in the resource theory of entanglement.  Finally, we provided a new way to view the non-classical phenomenon of measurement incompatibility as a resource for programmable measurement devices.  We derived necessary and sufficient conditions for when one programmable measurement device can be transformed to another without needing additional quantum memory.  All of the results obtained in this project can help inform the design and optimization of future quantum technologies.  Additionally, this work directly supported the training of four undergraduate students and two PhD students in quantum information science.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric A Chitambar"
