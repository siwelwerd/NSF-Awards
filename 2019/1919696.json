 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the purchase of an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) with laser ablation and mercury speciation capabilities.  This instrument will enable cutting-edge, interdisciplinary research by researchers at Grinnell College working in the areas of: 1) pollution control and prevention, with a focus on water quality; 2) carbon cycling in arid environments; 3) renewable energy generation and storage; 4) analysis of archaeological artifacts to reconstruct human history; and 5) novel approaches to chemical synthesis.  The instrumentation will promote faculty-mentored undergraduate student research and education at Grinnell, giving students and faculty access to modern, cutting-edge instrumentation for elemental analysis in both research and active-pedagogy driven coursework.  Grinnell College has a longstanding commitment to diversity, inclusion, and access in the sciences; the research supported by this MRI award will also help to broaden participation of historically underrepresented students in the fields of geoscience, environmental science, and materials science.  \r\n\r\nThe ICP-MS to be funded is a Perkin Elmer Nexion 2000 ICP-MS with associated autosamplers for mercury speciation (Brooks Rand MERX-M and MERX-T) and laser ablation (LA) system (ESI NWR213).  Specific applications of the instrument include: 1) investigations of mercury cycling in aquatic environments (especially methylmercury production and degradation); 2) investigations into the role of non-rainfall moisture and associated trace element deposition in carbon cycling in arid environments; 3) synthesis and characterization of novel thin film photo and oxygen reduction catalysts; 4) sourcing provenance and trade routes of archaeological materials from Asia and the American Southwest; and 5) characterization of interactions between synthetic transition metal complexes and proteins.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis major research instrumentation (MRI) award from the National Science Foundation (NSF) supported the purchase of an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) equipped with instruments for laser ablation (LA) and mercury speciation analysis at Grinnell College, a liberal arts college dedicated to teaching and research with undergraduates.  The ICP-MS has supported ongoing projects related to: a) the behavior of trace element pollutants in the environment, especially mercury; b) reconstruction of past climate using elemental signals preserved in stalagmites; c) the development of novel materials for energy harvesting and storage; and d) characterization of archaeological materials.   \n\n \n\nMercury pollution is the main driver of fish consumption advisories in the United States.  This award supported investigations of mercury occurrence and behavior in groundwater and rivers in Eastern Iowa, a region for which we have little information on mercury concentrations, despite this region receiving high inputs of mercury from the atmosphere.  We found that concentrations of methylmercury, a neurotoxic and bioaccumulative form of mercury, increase in groundwater and wetlands in response to flood events.  We discovered that agriculturally intensive regions with high rates of soil erosion may be more important to mercury export than previously recognized.  The NSF-supported instrumentation will permit ongoing long-term mercury monitoring vital to understanding the impacts of land-use management and climate change on mercury in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.  A second mercury-focused project investigated the mechanisms of methylmercury degradation by bacteria common in the low-oxygen habitats where mercury methylation occurs.  This process is poorly understood, but critical for accurate models that can predict mercury bioaccumulation and potential human exposure.   We found that methylmercury degradation by a variety of anerobic bacteria (bacteria that live in oxygen free environments) is very slow, and that other biological (e.g., mer-operon containing organisms) and chemical processes (e.g., abiotic reactions with sulfide or sulfide minerals) probably dominate methylmercury degradation.    \n\n \n\nKnowledge of how the climate system has functioned in the past improves our ability to predict the impacts of climate change.  Using the NSF-supported LA-ICP-MS, we have been involved in new collaborative research (with researchers at Iowa State University) using trace element signals in stalagmites (calcium carbonate cave formations) to reconstruct past climate in Portugal and the tropical Andes in Columbia.  Trace element signals, like the amount of magnesium incorporated into the stalagmite calcium carbonate (calcite), allow us to infer changes in water availability at relatively fine time intervals (years or less) because of the ability to measure concentrations at the micrometer-scale.  These analyses can complement other techniques like stable isotope analysis to help us understand the natural variability of climate phenomena like the El Nino Southern Oscillation or the North Atlantic Oscillation.  \n\n \n\nA transition to a renewable energy economy will require new materials for harvesting and storing energy from sunlight.  The NSF-supported instrumentation has also been utilized in research focused on developing new thin-film photocatalysts (materials that convert sunlight to electrical energy) and oxygen-reduction catalysts (materials used in fuel cells) by confirming the composition and homogeneity of the materials.   \n\n \n\nLastly, we have begun collecting data on the elemental composition of archeologically important cherts (used in gun flints and arrow points) using LA-ICP-MS.  These studies aim to evaluate whether elemental compositions may serve in identifying the geologic source of these materials, useful in reconstructing historical trade routes.  Our work to date has focused on method development, and we anticipate applying these methodologies to a wide variety of archaeological materials.  \n\n \n\nGrinnell College is an undergraduate-only institution where undergraduate research is central to the mission of the institution.  Despite a shift to remote learning during a significant portion of the project period due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we were able to involve a total of ten undergraduate research students in mentored advanced research projects that have made significant use of the NSF-funded instrumentation.  Seven of these students have had the opportunity to present their work at a national or regional scientific meeting.  Dozens of other students in upper-level chemistry courses have also gained exposure to elemental analysis using ICP-MS, many of whom are now pursuing careers in geoscience, environmental science, or analytical chemistry.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/21/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew M Graham"
