 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nanomaterials are being developed for use in several applications including coatings, antimicrobials, components in sunscreens, electronics, catalysts, and other products. With their growing use is the potential that these materials may cause environmental harm. However, other uses of nanomaterials include technologies for monitoring the health of the environment, environmental cleanup, and water treatment which will ultimately positively impact the environment. This 5th Gordon Research Conference on Environmental Nanotechnology will focus on advancing the understanding of how nanomaterials may interact with environmental systems and how they may be developed toward beneficial uses to help manage our water and environment. The Environmental Nanotechnology GRC is one of the most interactive conferences on this topic, and often is a platform for the generation of new ideas that go on to heavily influence the field. Participants include researchers from graduate students to professors, industry and government representatives, and international scientists which encourages stimulating discussions concerning the latest developments in the field from across the globe. The research presented and developed in relation to the Environmental Nanotechnology GRC is key to the sustainable development of this technology. The open exchange of ideas is a GRC hallmark and the collaborations and ideas that originate at this conference is fundamental in advancing the science of the biological and environmental interactions of nanoscale materials. The activities of the GRC and the affiliated Graduate Research Seminar build opportunities for early-career scientists by integrating these new scientists into a non-intimidating environment to discuss their current research and build informal networks with their peers that may lead to a lifetime of collaboration and scientific achievement. \r\n\r\nThis 5th GRC on the topic will discuss the next steps in the field and focus on topics such as advances in nanomaterial design, developments towards creating the next generation of materials, as well as new, advanced applications related to the environment including nano- enabled sensing technologies, environmental cleanup, and water and wastewater treatment. The potential environmental impacts of the use of nanomaterials continues to be a theme in this meeting with special attention to the interaction at the interfaces of nanomaterials and biological components. The 2019 GRC will also include a session on modeling and the development of predictive tools that probe nanoparticle behavior, transport and transformation. In addition, the development and application of in situ characterization techniques to reliably measure nanomaterial presence, transport, and interaction in the often-complex surrounding environment, will be explored. The meeting will be held from June 2-7, 2019 in Newry, Maine (Sunday River Ski Resort). This will also be the third time we develop and promote the associated Graduate Research Seminar (GRS), which brings together graduate students, and early career scientists to engage in discussions concerning the scientific advances in research and development. Opportunities for career development and mentoring will also be available at the seminar.\r\n.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
