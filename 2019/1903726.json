 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks solutions for re-energizing the electricity grid in hurricane-affected regions by\r\nsynergistically considering the convergence of unique aspects of systems engineering, social science, and\r\nfield data. Specifically, it will include fragility (vulnerability), sustainability, and survivability (resilience)\r\nas the core principles of design and operation. The social science approach to this work includes\r\nunderstanding the perceived barriers and benefits of grid infrastructure that can increase resilience during\r\nextreme weather events and routine storms. Field data, enabled by the participation of a utility affected by\r\nHurricane Michael, will play a crucial role in defining the solutions proposed using resilient microgrids.\r\nThe currently affected electric grid in the Florida panhandle, combined with the heightened need for\r\nreliable access to electricity, provides a unique opportunity to re-engineer this critical infrastructure using\r\nself-reliant, local, and resilient concepts such as the microgrid. In that regard, the team will use its\r\nextensive body of work in the field of electric power microgrids, aimed at normal and disaster-recovery\r\nmodes of operation, to fulfill the requirements of a stable, reliable, and economical source of electricity\r\nsupply to communities. The work will consider social factors by extensive engagement with the people on\r\nthe ground including the more vulnerable populations affected along with those most involved in current\r\nefforts in providing relief. This information will be used in a multi-criteria based prioritized design of\r\nmicrogrids for minimizing fragility, including sustainability measures, and increasing resilience. This idea\r\nof engineering the grid will create a template for Smart electric infrastructures, especially in the Atlantic\r\ncoast and Gulf of Mexico regions, so that they can all become prepared for future onslaughts from\r\nhurricanes. The team includes engineers and a behavioral psychologist that are experts in electrical power\r\nsystems design and operation, resilient and sustainable systems engineering, and surveys-based\r\napproaches to identification and quantification of barriers and benefits. Collaborations with a municipal\r\nutility from the FL panhandle, entities engaged in Hurricane Maria related rebuilding efforts in Puerto\r\nRico, a national lab, and an international academic institution strengthen our team.\r\n\r\nThe significant and transformative components of this RAPID proposal are: (a) engagement of local\r\ncommunities and utility to assess electricity supply needs; (b) engagement of relief/recovery providers in\r\nthe area for coordinating solutions; (c) design of specialized microgrids using multi-criteria based\r\npriority-oriented approaches; (d) co-optimization of design objectives including fragility, sustainability,\r\nand resilience of microgrids; and, (e) creation of template for resilience plan for hurricane-prone electric\r\ngrids. We will achieve the goals of this RAPID proposal by utilizing real data gathered from the ground,\r\nbasing our design and operation principles on sound mathematics and engineering, modeling and\r\nsimulating on realistic test systems, and proposing validation techniques for future implementation in the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
