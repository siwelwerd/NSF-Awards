 "awd_abstract_narration": "Heat waves are responsible for more deaths each year than all other natural disasters \r\ncombined. In urban areas, extreme heat events are intensified by the Urban Heat Island effect, \r\nwhich results in even more extreme microclimates due to the physical layouts of cities, the use \r\nof certain building materials, and a reduction in natural landscapes. In this project, the \r\ninvestigator will identify landscape design recommendations to mitigate extreme heat hazards \r\nin urban microclimates. Body-worn and ambient sensors will be used to understand urban heat \r\nwave patterns and the influences that heat and humidity have on physiological functions such \r\nas the core body temperature of individuals utilizing outdoor urban areas.  A wearable and \r\nambient sensor network will be extended and field-tested in Bloomington, Indiana. Geographic \r\ninformation systems will be used to classify urban areas within Bloomington \r\ninto microclimates in order to ascertain exposure levels of heat and humidity hazards to \r\nresidents. A real-time monitoring system for microclimates during heat extremes will be \r\ndeveloped using participatory design with stakeholders such as city planners, public health \r\nofficials, green infrastructure experts, and citizens. Results will include a new understanding of \r\nthe effects of extreme heat events on human health and wellbeing and will provide methods to \r\nmitigate heat hazards through more effective use of information technology and urban green \r\ninfrastructure. \r\n\r\nUrban heat extremes result in the highest number of fatalities across all types of natural \r\ndisasters each year. The design of cities and urban areas contributes to the intensity of heat \r\nevents through the Urban Heat Island effect. The investigator aims to use wearable sensors and \r\nembedded environmental sensors to better understand effects of extreme heat microclimates \r\non human health. The method includes an extension of an existing person-environment sensor \r\nnetwork to collect human physiological data and ambient temperature variances in \r\nmicroclimates. Current data and software tools will be used to explore, classify and integrate data to determine \r\nrelationships between microclimate heat events throughout the city, interactions with humidity \r\nand wind speed variations, and human physiological responses, such as core body temperature. \r\nThrough participatory design, prototype visualizations of real-time climactic changes in \r\nmicroclimates will be developed. This research will contribute to collaborative efforts among \r\nstakeholders to minimize risks to human health and design green infrastructure to mitigate the \r\nharmful effects of extreme heat events.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
