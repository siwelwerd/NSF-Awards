 "awd_abstract_narration": "Grid-scale energy storage has the potential to alleviate the variability and unpredictability of renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar, while also improving electrical grid stability and national infrastructure security.  This research project investigates organic electrochemical redox flow battery systems and one of their major limiting factors: electrode performance losses that contribute to a decrease in efficiency to the overall system. In most electrochemical systems, ions must move to store or release electricity in the electrode. If ionic transport is slow, then the system's ability to deliver power at high efficiency suffers. The research team will address the synthesis of the electrode material, mathematical simulations of the electrode formation mechanisms, and characterization of the electrochemical performance of the electrode in a flow battery application. The electrode material has a porous structure that is designed so that the transport of liquid electrolyte is facilitated and improves the power and efficiency of the whole battery system. The mathematical simulation component of this research is expected to contribute to a broader understanding of how fluids move in porous structure.  Such knowledge will be useful in oil and gas production, groundwater hydrodynamics, and other electrochemical reactors. The research will be integrated into a broad range of educational and outreach activities that include research dissemination through graduate and undergraduate courses, a pre-college summer program, and video clips of experimental demonstrations and simulation results for YouTube dissemination. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this research project is to accelerate ionic transport in organic electrochemical systems and to reduce ion transport loss via directionally-porous graphene aerogel (DGA) electrodes. Studies will lead to an understanding of the fundamental physics that define the relationship between viscous flow, porosity, pore morphology, and mass and ionic transport. The research will complement current research in organic redox electrochemical systems including identification of promising electrochemical redox couples and suitable separators. The project involves cyclic integration between molecular dynamics simulations of synthesis conditions, synthesis of DGA electrodes via freeze-templating, material property assessment, and electrode demonstration in an operating organic redox flow battery (biphenyl anode, sulfide/polysulfide cathode, and sodium triflate as charge carrier). Molecular dynamics simulations will focus on the effects of freezing conditions on electrode structure and ionic (biphenyl radical, sulfide, and sodium ion) transport in the presence of electrolyte convection. DGA electrodes will be synthesized under a variety of conditions for comparison with simulation results and implementation in a biphenyl/polysulfide redox flow battery. Physical properties including stiffness, porosity, and surface area, and electrode-relevant properties including electrochemical surface area, electronic and thermal conductivities, and effective permeability will be assessed. A novel characterization technique will directly measure changes in effective liquid-phase ionic conductivity using the same foundational principle underlying the standard four-point probe test used to measure solid-phase ionic conductivity (e.g. ion exchange membranes). The new diagnostic will measure liquid phase ionic conductivity, with and without a porous electrode, and with or without convective flux. Liquid phase ionic conductivity will be benchmarked against aqueous sodium chloride with a conventional carbon felt electrode.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We hypothesize that directionally-aligned pores in the proposed graphene electrodes provide low-resistance channels for effective mass and charge transport while maintaining the high surface area and heat dissipation properties of graphene materials (Figure 1). The D-GA electrode structure and material characteristics were examined through complementary collaborations integrating: 1. Graphene aerogel synthesis and characterization, 2. Multiscale computational modeling of synthesis and graphene electrode properties, and 3. Evaluation of D-GA electrochemical properties.</p>\n<p>The team first freeze cast graphene hydrogel, followed by freeze drying, yielding D-GA with directionally-aligned pores; the structure was verified with scanning electron microscopy (Figure 2 a,b). Pore directionality and size were controlled by optimizing freezing temperatures, graphene oxide concentration, and synthesis container aspect ratio. The conductivity of D-GA was in the range of 2-5 S/m, affected by how much reducing agent was present and how long reduction proceeded (Figure 2c). Treating DGA at 900 <sup>o</sup>C in argon further increased the conductivity nearly three times (Figure 2c). With a slight modification to standard synthesis, copper nanoparticle-functionalized DGA (Cu-DGA) was produced (Figure 2d,e). Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that Cu content in DGA is directly related to copper precursor concentration. However, Cu-DGA had conductivity like regular DGA, likely due to poor connections within the aerogel (Figure 2f). Overall, we demonstrated facile DGA synthesis and functionalization.</p>\n<p>Through multiscale computational modeling, we investigated water freezing and graphene structuring processes during DGA synthesis, properties of graphene structures, and ion transport through graphene electrodes<strong>. </strong>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulated water-ice phase-change propagation and graphene reorientation processes, revealing the effects of supercooling, ice crystal orientation, and graphene interaction (Figure 3a). Rayleigh-Benard convection generated in the freeze-cast process was simulated using the finite volume method (varying temperatures, container geometries, fluid and dispersed graphene properties, etc.), identifying convection's influence on freezing and graphene structuring processes (Figure 3b). MD also simulated graphene thermal transport and ion transport in graphene nanochannels. Even minimal doping can significantly reduce in-plane thermal transport of graphene (2% doping leads to ~94% reduction), though it enhances interfacial transport. Our ion transport study addressed channel size, surface interaction, convective flow, and electrolytes influences, demonstrating that convective flux alters ionic mobility due to the coupling effect (Figure 3c).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Having successfully synthesized DGA electrodes under a variety of conditions, supported by simulations of water freezing dynamics with suspended graphene, the team investigated electrochemical properties of D-GA. Half-cells were tested using the biphenyl|biphenyl radical for the negative couple; polysulfide was chosen as the positive electrochemical couple. Figure 4 shows that, for the polysulfide (positive) electrode, the Cu-functionalized D-GA electrodes achieved better electrochemical activity than the reference carbon felt material (from SGL). D-GA is not a suitable electrode for the negative couple because biphenyl anion radicals attack the carbon.</p>\n<p>In addition to research, this project provided training for graduate, undergraduate, and pre-college students. Four Ph.D. students significantly contributed to this project, with three of them developing their Ph.D. dissertations based on this research. One postdoc and three undergraduate students participated in this research. We hosted eight high school students, including several from historically-underrepresented populations, via \"High School Introduction to Engineering Systems for Twelfth Graders (HITES12)\" in Years 2 and 3 (Figure 5a). During this program, we introduced principles of battery technology, computational and experimental research, as well as applications and impacts of our research.
