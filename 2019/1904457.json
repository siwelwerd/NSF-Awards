The objective of the meeting is to bring together senior and junior researchers and interested PhD students from all over the world to present and discuss old problems, new developments and current research perspectives in the areas of algebraic geometry, singularity theory and low dimensional topology. The international meeting and networking opportunity provided by the conference will contribute to the dissemination of scientific results in different countries, among young researchers and underrepresented groups.\r\n \r\nSingularity theory studies the classification problems of non-generic situations of functions, maps, and spaces. It lies in the crossroads of geometry, algebra, and topology. Ever since its emergence in the second half of the 20th century it benefited from its central role, connecting methods and notions between different areas. The invited plenary lectures given by prominent mathematicians whose work has special connections to that of Andras Nemethi  will cover many faces of singularity theory, such as differential topology, geometry, algebraic geometry, low dimensional topology, enumerative geometry, as well as the global theory of singularities.\r\n\r\nMore information can be found on the conference website\r\nhttps://www.renyi.hu/conferences/nemethi60/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
