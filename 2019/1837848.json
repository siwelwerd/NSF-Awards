 "awd_abstract_narration": "Devastating wildfires in California are often aided by extreme wind conditions.  In Southern California these include the well-known, and well-studied, Santa Ana winds.  In Central and Northern California there is another kind of downslope windstorm which has been termed the \"Diablo\" winds.  The Diablo winds have aided numerous wildfires including the recent 2017 Wine Country fires that resulted in 44 deaths and billions of dollars of damage.  Despite the grave impact of Diablo winds, there has been a relative lack of detailed research on the causes and climatology of these events.  This award will allow for a detailed characterization of Diablo wind events, an assessment of weather model skill in predicting the events, and an assessment of the projected trend of Diablo wind events in future years.  The main societal impact of the work will be to give operational weather forecasters more confidence in their ability to forecast these events, which may allow more preventative fire measures to take place.  The lead researcher is very experienced with outreach and will continue activities to better inform the public of the relevance of scientific research.  In addition, the project will help to train the next generation of scientists.\r\n\r\nThis study will investigate the structure, evolution, and underlying physical mechanisms of Diablo winds, which are strong, dry offshore-directed winds occurring over central and northern California.  The project will involve both analysis and modeling approaches.  The range of deliverables to be expected include: 1) a comprehensive description of the Diablo wind phenomenon, including its structure, evolution, dynamics and control by the synoptic scale flow, 2) a detailed climatology of Diablo winds, including their frequency, duration, annual modulation, and long-term trends over the past 70 years, 3) an evaluation of future trends in Diablo wind frequency, structure, and amplitude based on dynamically downscaled high-resolution models, driven by GCMs, and GCMs driving statistical models of Diablo wind occurrence, and 4) an evaluation of the forecast skill of operational weather forecast model guidance now currently available, and the appraisal of deficiencies in current modeling systems with respect to the Diablo wind phenomenon.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project has resulted in important new knowledge and understanding regarding wildfire meteorology over the western U.S. It has also produced a breakthrough new model parameterization of warm-rain processes that can improve precipitation forecasts throughout the U.S. The work of the project is complete.\n\n\nac\n\n\nThis project began by describing and modeling Diablo winds, the downslope winds over northern California that have been associated with many major wildfires over the region. The project then turned to examining the meteorology associated with several major wildfires across the western U.S., including the 2017 Wine Country Fire, the 2018 Camp Fire, and the 2020 Oregon Fires. For all these events, it was shown that highly predictable downslope winds were key factors. The examination of wildfire meteorology was then extended to evaluating the meteorology associated with hundreds of California fires, making use of high-resolution satellite datasets to define wildfire existence and growth. A major finding of this work has been the demonstration that strong winds are critical contributors to nearly all major wildfires in California.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe research project has also produced some other major findings. It has shown the relationship between eastern Pacific sea surface temperatures and surface air temperature and humidity over the Pacific Northwest. Even more important was the solving of a major modeling challenge: to improve weather forecast model simulation of warm rain situations during which ice processes are not important. Although warm rain is critical for accurate precipitation prediction along the West Coast, in Alaska, and Hawaii, model skill has lagged due to problems with the physical description of this process. The new warm-rain description developed as part of this research project has resulted in a new, highly accurate parameterization that can greatly improve precipitation prediction in research and operational models.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, with the support of this grant, other research advances have been completed. Two papers described the origins of the 2021 Northwest heatwave and the role of dry soils. Another paper examined the reasons for the lagging of U.S. numerical weather prediction, while another research effort described the localized tree blow-down on the slopes of the Olympic Mountains of Washington State. In total, this project resulted in 17 papers published in the peer-reviewed literature.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/06/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: CliffordFMass\n"
