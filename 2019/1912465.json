 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cosmological observations indicate that modern physics can explain only a small fraction (about 5%) of the microscopic composition of the Universe. Exacting the nature of the remaining 95%, dark matter and dark energy, is one of the grandest challenges in modern physics. This project aims at finding inroads to solving this outstanding problem through interpretation, design, and characterization of precision measurement experiments carried out in laboratory settings. Such experiments, while being relatively inexpensive, have a tantalizing discovery potential. Any discovery in this area would profoundly help in painting a more complete picture of Nature's inner workings. Historically, such advances eventually lead to technological advances. The project will train a young theoretical/computational physicist, contributing to the high-technology workforce development. The project will be carried out in Nevada, a state historically underrepresented in the scientific enterprise, thus contributing to diversity.  \r\n\r\nA signal of new physics may come as a small perturbation on top of a conventional Standard Model physics background; thereby an interpretation of experimental measurements requires input from theoretical calculations characterizing such backgrounds. A major part of this project deals with  high-precision calculations of atomic properties required for improved  interpretation of the violation of mirror symmetry in atoms. Together with previous experimental results, the calculations will either reveal new physics or place powerful constraints on the dark sector.  Another part of the project will estimate fundamental physics limitations on the accuracies attainable with atomic timekeeping and also improve the interpretation of searches for ultralight dark matter with precision instruments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
