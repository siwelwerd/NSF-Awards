Long proxy records of these three variables can be used to both drive and evaluate general circulation models thereby providing a testing ground for further understanding of Holocene climate dynamics.  The goal of this project is to significantly improve the evaluation of Holocene-scale paleoclimatic change in western North America.\r\n\r\nThe potential Broader Impacts include developing a dataset of new measurements and analyses of Holocene climate, participation and support of students in the project, development of new educational exhibits at the Arizona's Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research (LTRR) which sees over 10,000 individuals per year (including K-12, University students, and the public), and recruiting and working with minority students through the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans (SACNAS) via Western Washington University.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
