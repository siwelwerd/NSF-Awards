 "awd_abstract_narration": "For over a century, randomness has been a core modeling tool used to describe phenomena such as, but not limited to, the value of stock prices over time, the motion of particles subject to thermal fluctuations (e.g. pollen grains or lipids suspended in water) and the time evolution of competing populations in biology.  Additionally, randomness is a key component in many algorithms used to process and understand big data.  Crucial to analyzing such models and algorithms is understanding precisely how the randomness and nonlinear effects, i.e. the excitation, combine to relax the system to equilibrium.  The research supported by this award will seek to quantify rates of convergence to equilibrium in a number of models in statistical physics, turbulence and molecular dynamics, especially in those systems used in random sampling algorithms.  The project includes collaborations with high school, undergraduate and graduate students, the results of which will be disseminated through publications and through presentations at domestic and international conferences.  \r\n\r\nThis award supports several projects at the interface of stochastic analysis and dynamics.  The first part of this research focuses on extracting explicit rates of convergence to equilibrium for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) used in random sampling algorithms.  Of particular importance is understanding the precise nature of convergence in high dimensions in the presence of singular coefficients in the equations.  Such singularities arise naturally in the context of molecular dynamics (e.g. Lennard-Jones, Coloumb potential functions) as they are used to describe repulsive effects as particles approach one another.  Although natural from a modeling and statistical standpoint, the singularities lead to challenges in both analyzing the dynamics itself as well as in analyzing the corresponding numerical simulation due to energy spikes generated by the singular interactions.  The second part focuses on studying large-time properties of various statistical models in turbulence.  In each of these models, there is also a source of energy often leading to interesting effects in equilibrium such as, for example, heavy-tailed invariant measures.  Understanding how randomness, nonlinearities, dissipation as well as the excitation balance out to produce these interesting effects is of central importance.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nRandomness is ubiquitous in modern science and technology.  It is used to describe various natural phenomena, from the behavior of stock prices over time, the motion of particles subject to thermal fluctuations, the time evolution of competing populations in biology, to algorithms that process and understand big data sets.     \n\n \nOne monumental challenge, both computationally and theoretically, is the design and implementation of algorithms that draw uncorrelated samples from a prescribed probability distribution, especially in high dimensional settings.  The current state of the art approach uses random dynamics whose large-time behavior has the desired statistics.  Samples are then generated by running the system ``long enough\".  However, understanding what ``long enough\" means in this context remains a big open problem.  This grant made progress on this problem by studying the behavior of convergence rates to equilibrium in popular models, such as first and second-order Langevin dynamics, whose discretization are used in this vein.  Particular emphasis in this grant was on the behavior of the convergence rate as it depends on key parameters in the system, e.g. the spatial dimension parameter or the friction parameter.  \n\n\nAnother big challenge is understanding models that describe various aspects of turbulence.  This is because the equations modeling this phenomena are teetering on the verge of instability.  In this grant, the PI studied various models of turbulence and their random perturbations, especially those that describe turbulent transport of small heavy particles and so-called Rayleigh-Benard convection.  The outcome produced from this was a better understanding of how the nonlinearities in the equations and the noise interact to produce an overall stable dynamics in the perturbative regime.         \n\n \n  Broader impacts of the research conducted include collaborations across universities with faculty, postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduates. The project supported two graduate students, both through research assistantships and travel to conferences to give presentations on topics related to the grant.  The PI also ran a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program, consisting of five undergraduate students and one graduate student, on research topics related to the grant.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David Herzog"
