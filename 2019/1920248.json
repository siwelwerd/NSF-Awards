 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Instrumentation Programs. Professor Mercouri Kanatzidis from Northwestern University and colleagues Kenneth Poeppelmeier, Sossina Haile, Steven Jacobsen and Danna Freedman are acquiring a single crystal X-ray diffractometer equipped with a silver micro-source, goniometer, and an efficient detector optimized for silver-radiation.  In general, an X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here impact many areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate and graduate students in chemistry and biochemistry at this institution where students receive hands-on access to the diffractometers and collect data on their own experimental samples. The new diffractometer is also used for the biannual international Summer School co-organized with the American Crystallographic Association and Northwestern University. Collaborations are in place with other research institutions such as the University of Chicago, the Ohio State University, Illinois Institute of Technology, Loyola University Chicago, Lake Forest College and Roosevelt University.  \r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It is especially used for exploring solid state chemistry of chalcogenides and analyzing solid-state-related electrochemical processes. The diffractometer is also utilized for the analyses of synthesized compounds and minerals as well as synthesized oxides and oxide-fluorides. The instrument is employed in projects with applications in sustainable energy, geology, planetary sciences, ceramics and nanomaterials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
