 "awd_abstract_narration": "Today's global socio-environmental challenges place unprecedented demands on natural and social sciences to understand and forecast a tightly interconnected world. Yet most studies on socio-environmental interactions have focused on a single socio-environmental system. While some studies have separately examined socio-environmental interactions between adjacent or distant systems, they usually focused on one-way impacts. Although these separate studies have generated useful information, little is known about the relationships among socio-environmental interactions within and across adjacent and distant systems systematically and simultaneously. This award will fill these key knowledge gaps by addressing some of the world's biggest challenges such as land use and food security across scales and across borders. The results are expected to reveal transformational insights into global food production, trade, and labor dynamics. They can also shine light on the potential cascading consequences of land use decisions. This innovative research represents an exciting new frontier, with pioneering contributions to the theory, methods, and applications of socio-environmental systems research. It will be tightly integrated with ambitious education and outreach efforts, elevating the public's understanding of the socioeconomic and environmental effects of complex trade relationships. Students and postdoc will gain broad knowledge and learn important skills to become future visionary leaders and globally engaged scholars.\r\n\r\nThe interdisciplinary research team will apply and quantify the holistic metacoupling framework that integrates socioeconomic-environmental interactions within as well as between adjacent and distant systems. Fundamental questions include: How do intracouplings (e.g., food production within a coupled system), pericouplings (e.g., labor movement between adjacent systems), and telecouplings (e.g., trade between distant systems) complement, enhance and/or offset their effects on socio-environmental feedbacks? To address this and other questions, the project will leverage existing and new data on global trade of a major agricultural commodity -- soybeans -- and associated labor and financial flows for commodity production. Analyses at the international/national scales will be conducted with new global grid-based models and other state-of-the-art tools. They will be complemented by in-depth studies at regional/local scales in key soybean exporting and importing countries through population census and agricultural data, ecological fieldwork and face-to-face interviews to inform the development and validation of a novel metacoupled agent-based model. These studies, spanning local to international scales, will be joined via systems integration. The international researchers will understand and simulate complex dynamics and feedbacks of metacoupled systems under various scenarios co-designed with stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Thus, as human needs are increasingly being met through global supply chains, many challenges are becoming more difficult to address. For instance, while the production of agricultural commodities for global markets is increasingly connecting consumers and producers around the world, it is also inducing a significant transformation from natural to human-dominated land cover types worldwide. This transformation has multiple socioeconomic and environmental consequences and poses unprecedented challenges, although also opportunities, for global sustainability. To comprehensively evaluate these consequences, challenges, and opportunities, it is crucial to use integrated frameworks that consider multiple flows among regions/countries. In this project, we used the framework of metacoupling (human-nature interactions within as well as across adjacent and distant systems) to illustrate the effects of the global soybean trade. Because soybeans are both an important human food (e.g., protein and edible oil) and a source of animal protein (soybean meal), their production and trade provide an excellent lens to study the complex dynamics and the socio-economic and environmental outcomes of global interconnections. Specifically, this project analyzed the socio-economic and environmental outcomes of the soybean trade between the largest producer (Brazil) and consumer (China) of soybeans in the world. Analyses were performed at different spatial scales. At international/national scales, the project developed flexible and open-source gridded economic models to assess the production and trade of soybeans and their associated socio-economic and environmental impacts. Using these models, the project assessed several issues, including the impacts of a large water transfer project in China for irrigation agriculture and of infrastructure development (including transportation networks for soybean transports) in Brazil. At regional/local scales, the project developed empirical models to analyze the impacts of the soybean trade on decision-making processes at the scale of farmsteads.

These models also allowed developing scenarios of land allocation for balancing agricultural production, climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation, which advanced our understanding of the nexus between production, trade and environmental sustainability at different scales. These results demonstrated the importance of including not only global processes (international trade, international/national governance) but also local decision-making processes in the design of policies for both agricultural intensification and environmental conservation.
