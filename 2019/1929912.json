 "awd_abstract_narration": "Water quality is central to every human activity, yet, water quality is being increasingly threatened by environmental forces and disasters such as hurricanes, floods, droughts, and most recently, by the wild fires of California. These firestorms have resulted in the potential release of massive amounts of toxic metals and compounds into groundwater supplies. Successful remediation and safe human relocation require large environmental monitoring efforts to test water supply safety. However, these efforts are hampered by state-of-the-art water quality assessment technologies which are costly, centralized, slow and laborious. Therefore, there is a critical need for rapid, cost-effective and field-deployable water quality monitoring technologies. Towards addressing this need, the PI's laboratory recently developed a rapid, low-cost synthetic biology platform named RIViTS, that detects a range of toxic compounds in water samples. This project transitions RIViTS from the laboratory to the field by performing field use studies for the detection of toxic metals in water samples from Paradise, California. These samples are taken from the remains in the aftermath of the firestorm of November 2018. Field water samples at known contamination zones are tested with RIViTS and collected for independent validation using gold-standard environmental water analysis. Comparison of field and lab validation data is used to develop statistical measures of RIViTS performance, uncover factors affecting field performance and to study how RIViTS performance is dependent on metal ion complexation. As part of the project, RIViTS kits are distributed to undergraduate students at California State University Chico, to test the ability of non-experts to operate the platform.\r\n\r\nThe PI has recently developed a rapid, low-cost synthetic biology platform using regulated in vitro transcriptional sensors (RIViTS) that detect a range of toxic metals in aqueous samples. In this project RIViTS is field tested and assessed for non-expert usage. Field testing occurs at known contamination locations for the presence of lead, copper, zinc, cadmium and mercury. Water and soil leachate samples are collected and stored for independent validation. The project employs state-of-the-art analytical methods to determine metal concentration in collected aqueous samples, to validate RIViTS field tests. Metal speciation is measured to determine which species is detected by RIViTS. Kits developed for the RIViTS method are distributed to undergraduate students at California State University Chico, for monitoring metal ions after rainfall. The kits include RIViTS reaction tubes, handheld illuminators and a graphical field guide. This project is the first field testing and validation for a new technology that is a direct application of synthetic biology to environmental monitoring.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Yet, water quality is being increasingly threatened by anthropogenic activities that directly or indirectly cause the release of toxic metals and compounds into aquatic systems that are often used for water supplies. Successful remediation and human health require large environmental monitoring efforts to test water supply safety. However, these efforts are hampered by the current state-of-the-art water quality assessment technologies which are dependent on laboratory-based instruments. As such, there is a critical need for rapid, cost effective and field-deployable water quality monitoring technologies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Towards addressing this need, we investigated how a new low-cost, easy-to-use synthetic biology diagnostic platform could be used to detect the presence of metals in the field. Called ROSALIND, for RNA Output Sensors Activated by Ligand INDuction, this platform utilizes molecular machinery found in natural organisms to detect metals and then produce a glowing green-fluorescent output. Microorganisms such as bacteria found in soils have evolved detection systems for the same metals that are known to be toxic to humans - e.g., lead, chromium, cobalt and copper - when they reach specific concentrations. Using approaches from synthetic biology, we developed methods to extract the molecular detection machines and genetically rewire them so that they work in test tubes completely free of living bacteria. These so called 'cell-free synthetic biology' reactions can then be freeze dried in test tubes (using the same process as making Astronaut Ice Cream) which allows them to be stored on the shelf or easily transported to where they are needed. In the field, a user simply adds a drop of water to the tube to test the water for the presence of metals. Using a 3D printed hand-held illuminator a user can then directly see if there is contamination - the presence of a glowing green in the tube indicates high levels of these metals.</p>\n<p>This project focused on transitioning the ROSALIND platform from the laboratory to field testing in response to the devastating Camp Fire in Paradise CA of November 8, 2018. The Camp Fire presented an especially concerning source for water contamination since the burning of residences, industrial structures, and automobiles released toxic metals and compounds into the environment, including surface waters. We traveled to Paradise, CA in June 2019 and used ROSALIND tests to monitor for the presence of lead and zinc in surface waters and the municipal water supply which had been shut down because of the fire. Initial field testing revealed a need for optimizing the packaging of the ROSALIND tests. Once optimized, we returned to Paradise in the Fall of 2019 and successfully validated that ROSALIND could detect elevated levels of copper and zinc in the municipal water supply.</p>\n<p>In addition to the successful scientific outcomes of this project, this work contributed to a number of other important areas in both education and outreach. For education, a critical component was the inclusion of undergraduate students from underrepresented populations, as well as the development of new undergraduate and graduate course curricula that integrated this research in teaching new approaches for environmental monitoring and new principles of synthetic biology.
