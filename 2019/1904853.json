 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Abstract:\r\nWith support from the Biomaterials Program in the Division of Materials Research, Professors Reineke and Frontiera are developing a series of new polymeric materials that bind, compact, and transport nucleic acids and gene editing systems into living cells. The development of new delivery vehicles is crucial to reducing the cost and toxicity of gene editing therapies. The goal of gene editing is to modulate the expression of gene products to treat diseases by delivering therapeutic nucleic acids and/or ribonucleoprotein complexes. Traditionally, gene editing systems, have been delivered by modified viruses, which are extremely expensive and can lead to detrimental immune responses. Polymeric vehicles are promising candidate systems for delivery as they bind nucleic acids and proteins into compact nanoscale vehicles, while simultaneously reducing side effects from traditionally used viral vehicles. Here, the PIs propose using a tunable series of polymers containing quinine, a natural product long used to treat malaria, to promote delivery and unpackaging of gene therapy components in living cells. The PIs will synthesize and characterize a family of polymers rationally designed for efficient gene editing construct delivery, and comprehensively characterize their structure and packaging efficiency. These polymers will be screened for genome editing efficiency and lack of toxicity. The most promising candidate formulations will be examined with advanced spectroscopies in order to determine the mechanism of cellular delivery. Additionally, the PIs will establish an interactive mentoring and learning environment by attracting students to the McNair Scholars program and hosting them for summer research and mentoring experiences.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract:\r\nDevelopment of new materials that bind, compact, and transport nucleic acids and gene editing systems into living cells in a manner that is efficient, nontoxic, and does not interfere with normal cell function is essential for the success of many facets of medical research. Polymeric nucleic acid vehicles show great promise in circumventing the problems associated with viral vectors (immunogenicity, difficulty in scalability, and high cost) because their structures can be modified synthetically to endow them with properties for nontoxic and highly efficient transport. The objective of this project is to develop a novel family of seven delivery vehicle \"beacons\" containing quinine that form complexes with nucleic acids and Cas9 protein, are low in toxicity, and can be readily tracked for payload packaging and intracellular trafficking. The project will entail synthesis of a family of tunable quinine-containing polymers, with quantitative characterization by comprehensive optical and vibrational spectroscopies. This suite of polymers will be assessed for cell viability and genome editing efficiency, with statistical identification of the most promising formulations. These systems will be examined in detail, with discovery of the mechanisms of intracellular delivery, kinetics of unpackaging, and editing payload location. The exploration of new delivery systems with unique properties to facilitate multicomponent complex formation, spectroscopic probing of payload packaging, cellular delivery, and imaging could offer transformative potential to the field of non-viral based gene editing system development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The primary challenge associated with nucleic acid therapies is the delivery of genetic material inside of cells, as naked genetic material is susceptible to degradation and is repulsed by the negatively charged cell membrane. Both engineered viral vectors and lipid formulations have been used as delivery vehicles to overcome these challenges; however, the former is extremely costly and can spur immune responses, while the latter is plagued by instability at ambient temperatures. An alternative delivery vehicle for nucleic acids comes in the form of cationic (positively charged) polymers, which have the advantages of a large synthetic design space, lower costs, and improved stability. However, cationic polymers often succumb to lower gene delivery efficiency and increased cytotoxicity, which is what our work broadly seeks to address.</p>\n<p>Throughout the course of the award, this project explored the use of quinine in polymers for gene delivery applications. Quinine is an attractive monomer for study as it is a natural product with a history of medical use as an antimalarial drug. We also found that quinine is able to bind to DNA via two kinds of molecular interactions: (1) electrostatic interactions from the positive charge on the quinuclidine amine, at physiological pH, binding to the negatively charged phosphate backbone of DNA, and (2) intercalation of the quinoline ring of quinine into the base pairs of DNA via noncovalent orbital interactions between aromatic rings, called pi-pi stacking. This allows for strong binding to DNA while keeping the charge density on the polymers low, which is suggested to reduce the toxicity of polymers.</p>\n<p>Our key findings from this project began with the creation of a highly efficient gene delivery system made from a copolymer of quinine and 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA) (Figure 1). Not only did this polymer successfully deliver genetic material to several cell types, but we were also able to use the Raman signal of the quinine in the polymers to track its fate inside of the cells. We elucidated that the polymer-DNA complexes, or polyplexes, were unpackaged inside of the cells in a protein-dependent manner. This insight was critical in understanding the remarkable efficiency of this system. Following this, we began to study structure-activity relationships within quinine-based polymers. We utilized a library of structurally similar molecules to quinine called cinchona alkaloids to probe these relationships (Figure 2). The polymer system was found to be especially sensitive to polymer chain length, with longer chains demonstrating drastically improved gene delivery efficiency. Additionally, cinchona alkaloids with a methoxy substitution on the quinoline ring, such as quinine, were able to bind and deliver DNA more effectively than those without. Lastly, the stereochemistry of the alkaloids played a smaller, but still pronounced role in successful gene delivery. Again, Raman spectroscopy was used to uncover key DNA-binding differences among the cinchona alkaloids.</p>\n<p>Finally, our work led us to create a derivative of quinine that was amenable to living polymerization techniques (Figure 3). This derivative of quinine, termed HQ, gave us the ability to synthesize polymers with much higher incorporations of quinine into the polymer chains. While uncontrolled, free radical polymerization of quinine and HEA achieved a maximum of 14% quinine incorporation, the use of HQ allowed quinine incorporation up to 100%. It was found that the 25% and 35% incorporations of HQ in the copolymers gave the best performance with more sustained effects than current commercially available gene delivery agents. This development of HQ also gave access to diblock copolymers, which can be used to form micellar architectures for gene delivery. Both self-assembled micelles and polyion complex micelles have been developed and show promise for overcoming some of the pitfalls associated with simple linear polymers, such as colloidal instability and entrapment in the endosomal compartment of the cells.</p>\n<p>Beyond the results produced in the laboratory, this award has benefitted several students by offering them the ability to work on a highly interdisciplinary project and gain the skills needed for the next steps in their scientific careers. Students and post-doctoral fellows on this project have gone on to secure industry positions at Element Materials Technology and PPG Industries as well as faculty positions at the University of Delaware and the University of Vermont.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/29/2023<br>\nModified by: Theresa&nbsp;M&nbsp;Reineke</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1904853/1904853_10628719_1701286016865_Slide1--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1904853/1904853_10628719_1701286016865_Slide1--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Figure 1.
