 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for participation in the \"Workshop in Analysis and Probability\" to be held on the campus of Texas A&M University during the period June 15 to August 15, 2019, and during similar periods in the summers of 2020 and 2021. The Workshop brings together senior and junior researchers and advanced graduate students in analysis, probability, and related fields of mathematics in order to broaden participation and to promote interaction among researchers working in different areas. It sponsors Concentration Weeks and a yearly three-day conference entitled Summer Informal Regional Functional Analysis Seminar (SUMIRFAS).\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2019, the three-day conference will be held July 26 to 28 and the Concentration Week \"Randomness and Determinism in Compressive Data Acquisition\" will take place July 22 to 26. In addition to advanced lectures for experts, Concentration Weeks include introductory lectures designed to acquaint junior researchers and non-experts with the basics of a topical area of current interest. The Workshop will provide support to many researchers not on sponsored research grants who will benefit from contact with established leaders in the field and from being in a research-friendly environment. Emphasis is placed on the support of early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, and graduate students. More information about the Workshop can be found at <http://www.math.tamu.edu/~kerr/workshop>.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
