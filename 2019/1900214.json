 "awd_abstract_narration": "Catalysts that use the energy from light to cause chemical reactions are key to many important processes, including the synthesis of novel molecules, the splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen gas, and photosynthesis. Studying these catalysts is important because a better understanding of how they work can lead to more efficiency in current applications as well as to new catalysts and new processes. In this project, Dr. Goldsmith of Bryn Mawr College is developing an analytical method to measure how efficiently catalysts use the light energy they capture. This new method is being used to study known catalytic systems to learn how they can be modified and improved. Dr. Goldsmith is also making polymers (plastics) that contain these catalysts to construct systems that better capture the energy from light. This new analytical technique gives insight into the functioning of these systems. The deeper understanding of the factors that govern light harvesting efficiencies obtained from this research provides avenues for the further catalyst development and improvement. As a faculty member at a women's college, Dr. Goldsmith is deeply committed to increasing access to and persistence in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) for women and underrepresented minorities. This research project is influencing Dr. Goldsmith's teaching in the classroom.  The research project sparks students' interest in topics such as catalysis and renewable energy - large industries in today's society. Involving Bryn Mawr College's diverse student population directly in this research provides opportunities for women and minorities to engage in cutting-edge interdisciplinary research and fosters their participation in STEM. \r\n\r\nDr. Goldsmith and his research group at Bryn Mawr College are developing an analytical technique, photoinduced chronoamperometry (PICA), that couples photoexcitation with chronoamperometry to yield a direct measurement of the efficiency of photoinduced electron transfer processes. A series of iridium based photo-redox catalysts, including ones that can mediate the reduction of water to hydrogen and others that are used as single-electron-transfer catalysts in organic synthesis are being investigated with PICA. These results give insight into the structure-function relationships that govern the performance of such catalysts, guiding their rational optimization. Using electropolymerization, thin-layer light harvesting architectures containing these catalysts are being constructed. The ability of such structures to effect the photoreduction of water to hydrogen is interrogated with PICA in order to gain a better understanding of how to design an optimally efficient thin-film-based water reduction system that harnesses the energy from visible light. Dr. Goldsmith teaches chemistry courses at all levels of the curriculum and the research provides real-world examples that can be used to spark students' interest in STEM. Dr. Goldsmith's research group is composed of Bryn Mawr College's diverse female students.  The research topic encourages the students in interdisciplinary research in inorganic photochemistry and facilitates their increased engagement in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
