 "awd_abstract_narration": "Innovative research on the complex interaction of socio-economic and global environmental trends on biodiversity and ecosystem services is needed to help develop more informative scenarios for addressing environmental and human development challenges. To overcome these challenges coupled natural-human systems approaches and analyses are needed. These provide improved scenarios of biodiversity and ecosystem services that couple the outputs of direct and indirect drivers such as land use, invasive species, overexploitation, biodiversity, environmental change, and pollution. The resulting models provide a methodological state-of-the art that results in more accurate quantitative assessments, better land use, and more effective ecosystem services. Employing this methodology, this research project, which is an international coalition between US scientists and five European nations, seeks to quantify the magnitude, spatial extent and timing of aerial migrations (birds and insects), and their functional relations to environmental and socio-economic variables. Migratory bird and insect populations involve thousands of tons of animal biomass that move through the air within and across continents at various times of the year. Migratory flying animals play significant roles in shaping ecosystems through a variety of transport and trophic effects that also represent services and disservices to human infrastructure, agriculture, and welfare. This project reveals the role these organisms have in shaping the diversity of ecological communities, as well as providing information to allow the better utilization of their related ecosystems services and reducing their negative impacts. This requires the tracking and quantification of these species and their movements across continents, i.e. over large spatial and temporal scales. This study investigates past changes in important drivers of change such as climate; the expansion of urban areas; deployment of energy infrastructure, like wind farms; and changes in land use/agriculture. Data and results will be modeled to develop projections for future changes under environmental and human-induces scenarios. Current and archived radar data of biomasses of aerial migrants will be used. Drivers resulting in changes in patterns of migrations and local ecosystem function will be used to develop behavior-based models for generating predictions under future changes. The broader impacts of this work include international collaboration with scientists from five other countries (UK, Belgium, The Netherlands, Finland, and Switzerland), the generation of data to improve policy and resource management decisions, and information to help reduce airplane damage from bird strikes. Other impacts include training a postdoctoral scholar in interdisciplinary, international, team-oriented, collaborative research and the creation of new software that allows others to process data on aerial migrations in terms of variables such as weather, climate, land use, wind, and light.\r\n\r\nThis award supports US researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a coalition of 26 funding agencies from 23 countries through the Belmont Forum call for proposals on \"Scenarios of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services\". The call was a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that contribute to the development of scenarios, models, and decision-support tools for understanding and solving critical issues facing our planet. The goal of the competition was to improve and apply participatory scenario methods to enhance research relevance and its acceptance and to address gaps in methods for modelling impact drivers and policy interventions. It was also to develop and communicate levels of uncertainty associated with the models, to improve data accessibility and fill gaps in knowledge. Using this methodology, this major international effort between the US and five European countries will addresses challenging and pressing biodiversity issues related to aerial migratory species (birds and insects) across scales from local to continental. For the project, each country will fund its own scientists and their part of the overall project. The interdisciplinary team consists of ecologists, meteorologists, and computer scientists who will use the existing infrastructure of continental weather (and other) radars to generate a standardized large-scale, long-term monitoring of migratory aerial biomass flows, as well as develop sustainable data and analytical infrastructure and workflows that that can be used by other present and future stakeholders. Motivation for this study comes from the fact that aerial migratory animals are an integral component of biodiversity and have been declining at an alarming rate. Identifying their response to climatic and land-use changes, light pollution and wind energy development is fundamental for efficient conservation and mitigation of human-wildlife conflicts. Thus, this research links various stakeholders from scientists to meteorologists to conservation practitioners and policy makers and to the wind energy sector and aviation safety. Goas are to develop (a) standard long-term and large-scale monitoring of aerial migrations; (b) information to feed policies associated with the proliferation of artificial light; (c) establish aerial migratory species death-mitigation procedures for wind energy installations and aircraft; and (d) policies for conservation of crucial (aerial) habitat, migratory locations, and major migration time-periods that are essential for sustaining migratory populations. Research will entail quantifying the magnitude, spatial extent, and timing of aerial migrations; understanding their (functional) relations with environmental and socio-economic variables; and projecting the consequences of future changes in these variables on migratory populations. This will be achieved by retrieving biological information from weather radar networks using methods that rely on machine learning and statistical analyses to quantify biomass flows of aerial migrants in Europe and North America. It will also estimate the role of migrants in ecosystem functioning and how aerial migratory biomass flows is impacted by external human induced variables.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our interdisciplinary team of ecologists, meteorologists, computer scientists, comprising core members from five countries, Belgium, Finland, Netherlands, Switzerland, and United States, used the existing infrastructure of continental weather surveillance radars, to develop datasets, pipelines, and peer-reviewed publications to support standardized large-scale, long-term monitoring of aerial biomass flows as well as develop sustainable data infrastructure that various present and future stakeholders can use. Our research addressed challenging and pressing biodiversity issues, studying migratory animal?s patterns of movements and their responses to climatic and land-use changes, light pollution, and wind energy development. We have provided with this project a strong foundation to assist in developing a) standard long-term and large-scale monitoring of aerial migrations; b) policies regarding artificial light; c) forecast models to support mitigation procedures for wind energy installations; and d) policies for conservation of crucial (aerial) habitat, core locations and time-periods that are essential for sustaining migratory populations.

During our research efforts under NSF ICER-1927743, we published numerous scientific papers and more broadly accomplished the following: \n\n-       We retrieved biological information from weather surveillance radar networks using methods we have previously initiated and continued to develop that rely on machine learning and statistical analyses, quantified biomass flows of aerial migrants, and described how these biomass flows are related to external variables, particularly weather and climate, land use, and artificial light.\n\n-       We initiated assessments of consequences of changes in population dynamics of aerial migrants, developed and pursued specific activities for dissemination of the project?s outputs, knowledge transfer and involvement of stakeholders/policy-makers, and continued our research to quantify biomass flows of aerial migrants, particularly birds, and created a unique tool to access these data on a nightly basis at scales from the county and state levels to the continental level. \n\n-       We quantified bird migration (traffic rate, direction, speed, altitude) from radar and investigated important drivers of changes to migration patterns of birds, such as climatological variables, expansions of built environments and human activities, and in relation to aerial-terrestrial ecosystem interconnectivity. \n\nNumerous citations of GloBAM research now appear in peer-reviewed articles, including general science, ecology, machine learning, global change, meteorology, and ornithology. Results include analysis of ecological patterns, machine learning methodologies, visualization, statistical methodologies and computational transformations, policy, applications and engagement, and community science. GloBAM provided direct opportunities for research, education, outreach, and teaching; improved the performance, skills, or attitudes of high school, undergraduate, doctoral, and professional communities that improved their use and access to or retention in research, teaching, or other related professions; and provided exposure to science and technology across a broad array of academic and community scientists, municipalities, developers and statisticians, ornithologists, business and industry entities, and members of the public that have contacted project leaders for collaboration in arts, science projects, and media projects.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/06/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew Farnsworth"
