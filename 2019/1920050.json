 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Description:\r\nA traditional optical microscopy, even with the best possible spatial resolution that can be achieved, is not sufficient to study very small structures, such as the ones often found in nature, nanotechnology and small-scale engineering. In this project, an advanced scanning probe microscopy system allows scientists and engineers to overcome this limitation. Light is reflected off a nanoscale tip of the microscope to explore fine structures and discern composition of complex materials. The ability to span multiple length scales, from bulk to a scale approaching that of molecules, offers new understanding of the heterogeneities contributing to properties in complex natural and engineered systems. The project significantly enhances research and education capabilities across the boundaries of STEM (Science Technology Engineering Math) disciplines, while providing new opportunities in graduate and undergraduate research training and education. These activities serve a diverse population at the University of Central Florida (UCF), a Hispanic Serving Institution, and the Southern US. \r\n\r\nTechnical Description:\r\nThe project involves the acquisition of an integrated confocal, tip-enhanced Raman system (TERS) and tip-enhanced photoluminescence (TEPL) microscope at UCF. The platform implements the principle of tip-enhanced near-field optics on an atomic force microscope to surpass the diffraction limit of conventional Raman confocal microscopy. The TERS configuration achieves a lateral resolution of approximately 10 nm. The microscope is equipped with several  excitation lasers, covering most of the visible wavelengths plus near infrared , to accommodate a wide range of research projects. The system enables interdisciplinary research to understand the structure-property relationships of a broad range of emerging materials including two-dimensional materials, perovskites, nanoparticles, biomaterials, pesticides, composites, soft tissues (e.g., plant cells), meteorites and asteroids for applications in electronics, optoelectronics, catalysis, biosensing, nanomedicine, nano-agriculture and planetary sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The team at the University of Central Florida has demonstrated the virtue of an instrument providing micro-to nano-scale analytical and imaging times to advance the fundamental understanding of materials and their applications.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">The combination of nanoscale imaging and Raman confocal microscopy has unveiled new exciting properties of 2D materials, including the properties of PdSe<sub>2</sub> and its behavior in a 2D-2D heterojunction with MoSe<sub>2</sub>. Using nanoscale functional measurements such as Kelvin probe microscopy, it was possible to investigate the charge transfer doping taking place in the system (published in Advanced Electronic Materials 7, 2001057 (2021)). Other unique properties of 2D materials were unveiled, notably the first demonstration of photocatalytic activity of hexagonal Boron Nitride (h-BN) engineered with defects, under visible light. This proof of concept is expected to benefit the field of catalysis with applications to clean energy production (such as hydrogen), and beyond. In the scope of this work, the formation of well-defined carbon-rich structures on the catalyst was discovered. The morphology and properties of the structures was successfully varied by controlling the illumination parameters and gaseous environment, therefore unveiling a new photo-induced method for the rapid (few seconds) growth of carbon material at room temperature and using a metal-free catalyst. The important role of defect in these new processes was unveiled. Nanoscale measurements were initiated to control defect creation in the 2D layers, in preparation for future fundamental studies to monitor the molecular events ruling the photocatalytic behavior uncovered in the h-BN powder.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">The instrument has also uncovered new information on defects in silicon solar cells. In an NSF GOALI project (Award Number 1922984), the Horiba LabRam? was used to chemically and structurally map a defect inclusion embedded inside the surface of a finished solar cell. These inclusions are leftover particles during the processing of solar cells and represent ?defects? which reduce solar cell efficiency. Traditionally, optical microscopy is used to identify such defects. However, by using the Horiba LabRam? the chemical signature of the defects was obtained as well. Further, by conducting Raman microscopy along the depth direction (i.e., confocal), 3D reconstruction of the defect was generated. Thus, the non-destructive confocal Raman technique was key to identifying the chemical and structural characteristics of the defects.
