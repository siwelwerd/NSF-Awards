Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Sarah Peluse is \" Quantitative bounds in the polynomial and multidimensional Szemeredi theorem and other topics in additive combinatorics\". The host institution for the fellowship is Oxford University and the sponsoring scientist is Ben Green.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
