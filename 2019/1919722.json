 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation Program. Professor Yong Ba from California State University Los Angeles and colleagues Jamil Momand, Edith Porter, Yixian Wang and Cecilia Zurita-Lopez are acquiring a matrix-assisted laser desorption / ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF-MS) equipped with a photodiode array. In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species in complex samples. MALDI TOF combines gentle ionization (ideal for producing intact ions of peptides, proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, synthetic polymers, and other similarly sized species) with a detection mode that offers an excellent balance between sensitivity and accuracy across a wide range of samples. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the university and within the regional. The instrument broadens participation by giving hands-on access to a diverse student population. The instrument is also used in outreach activities.\r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts studies correlating molecular structure, orientation and dynamics.   Researchers use the MALDI-TOF-MS to study interactions of a mucoadhesive co-polymer colloidal gel systems and in identifying in vivo substrates and binding partners for the protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) in mammalian cells. The mass spectrometer is used for studying cell disruption mechanisms that may be operational in Parkinson's disease and for studying antifreeze proteins. The instrument also serves researchers identifying proteins associated with t-Darpp AKT activation proteins, in which t-Darpp is a truncated isoform of dopamine-regulated phosphoprotein having an elongated monomer that binds calcium and is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent enzyme kinases. Finally, the instrument is used by researchers investigating antimicrobial peptides.  Overall, the instrument acquisition may benefit the National health and welfare as well as supporting education and diversity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
