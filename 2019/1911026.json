 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in their efforts to significantly increase the numbers of students matriculating into and successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines to diversify the STEM workforce.  Particular emphasis is placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences in support of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.  These strategies facilitate the production of well-prepared students highly-qualified and motivated to pursue graduate education or careers in STEM.\r\n\r\nFor the United States (U.S.) to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy.  The Pacific Northwest LSAMP (PNWLSAMP) program was established in 2009 in response to the need for a more diverse and skilled technical workforce.  That need still exists and is particularly acute in the State of Washington.  The ten public institutions that make up the Alliance are diverse and include five four-year institutions and five partnering community colleges.  The institutions are Boise State University, Oregon State University, Portland State University, the University of Washington, Washington State University, the College of Western Idaho, Linn-Benton Community College, Seattle Central Community College, Yakima Valley Community College, and Portland Community College.  The goal of the Alliance is to increase the number of underrepresented minority (URM) graduates with STEM degrees by 50% over the next five years.  This goal will be accomplished by continuing successful programming from previous years while expanding its focus on leadership and mentorship.  This new program will include professional development, opportunities to participate in program operations, serve as mentors, and have access to faculty mentorship.  This focus will support LSAMP students in developing their scientist identity and self-efficacy through engagement in the culture of science and discussion of the role of race and social stigma in scientific training.  PNWLSAMP will also increase the number of URM students from Alliance institutions pursuing graduate education by 5-10% through integrated research experiences and graduate school preparation and advisement.  These goals support the National Science Foundation's strategic goal to \"cultivate a world-class, broadly inclusive science and engineering workforce, and expand the scientific literacy of all citizens.\"\r\n\r\nThe educational research study will take an assets-based and intersectional approach, examining factors that contribute to persistence in STEM for students from URM groups.  The research project will include a large multi-year study and four smaller \"sprint studies\" conducted by researchers across the Alliance.  The large study will examine how STEM students from URM groups navigate within historically exclusionary social institutional structures.  It will also include a participatory action element that engages students and administrators to develop strategies for improving equity on their campuses.  The sprint studies will each take place on one PNWLSAMP campus and focus on different dimensions of belonging in STEM for students from URM groups.  An external evaluation team will implement both quantitative and qualitative instruments to assess the overall quality of the programs on the individual campuses as well as the entire alliance related to the overall goals of the project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Continue to increase the number of highly competitive URM bachelor&rsquo;s degree recipients in STEM, including those who have transferred from a 2-year institution<br />2. Increase the number of URM students who pursue graduate studies in STEM<br />3. Conduct and disseminate the results of a multi-year mixed methods study and 4 one-year sprint studies to address the national need for new scholarly research on broadening participation of URMs in STEM disciplines and the STEM workforce.<br />Challenges with third cycle of Funding:<br />March 15, 2019, to February 2024. The award was scheduled for release September 2019; however, due to a threat in the Federal Government shutdown funds were released March 2019. Funds were inaccessible until September 2019 to avoid an overlap of expenditures. PNW LSAMP closed out the NSF Phase Two award in August of 2019. Because our first-year funds were not accessible until September 2019, we had four months to spend funds. <br />A no-cost extension was submitted extending our end date to February 2025 and the remaining funds to be released in March 2024. This judgment impacted us as it shifted the deadline by one year for our eligibility to apply for our 4th cycle of funding. It happened right before COVID-19, shifting all activities online. This shift left PNW LSAMP challenged since all in-person events were canceled due to COVID-19. Building an online community did not offer the same connection, and students were often a &ldquo;no show&rdquo; for online activities. We developed and implemented a plan to rescind the adjusted end date from March 2025 to our originally requested end date of August 2024. <br />NSF froze the portal for submitting our WebAMP reports for two consecutive years (2020 &amp; 2021). The portal re-opened in 2024.<br />Enrollment and degree data reported through WebAMP reveal that PNW LSAMP continued to increase the number of URM students enrolled in STEM disciplines and the number of bachelor&rsquo;s degrees granted to URM students in Phase 3. PNW LSAMP also increased the proportion of URM STEM transfer degrees. However, the Alliance has seen a decrease in 2-year transfers as a percentage of URM STEM enrollments.</p>\r\n<p>Alliance-wide, the total number of URM students enrolled in STEM disciplines increased by 13.6% between the 2020-21 and 2022-23 school years. The largest increase in URM STEM Enrollments was at UW. URM STEM enrollments also increased at OSU, BSU, PSU, and WSU.</p>\r\n<p>Alliance-wide, the number of bachelor&rsquo;s degrees granted to URM STEM students increased by 3.2% between the 2020-21 and 2022-23 school years. The largest increase in URM STEM bachelor&rsquo;s degrees was at UW. URM STEM bachelor&rsquo;s degrees also increased at BSU, but decreased at PSU and WSU. It stayed consistent at OSU. <br />PNW LSAMP universities enrolled 168 more URM transfer students in STEM fields in 2022-23 than 2020-21. However, in 2022-23, two-year transfers comprised 27.1% of URM STEM enrollments, down 1.04 percentage points from 2020-21.<br />The proportion of URM STEM transfer enrollments decreased at all PNW LSAMP institutions except BSU and PSU (up 4.4 and 7.3 percentage points, respectively). OSU URM STEM transfer enrollments decreased by 2.6 percentage points, UW decreased by 2.6 percentage points, and WSU decreased by 4.7 percentage points.<br />PNW LSAMP universities granted 13 less STEM bachelor&rsquo;s degrees to URM transfer students in 2022-23 than in 2020-21. The percentage of URM STEM degrees granted to 2-year transfers in 2022-23 was 29.9% (-1.9 percentage points 2020-21).<br />The proportion of URM STEM degrees granted to transfer students decreased at all schools except for BSU and WSU. BSU URM STEM transfer degrees increased by 31.7 percentage points and WSU increased by 1.8 percentage points.</p>\r\n<p>Executive Overview of Sight Visit Report 2021<br />PNW LSAMP conducted five online site visits in 2021 due to COVID-19, assessing institutional success and challenges. Objectives included evaluating program progress, gathering data for future funding cycles, and aligning PNW LSAMP with institutional goals. LSAMP programs across the Alliance have varied levels of institutionalization. Some are under well-established programs, enhancing visibility and support. Recommendations focus on marketing LSAMP, securing institutional support, and defining program components aligning with institutional values. LSAMP engages students in research, mentorship, and leadership experiences. Recommendations include promoting paid opportunities, faculty support, mentor training, and creating networking opportunities for students. Marketing LSAMP benefits both institutions and students. Challenges include funding, staffing, and time limitations. Recommendations emphasize early student engagement and program visibility. Strengthening Connection with Community Colleges: Challenges faced by Community Colleges during COVID-19 impact LSAMP goals. Recommendations focus on collaboration, resource sharing, and professional development for Community College Directors. PNW LSAMP serves as a supportive community for staff and students. Suggestions include sharing successes, addressing challenges, attending conferences, and hosting joint programs.<br />Conclusion:<br />PNW LSAMP aims to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM through institutional collaboration, student support, and program development.<br />By focusing on these key points, stakeholders can better understand the achievements, challenges, and recommendations outlined.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/27/2024<br>\nModified by: Tricia&nbsp;Serio</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div

Building an online community did not offer the same connection, and students were often a no show for online activities. We developed and implemented a plan to rescind the adjusted end date from March 2025 to our originally requested end date of August 2024. \nNSF froze the portal for submitting our WebAMP reports for two consecutive years (2020 & 2021). The portal re-opened in 2024.\nEnrollment and degree data reported through WebAMP reveal that PNW LSAMP continued to increase the number of URM students enrolled in STEM disciplines and the number of bachelors degrees granted to URM students in Phase 3. PNW LSAMP also increased the proportion of URM STEM transfer degrees. However, the Alliance has seen a decrease in 2-year transfers as a percentage of URM STEM enrollments.\r\n\n\nAlliance-wide, the total number of URM students enrolled in STEM disciplines increased by 13.6% between the 2020-21 and 2022-23 school years. The largest increase in URM STEM Enrollments was at UW. URM STEM enrollments also increased at OSU, BSU, PSU, and WSU.\r\n\n\nAlliance-wide, the number of bachelors degrees granted to URM STEM students increased by 3.2% between the 2020-21 and 2022-23 school years. The largest increase in URM STEM bachelors degrees was at UW. URM STEM bachelors degrees also increased at BSU, but decreased at PSU and WSU. It stayed consistent at OSU. \nPNW LSAMP universities enrolled 168 more URM transfer students in STEM fields in 2022-23 than 2020-21. However, in 2022-23, two-year transfers comprised 27.1% of URM STEM enrollments, down 1.04 percentage points from 2020-21.\nThe proportion of URM STEM transfer enrollments decreased at all PNW LSAMP institutions except BSU and PSU (up 4.4 and 7.3 percentage points, respectively). OSU URM STEM transfer enrollments decreased by 2.6 percentage points, UW decreased by 2.6 percentage points, and WSU decreased by 4.7 percentage points.\nPNW LSAMP universities granted 13 less STEM bachelors degrees to URM transfer students in 2022-23 than in 2020-21. The percentage of URM STEM degrees granted to 2-year transfers in 2022-23 was 29.9% (-1.9 percentage points 2020-21).\nThe proportion of URM STEM degrees granted to transfer students decreased at all schools except for BSU and WSU. BSU URM STEM transfer degrees increased by 31.7 percentage points and WSU increased by 1.8 percentage points.\r\n\n\nExecutive Overview of Sight Visit Report 2021\nPNW LSAMP conducted five online site visits in 2021 due to COVID-19, assessing institutional success and challenges. Objectives included evaluating program progress, gathering data for future funding cycles, and aligning PNW LSAMP with institutional goals. LSAMP programs across the Alliance have varied levels of institutionalization. Some are under well-established programs, enhancing visibility and support. Recommendations focus on marketing LSAMP, securing institutional support, and defining program components aligning with institutional values. LSAMP engages students in research, mentorship, and leadership experiences. Recommendations include promoting paid opportunities, faculty support, mentor training, and creating networking opportunities for students. Marketing LSAMP benefits both institutions and students. Challenges include funding, staffing, and time limitations. Recommendations emphasize early student engagement and program visibility. Strengthening Connection with Community Colleges: Challenges faced by Community Colleges during COVID-19 impact LSAMP goals. Recommendations focus on collaboration, resource sharing, and professional development for Community College Directors. PNW LSAMP serves as a supportive community for staff and students. Suggestions include sharing successes, addressing challenges, attending conferences, and hosting joint programs.\nConclusion:\nPNW LSAMP aims to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM through institutional collaboration, student support, and program development.\nBy focusing on these key points, stakeholders can better understand the achievements, challenges, and recommendations outlined.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/27/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: TriciaSerio\n"
