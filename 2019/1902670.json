 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award provides participant support for the next three Georgia Topology Conference. The 2019 edition will be held in Athens, GA from May 22-26, 2019.  The focus of the conference is three dimensional geometric topology.  The spaces that arise are, locally, the same as the space we live in, and can be studied by analyzing the one and two dimensional structures that live within them.  The conference website is https://research.franklin.uga.edu/topology/2019-georgia-topology-conference.\r\n\r\nThe 2019 conference will be focused on 3-dimensional topology, and in particular, codimension-1 foliations. Speakers at the conference will be chosen to emphasize the richness of this topic as indicated by its connections to Heegaard Floer homology, contact topology, Heegaard splittings, group orderability, and Dehn surgery.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These have included large international conferences every eight years, but most years, including those covered by this award, the conference is a smaller event focusing on a specific area related to geometric topology, and is structured to both disseminate exciting new results and give junior researchers opportunities to share their work and interact with leaders in the field.\n\n\nThis award provided support for four installments of the Georgia Topology Conference. The 2019 conference focused on codimension-one foliations of three-dimensional manifolds. After a planned conference in 2020 had to be cancelled due to the pandemic, the series resumed with a virtual conference in 2021 on four-dimensional manifolds. The 2022 conference was a hybrid in-person/virtual event concerning quantum knot invariants. In 2023, the conference returned to a fully in-person format, with the theme of spaces of diffeomorphisms, symplectomorphisms and contactomorphisms in dimensions three and four.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe conferences each created opportunities for mathematicians working on rapidly-developing topics to share techniques and results, and stimulated collaboration and networking. During the years when some or all participants were remote, \"virtual teas\" and other novel activities simulated some of the social aspects of an in-person conference. Speakers and participants were diverse across age and background, Starting with the 2022 conference, graduate students who were not among the main speakers had the opportunity to give \"lightning talks\" to introduce their work to a broad audience. In their choice of topics, recruitment of participants, and overall structure, each of the conferences was designed to help junior mathematicians learn about cutting-edge research and broaden their connections in the mathematical community.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/10/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MichaelUsher\n"
