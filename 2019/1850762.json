 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will use data from the NSF Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) to study the effects of the ocean bottom on how wind energy travels in the ocean interior. The OOI data will be combined with output from a general ocean circulation model to investigate how different ocean bottom shapes affect energy propagation and its dissipation. The primary OOI data set consists of temperature, salinity, and velocity data obtained from sensors mounted on moored profilers - sensor packages that travel periodically, vertically up and down oceanographic moorings. These data are available from four OOI sites. The project also will provide new, high quality calibrations and processing of these data for use by the oceanographic community. The project will leverage the OOI program to provide improved data and improve understanding of how wind forcing and oceanographic variability influence the internal exchanges of energy in the ocean.\r\n\r\nIn this project data from Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) open ocean moorings will be used along with a very high resolution global circulation model and idealized models to understand the effects of sloping bottom topography on wind generation of near-inertial energy and subsequent propagation and dissipation. The primary data set comprises temperature, salinity, and velocity data from sensors integrated in McLane Moored Profilers (MMP) located at the OOI mooring sites. The lead PI, who developed the moored profilers used on the OOI arrays, will reprocess these data using optimal techniques and make the data available for OOI and the oceanographic community. The effects of mesoscale eddy fields on propagation of near inertial wave energy will be investigated. The reprocessing of these data from long term mooring sites at various locations around the world oceans represents and unique opportunity to test and improve theories of the wind driven inertial motions and internal waves.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nWhen it was initiated in 2013/14, the Ocean Observatory Initiative program instrumented four deep-ocean sites with sensors nearly spanning the full water column that sampled the water properties and ocean currents at high temporal and vertical resolution. The two sites in the Southern Hemisphere were maintained for a 3-year period; the two in the North are continuing. This study (that focused on observations between 2015 and 2018) exploited these full-ocean-depth data to quantify the intensity and characteristics of the ocean variability on several time scales. At the so-called mesoscale or eddy time scales that range between several months to several weeks, the observed horizontal currents and vertical heave of density surfaces were qualitatively compared to theoretical predictions based on the average ocean stratification and bathymetric characteristics at each site. No universal dominant vertical structure was found between the four sites that accounted for the bulk of the observed variability, complicating efforts to extrapolate surface observations downward to characterize the motions at depth. The nature of higher frequency motions at the OOI sites was also explored, specifically variability at the local inertial period (that depends on latitude) and the twice-daily, semi-diurnal tidal period. An energetics framework was developed for the near-inertial variability in which generation by wind forcing, horizontal and vertical propagation and turbulent dissipation were all quantified. The study finds that a balance between time-averaged wind generation of near-inertial motions in the surface mixed layer and time-averaged depth-integrated dissipation rate only approximately holds at two of the four sites. Rather than a simple, local framework for the near-inertial energetics in which wind generated inertial oscillations stimulate propagating internal waves which conduct energy smoothly to dissipative scales, we find that eddies, remote generation, and bottom generation/reflection contribute substantially to the energetics at these sites. The investigation of semi-diurnal variability highlighted the importance of motions with vertical scales of just a few hundred meters with indication that these tidal-period internal waves are carrying energy up from the bottom. Both foci are contributing understanding of the roles that internal waves play in supporting vertical mixing and ultimately, the global overturning circulation. This study additionally served to springboard two female junior investigators onto their academic research careers.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/25/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JohnMToole\n"
