 "awd_abstract_narration": "The modelling of particle acceleration at shocks is expected to pave the path to improved understanding of the origin of cosmic-rays, which were discovered more than 100 years ago.  The current standard model of Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA) applies to the case of ideal, infinitely planar shock front; the process of acceleration is self-sustained if particles can contrast the flow advection and return to the shock to undergo further acceleration.  If particles cannot be confined in proximity of the shocks, then the DSA approach is not feasible.  The main focus of this one-year EAGER project is to explore a novel approach to explain the observations of energetic particles that do not fit in the DSA paradigm.  This approach will comprise both analytic and numerical analyses, which support the interpretation of spacecraft data.  The research project will produce an advanced theoretical model that may explain the measurements of shocks near the Earth, as well as observations of a variety of astrophysical sources, including pulsar wind nebulae, blazars, supernova remnants, etc.\r\n\r\nThis one-year EAGER project is aimed at transforming our present understanding of the acceleration of charged particles at interplanetary and astrophysical shock waves.  Several interplanetary shock events exhibit broken power-law spectra of the energetic particles.  Such spectra fall outside the regime of validity of the standard Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA) model and, despite observed in several cases, have been poorly studied to date.  This project builds upon a previous effort to interpret the observed electromagnetic radiation from astrophysical sources -- a log-parabola spectrum of energetic electrons, instead of empirical, multiple power-laws -- that explains surprisingly well the observations of the Crab Nebula over an unprecedentedly broad energy range.  The project team, which based at the University of Arizona, aims to determine the physical conditions that give rise to a log-parabola spectrum, which would yield a paradigm shift in the field.  The team will use the new knowledge gathered during the project to educate the general public about the physical drivers of space weather and their impacts.  The research and EPO agenda of this EAGER project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Through our work we initiated the building of a theoretical model to address the bending of the energy spectra of energetic particles at shocks that routinely deviate from the theoretical prediction of single power-law. Such a deviation is here interpreted as a result of particle escape from the shock.<br />The advancement by this model is twofold: 1) combining particle acceleration and escape as a continuous transition from former to latter rather than a discrete one; a large part of previous models have assumed that escape occurs at a specific distance from the shock, independent on the particle energy; in this model the escape happens at a time that is energy-dependent, shorter for higher energy particles. 2) Incorporating into the diffusion coefficient (see Fig. 1) both the turbulence generated by the shock in its proximity and the pre-existing turbulence far upstream from the shock (several hours in the typical 1 AU spacecraft measurements). Existing models focused on one type of turbulence only, mostly via very high-resolution numerical simulations over small spatial and temporal scales. In this model the dominance of either turbulence has an imprint on the energy spectrum at the shock. Both aspects have never been combined in a single model and are potentially transformative in the field as they allow to treat the escape with a realistic and simple approach and to determine the relative role of two different types of turbulence in the acceleration process. <br />We have tested the model using multi-spacecraft data from the Ground Level Enhancements of Solar cycle 23 (see Fig.s 2,3). The broad energy-coverage allowed by such multi-spacecraft data was related to the microscopic properties of particles at the shock (diffusion coefficient) and to the shock macroscopic properties (speed, compression).<br />The solution to the time-dependent transport equation combined with multi-spacecraft data analysis, both carried out in this project, provides a critical tool in understanding the evolution of energetic particles at shocks, in identifying the source of Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs) and in constraining the acceleration mechanisms at play. Beside from addressing the broad problem of understanding the role of the charged particles in the Sun-Earth connection, this project provides information that will enhance our ability to predict the radiation dose transfer to Earth's atmosphere and the risk to astronauts and equipment in space caused by SEP events. As a broader impact, this study promotes the theoretical understanding of particle acceleration at a variety of shocks, including the high-Mach number astrophysical shocks generated in supernova explosions or the termination shocks of the pulsar wind nebulae.<br />The results of this study was presented to the broader community through several avenues: peer-reviewed scientific journals; scientific meetings, such as AGU Fall meeting, International Cosmic Rays Conference, where discussion with the scientific community helped us tailor work and explain latest observational findings.<br />As for the educational impact, throughout this project the PI was heavily involved in training a number of undergraduate students introducing them into the field of space physics and to the physics of shocks. After graduation, one of the students who worked for 2 years under the supervision of the PI was admitted as a graduate student at a number of top-tier institutions (MIT, Princeton, etc) and he is currently a Princeton graduate student. <br />This project has benefitted the society through a number of initiatives. The PI served in outreach activities (e.g., K-12 at schools, undergraduate science majors, non-science majors, and graduate students) and at public lectures (Astronomy on the Tap).</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/07/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Federico&nbsp;Fraschetti</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1850774/1850774_10585333_1673126096235_fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1850774/1850774_10585333_1673126096235_fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Spatial profiles of diffusion coefficient and escape time across the shock.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1850774/1850774_10585333_1673126096235_fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Spatial profiles of diffusion coefficient and escape time across the shock.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Assumed spatial profiles of the diffusion coefficient (kappa) and escape time (T) across a shock wave (black vertical line).
