 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians by supporting the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need at Portland Community College (PCC). PCC is the largest institution of higher education in Oregon. Over its five-year duration, this project will fund one-year scholarships to 108 students who are pursuing associate degrees in the biological, physical or mathematical sciences, with the expectation that 36 students (3 cohorts of 12 students) will receive these scholarships for two years, with 36 one-year scholarships awarded to these scholars transferring to Portland State University (PSU). The project will implement evidence-based project activities from recruitment to degree completion and transfer, such as targeted recruitment from local high schools, a comprehensive mentoring program from high school to PSU, enhanced faculty-student interactions, academic excellence workshops, and use of peer tutors. In addition, the project team will embed hands-on activities in PCC's mathematics curriculum related to culturally responsive teaching/learning that lower barriers to participation for women and other underrepresented students in STEM fields. The project will investigate the effectiveness of recruitment and retention strategies and other evidence-based approaches in broadening participation of underrepresented students by designing activities for a diverse pool of scholars. Furthermore, it will create a bridge between high school, PCC, and PSU, thus providing students with consistent exposure to STEM academic fields and careers and a built-in cohort for peer networking and support.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to increase success of students pursuing STEM degrees by implementing evidence-based strategies, such as 1) collaborating with local high schools to provide additional support and encouragement of participants in entering post-secondary education, and 2) embedding peer mentors in introductory PCC math courses to begin cohort-building activities that continue throughout the scholarship program as most community colleges are not residential, thus effecting students' ability to persist in STEM. The project will make curricular changes to two introductory math courses taken by students majoring in STEM, and will investigate the degree to which these changes impact retention, with an expectation that there will be an overall increase in the percentage of students passing the course. It is anticipated that 85% of scholars will be retained from their first to their second year due to the curricular changes and intensive supports provided to them. The project will be assessed using qualitative methods such as surveys, guided interviews, and focus groups with scholars and faculty; and quantitative measures such as pass rates of targeted math courses and scholar retention and transfer rates. This project is funded by NSF's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
