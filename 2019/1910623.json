 "awd_abstract_narration": "Patterns of genetic diversity within species contain information about the history of the species, including how it responded to historical climate change and the degree of isolation of its populations. For this reason, thousands of scientific projects have been funded by federal agencies with the goal of investigating the genetic diversity within a particular focal species. The data from these efforts, including the genetic data collected from a given specimen and the physical location from which that specimen was collected, are a valuable resource and typically are made available to other researchers upon publication of the study. However, since different types of data are stored in different databases, it can be difficult to access and assemble these data for reanalysis. This project will build a database that (i) aggregates data from different sources, (ii) connects these data at the specimen level, and (iii) includes customized web-based apps that will enable these data to be analyzed in a variety of ways. This project will benefit the public by increasing an understanding of conservation risks that may be faced by species in particular habitats and by facilitating comparisons across species. This project will facilitate two types of scientific research: large meta-analyses of thousands of species that can address classic questions in evolutionary biology, ecology, and conservation biology on a global scale, and student- or citizen- science based investigations that will introduce a broad range of people to the analysis of genetic data for species of interest.\r\n\r\nMore than 40,000 phylogeographic investigations have been published to date, each collecting genetic data from hundreds of samples. Despite millions of data points, few meta-analyses have been conducted because the synthesis of results across hundreds of studies, each using different methods and forms of analysis, is a daunting and time-consuming task. It is more efficient to proceed by repurposing existing data and using automated data analysis. While the editorial policies of most journals now require data to be made available upon publication, the utility of these data are limited because genetic data and geographic sampling localities are typically published in separate databases that are not easily linked. This project will: (i) provide a series of web-based tools to connect accessions in genetic databases such as GenBank with geographic information on databases such as GBIF; (ii) expand data analysis pipelines that can be used to automate phylogeographic analyses from thousands of species on a global scale; (iii) promote these tools to the broader community of organismal biologists; and (iv) work with High School teachers and undergraduate students to develop educational modules that utilize this project's software. The primary deliverable will be Phylogatr, a database and web application built by professional software engineers via a partnership with the Ohio Supercomputer Center. The project will enhance the value of existing data via the creation of software and web-based tools that enable these data to be recycled and reanalyzed.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
