 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is well known that climate (temperature, rain or snow) can change the timing (or \"phenology\") of plant and animal reproduction, and that different species vary in how much they shift their timing. Little is known about how these differences in responses to climate will influence the ability of species to thrive. When the weather becomes warmer, or snow melts earlier, do plant species that shift their flowering time earlier become more common than plants that change less? Is it possible for bees and flowers to shift their timing of reproduction differently and miss interacting? Answers to these kinds of questions are important for predicting how plants and animals in natural areas will change in the future, and for managing the crop plants we depend on for food. The project also trains elementary and high school science teachers and college students in research, and provides science talks for children and adults.\r\n\r\nThe Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory Phenology Project maintains the world's longest detailed record of the timing of plant and insect activity. These records, together with new measurements of plant growth, will be used to understand how changes in the timing of flowering and bee activity with climate affect plant and bee success. The project has detailed measurements of climate (daily) and the timing of flowering (three times per week) for all plant species in 36 permanent plots in high mountain meadows in Colorado for up to 45 years, and the abundance of all bee species (every other week) in nearby meadows for ten years. Going forward, this project will measure the relative abundance of all plant species and productivity of the plant community. With these new data, the project will address three questions: (1) Does the phenological responsiveness of plant or bee species explain differences in species' abundances, annual variation in abundance, or resilience after extreme weather events? (2) How does the phenological responsiveness of the plants used by each bee guild influence bee communities? (3) Are the traits of plants in a local community related to community-level responses to climate such as changes in species richness, or ecosystem responses such as productivity? The project will also continue to provide its long-term datasets (already used by research groups across the US and abroad) to the scientific community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
