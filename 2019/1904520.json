 "awd_abstract_narration": "Globally, humans are causing substantial environmental perturbations, and these perturbations are likely to become more frequent and more severe in the future. Such disturbances can have profound impacts on the structure of ecological communities (e.g. species diversity and abundance) and on the ecosystem services that those communities provide. Given the potential significance of such changes for human well-being, it is essential that we develop effective tools to predict these ecological and ecosystem impacts. Traditionally, the study of the resilience of ecological communities to severe environmental perturbations (e.g. hurricanes, floods) has focused on ecological processes. However, there is mounting evidence that feedbacks between the ecological and evolutionary processes (eco-evolutionary feedbacks) occur over commensurate time scales. This raises the possibility that evolutionary processes may play an important role in community resilience and species persistence. This project tackles the challenges posed by this possibility by developing a mathematical framework for analyzing models of disturbance which account for eco-evolutionary feedbacks and applying this framework to two real world systems whose properties have not been synthetically treated. In addition, this project will also support multiple outreach activities to K-12 education. \r\n\r\nThe investigators will develop new analytical methods models accounting for environmental stochasticity, eco-evolutionary feedbacks, and demographic stochasticity. Stochastic difference equations (SDEs) will be used to model eco-evolutionary feedbacks in disturbed habitats. For these SDEs, new methods will be developed for verifying persistence of species and exponential rates of convergence to positive stationary distributions (which provides a measure of resilience). For models also accounting for finite population sizes, large deviation methods will be used to prove that stochastic persistence for the mean field SDE implies that the mean time to extinction of any species or genotype increases exponentially with habitat size, and the meta-stable behavior of the system dynamics are characterized by the positive stationary distributions of the mean field SDE. These mathematical methods will be applied to a nested set of common models associated with two prominent empirical systems: Anolis lizards on Bahamian Islands recovering from hurricanes, and stickleback fish in streams on Vancouver Island recovering from catastrophic floods. Using such different model systems provides the unique opportunity to more readily find generalities and plays to the two systems' complementary experimental strengths. Field experiments and observations as well as existing data will be used to parameterize the individual-based eco-evolutionary models. These models will be used to examine the impact of an environmental disturbance on (1) local adaptation of a focal predator (Anolis or stickleback), (2) community resilience, (3) long-term species persistence, and (4) projections about the rate and nature of ecological and evolutionary recovery under present and future climatic conditions. For outreach, the investigators will run and develop material for the modelling in the life sciences cluster of the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science, will develop short educational videos about field research, ecology, and evolution for K-12 students in Austin, and create additional educational opportunities for local Bahamian school children in collaboration with Friends of the Environment (a Bahamian conservation organization).",

Environmental change can introduce brief disturbances that briefly impose strong but atypical natural selection. After such a disturbance, the popuation must re-adapt to typical conditions. This re-adaptation entails a synergistic combination of changing community ecology, and evolutionary change in traits and genes. Sebastian Schreiber developed mathematical approaches for modeling these transient experimental changes, and the subsequent eco-evolutionary recovery. co-PI Dan Bolnick's team conducted a large field experiment to provide biologically reasonable parameters for these models. In 2018 Alaska Fish and Game used rotenone to eliminate all animals from nine lakes (to extirpate an invasive fish, the northern pike). We reintroduced native stickleback fish into these disturbed lakes in spring 2019 and tracked yearly change thereafter (2020, 2021, 2022), measuring fish from the 8 native lakes that provided founder fish, and from the 8 whole experimental lakes where we created new populations. We tracked prey community, fish diet, fish parasite infections, fish immune traits, and genetic samples This grant supported the field work to generate biological samples and specimen collections. We are presently conducting genome sequencing, transcriptome sequencing, microbiome sequencing, morphological measurements, diet analyses (stomach contents and stable isotopes), and immune trait analyses. The resulting data will provide biological parameters for the modeling work to generate testable forecasts about the interdependence between ecological change (e.g shifting prey availability and fish diet) and evolutionary change.
