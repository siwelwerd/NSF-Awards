These techniques use measured data to infer properties of or build predictive models for physical phenomena such as fluid flow or the behavior of mechanical systems. This award funded research yielding several advances.

A critical component of academic work is also fostering the growth of aspiring scientists.  The PI is very grateful to have had the opportunity to give several lectures and to have worked with several graduate students while a postdoctoral fellow.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/26/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Samuel Rudy"
