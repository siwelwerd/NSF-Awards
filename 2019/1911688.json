 "awd_abstract_narration": "Environmentally induced variability, or 'developmental plasticity', offers a way for animals and plants to \"match\" their traits, at least to some degree, to their surroundings. In extreme cases, this variability results in disparate, alternative forms. Although plasticity in general is common in animals and plants, very few examples of how environments cause \"switches\" between alternative trait outcomes are understood at the level of genes. It is even more obscure how the internal genetic machinery for a switch arises in evolution. Furthermore, what consequences this flexibility has for the natural selection of traits, which take different forms under different conditions, are not well understood, due to our limited understanding of the genes involved in the switches and what these switches act on. In this research, the nematode Pristionchus pacificus and several related species - which assume different feeding-forms in response to starvation and local competition for food - will be used to determine how genes have come together in evolutionary history to form a switch that mediates developmental plasticity. A comparative approach will be used infer what effects this switch has had on the genes, and ultimately the traits, it influences. In addition, the investigators will train undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students in research integrating genetics, developmental biology, and evolution, and it will support two science-outreach programs at Indiana University: (i) the PI will host and mentor underrepresented minority high-school students in their own research projects in an annual summer program; (ii) the PI will help Indiana high-school teachers to develop and implement projects, experiments, and activities as classroom resources to improve the teaching and learning of state life science standards.\r\n\r\nThis research will advance a functional genetic understanding of developmental plasticity, specifically of its regulatory and target genes, and it will provide the necessary framework for understanding both the mechanistic evolution and the evolutionary significance of polyphenism, i.e., discrete developmental plasticity. First, it will describe how nutritional sensing interfaces with the polyphenism switch in the nematode model Pristionchus pacificus. This aim will be met by functional tests of switch components, particularly genes isolated from a forward screen for polyphenism mutants. Second, the research will reconstruct the evolutionary history of an integrated switch mechanism for the mouth polyphenism in P. pacificus and other species in its family (Diplogastridae). This aim will be met by comparative reverse genetics and transgenic experiments. Third, it will determine the molecular consequences of polyphenism and its loss across diplogastrid nematodes. This aim will be met by molecular evolutionary analyses of polyphenism target genes. In summary, the research will integrate a model for polyphenism genetics into a phylogenetic framework of several lineages characterized by plastic - and secondarily assimilated morphologies. Specifically, the research will establish a model for polyphenism that encompasses: (i) the mechanistic requirements for its origin; (ii) the molecular capacities for its regulation to change; and (iii) its proximate (genetic) and ultimate (evolutionary) consequences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
