 "awd_abstract_narration": "How do our brain, nose, and mouth work together to generate the flavor of food and drink?  When flavor perception goes wrong, can this play a role in diseases like obesity?  The sense of smell is very important for perceiving flavor, largely because of odors that originate in the mouth and are exhaled through the nose via the back of the throat in a a process called retronasal olfaction.  In this study, researchers from the University of Arkansas, the Virginia Commonwealth University, and Southeastern Methodist University are teamed up to gain better understanding of how retronasal olfaction works using rats as an animal model.  The researchers combine direct measurements of the brain in action together with computer simulations of air flow through the nose and neural networks. They are testing the idea that different forces in the nose caused by reversing airflow through the nasal cavity are responsible for how the brain distinguishes exhaled retronasal odors from inhaled odors. In addition, the researchers offer training opportunities at each of the three institutions and are developing an educational video game aimed at introducing users to basic concepts of neurobiology and cognitive neuroscience. \r\n\r\nSmells that enter the nose retronasally, i.e., from the back of the nasal cavity, play an essential role in flavor perception, yet many questions about the neuroscience of retronasal olfaction remain unanswered.  How does simply reversing the direction of air flow through the nasal cavity result in different neural input to the olfactory bulb (OB)?  How are retronasal and orthonasal (inhaled) olfactory signals encoded at the level of spiking neurons in the OB?  How do interactions within OB circuits facilitate selective response to retronasal versus orthonasal stimuli?  In this study, researchers from the University of Arkansas, the Virginia Commonwealth University, and Southeastern Methodist University are teamed up to answer these questions, guided by a two-part hypothesis. First, they hypothesize that, at the sensory periphery, retro- and orthonasal stimuli produce distinct spatiotemporal patterns of mechanosensory excitation of olfactory receptor neurons.  Second, they hypothesize that, in the OB, cell-type-specific inhibitory circuit interactions are crucial for dynamic changes in retronasal coding.  To test these hypotheses, the research team is combining high-density multi-electrode recordings in rat OB with fluid dynamics computer simulations based on the three-dimensional shape of the nasal cavity of the same animals. Moreover, the team is performing state-of-the-art realistic computational modeling to identify OB circuit-level principles of retronasal coding.  This work is expected to generate new understanding of the neural basis of retronasal olfaction that includes both peripheral mechanisms in the nose and central mechanisms at the level of M/T cells in the OB. This project is jointly funded by the cross-directorate Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research(EPSCoR), and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

More generally, we developed a biophysically plausible decoding algorithm for sensory signals and determined when it performs at optimal limits.\n\n\nKey Findings:\n\nStimulus Driven Mechanisms: In rodents, we explored how different airflow patterns in the nasal cavity affect how the brain processes retronasal (exhaled) versus orthonasal (inhaled) odors. Fluid dynamics simulations provide a proof of principle for how the different stimulus modality (retro versus ortho) could lead to different activity in olfactory receptor neurons, that is largely consistent with previous imaging studies (fMRI, calcium imaging, etc.)\nCircuit Mechanisms: Using simultaneous spike recordings in different brain regions of rodents, for the first time ever we showed how the olfactory bulb could selectivity spike to food odors delivered with the 2 different modalities: ortho versus retro. We showed how the olfactory bulb circuit could effectively operate differently depending on modality, and we directly showed how ortho versus retro information is efficiently encoded from the bulb to higher brain regions. We also analyzed circuit attributes to explain how olfactory bulb spiking variability or noise generally increases with odor stimuli; this is vastly different than cortex where it is well know that spiking variability decreases with sensory (and motor) inputs.Finally, we also showed how olfactory cortex could efficiently decode ortho versus retro by using our unsupervised decoding algorithm.\nInnovative Methodologies: The project utilized advanced techniques, including high-density multi-electrode recordings in multiple brain regions, computational fluid dynamics discretized on a novel domain (mammalian nasal cavity) to model airflow of breathing, and data-driven stochastic neural network modeling on various scales (biophysical, statistical, etc.).
