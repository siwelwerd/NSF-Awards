 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the University of Notre Dame to develop an online surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detector compatible with liquid chromatography (LC) whose purpose is to identify metabolites. Developing the SERS detector for LC provides a unique training opportunity for graduate and undergraduate students.  Training a diverse scientific workforce is essential to maintaining the high concentration of knowledge- and technology- intensive industries building and utilizing chemical instrumentation. This project will develop technology and intellectual property that can be licensed and marketed commercially while exposing students to this process.  Integration of the research with the PI's teaching will provide a unified platform for promoting biochemical analysis, providing training opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students to gain research skills relevant to academic research and commercial interests. An outreach program will provide these undergraduate research opportunities to students from the neighboring, all-woman, St. Mary's College. The PI is actively exploring leveraging research infrastructure for both formal coursework and student training. The pedagogical tools developed may reduce the fiscal cost of education while increasing student engagement in the scientific research process. \r\n\r\nMetabolic profiling has become a valuable tool for systems biology studies.  SERS has demonstrated the ability to detect and identify molecules that are challenging to characterize by current technology, such as mass spectrometry (MS), and thus will provide new insights into biochemical pathways associated with metabolism. The approach builds from our recent results demonstrating high-throughput, high-sensitivity, SERS detection in flow. The vibrational modes that give rise to the SERS spectra are sensitive to molecular structure and can differentiate between isomeric species that are problematic in MS detection. LC-SERS should provide complementary characterization to the more common LC-MS, thus providing more complete coverage of the metabolome.  To demonstrate the utility of the approach for metabolomics, metabolic profiling will be performed on beta-cells following glucose stimulation.  By developing a method that works inline, different sample preparations can be avoided, facilitating adoption by others.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAdvances in bioanalysis have been enabled by the development of instrumentation that characterize and quantify molecules in biological samples.  Advances in genomics and proteomics have resulted from instruments that can identify genes and sequence proteins, enabling these molecules to be used in diverse applications in biology and medicine.  Metabolomics uses the small molecules that regulate biochemical reactions to assess how biological systems are functioning.  Changes in metabolite levels, can indicate dysregulation of biological pathways and provide a more wholistic picture of an organism.  This project developed new instrumentation to enable the detection and quantification of metabolites in biological samples.\n\nIntellectual Merit. This project developed a new instrumental approach based on surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) to identify and quantify metabolites online during a liquid chromatography separation. Using a sheath-flow SERS detector, invented and developed in our laboratory, we were able to identify and quantify metabolites that are challenging to characterize by current mass spectrometric detection. The vibrational modes that give rise to the Raman spectra are sensitive to molecular structure and can differentiate between isomeric species that are problematic in MS detection. The ability to detect these molecules offers a new method to explore biochemical pathways associated with metabolism. Other competing technologies require trade-offs in sensitivity and molecular identification.  Because Raman scattering occurs for all molecules, the instrumentation developed offers chemical specificity and complementary detection to these existing methods.  Sheath flow SERS increased the sensitivity of Raman scattering such that it is compatible with biologically relevant concentrations of molecules found in liquid chromatography separations of biological samples.   \n\nThe LC-SERS detection developed successfully identified and quantified phosphorylated carbohydrates in cell culture media.  Glucose-6-phosphate, Glucose-1-phosphate, and Fructose-6-phosphate were detected and quantified following a liquid chromatographic separation.  Increased understanding of the chemical selection involved in SERS detection indicates those analytes that best interact with the surface are most readily detected.  Quantification of these analytes was enabled by an internal standard method developed that utilizes the acetonitrile solvent commonly used as the non-polar component of a reverse phase chromatography mobile phase.  The sheath-flow SERS approach was demonstrated with both capillary and nano-flow liquid chromatography columns.  Additional work was performed to translate the sheath-flow SERS detector from a laboratory system to one that is readily adopted by non-experts.  These efforts included research into alternative surfaces for SERS enhancement of the signals and new designs for the flow cell device. \n\nBroader Impact.  During this award, efforts were made to collaborate with industrial collaborators to commercialize the sheath-flow SERS detector.  These activities introduced and educated project participants to the requirements and challenges in commercializing academic technology.  A total of 10 individuals (2 postdoctoral fellows, 2 graduate students, 1 post-baccalaureate research assistant, and 5 undergraduate students) received training in how to conduct scientific research, commercialize technology through interactions with industry, and effectively scientific communicate through presentations and publishing scientific results.  A PhD dissertation was completed under this project, which enabled the trainee to obtain a job with a biotechnology company.  Of the 10 trainees involved in this project, 8 were from underrepresented minority groups in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM).  Training these individuals helps address disparities that persist STEM related fields.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/13/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Zachary Schultz"
