 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary international organization for computational linguistics and natural language processing.  This is one of the primary application areas for researchers in machine learning and artificial intelligence.  The proceedings of the ACL's annual  meeting provide the foundation of the field; it is the most cited and most respected publication in computational linguistics. Thus, it is also the most important gathering of researchers in computational linguistics and natural language processing, and represents one of the most important opportunities for young researchers to understand the field, build professional connections, and gain exposure. ACL has a twenty-year history of supporting these formative activities by holding a student research workshop.  The workshops have proven popular: attracting dozens of submissions from highly qualified applicants.\r\n\r\nThe student research workshop will be a part of the 2019 meeting of the ACL held from July 28th to Aug 2nd, 2019. The workshop will solicit submissions in two categories: (1) *thesis proposals* for advanced students who have decided on a thesis topic and wish to receive feedback and (2) *research papers* describing completed work or work in progress with significant preliminary results.  Each accepted paper will be assigned an established research mentor who will meet with the student during the conference to provide individual feedback.  Both paper types will be presented in the poster session of the main conference.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The workshop provides a unique opportunity for student participants to present their work and receive valuable feedback from the international research community as well as from faculty mentors. Following the tradition of the previous years&rsquo; student research workshops, we have two tracks: research papers and research proposals. The research paper track is a venue for Ph.D. students, Masters students, and advanced undergraduates to describe completed work or work-in-progress along with preliminary results. The research proposal track is offered for advanced Masters and Ph.D. students who have decided on a thesis topic and are interested in feedback on their proposal and ideas about future directions for their work. This year, the student research workshop has received a great attention, reflecting the growth of the field. We received 214 submissions in total: 27 research proposals and 147 research papers. Among these, 7 research proposals and 22 research papers were non-archival. We accepted 71 papers, for an acceptance rate of 33%. After withdrawals and excluding non-archival papers, 61 papers are appearing in these proceedings, including 14 research proposals and 47 research papers. All of the accepted papers will be presented as posters in late morning sessions as a part of the main conference, split across three days (July 29th-31th). Mentoring is at the heart of the SRW. In keeping with previous years, students had the opportunity for pre-submission mentoring prior to the submission deadline. Total of 64 papers participated in presubmission mentoring program. This program offered students a chance to receive comments from an experienced researcher, in order to improve the quality of the writing and presentation before making their submission. In addition, authors of accepted SRW papers are matched with mentors who will meet with the students in person during the poster presentations. Each mentor prepares in-depth comments and questions prior to the student&rsquo;s presentation, and provides discussion and feedback during the workshop. We are deeply grateful to our sponsors whose support will enable a number of students to attend the conference. We would also like to thank our program committee members for their careful reviews of each paper, and all of our mentors for donating their time to provide feedback to our student authors. Thank you to our faculty advisors Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Aurelie Herbelot, Scott Yih, Yue Zhang for their essential advice and guidance, and to the members of the ACL 2018 organizing committee, in particular David Traum, Anna Korhonen and Llu&iacute;s M&agrave;rquez for their helpful support.
