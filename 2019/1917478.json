 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) operates R/V Sikuliaq, a 261-foot, global class ice-capable oceanographic research vessel owned by the NSF as part of the UNOLS fleet. Sikuliaq provides a general-purpose platform for multidisciplinary research missions from polar to temperate latitudes. The ship was delivered in 2014 and has completed four years of funded operations. UAF requests funds to purchase and install shipboard scientific support equipment that would be custom engineered to enhance the vessel's capability in support of NSF-sponsored research to be undertaken on Sikuliaq in the future.\r\n\r\nIn 2018, R/V Sikuliaq completed 232 days, 142 (62%) of which were for NSF. In 2019, the vessel is scheduled to sail 252 days with 69% (174 days) of the schedule for NSF.  With this proposal, UAF provides technical descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment:\r\n\r\n1)\tIP radio system\t$20,382\t\r\n2)\tTraction winch sheaves\t$37,440\t\r\n3)\tHanging blocks\t$44,900\t\r\n4)\tAir compressor\t$17,155\t\r\n\t\t\t$119,877\t\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
