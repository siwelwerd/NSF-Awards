 "awd_abstract_narration": "Siena College proposes to leverage and expand an existing researcher-practitioner partnership (RPP) to create a new community-focused professional development (PD) model for preparing high quality computer science (CS) teachers capable of increasing the number and diversity of students in their schools' CS classrooms. Siena College's past work and strong ties to secondary CS and mathematics education in New York State's Tech Valley region are ideal for developing a regional CS teacher community and for addressing, in a significant manner, the problem of underrepresented groups in CS. \r\n\r\nThe work has five key components: \r\n(1)\tCommunity Based PD for In-Service Teachers: A new PD program will prepare in-service math/technology teachers to teach Siena's introductory college level dual-enrollment CS course or a high school level CS course. It will integrate teachers, counselors, administrators and college faculty into a sustainable CS professional learning community via the dual-enrollment program, annual CS outreach events for teachers and their students, and collaboration with the local Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) chapter.\r\n(2)\tDiversity Initiative: Drawing on expertise in the RPP, high school teachers will be assisted in developing and implementing plans for increasing the number and diversity of students in their CS classrooms, customizing their plans based on the unique conditions, opportunities and challenges at their high schools.\r\n(3)\tIn-Service Teacher Second Certification in CS: Pathways will be created for in-service teachers to earn up to fourteen college CS credits over the two year grant period. These credits can count towards New York State's recently approved second certification in CS.\r\n(4)\tPre-Service Teacher Initial Certification in CS: A new program for CS initial certification for undergraduates will be established, making it one of the first in New York State. As a tool for recruiting current undergraduates into the program, Siena students will have opportunities to serve as assistants for CS teachers in the RPP. \r\n(5)\tCommunity Building Programming: The Siena College CS Department will continue to support and expand its outreach activities which include programs for high school students and sponsorship of the Upstate New York CSTA chapter meetings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project, a team of Siena College computer science (CS) and education faculty developed and implemented a new model for improving secondary CS education through comprehensive college/high school partnerships.  The model increased CS teacher capacity and broadened student participation in foundational CS high school classes in 30 school districts in upstate New York. \n\nTo address the shortage of CS teachers, the grant principal investigators (PIs) provided curriculums and professional development (PD) to over 37 high school teachers certified in other areas so that they could confidently offer two foundational CS courses at their high schools.  The curriculums included a new full year high school level Discovering CS course developed as part of the grant and a college level dual-enrollment Introduction to CS with Python and Multimedia course.  During the COVID pandemic, both curriculums were adapted for online learning to support the schools\u2019 move to remote instruction.   The PD consisted of a summer kick-off workshop and regular school year PD meetings.  It covered CS content knowledge, pedagogy, and research-based equitable teaching practices for engaging diverse student groups.  Teachers also developed and implemented school-based plans for increasing the number and diversity of students enrolled in their CS classrooms, with a focus on groups historically underrepresented in CS including female, Black and Latinx students.  \n\nAs part of this grant work, Siena College became the first college/university to offer a NYS Education Department (NYSED) approved pre-service teacher initial CS certification program.  To support in-service teachers certified in other areas, the grant PIs offered Siena College CS classes in the late afternoons with remote options so that the teachers could enroll in them.  This deepened their CS content knowledge and may count towards an additional teaching certificate in CS through NYSED\u2019s individual evaluation pathway.  During the grant period, 23 teachers completed a combined total of 127 CS college credits.      \n\nAccess to and participation in high school CS classes increased significantly as a result of building this CS teacher capacity. Because rural and high-needs districts are less likely to offer CS to their students, we intentionally recruited such districts into our partnership.  16 of the 30 districts involved in the grant were rural and 9 were high-needs.
