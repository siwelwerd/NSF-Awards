 "awd_abstract_narration": "The inaugural Geochronology Gordon Research Conference will be held in Waterville, NH, in August 2019.  The meeting will pull in a diverse group of scientists who are at different careers stages to report on cross disciplinary research and develop new collaborations.  The congress has a strong emphasis on current geochronological capabilities and their application to a variety of paleontological problems.  Further, this meeting will include an important deep-time perspective that will inevitably lead to new insight and future research directions that are both novel and timely. This award will support the participation of 18 early career scientists.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to support travel and meeting expenses for 18 participants. Eight are invited speakers, who are early in their careers and they will be highlighted in the scientific sessions and serve as mentors at the conference.  An additional 10 early career participants will be selected to receive travel support so that they can attend the meeting.  Announcement of the application procedure for this support will be broadcast as widely as possible through established mailing lists and websites. The program organizers have planned mentoring events, including a GRC sponsored women in science \"power hour\".  Finally, participants will have the opportunity to interact with experts from across the field, to learn cutting edge methods and approaches, and to build their network of collaborators for future research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
