 "awd_abstract_narration": "Formal Methods in Computer Aided Design (FMCAD) 2019 is the ninteenth in a series of conferences on the theory and applications of formal methods in hardware and system verification. It provides a leading forum to researchers in academia and industry for presenting and discussing ground-breaking methods, technologies, theoretical results, and tools for reasoning formally about computing systems. This grant will help support conference travel for up to 15 students enrolled in US institutions to attend FMCAD in San Jose, California October 23-25th 2019. The students will get the opportunity to present at the Student Forum, which is a platform for graduate students at any career stage to introduce their research to the wider Formal Methods community, and solicit feedback.\r\n\r\nFormal methods is being rapidly deployed in a variety of areas both in academic research as well as in industrial systems. Thus the broader significance and importance includes fostering the next generation of researchers in this research area, as well as providing international experiences to build a globally-aware workforce. In particular, students will have the opportunity to present at the Student Forum, learn state-of-the-art methodologies, be exposed to novel techniques, and interact with senior researchers in their areas of expertise. The organizers will give priority to students from under-represented groups and from small universities without a formal methods program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
