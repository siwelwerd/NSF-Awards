 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technology with enhanced spatial resolution and reduced scan time for investigating a comprehensive range of biological systems from single cells to humans. Novel MRI probes with dielectric pads will have an immediate impact on animal and human behavior studies where neuroscientists are using MRI techniques to monitor brain activity and cognition. Entirely new research and clinical tests become possible at increased resolution and reduced scan time.  High-resolution MRI is a powerful tool for understanding metabolic activity in humans and animals.  MRI will be a key diagnostic technique of the neuroscience - linking chemical and spatial information with neurological and brain disorders. In addition, researchers of Biological Anthropology, Fisheries and Biology will benefit from new tools with shorter MRI scan times and higher resolution.  The I-Corps project will provide a commercial foundation for translating breakthroughs in high-resolution MRI probes to the life science and medical communities.    \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project addresses fundamental electromagnetic challenges of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging. Radio Frequency (RF) probes with dielectric pads have been successfully tested in a research setting for biological phantoms, animals and humans. The company will work with clinicians and researchers to translate the new RF probes into commercial and research-based MRI systems.  The design flexibility of an RF probe with a dielectric pad provides for customized volumes of uniform magnetic field and allows for MRI of diverse samples including humans, mice, fish, and single cells. The proposed program will bring together material scientists, electrical engineers, biologists and radiologists to create a unique ecosystem for understanding the value of novel MRI RF probes in biological research and medicine.  Integration of knowledge from different disciplines, combined with information from prospective users will assure the creation of a comprehensive plan for commercialization of RF probes in MRI scanners.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
