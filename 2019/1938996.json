Available recordings are on obsolete media and are aging and susceptible to loss and damage, which would be an irreparable harm to the region's and the nation's cultural heritage. This project will prepare a digital archive of recordings of songs and dances of the St. Lawrence Island Yupik of Savoonga, Alaska, allowing for future research on the sociocultural and ethnomusicological history of this Arctic Indigenous community. In addition, sharing the results in a book will make more people aware of this rich heritage and will help the people of St. Lawrence Island better appreciate their own history and music. This will also encourage them to sustain these practices and their meaning even as their society continues to adjust and adapt in today's world.\r\n\r\nThe recordings are in danger of being physically lost though damage or accidental disposal, and the information about the recordings exists at present only in the memory of one Elder. Having this record available for the future opens countless possibilities for cultural perpetuation and scholarly research. The recordings, currently on a variety of media, will be converted to digital audio or video files. The archive will be fully annotated and curated to the highest standards of data management, respecting the intellectual property of Indigenous peoples. The archive will be available publicly, with some restrictions for sensitive information and data ownership. In addition, the findings of this project will lead to a book about the recordings, the significance of music and dance for the St. Lawrence Island Yupik, and the procedures involved in creating a permanent archive for the benefit of the people of Savoonga and the nation as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This was an urgent project because of George's precarious health. We made a good start in 2019 and early 2020, but then had to stop project activities due to COVID. We were able to make a little progress virtually, but not a great deal. In late 2022, PI Henry Huntington was able to visit George in Savoonga to re-start project activities. Among other things, during this visit George wrote an essay about his \"music journey,\" the steps in his life that had led to his becoming a culture bearer. Sadly, in March 2023 George passed away. We realized that without his knowledge, completing the project would be much harder. We considered options for continuing our work, and discussed these with George's family, who are the heirs to his recordings. They decided that they did not wish to continue the project, a decision we respected in accordance with ethical research principles. Three members of our project team published an obituary for George, in the journal \"Arctic,\" and we were also able to publish George's \"music journey\" essay in ICT News (formerly Indian Country Today), which reaches a nationwide Indigenous audience. We thought that was a fitting tribute to George, and we hope it will be an inspiration to other culture bearers and aspiring culture bearers.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/18/2023<br>\nModified by: Henry&nbsp;P&nbsp;Huntington</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
