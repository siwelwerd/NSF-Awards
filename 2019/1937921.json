 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wichita State University (WSU) will implement an ADVANCE Catalyst project to undertake a comprehensive institutional-assessment and develop a five-year strategic plan of action with proven strategies for increasing equity for STEM faculty.  WSU is a growing institution with a diverse student enrollment.  The assessment will analyze policies and the underlying systemic issues impacting the participation, success, and retention of women and URM faculty.  The Catalyst project will create mechanisms to sustain the efforts after the project ends.  The long-term objective is to establish policies, procedures and a community for the continuous promotion of equity and inclusion that will lead to greater representation and advancement of the STEM academic workforce of women and racial and ethnic minorities (underrepresented minorities (URM)) at Wichita State University.\r\n\r\nThis two-year project will prepare the university for future data collection and data analyses of faculty equity which can be used by institutional leadership to inform decision-making.  The Catalyst work will also prepare the institution to implement evidence-based strategies to enhance the university climate for all faculty which will be outlined in a five-year faculty equity strategic plan that will be produced as part of this project.   \r\n\r\nThe NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions.  Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational culture and climate.  ADVANCE \"Catalyst\" awards provide support for institutional equity assessments and the development of five-year faculty equity strategic plans at an academic, non-profit institution of higher education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The COACHE survey was offered to all WSU faculty, with a response rate of approximately 50% among all faculty, as well as among individual faculty populations; 2. A series of focus groups was held with (i) female faculty, (ii) faculty of color and international faculty, and (iii) LGBTQ and faculty with disabilities; 3. A series of focused discussions was held with department chairs from STEM disciplines and associate deans from their colleges, in which Stewart and Valian?s book <em>An Inclusive Academy: Achieving Diversity and Excellence</em> was used as the basis for discussion; 4. Three events were held for the campus community, including invited speakers Dr. Jerry Kang who spoke on ?Implicit Bias? and Dr. Robert Sellers who discussed ?How Faculty and Administrators Can Be Change Agents for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in the Academy,\" as well as a screening of the documentary film ?Picture a Scientist? followed by a panel discussion with the directors Sharon Shattuck and Ian Cheney; and 5. A review of university policies and procedures was carried out to identify opportunities to reduce bias in hiring and promotion processes. The period of the grant coincided with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, necessitating that many of these activities were conducted remotely. The institutional data indicated challenges in many departments in that faculty applicant pools do not include diversity consistent with that present in the national pool of eligible individuals, as reported through the Department of Education IPED system. The COACHE survey identified a number of areas of special concern to female and/or URM faculty, including in the areas of faculty mentoring and clarity of tenure expectations. Similar concerns were identified during the focus groups, along with a desire for increased female and URM representation in administration and recognition and/or compensation for service work done by female and URM faculty, especially in support of diversity efforts. Outputs of the grant included the following: 1. On-campus presentations were made to chairs, associate deans, and deans from across the university highlighting the issues uncovered; 2. A five-year strategic plan was developed and incorporated into the university?s DEI plan; 3. The Provost established a fund to assist in the hiring of URM and female faculty; 4. The Provost prioritized the creation of college-level administrative positions focused on DEI and two colleges have already filled these; 5. Presentations were given at a national meeting of the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues, the 2022 Gender and Sexuality Conference at WSU and at the statewide Michael Tilford Conference on Diversity and Multiculturalism in higher education; and 6. A manuscript describing the outcomes of the Deliberative Dialogues has been submitted to Journal of Diversity in Higher Education.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/05/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Janet&nbsp;M&nbsp;Twomey</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
