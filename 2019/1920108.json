 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program enables the study of important electrochemical reaction mechanisms, such as, carbon dioxide electrochemical conversion and electrochemical hydrogenation of unsaturated biofuels on emerging nanocatalysts. In combination with advanced gas chromatography system, this instrument strengthens the product analysis facility at a minority-serving institution, Elizabeth City State University (ECSU).  It also supports both research training and education of underrepresented minority students at ECSU in state-of-the-art research areas such as electrochemistry, nanocatalysts and renewable energy storage systems. This system facilitates several research projects with both domestic and international collaborators. Regionally, two faculty members and numerous students from Old Dominion University (ODU) and Eastern Carolina University (ECU) working on collaborative projects will directly benefit from this facility. \r\n\r\nThe award supports the acquisition of a Differential Electrochemical Mass Spectrometry (DEMS) system consisting of microflow capillary inlets for research and education at ECSU.  The real time electrochemical reaction intermediates and products analysis by DEMS is at the center of identifying reaction mechanism of several electrochemical reactions and providing fundamental knowledge for the development of efficient nanocatalysts. In one project, research focuses on understanding of carbon dioxide electrochemical reduction mechanism on grain-boundaries or edge atoms of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide nanosheets. This project further enables the development of an efficient catalytic system consisting of heterogeneous grain-boundaries for efficient carbon dioxide conversion into valuable products. In another project with ODU, this instrument addresses the question of how electrochemical hydrogenation occurs on reduced metal oxide nanostructures to help designing more energy-efficient and cost-effective catalytic system for conversion of bio-oils into transportation fuels.  The gained knowledge will broadly benefit areas related to nanocatalysts, renewable energy storage systems and biofuel production.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
