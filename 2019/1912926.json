This meeting will be held in Crystal City, VA October 13 - 17, 2019. The CEU is a natural venue for students who have had an undergraduate research experience to present the results of their research and interact with other students as well as faculty and senior researchers. The CEU has been immensely successful in fostering this interaction, which helps students to have a broad introduction and exposure to research across nuclear physics, and to enable senior researchers to get to know some of the junior future leaders. Partial support will be provided for approximately 20 undergraduate students, out of a planned total of 140.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
