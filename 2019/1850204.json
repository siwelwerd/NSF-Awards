 "awd_abstract_narration": "The human brain is an interconnected web of billions of neurons that enables humans to memorize, reason, perceive, imagine, and act. Understanding the relation between neuronal activity in the brain and the functionality it enables is crucial to the characterization, early diagnosis, and effective treatment of mental illness. Advances in brain imaging technologies allow researchers to collect large volumes of brain activity data while subjects are resting or while working on a task. Multiple such brain imaging datasets that are publicly available present a tremendous opportunity to study the relationship between brain activity and brain functionality. However, a major factor limiting progress is the lack of suitable computational data mining tools that can sift through large volumes of data with challenging properties to discover insights about brain functionality.  One major challenge in developing the necessary tools is due to the properties of the brain activity data that are different from traditionally studied data for which majority of the computational tools are originally developed.  Another challenge is due to the manner in which desired insights are represented in the brain activity data. This project will result in novel computational tools and techniques that will address these two general challenges. This work is expected to accelerate progress towards effective treatment procedures for mental illness.\r\n\r\nThe overall goals of this project will be accomplished by defining original neuroimaging data analytic problems without shoe-horning them into existing frameworks, tackling the unique spatio-temporal characteristics of neuroimaging data, and leveraging domain knowledge in neuroscience. The driving neuroscience questions include: 1) What are the representations of the functional activity that adheres to the underlying structure of the brain connections? 2) What are the brain activation maps that can be used to represent a variety of brain functions and to study relationships among them? 3) What is the utility of transient brain states in uniquely identifying subjects, in comparison to a static representation? The corresponding computational research involves developing techniques for: 1) Determining the brain parcellation such that the resultant parcels reflect the underlying topographic connectivity; 2) Simultaneously learning the dictionary as well as classification models for multiple task-fMRI datasets; 3) Discovering and using transient brain states and their transitions to uniquely identify subjects based on their fMRI data. The resultant tools and techniques will enable the investigation of hypotheses relevant to personalized neuroscience -- understanding the neurological processes that are shared and unique to individual subjects. This will help achieve the clinically relevant goals of personalized neuroscience and eventually alleviate the huge societal burden of mental illness.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\nThe overall goal of the project was to advance spatio-temporal data mining to effectively model neuroimaging data to enable neuroscientists in making novel discoveries. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntellectual Merits:\n\n\n\n\nThis project resulted in two major outcomes: 1. effective approaches for fingerprinting and 2. novel computational approaches for discovering groups of related timeseries referred to as multipoles. \n\n\n\n\nThe first contribution is in the context of precision neuroscience, where the ability to uniquely characterize individual subjects based on their brains functional connectome (FC) is a key requirement. Specifically, this problem is called FC fingerprinting where the goal is to match an individual's brain FC to their own FC among a collection of FCs. This has been studied in the neuroimaging community using various rudimentary approaches. Independent studies showed that fingerprinting accuracy suffers at large sample sizes and when coarser parcellations are used for computing the FC. Quantifying this problem and understanding the reasons these factors impact fingerprinting accuracy has been crucial to developing more accurate fingerprinting methods for large sample sizes. Part of the challenge in fingerprinting is that FC captures both generic and subject-specific information. A systematic approach for identifying subject-specific FC information was crucial for making progress in addressing the fingerprinting problem. In this project, we addressed three gaps in our understanding of the FC fingerprinting problem. First, we studied the joint effect of sample size and parcellation granularity. Second, we explained the reason for reduced fingerprinting accuracy with increased sample size and reduced parcellation granularity. Third, we developed a general feature selection framework for systematically identifying FC elements that capture information to uniquely identify subjects. In addition to this, we also were among the first to project the FC fingerprinting problem as a machine learning problem and to investigate the utility of a graph neural network-based approach for effective fingerprinting. Our results showed that our approach is far superior to the existing approaches.\n\n\n\n\nThe second contribution is in developing novel computational approaches to discover latent relationships in large timeseries datasets. Traditional approaches to modeling timeseries dataset as a network consider pairwise similarities between timeseries. We and others observed that groups of timeseries (referred to as multipoles) of size 3 or more, tend to exhibit interesting relationships even though the pairwise similarities are weak. More specifically, Multipoles are groups of timeseries where one timeseries can be determined as a linear combination of the rest, even though the pairwise correlations among them are weak. They can reveal previously unexplored relationships among signals from different brain regions in neuroscience or among climatic variables from different regions of the Earth, or among traffic data from various locations in a city. Using the principles that shed light on the structure of the problem space,we developeda novel computationally efficient and provably complete approach to discover multipoles. Unlike existing approaches that first determine candidates and then evaluate them, our approach integrates candidate generation and evaluation effectively. Using our approach, neuroscientists, transportation engineers and climate scientists will be able to discover latent signals in the data in an efficient manner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBroader impacts:\n\n\n\n\nOur project outcomes are published in conferences and journals of interest to the data mining and neuroimaging research community. Building on our machine learning paradigm for fingerprinting, other alternative approaches have been studied in the neuroimaging community. Mutiple undergraduate students and graduate students were trained in developing advanced spatio-temporal data science techniques for modeling neuroimaging data. Tools developed in this project were also used by undergraduate students at the University of Cincinnati to discover insights from other publicly available datasets as part of their senior research design project. The project outcomes were also incorporated into thespatio-temporal datamining course offered by the PI at the University of Cincinnati.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/14/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: GowthamAtluri\n"
