The short-term objectives of the proposed project are: 1) to introduce promising next generation scientists with expertise in the Arctic region to existing knowledge and leadership policy-relevant international networks; 2) to provide them with the additional knowledge, experience, inspiration, and opportunity they need to become future leaders of the region; and 3) to ensure the early career scientists represent the diversity of the region by including women and Indigenous participants. In the longer-term, the project aims to develop the skills for these early career scientists to step into future regional leadership roles. \r\n\r\nThe project team will fulfill its objectives by inviting four high-caliber early career scientists to the two-day NPAC conference in each year. They will be included as full participants in the conference proceedings, first as panelists; second as contributors to the published NPAC conference proceedings; and third as participants in high-level virtual networks associated with the NPAC community. Upon the conclusion of the conference, they will continue on as participants in these virtual networks and also be given the opportunity to contribute their written works the East- West Center's Asia Pacific Bulletin and Asia Pacific Issue publications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEngaging Early Career Polar Scholars in the North Pacific Arctic Conference (NPAC) Network, Honolulu, HI 2019-2022\n\n \n\nThe North Pacific Arctic Conference, now in its 13th year, provides a regular and well-recognized venue for engagement (under Chatham House Rule) among policymakers/practitioners and scientists/analysists regarding Arctic issues of mutual interest to leading North Pacific Arctic states (Canada, Russia and the United States) and non-Arctic states (China, Japan, and Korea).  It focuses on emerging policy issues and helps to promote improved understanding of major options for addressing them among these six states in both the setting provided by the Arctic Council as well as other contexts.  Although having its basic footprint in the North Pacific and looking at the Arctic through a \"North Pacific Arctic lens\", a distinction from more traditional and common North Atlantic focused dialogue, it also includes participants from across the globe.  NPC is organized by the East-West Center (EWC) in Honolulu. The Korea Maritime Institute (KMI) is the Center\u2019s main institutional partner, coordinating Asian participation and providing major funding.\n\n \n\nOne of the eight explicit goals of NPAC is to \"Contribute to the emergence of the next generation of knowledgeable individuals who will become leaders in dealing with Arctic issues in the future\".  NSF funding facilitated this by enabling us to include promising early career scientists, scholars, policy makers, and practitioners in the annual North Pacific Arctic Conference and to also leverage funds from Asian partner institutions for support of additional Early Career Scholars from Asia.  \n\n \n\nThe NPAC International Steering Committee funded the participation of 4 NPAC Fellows in 2017 supporting its commitment to contributing the next generation of Arctic scholars. The contribution that the NPAC Scholars made to NPAC 2017 encouraged our application for NSF funding. The successful application supported the participation of Early Career Scholars (NPAC Fellows) in the annual NPAC Conferences from 2019-2022.  Initial support was for 2019-2021, but due to COVID-19 travel restrictions and virtual and hybrid meetings in 2021 and 2022, Fellows were supported in 2022 as well.\n\n \n\nNSF support was used to leverage support from Asian institutions to include additional Early Career Scholars from Asia, contributing to building an international network of the next generation of Arctic scholars, policy makers and practitioners prepared to address Arctic challenges in the years ahead.  It also introduced the Fellows to senior leaders in the field and provided opportunities for networking and mentoring. Over the course of the NSF grant, 23 NPAC Fellows were supported by NSF and 10 by Asian Institutions.  They represented over a dozen nations and included indigenous Arctic participants.  Half of the NSF supported participants were women.\n\n \n\nSince NPAC\u2019s initial Conference 13 years ago, there have been major global environmental and political shifts, the threat of climate change persists largely unabated, there is increasing political instability across the globe.  We have experienced a global pandemic with huge health, socioeconomic and political consequences.  Given the increasing complexity of human/ecosystem interactions and rapid international travel, it is unlikely that COVID is the last pandemic that we will face.  The 2022 NPAC took place as war continued in Ukraine.  Russia is the largest Arctic nation and held the Arctic Council chairmanship.  \n\n \n\nChallenges impacting the Arctic originate largely outside of the Arctic.  The NPAC Fellows Program has enabled early career scholars to interact with some of the Arctic\u2019s top policy makers, scholars, practitioners, and indigenous leaders.  NPAC will seek additional financial resources to continue this valuable contribution to building cadre of next generation leaders for the Arctic.  The contribution of the NPAC Fellows to NPAC has been huge. It\u2019s a win-win. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/28/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nancy D Lewis"
