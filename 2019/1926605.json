 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this doctoral research project, the investigator will examine biological pathways through which exposure to social stress can affect physiological well-being. The research will focus on Native American populations who are historically understudied yet experience high levels of stress-related disparities. Stress physiology will be assessed using various biomarkers, including salivary cortisol, blood pressure (BP), and additional biometric data. Semi-structured interviews, demographic questionnaires, psychometric measures, and identity scales will be used to assess how cultural identity, psychosocial stress, historical trauma, health status and stress physiology interact. The results of this research will advance understanding of how seemingly unrelated psychological mechanisms and social environments may contribute to disparities in physiological well-being among minority populations in the United States. The project will also support student training and science outreach activities, including among groups underrepresented in STEM fields. \r\n\r\nThis project will investigate the relationship between psychosocial stress, stress physiology, and physiological disparities by assessing: 1: the prevalence of diagnosed and suspected stress-related conditions in an Indigenous Community in the Pacific Northwest (ICPN); 2: allostatic load (chronic stress) in members of ICPN, as defined by an Allostatic Load Index (ALI) comprising neuroendocrine, metabolic, cardiovascular, and immune system biomarkers; and 3: the relationship between variation in HPA-axis regulation (stress physiology) and allostatic load, and stress-related disease occurrence, Indigenous ancestry, historical trauma, and cultural identity in ICPN. This project moves away from a research focus on purely biological factors in understanding racial disparities, toward a holistic understanding of how unequal social and psychological environments negatively impact physiological well-being.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
