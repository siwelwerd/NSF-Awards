 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is only one area of particle physics with an accumulation of potentially-related anomalies: neutrino oscillations, where neutrinos change their character as they propagate through space. For more than two decades, deviations from the Standard Model three-neutrino expectation have been observed in short baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. Most commonly, new-physics explanations introduce a single sterile neutrino in addition to the three active flavors, electron, muon, and tau, called a 3+1 model. However, within this model, the anomalies and relevant null results are not self-consistent. Given these discrepancies, if all, or even some, of the signals are due to new physics, then the underlying physics must be more complicated than a 3+1 model. Resolving the situation has become a high priority for the field. Unlike many beyond-Standard-Model searches, this is a case where the parameter space we must probe is relatively well-understood. This coordinated IceCube and IsoDAR program, which is developed as part of this project, will explore this space in depth, and offer new approaches involving all three flavor signatures -- even tau-neutrinos.\r\n\r\nThis PI has developed two ongoing, unusually-impactful programs. The first is the $100 desktop muon counter, which has been featured in the press. She will continue to improve the design and instructions, and to present the device at conferences, schools, and science festivals. The second is development of a modestly modified IsoDAR cyclotron to produce rare medical isotopes, including Ac-225. \r\n\r\nIceCube can uniquely search for sterile-induced matter-effect resonances. As the only on-going experiment with tau-neutrino identification capability, recently demonstrated in a successful astrophysical tau-neutrino candidate search, the group will use IceCube data for the first search for anomaly-related muon-neutrino -> tau-neutrino resonances. They will integrate the results of their searches into global fits that the group has performed for more than a decade.  IsoDAR is transitioning from R&D to construction of equipment. The group plans to calibrate and commission the transformative radio-frequency quadrupole technology that they have developed, establishing that IsoDAR can meet its flux goals. Thus, along with a coordinated physics program, the IceCube+IsoDAR combination offers the junior scientists experience at every stage of particle physics: phenomenology, hardware, software, and analysis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis grant supported research by MIT scientists to search for Beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics in two unique experiments. The IceCube Experiment located in the Antarctic Ice at the South Pole and the IsoDAR experiment under development to run at Yemilab in Korea. Both instruments represent first-of-their-kind and state-of-the-art devices.\r\n\n\nThe grant was initiated in 2019 and recieved extension through 2024 due to an AGEP supplement that was associated with the grant in its third year.\r\n\n\nThe work in this proposal focused on signatures for new physics in the neutrino sector. In paricular, the studies explored the existence of new neutrinos with masses of about 1 eV. This is motivated by theory and by anomalies seen in accelerator-based experiments. Resolving the anomalies was a priority of the 2014 Particle Physics Prioritization Panel, thus the work funded by this proposal had strong intellectual merit.\n\nThe IceCube detector consists of more than a Gigaton of ice that is instrumented with optical modules. These modules observe Cherenkov light (what might be called a \"photonic boom\") produced in the ice. Using this information, the energy and direction of the highest energy neutrinos in the universe can be reconstructed.  This grant supported one MIT student with substantial expertise in computing to travel to the  South Pole to support the data acquisition for the experiment during one Antarctic summer. The MIT group also supports the collaboration through contributions to calibration.\r\n\n\nThe MIT-based analyses funded by this grant make use of a highly pure sample of muon neutrino interactions produced below and within the detector. In particular, most of the analyses searched for disappearance of the signal as a function of energy and direction. The results have indicates a 2-sigma excess in three results.  While this interesting, it does not rise to the community definition of evidence, and so is not decisive.  However, this is the first indication there may be a BSM effect in this particular signature and motivates further exploration.\r\n\n\nThe IsoDAR funded by this proposal results are on instrumentation. IsoDAR will be the first high-power accelerator located underground next to an ulta-large detector. A cyclotron produces protons that are guided to a beryllium target, which, in turn, produces neutrons. These are captured in a lithium-7 \"sleeve\" that becomes lithium-8 which beta decays.  The result is a unique set of particle fluxes---more than a mole of neutrinos, neutrons and photons. Using these, IsoDAR has a rich physics program, primarily focused on BSM searches.\r\n\n\nFunded by this grant, MIT has established the feasibility of the first 10 mA, 60 MeV cyclotron, which is 10x the intensity of commercial machines. This forms the heart of this experiment, supplying the protons to drive the source. We had multiple novel developments and our design won two awards during this proposal period.\r\n\n\nThese projects were excellent training grounds for students on instrumentation, AI and phenomenology. One student went directly to industry after Ph.D. due to his valauble skills. A diverse group was educated, with roughly equal participation by women and substantial Hispanic participation. Undergraduate and Ph.D. students were supported through this grant.\r\n\n\nBeyond this, IsoDAR is unusual in that it has direct spin-offs. The MIT design represents a new family of high power cyclotrons producing up to 10 mA of a range of ions with charge-to-mass of 1-to-2 and with energies from 1.5 to 60 MeV. That has direct value to the medical isotope industry. In specific the case of 40 MeV deuterons, it also has value to development of a fusion materials test-stand. Thus, IsoDAR has expecially strong Broader Impacts.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JanetMConrad\n"
