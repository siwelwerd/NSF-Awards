 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drs. Carla Hadden, (University of Georgia) Barnet Pavao-Zuckerman (University of Maryland), Laurie Reitsema (University of Georgia), and Elizabeth J. Reitz (University of Georgia) will study the role of animals in the development of early colonial American cities. Early urban centers were often established as trans-oceanic trading ports, but their connections to local and regional economies is often overlooked. To what extent were urban colonial centers dependent upon distant rural agrarian communities? This project will use zooarchaeological, microbotanical, and stable isotope evidence coupled with historical documents to test the hypothesis that specialized animal economies were fundamental to the development of new colonies and urban centers in early America. This study will contribute to interpretation and outreach efforts of The Charleston Museum, under the supervision of Curator Martha Zierden, particularly the development of Bragg Boxes for rural and underserved schools. The boxes will include an activity book designed for a K-12 audience prepared by the University of Georgia's Center for Applied Isotope Studies.  \r\n\r\nThe team will examine how animals contributed to the emergence of colonial economies in British North America during in the 16th-18th centuries using colonial Charleston, South Carolina, as the test case, where the production of animals and animal products ranked fourth among Charleston's agricultural enterprises in the 1700s. This team will focus specifically on the origins and distribution of cattle in the southeastern U.S. and Charleston's role as a node in large-scale regional, interregional, and global provisioning systems. The team will examine whether cattle were from distant rural locations, suburban pastures, or urban backlots; whether and how these sources changed over time; and the extent to which the city's participation in global markets reflects the region's rural-urban animal economy. Bone chemistry data derived from stable isotope analysis will be essential to understanding local, regional, and international aspects of the animal economy. This combination will enable them to determine whether provisioning shifts occurred between the colony's foundation in 1670 and its role as a major trans-Atlantic port by 1780. The interdisciplinary, multi-proxy research design allows them to distinguish between local and distant sources of animals and animal products within a colonial distribution system. It is rare to find this combination of approaches used to examine how short- and long-distance trade networks and provisioning strategies connected and organized people and landscapes. Professional contributions will link the Charleston trade with studies of global trade in animal products.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Although oral and written histories document the importance of cattle in the economy into the twentieth century, understanding the historical background of the cattle economy requires deeper study of archaeological and historical records. By merging information from documents, soil cores, stable isotopes, and zooarchaeological studies of the City and its hinterlands the study offers new perspectives into the seventeenth- to nineteenth-century cattle economy.</p>\n<p>The Lowcountry was a tightly knit economic system, with cattle circulating within the region, primarily from the inland rural hinterlands to the Lower Coastal Plain. Cattle were most likely semi-feral and free-ranged, as evidenced by the dietary diversity reflected in carbon isotope assays, most especially on the ecologically diverse coastal plain. Oxygen isotope assays also reflect free-range practices. The vast majority of cattle drank fresh, flowing water, rather than ponded water as would be expected for penned animals. Cattle were managed differently in rural and urban locations. In Charleston, cattle were managed primarily for beef, and were slaughtered at younger ages, as is typical for beef-managed herds. In the rural hinterlands, cattle were managed for both beef and dairy, with infertile cows slaughtered at older ages. The movement of cattle from the rural hinterlands to the urban center at Charleston may have peaked in the mid-eighteenth century, followed by a protracted but steady decline in the Lowcountry cattle industry. This decline may have been driven by disease, habitat degradation, and/or poor nutrition, topics that deserve further study. Rural production centers appear to have moved upcountry, perhaps pushed further inland by an expanding demand for agricultural land outside Charleston. Ironically, it appears that the growth of herds into the eighteenth century altered Lowcountry landscapes, facilitating the increase in rice and cotton production that eventually replaced free-range cattle herds. These changes indicate a shift from a generalized cattle husbandry strategy to a focus on meat and other secondary products, such as hides and tallow, needed by the growing urban population in Charleston and its international market. This research, merging archival and archaeological data, also underscores subtle and not-so-subtle differences between upcountry and Lowcountry landscapes and lifeways.</p>\n<p>The project was intentionally designed to maximize broader impacts reaching children and adults through three outreach products. The products, all parts of ongoing efforts at the University of Georgia and The Charleston Museum, are intended to be broadly inclusive and accessible, incorporating the voices of the communities that would be impacted the most by our work.</p>\n<p>1. The third installment of the <em>Carbon Comics </em>series, an educational comic sponsored by the University of Georgia Center for Applied Isotope Studies (CAIS). These bilingual comic books focus on the intersection of historical narratives and archaeological science, describing projects conducted by CAIS scientists and collaborators, and produced in consultation with descendent communities. Lesson plans are aligned with Georgia science and social studies standards as well as Next Generation Science Standards.</p>\n<p>2. The Charleston Museum incorporated the project results into modernized Bragg Boxes. Bragg Boxes feature artifacts, replicas, reproduction images, documents, lesson plans, and activities to provide valuable arts-infused social studies and natural sciences curricula to students, tied directly to South Carolina state educational standards. Each box contains 4-5 lesson plans which offer a variety of problem-based learning experiences. The boxes are contained in rolling footlocker trunks. Trunks may be picked-up at the Museum, dropped off at local schools, or shipped to out-of-state schools. Funds are available to provide the boxes without charge to Title One or schools in at-risk communities. The trunk contents encourage accessibility and inclusivity through different instructional modalities and physical access to artifacts and lessons that would otherwise only be available to students able to visit the Museum or the sites themselves.</p>\n<p>3. The Charleston Museum incorporated archaeological discoveries and project results into on-site interpretation and exhibits at the Heyward-Washington House Museum. Zooarchaeological research served as the foundation to add faux food interpretation to the kitchen and dining room.

Over time, international collaborations will build integrative studies focused on the ways colonists and indigenous peoples in the United States and elsewhere interacted with animals and one another throughout the post-Columbian world.</p>\n<p>A complete project report is available for free to all readers via The Charleston Museum web site &lt;<a href=\"http://www.charlestonmuseum.org/\" target=\"_blank\">www.charlestonmuseum.org</a>.&gt;.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/14/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Carla&nbsp;Hadden</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1920835/1920835_10611657_1665603811168_CAIScomicsample1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1920835/1920835_10611657_1665603811168_CAIScomicsample1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Draft comic cover\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1920835/1920835_10611657_1665603811168_CAIScomicsample1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Draft comic cover\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Cover of Carbon Comics 3: Archaeology of the Cattle Economy in Charleston, South Carolina</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">James Burns</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Carla&nbsp;Hadden</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Draft comic cover</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1920835/1920835_10611657_1665775070570_HWHoutdoorsignagemontage-01--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1920835/1920835_10611657_1665775070570_HWHoutdoorsignagemontage-01--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"HW wayside montage\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1920835/1920835_10611657_1665775070570_HWHoutdoorsignagemontage-01--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"HW wayside montage\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">New waysides in the Heyward-Washington House Museum</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">The Charleston Museum</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Carla&nbsp;Hadden</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">HW wayside montage</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1920835/1920835_10611657_1665775381004_Fauxfoods-01--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1920835/1920835_10611657_1665775381004_Fauxfoods-01--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Faux foods in the HW Kitchen\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1920835/1920835_10611657_1665775381004_Fauxfoods-01--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Faux foods in the HW Kitchen\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Heyward-Washington House kitchen, prior to installation of faux foods.
