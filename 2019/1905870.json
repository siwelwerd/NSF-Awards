 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nBio-renewable polymers such as poly(lactic acid) (PLA) hold the promise to replace fossil-based thermoplastics such as poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET).  PLA has not replaced PET despite similar physical properties such as relatively high glass transition temperature Tg (60 to 70 degree Celsius) and slow crystallization kinetics.  Unlike PET, crystalline PLA are brittle at room temperature, making the material hardly usable.  Amorphous PLA is also brittle because of rapid physical aging that can take place in PLA.  To make the replacement competitive, which is of considerable economic benefit to the national prosperity and welfare, several scientific advances must be made.  First, a better understanding of mechanics of semicrystalline polymers must be achieved from a molecular viewpoint.  Second, a clearer relationship must be established between processing conditions and resulting mechanical properties of semicrystalline polymers.  The proposed research will investigate why crystallization does not enhance ductility for polymers with Tg above room temperature.  In particular, research will be conducted to evaluate the conjectures that (a) crystalline regions of such semicrystalline polymers are mechanically weaker than the non-crystalline regions and (b) fast crystallization is necessary is entrap chain entanglement and preserve (instead of deplete) chain networking.  Moreover, efforts will be made to establish the processing, structure and property relationships that will make PLA superbly tough and heat resistant.  Specifically, scientific principles will be identified to achieve crystallization while preserving chain uncrossability.\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nPast studies of mechanics of semicrystalline polymers and \"flow-induced\" crystallization mainly focused on polymers whose glass transition temperature are below room temperature and crystallization kinetics are relatively fast, e.g., isotactic polypropylene and polyethylene.  The existing knowledge is thus not transferrable for class B semicrystalline polymers (with Tg above room temperature) such as PLA because mechanics of PLA at room temperature involves deformation of glassy amorphous regions that separate the crystalline regions.  For example, the well-known respective models of Peterlin and Flory-Yoon do not directly apply.  The much higher stress due to glassy polymer deformation raises the question of whether crystalline regions are structurally as strong as the amorphous regions.  Since chains do not topologically cross in the crystalline regions, the cohesion of crystalline regions cannot take advantage of strong covalent bonds and is thus limited.  The planned research will apply new knowledge in melt rheology and molecular mechanics of polymeric glasses, in combination with the mature characterization tools such as WAXS, SAXS and DSC to establish an insightful perspective that recognizes the need to explicitly describe and control the state of the amorphous phase in terms of the population of tie chains relative to dangling and free chains.  Moreover, in situ polarized optically microscopy will be employed to identify the locations (either inside spherulites, or within amorphous regions or at inter-spherulitic boundaries) where mechanical weakness resides, providing the needed information for a molecular model of mechanics of glassy semicrystalline polymers.  The proposed work will explore the unique effect of elastic pre-melt-deformation on polymer crystallization and resulting mechanical properties of PLA.  Here each stretched entanglement strand is expected to nucleate a nano-crystal that is free of chain folding and acts like rigid nano-fillers in close packing, linked by non-crystalline stretched chain networking.  Specifically, cold-crystallization of pre-melt-stretched PLA could result in crystalline yet optically clear samples that are not only superbly ductile but also have outstanding dimensional stability (e.g., zero shrinkage at 100 degrees Celsius).\r\n.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe objective of the proposal is to show how existing and new semicrystalline polymers can avoid brittle failure under heavy load.  Such polymers are like a pot of frozen spaghetti where a typical strand partially packs parallel to neighboring strands to form an order state (known as crystallization, acting the fix the strands in space) while trying to remain inserted into the sea of other strands.  Although reality is far more complicated than such a simple mental picture, various experiments can provide useful insights into the structure-property relationship.  This research first explored the influence of crystallization on structural integrity and demonstrates that lack of desirable mechanical characteristic, e.g., poor resistance to fracture, is linked to how semicrystalline polymers undergo crystallization.  These polymers include polypropylene and bio-based, biodegradable poly(lactic acid) (PLA).  The completed study emphasized the concept of global entanglement (technically termed crystalline chain network) achieved by mutual penetration of long spaghetti (polymer chains) and suggests that failure can be avoided when enough chains can pull out of the crystalline region to permit crystal deformation without decohesion.  Second, the research was carried out to show how mechanical characteristics of semicrystalline polymer can be improved by re-structuring the topological arrangements among the spaghetti strands.  In one example, the brittle PLA was demonstrated to overcome all of its weakness and become tough, transparent yet heat-resistant enough to withstand boiling water when made into a beverage cup.  Understanding acquired from these research activities, summarized in two lengthy back-to-back published papers, can be expected to be helpful to practitioners in polymer industry in their efforts to make better products from sustainable and recycled polymers.  The emergent knowledge also forms an integral part of the content for a new book titled Physics of Polymer Mechanics, which is written to guide researchers in their exploration of new and wider applications of a wide range of polymers.\n\nThis project also branched into a second separate topic, the subject of fracture mechanics of polymers, as part of a bigger picture concerning ductility and drawability of polymers.  This unusual foray into something entirely different from the proposed research objective occurred in the middle of the grant period.  It became clear at the time that groundbreaking progress could be made in this presumably mature area of seventy years.  Considerable efforts were made in addition to the completion of the proposed objective stated above.  Through two initial publications, it was shown that fracture of polymers such as plastics and elastomers may be more accurately understood in a new paradigm that the original fracture mechanics research failed to establish.  Carefully designed experiments, based on spatial and time-resolved birefringence measurements, explicitly demonstrated that local stress exceeding the polymer strength is the fracture mechanism.  This new framework offers a simple understanding of what determines material?s resistance against brittle fracture.  Clearly, this newly acquired perspective holds the promise to transform this important field, enabling better characterization and design of polymers to display greater toughness, i.e., the ability to resist fracture. In fact, the topic is the missing piece of the whole puzzle regarding all aspects mechanical of polymers.  Through the ongoing efforts, we can expect a coherent scheme to be established in which mechanical performance of polymers in different forms can be optimized.  Since over 400 million metric tons of polymers go into products worldwide every year because of their adequate mechanical characteristics, a better understanding of mechanical properties of polymers is beneficial to the overall economy.  This project has contributed to such understanding.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/26/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Shi-Qing Wang"
