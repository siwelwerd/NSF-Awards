 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most successful theories in all of science is the Standard Model of particle physics. It describes the fundamental interactions of the sub-atomic particles that make up the visible universe.  Within the Standard Model, the Strong Force is described by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and this force governs the interaction between the constituent particles making up the protons and neutrons (collectively \"nucleons\") in the nucleus of ordinary matter.  While QCD has been remarkably successful in explaining many aspects of nucleon structure, many questions still remain.  Understanding how the fundamental force between the constituent particles (quarks and gluons) leads to the structure of the protons and neutrons is one of the overarching ambitions of modern nuclear physics.  Over the past several decades, one of the most powerful experimental tools for nucleon structure studies has been the scattering of fast electrons from nucleons inside atomic nuclei.  This project will support an experimental program of electron scattering to study the fundamental structure of the neutron and proton in the case when an electron is scattered from a single \"valence\" quark.  This case is of particular interest as there are some definite mathematical predictions for the ratio of the up to down quark distributions, and precise measurements would test our understanding of the QCD theory.  In addition, this research program will address a critical need for training the next generation of physicists and provide science training to historically underrepresented groups, including women and African-Americans working directly on the project.  The presence of highly visible, leading edge research on the campus of a minority institution provides students with exposure to science that might not otherwise be accessible. \r\n\r\nThe research program will be accomplished via two complementary experiments carried out with the electron beam at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab).  The Hampton group has a leadership role in both experiments, and each experiment will be the dissertation topic for a Hampton Ph.D. student.  The first experiment will measure the nearly free neutron structure function and the ratio of down to up quark distributions via the method of spectator proton tagging from a deuterium target. The Hampton group has responsibility for design, construction, and operation of the recoil proton detector in addition to contributions to the data analysis and simulation.  The second experiment took data in 2018 in Hall C to measure the inclusive proton and deuteron F2 structure functions at large Bjorken-x.  The Hampton group participated in the data analysis and simulation efforts, as well as systematic studies of the new SHMS spectrometer in Hall C.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis scientific research was proposed toprovide critical experimental  information on the fundamental structure of the neutrons  that are found within the nucleus of atoms and are the building blocks of ordinary matter. While Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) has become accepted as the theory of the strong interaction, which binds the constituent quarks  and gluons in the proton and neutron, numerous questions still remain in  regards to the resulting structure of these nucleons. In contrast to the proton, the neuitron structure has been much less well measured than the proton due to the lack of high density neutron targets available for scattering experiments. The aim of this research program was to significantly improve our knowledge of neutron structure in the 'valence' region in which a single struck quark carries most of the neutron momentum,\r\n\n\nOne of the  primary tools for such studies is electromagnetic scattering  experiments, where an intense beam of charged particles (such as electrons) interact with the  composite target particle to be studied. By detecting the scattered electrons from a target composed of like nuclei - such as protons in  hydrogen or the deuteron (weakly bound proton and neutron) in deuterium -physicists can infer the distribution of charged quarks. This program was accomplished via two complimentary experiments at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab). The BONuS12 experimetn was carried out in Hall B with the aim of measuring the nearly free neutron structure function via the method of spectator proton tagging, while the second experiment was a Hall C experiment which took data to measure proton and deuteron structure functions.\r\n\n\nThe first results from the Hall C experiment on the ratio of deuteron   to proton structure functions has been submitted for publication. The   data precision is a large improvement over existing data sets and was   demonstrated to significantly reduce uncertinaties in the extracted   d-quark distribution in the valence region when utilized in global QCD   fits. The BONuS12 experiment took data during the second year of this grant, which provided support for the Hampton University group to lead the  development and testing of the proton detector and to be the on-call system  experts during data taking. The analysis of the BONuS12 data on the free neutron structure function is nearing completion and has been recognized by the JLab Program Advisory Committee to be a high impact experiment. Leveaging the results from both experiemnts will shed light not only on the free neutron structure, but on the nuclear effects in the most simple of nuclei with a single proton and neuton.\r\n\n\n\nThis grant addressed a need for training the next  generation of nuclear physicists and support for two Hampton University to complete their Ph.D degrees focusing on the analysis of these experiments, as well as providing undergraduate students from an  under-represented group access to participation in cutting edge research  at an Historically Black College or University, with minority  undergraduate students contributing to this research.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/12/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MichaelEChristy\n"
