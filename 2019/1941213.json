 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will explore whether we can develop a electro-optic silicon nitride that is compatible with\r\ncomplementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication. The ideal material for integrated\r\nphotonics is compatible with CMOS electronics, has a high refractive index, is deposited, electrooptically\r\nactive, and low loss; however, current photonic platforms fall short of meeting these\r\ncharacteristics. While silicon has revolutionized photonics over the last two decades because of its high\r\nrefractive index and relative compatibility with CMOS electronics, the silicon photonic platform, which\r\nuses the plasma dispersion effect for refractive index modulation, is fundamentally limited by carrier loss.\r\nThis fundamental loss limits the impact of silicon photonics in quantum information science, ultra-low\r\npower communications, and chip-based LIDAR. Silicon nitride is a CMOS compatible material with high\r\nrefractive index and low loss; however, it is passive. Electro-optic silicon nitride (EO-SiN) has the\r\npotential to completely change the field of integrated photonics. If successful, one can envision an EOSiN\r\nplatform for modulation, low loss guiding, switching, and nonlinear functionalities all integrated on a\r\nsingle chip.\r\nThe proposed project will create a unique experience for one high school student from the Kearns Center\r\nUpward Bound Program. The experience consists of a six-week internship during the summer. The\r\nstudent will be immersed in the research group working on a project alongside other undergraduate,\r\nmaster's and PhD students. The goal of this effort is to expose one first-generation, low-income high\r\nschool student to STEM fields to motivate them to follow a career in math, science, and engineering. The\r\nstudents will receive an integrated mentorship from McNair fellows (undergraduate students), master's\r\nstudents, PhD students, and the PI as they reinforce and discover the excitement of working in cutting\r\nedge research.\r\nTechnical description\r\nThe PI proposes to explore whether we can engineer an electro-optic effect in silicon nitride using\r\nelectrical poling. As a proof-of-concept of the potential of electro-optic silicon nitride, we will\r\ndemonstrate a silicon nitride, on-chip, high-speed modulator. Understanding how to engineer an electrooptic\r\neffect in silicon nitride will bring forward a high refractive index, low loss, deposited material with\r\nCMOS compatibility and the ability to modulate the refractive index without inducing loss. It will clarify\r\nthe origin of previously observed second harmonic generation in silicon nitride, which is hypothesized to\r\ncome from either surface effects or the bulk properties of silicon nitride.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
