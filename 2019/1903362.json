 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advanced fuel-lean combustion engine technologies can increase the energy efficiency and reduce the carbon emissions. However, the development of this technology is hindered by the ignition failure in fuel-lean mixtures. To achieve successful ignition in fuel-lean mixtures, understanding of the mechanism of plasma reaction and propagation in engines is critical. However, the coupling between fuel chemistry and plasma-associated reactions in a combustible mixture has not been studied in detail. In this investigation, a collaborative team will develop new theoretical, computational, and experimental models to understand the fundamental mechanism of thermal-chemical processes occurring in combustible mixtures. If successful, the proposed investigation will provide a new well-validated theoretical model to simulate plasma-driven reactions in an engine, especially under ultra-lean fueling conditions with reduced carbon and pollutant emissions. The plasma model developed can also contribute to advancing other research topics, such as fuel reforming and materials synthesis. The research will also provide career development opportunity for graduate and undergraduate students in plasma sciences, combustion, sustainable energy, and laser imaging, and augment the Sustainable Energy certificate program for Princeton undergraduate students\r\n\r\nThe proposed study will develop: (1) a new thermal-chemical instability model to understand the mechanism of kinetic coupling between plasma and n-pentane combustion chemistry in plasma contraction, (2) advanced laser diagnostic methods to characterize the dynamics and chemical process of plasma instability in a combustible mixture at elevated pressure, (3) a validated three-dimensional computational model to simulate thermal-chemical instability of weakly ionized plasma in a combustion mixture, and (4) a novel volumetric ignition technique by controlling plasma instability using an energy cascading discharge array for ultra-lean ignition. The resulting new thermal-chemical instability model will significantly advance the understanding of the kinetic impact of plasma-combustion chemistry on plasma instability in engines. The experimental data of electron temperature, number density, and electric field will provide critical validation targets for the theory and numerical models. The novel volumetric ignition technique by using an instability controlled energy cascading discharge array will provide an innovative method for efficient ignition at fuel lean conditions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In this study, we developed a new thermal-chemical instability theory and criterion which can predict and control plasma instability in a reactive mixture with plasma enhanced chemical reactions. The newly developed plasma thermal-chemical instability criterion is validated using methane and dimethyl ether/air mixtures with in-situ laser diagnostics. It is found that the reaction kinetics and heat release of plasma assisted fuel oxidation dramatically affects plasma dynamics and instability. The low temperature heat release from plasma assisted fuel oxidation significantly accelerates the development of plasma instability. Moreover, it is also shown that endothermic reactions can delay the onset of plasma instability. &nbsp;Time and spatially resolved one-dimensional imaging of both rotational and vibrational plasma temperatures was developed by using pure rotational hybrid femtosecond/picosecond coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (fs/ps CARS). A sensitive and single-shot measurement method for simultaneous detection of OH and temperature in plasma chemistry diagnostics was developed by using femtosecond ultraviolet laser absorption spectroscopy (fs-UV-LAS). A multiscale adaptive reduced chemistry solver for plasma assisted combustion (MARCS-PAC) in a compressible multi-component reactive flow is developed and validated for appropriate modeling of plasma instability and plasma assisted ignition and detonation. The developed diagnostic and computational methods were applied to control deflagration to detonation control in a microchannel with uniform plasma discharge. It is shown for the first time that plasma enhanced low temperature chemistry can dramatically accelerate the deflagration to detonation transition. Moreover, elementary reaction rates of electronically excited species with fuels were directly measured, and experimentally validated kinetic models of plasma assisted combustion of large alkanes, oxygenated fuels, and ammonia are developed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/27/2023<br>\nModified by: Yiguang&nbsp;Ju</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1903362/1903362_10636898_1703711001397_figures_2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1903362/1903362_10636898_1703711001397_figures_2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"pure rotational hybrid femtosecond/picosecond coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (fs/ps CARS)\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1903362/1903362_10636898_1703711001397_figures_2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"pure rotational hybrid femtosecond/picosecond coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (fs/ps CARS)\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Time and spatially resolved one-dimensional imaging of both rotational and vibrational plasma temperatures was developed by using pure rotational hybrid femtosecond/picosecond coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (fs/ps CARS).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Yiguang Ju</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Yiguang&nbsp;Ju\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">pure rotational hybrid femtosecond/picosecond coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (fs/ps CARS)</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1903362/1903362_10636898_1703710905337_figures_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1903362/1903362_10636898_1703710905337_figures_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Plasma thermal chemical instability\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1903362/1903362_10636898_1703710905337_figures_1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Plasma thermal chemical instability\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Comparison between plasma thermal chemical instability in air and in dimethyl ether/air mixtures</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Yiguang Ju</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Yiguang&nbsp;Ju\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Plasma thermal chemical instability</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1903362/1903362_10636898_1703711085691_figures_3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1903362/1903362_10636898_1703711085691_figures_3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Plasma elementary reaction rate measurement\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1903362/1903362_10636898_1703711085691_figures_3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Plasma elementary reaction rate measurement\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Reaction rate measurement of O(1D) with ethanol reactions using Faraday rotational spectroscopy</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Yiguang Ju</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Yiguang&nbsp;Ju\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Plasma elementary reaction rate measurement</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1903362/1903362_10636898_1703711165986_figures_4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1903362/1903362_10636898_1703711165986_figures_4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Plasma control for detonation\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1903362/1903362_10636898_1703711165986_figures_4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Plasma control for detonation\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Plasma assisted deflagration to detonation transition: Plasma can accelerate and delay detonation transition</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Yiguang Ju</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Yiguang&nbsp;Ju\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Plasma control for detonation</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
