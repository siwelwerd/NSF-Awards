 "awd_abstract_narration": "Innovations in plant science are needed to tackle global sustainability, food security and human health. Plants not only form the foundation of terrestrial ecosystems and the human food supply, but also provide renewable energy and essential medicines. The goal of this workshop is to bring together scientists from the fields of data science and bioinformatics, imaging, proteomics, single cell profiling and nanotechnology to brainstorm and develop tools to lay the groundwork for creating a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic molecular organization of the plant cell, an initiative we are calling the Plant Cell Atlas. A Plant Cell Atlas will become a crucial resource for the scientific community to address basic, long-standing questions in biology that relate directly to grand challenges in food security and climate change. This community will leverage and extend a number of revolutionary technologies and techniques and be poised to create new techniques. This conference will foster a network of young and established scientists. We will proactively recruit participants from underrepresented scientists and junior faculty, postdocs and graduate students.\r\n\r\nThis workshop aims at starting a community of interdisciplinary scientists to meet and brainstorm about broader directions the Plant Cell Atlas initiative should take, the challenges it might pose on the way and how to be prepared to meet those challenges. The workshop also aims to foster interaction with and input from the leading scientists of the Human Cell Atlas project by inviting some of them to share their perspectives and participate in workshop activities. The workshop will feature presentations of initial data, along with broader ideas, in the form of invited talks and short talks from abstracts. In addition, breakout sessions and panel discussions will be organized around topics including technical challenges, community wants and needs, and the conceptual goals of the plant cell atlas. These activities will facilitate interaction and networking among the participants of this initiative. We anticipate various proposal concepts and collaborations to form from this gathering.\r\n\r\nThis award was co-funded by the Cellular Dynamics and Function and Genetic Mechanisms clusters of the Division of Molecular Biosciences and the Plant Genome Research Program of the Division Integrative Organismal Systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The original workshop was budgeted to host 50 scientists from around the world, and another 40 planned to attend from institutions local to the San Francisco Bay area. However, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 shifted the meeting from an in-person workshop to a series of 3 virtual meetings (collectively the 1st PCA workshop) held in May and June 2020. The shift to a virtual setting allowed for a more diverse set of scientists to attend the meeting and add their voices to the discussion of developing a Plant Cell Atlas initiative. The three meetings had 428 attendees in total (a 376% increase), 70% of whom were early career researchers.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Discussions during the 1st PCA workshop provided the impetus needed to take the next steps in establishing the Plane Cell Atlas community. In the second year of this grant, organizers and attendees of the 1st PCA workshop put out a call for papers for a Focus Issue in Plant Physiology. They also submitted a Research Coordination Network (RCN) grant to NSF to continue building the community. Additionally, a report of the discussions from the 1st workshop was published in Plant Direct. During the 1st workshop, the community identified tools and techniques that were needed to develop a Plant Cell Atlas, such as single-cell sequencing and&nbsp; spatial proteomics. In early 2021, two virtual workshops were held on these topics. A perspective paper from the PCA community was also submitted to eLife. This article was later published and the RCN grant funded. In the last 4 years, the scientific community that has grown out of this initial workshop and the subsequent RCN grant have published 11 articles (plus 18 in the Focus Issue), submitted eight grant proposals (including the RCN), held 9 virtual workshops and symposia and a Gordon Research Conference, and provided training and career development opportunities for cumulatively 919 students, postdocs, and early career scientists around the world. Two of the eight grants are multimillion dollar center grants that focus on single cell omics research in plants and omics data integration. The ideas for these grants were developed in large part by the community that came out of the 1st PCA workshop and several of the PI's and co-PIs on these grants are members of the PCA community. To disseminate the events and products from the PCA community a website, X(Twitter) account, YouTube channel, and email list were established over the course of this grant. As of writing the YouTube channel, email list, and X(Twitter) account have 188 and 1,484 subscribers and 1904 followers, respectively.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Due to the meeting being held virtually, a surplus of funds from this grant remained. This allowed for the development of an outreach initiative to engage the interest of undergraduate students in plant science research - the PCA Art and Science exhibit. This art exhibit features eight 8 ft x 8 ft fabric banners centering around two topics, historical Black plant scientists and biotechnology applications of plant research. The exhibit was developed in collaboration with faculty from 3 Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Bowie State University (BSU), Howard University, and Morgan State University. The first showing was held at these three universities in the Fall of 2021 and featured the four historical Black plant scientists - Dr. Marie Clark Taylor, Dr. George Washington Carver, Edmond Albius, and Dr. Percy Lavon Julian. An article was also published in Trends in Plant Science with additional information about the exhibit and how it can be integrated into undergraduate curricula. At BSU Dr. Anne Osano incorporated the PCA Art and Science exhibit in her Fall 2021 General Botany course. The class learned about and researched the scientists featured in the exhibit and presented their findings during a one hour seminar for the BSU Natural Science Department.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The plant biotechnology banners debuted in the Spring of 2022 and Summer of 2023.

A showing was also held at the University of Wisconsin, Madison in 2022. The art has also been shown at Heron's Head EcoCenter in San Francisco, CA and the Carnegie Institution for Science in Stanford, CA in 2023.
