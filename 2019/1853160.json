 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be a revolutionary, high-speed, high-resolution and extremely high-sensitivity camera. This Quanta Image Sensor (QIS) camera will be the only compact complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) camera in the market with photon counting capability at room temperature. This camera can be used in scientific and medical imaging applications where high-sensitivity is extremely important. The current state-of-the-art camera technologies cannot satisfy the needs of the customers in these markets, and customers are desperately seeking a better technical solution. The QIS is a platform imaging technology and can be used in a broad range of imaging applications, such as automotive, augmented-reality & virtual-reality, security & surveillance, among others, where high-sensitivity, high-resolution and high-speed operations are required. The global image sensor market is expected to expand at an annual growth rate of 10.4% from 2015 to 2021, reaching $18.8 billion market value by 2021. Since the QIS technology is compatible with the mainstream CMOS fabrication lines, it has the potential to dominate the image sensor and camera market by high-volume production.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project addresses the major drawbacks of the state-of-the-art scientific EMCCD cameras, such as high noise (around 1 electron read noise with external cooling), nonlinear response and unpredictable readout gain, low-resolution, low-speed, massive size and extremely high-power consumption. In this project, the second generation Quanta Image Sensor (QIS) chip will be designed and fabricated, and will be implemented into an 8 megapixel QIS camera which can function at 120 frames/s and the whole camera power consumption will be less than a few Watts. The average noise will be around 0.25 electron that unlocks the true photon-number-resolving at room temperature, with about 99% accuracy. The modular compact QIS camera will contain some peripheral digital IC chips, power supplies, FPGA, USB 3 interface, etc. A QIS image processing algorithm will be implemented in the camera module to form an output image from the bits received from the QIS imager. Advanced industrial and commercial standard tests and characterizations will be performed to comprehensively measure the performance of the prototype QIS camera. Also, the camera will be tested by beta-customers and their feedback will be received to improve the QIS camera. The QIS camera will be available in monochrome and color.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These current sensors include sCMOS, EMCCDs, and CCDs. We aim to overcome those drawbacks and limits with the next-generation imaging technology, Quanta Image Sensor (QIS) technology. We successfully designed and manufactured two QIS devices with 41megapixel resolution and 163megapixel resolution to meet the specialized requirements of scientific imaging applications. These new sensors have 1.1-inch large optical formats and the highest resolution so far among high-sensitivity image sensors. They are highly capable of low-light imaging with deep-sub-electron read noise and photon-number-resolving capability at room temperature. New patented pixel structures were developed to enable &gt;95dB high dynamic range imaging with single exposure. A comprehensive compact camera system was designed, optimized, and manufactured, which includes multiple printed circuit boards (PCBs) needed by the camera hardware, complete finite Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) programs to control the sensor, a camera enclosure and thermal stabilization system, and a user-friendly software with a graphic interface. The performance of the sensors was validated through comprehensive characterization procedures, and the camera hardware and software were thoroughly tested.
