 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) Program, this Track 2 project will develop constructivist instructional modules that help students learn mathematics through interdisciplinary, open-ended mathematical problems. Teaching mathematics via a constructivist approach may not only help students learn mathematical concepts and skills, but also gain confidence in doing mathematics. By increasing student success in mathematics, this project seeks to increase the number of students enrolling in STEM degree programs. Many students in open-access colleges need support to develop the mathematics knowledge and skills needed to progress in a STEM program.  This project seeks to identify the key mathematical concepts and skills needed for success in both college mathematics courses and in the workforce. The project will develop stand-alone instructional modules that teach mathematical topics through active student engagement in mathematics. Since each instructional module will be complete and independent, the modules have the potential to complement lower-level mathematics courses in a variety of instructional settings.\r\n\r\nThe project seeks to increase the number of declared pre-STEM majors persisting into credit-bearing STEM courses. The project will complete a pilot test to design constructivist instructional modules that both develop mathematical concepts and reinforce application skills needed for success in subsequent mathematics courses. The modules will include open-ended problems and activities that require students to justify and present solutions, which are also skills desired by potential employers. The project will assess the impact of the constructivist instructional modules and associated support activities on student learning outcomes and course completions. The project will also investigate the impact of the modules and support activities on the ability for students to apply mathematical knowledge in new situations. The project seeks to develop materials that could be shared with other institutions seeking to enhance student learning and completion of lower-level mathematics courses. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
