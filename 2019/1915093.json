 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research activities of Professors Maria C. Gonzalez-Garcia, Patrick Meade, Leonardo Rastelli, Martin Rocek, Robert Shrock, Warren Siegel, George Sterman, and Alexander Zamolodchikov at Stony Brook University. \r\n\r\nPhysics is constantly evolving as new techniques and capabilities are developed to understand the natural world. This award supports research in a broad but deeply related set of topics in theoretical physics. Engagement at each of these frontiers of knowledge serves the national interest by advancing fundamental scientific progress within the United States. Investigations will include the analysis of high-energy collisions of elementary particles, which probe the fundamental laws upon which the material universe is based, and proposals for new experiments involving elementary particles and atomic nuclei. These efforts will complement studies of the deep mysteries of gravity, space and time, and the possibility that all of the known forces in nature are related, unifying gravity itself with the forces that are seen in electrical phenomena, in radioactivity, and in nuclear physics. The theoretical methods developed in quantum field theory have also been found to have exciting applications to the properties of solids and to turbulence in fluids.  This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts.   The research carried out under this award will serve in the training of graduate students and the mentoring of postdoctoral fellows at the highest level. The faculty of this proposal conduct their research with graduate students and share their experience and expertise with undergraduates and community members, in and beyond the classroom. Individual members will also continue their own outreach activities, which have included successful traditions in high-school research mentoring and in the organization of science playwriting competitions. \r\n\r\nAt the technical level, this award will support research over a wide range of theoretical physics, largely based on quantum field theory, phenomenological analysis, statistical mechanics, and string theory. Recent years have seen a strengthening engagement of theory and experiment in particle physics, synthesizing data from the Large Hadron Collider, from neutrino observatories, cosmic ray satellites and now gravitational wave detectors. These new sources of information concerning our universe enable theorists to test long-standing ideas against evolving data, and to develop new theoretical methods to guide experiment. Understanding the extraordinary successes of the Standard Model of particle physics and how it is embedded in a still more fundamental theory will require development of new precision techniques in perturbative and nonperturbative field theory. New approaches to the analysis of existing data on flavor quantum numbers and neutrino masses are under study. At the same time, novel applications of quantum field and string theory, including theory duality, conformal symmetries and integrability properties, have been developed in and beyond particle physics, opening unexpected avenues of research into condensed-matter physics, statistical mechanics, and pure mathematics. As active participants in these historic developments, the senior personnel of this award will investigate theoretical questions in such topics as quantum fields with and without supersymmetry, high-energy collider phenomenology, model-building, quantum chromodynamics, neutrino physics, astroparticle physics and astrophysics, applications of gauge-gravity duality, conformal field theory, the concept of theory space, extensions of the Standard Model, electroweak symmetry breaking, superstrings, and the geometry of supersymmetric gauge theories.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project \"Theoretical Physics\" resulted in significant advances in broad areas of science. Many of these advances relate to quantum field theory, an indispensible contemporary tool to study nature, from elementary particles and forces to materials with special electronic properties and applications. \n\nIntellectual Merit: A frontier area in elementary particle physics is the study of neutrinos, where experiments in the US and Japan are seeking to determine properties of these mysterious particles, possibly related to the dominance of matter over antimatter in the universe. New studies were published that statistically synthesize the world's current evidence related to this fundamental question. These and other studies, including data from new experiments involving antineutrinos at reactors, are widely used, serving as benchmarks for the development of such national programs as DUNE, the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment.  Other experiments that study how neutrinos appear in the decays of unstable particles are being studied and advanced jointly with experimental teams.\n\nStudies produced from this award also serve to provide theoretical guidance for the exploration of fundamental matter and forces at the Large Hadron Collider, the world's highest-energy particle accelerator. New methods were described on how and where to look for evidence of the need for extensions of the Standard Model, and for the accurate calculation of predictions in any quantum field theory.  The Standard Model describes visible matter, the structure of atoms and their nuclei, including forces that produce the decay of elementary particles and mediate the production of energy in stars.  Experiments at particle colliders also provide information on possible ways in which the Standard Model can arise from more fundamental theories, and how the visible world may have emerged at the earliest moments of our expanding universe.   New ideas were developed and published that explore these connections, which suggest how experiments such be designed and analyzed to test the Standard Model in new ways.  The potential of new concepts in accelerator physics, such as the proposed use of the unstable muon particle in a collider, were explored.   Aspects of extensions of the Standard Model involving the mysterious \"Dark Matter\" were studied, especially for how it might have influenced early stages of the universe.\n\nThe Standard Model is a set of quantum field theories, and our investigations into nature naturally pose the question of what kinds of quantum fields are possible, whether it is conceivable to \"chart\" a space of self-consistent field theories.  This is an historic quest.  In the award period, considerable progress has been made in analyzing properties of theories on the basis of their internal mathematical structure, their \"symmetries\".  Such studies do not rely on assuming a list of the theory's particles and the mutual forces between them, which had conventionally been thought unavoidable. Important results were reported starting from this more abstract point of view, including advances in simplified models of the \"strong\" force, that binds nuclei.  Surprising connections between these investigations and mathematical theorems were also discovered.  A new technique to probe the emergence of stongly-interacting particles produced in high energy collisions was proposed.\n\nTo understand the ultimate origin of the quantum fields that we observe in nature, string theory offers a compelling template, which appears to require that there are as-yet unobserved dimensions beyond the three plus time that we observe around us. Methods to explore the theoretical potential of these proposals were developed. The analysis of string theories requires the creation of new mathematical tools for curved space-time, and progress was made in the exploration of these possibilities, including the possibility of supersymmetry, which unites the concepts of matter and forces.
