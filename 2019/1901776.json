 "awd_abstract_narration": "Providing high-quality college education and professional opportunities in rural areas continue to be a national challenge. To help address this challenge, Texas State Technical College will develop and implement on-line competency-based programs in Computer Aided Design and in Cyber Security.  The project will focus on serving non-traditional students and individuals living in rural areas, populations that have less access to technical education programs.  Project activities will include updating and expanding existing curricula to respond to current industry demands; providing professional development for faculty; providing on-going mentoring and support services for students; developing handbooks for faculty who are teaching the courses; developing a model for on-line competency-based education that can be used in other career and technical fields and by other institutions; and supporting job placement opportunities for graduates. This project will also reach high school students through dual enrollment and, thus, has the potential to increase the number of students seeking academic and career opportunities in Computer Aided Design and Cyber Security across Texas. \r\n\r\nBeyond creating and implementing the new curricula, the project is designed to increase connections between students, faculty, the college, and industry.  Such connections have the potential to enhance students' educational experiences, expand the capacity of faculty to understand industry needs and opportunities, and increase the placement of highly qualified technicians into high demand fields.  Program evaluation activities will assess the curriculum development processes, the success of new industry advisory boards, the retention and academic performance of the students, and rates of graduation and placement into industry jobs.  Project results will be presented at academic and professional conferences and submitted for publication. This project is funded by the NSF Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The review includes three focus areas: (1) Curriculum Alignment based on defined job profiles; (2) Assessment System Strength; (3) Individual Assessment Strength (Task and Context Authenticity, Rigor, Reliability). The Cybersecurity program was the first to undergo this process in Fall 2022, using the feedback received to validate and improve the curriculum and its workforce relevance. Other program disciplines will follow. \nTSTC has institutionalized PBE, with seven programs launched in Fall 2021, to include CYS. Other programs, including ADEG, transitioned in Fall 2022. Additional program disciplines will transition in 2023 and beyond. TSTC's PBE Online College enrollment of part-time and dual enrollment students has increased across the state. Along with the traditional AAS Awards, curriculum based on competency-based modules has facilitated the development of stackable awards (Certificates, Occupational Skills Awards (OSA), micro-credentials, non-credit courses) expanding opportunities for dual enrollment students to earn a certificate, customized workforce training, and the development of job-specific reskilling and upskilling opportunities for those seeking to train on new emerging technologies, or a change in careers. The Texas A&amp;M Engineering Experiment Station (TEES) has partnered with TSTC for an A&amp;M Bachelor's+ program that provides engineering students hands-on applied work experience/skills through OSAs in ADEG, CYS, and five other program disciplines. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Norma Colunga-Hernandez"
