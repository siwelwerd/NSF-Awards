 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for US-based participants in the 2019 series of Mathematical Sciences Workshops to be held at the Casa Matematica Oaxaca (CMO) in Oaxaca, Mexico during the period April through December 2019.  CMO activities aim to contribute to advancing the frontiers of research in mathematical sciences worldwide, to strengthen the research schools and groups in mathematics and its interactions, in Mexico and eventually in Latin America, and to foster the academic ties of these with top level mathematicians and research schools in the world, particularly in North America.  Participation in the CMO workshops nurtures a globally-engaged US scientific workforce and provides US-based participants unique opportunities for interaction and collaboration with leading researchers from across the globe.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-five 2019 CMO Workshops include a broad range of research areas in the mathematical sciences and their applications. Each workshop hosts up to 42 participants in an intensive, 5-day event. Video recordings of workshop presentations are published, as are workshop reports that summarize the state of the research and directions for further work.  More information on the 2019 CMO Workshops can be found at the CMO web site https://www.birs.ca/cmo\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
