 "awd_abstract_narration": "The HSCC KickStarter project will provide Hispanic-Serving Community Colleges (HSCCs) with technical assistance to improve their readiness and competitiveness for federal grant programs in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. HSCCs have large enrollments of Hispanic and low-income students and are therefore important partners for increasing the participation of diverse individuals in STEM education programs and careers. Many HSCCs have not been successful in securing federal grant projects, which is often attributed to the lack of infrastructure at HSCCs to develop and implement large federal grants. This project will increase the numbers of HSCCs that successfully pursue federal grants, particularly from the National Science Foundation, ultimately increasing recruitment and retention in STEM through enhancements to these institutions' STEM curricula, strengthening ties to industry and community partners, and developing robust articulation pathways to four-year STEM programs. The KickStarter project will provide intensive technical assistance to 10-15 HSCCs. In addition, all community colleges in the country will have an opportunity to benefit from access to the tools, materials, and lessons learned through KickStarter webinars and conference presentations.\r\n\r\nThe KickStarter team will implement an innovative and comprehensive technical assistance model designed to address the issues associated with the HSCCs' low level of success in submitting and securing federal STEM grant proposals. According to the proposers, the issues most often cited in reviews of declined federal proposals include the lack of readiness to conceive, justify, and execute complicated projects. The KickStarter technical assistance model will address these issues by developing a \"Readiness Framework\" in collaboration with the HSCCs. The framework will be based on institutional self-evaluation of student support services, industry engagement, and technology and curricular alignment. This framework will guide the development of STEM proposals that demonstrate capacity for project implementation and align with the institutional mission and STEM education goals of the HSCC. The KickStarter team has expertise in building community college partnerships with industry and community organizations, and deep knowledge of and experience with federal grant programs and grant management. This project has the potential to become a technical assistance model for other minority-serving community colleges, such as two-year Historically Black Colleges and Tribal Colleges.",

The goal was for 12 two-year HSIs to submit two proposals within a two-year span, with one proposal award. The program doubled that goal and served 24 colleges from six states in four cohorts (Figure 1). Participating KS colleges had no prior NSF funding as a lead institution within the last 5 years. Faculty and staff participating often had little to no experience with educational research nor with proposal development at the levels expected by NSF. Through their participation in KS, the 18 colleges from Cohorts 1-3 submitted at least one proposal, and 12 of these submitted at least two proposals, resulting in 18 awards with another six pending (Table 1). The highest award rates were for NSF HSI, ATE, and S-STEM programs (Table 2). Five of six Cohort 3 colleges received awards on their first submission as KickStarter continually improved and was better able to match these colleges' proposal concepts with NSF programs that aligned well to their needs (Table 3).</p>\n<p>These results and an overall grant award success rate of 50% and $10.14M in funding for the KS colleges suggest the comprehensive technical assistance of the KS Process (Figure 2) has proven successful. The KS Process introduces participants to a methodical, college-wide approach that, by starting from a strategic foundation and self-assessment, was found to be instrumental in developing STEM plans, and constructing strong, well-supported concepts that lead to successful proposals. The approach requires forming a cross-functional STEM team that ultimately learns about each others' assets and identifies common ground for collaboration. Features of the KS Process include a STEM self-assessment; President-endorsed STEM plan with institution-wide goals to improve student education; professional development in educational research and proposal preparation; meeting with NSF program officers; and technical assistance throughout. By continually improving the process over four cohorts, the service provided to colleges has been streamlined and made more cost-effective.</p>\n<p>Undertaking the KS process positioned 2-yr HSIs to think more strategically about future ideas, including collecting relevant data and identifying research questions to proactively anticipate funding opportunities. KS-facilitated STEM Assessment and Planning discussions increased faculty engagement, leadership, collaboration, and visibility to College executives, gaining endorsement of the STEM plan. Some institutions reported redirecting unused Title V funds to activities identified during STEM Planning. Faculty professional development for educational research became a critical support piece that contributed to sustainability as trained faculty continue beyond KickStarter, some reporting improved ability to obtain other federal grants.</p>\n<p>Two-year HSIs with awards assisted by KS have impacted 1,611 students, 451 faculty, and 95 partners in industry, K-12, public agencies, and post-secondary institutions (Figure 3). Types of student impacts include scholarships, undergraduate research experiences, and certificate and course completions in Biotechnology, Biology, Math, Physics, Chemistry, Logistics and Supply Chain, Cybersecurity, Welding, and Advanced Manufacturing. Faculty development included instructional practices and acquiring discipline-specific knowledge and equipment operation. A panel discussion held during the 2019 NSF ATE PI Conference featured three principal investigators (PI) from KickStarter HSIs with ATE grants. Strong emphasis on workforce experience in the Biotechnology program described in the panel resulted in eighteen students employed at local biotech companies, two student transfers to a 4-year university biology major, and fifteen students continuing in the program. The program also yielded 27-times increase in Lab Technician degrees, three-times increase in Research Lab Technician degrees, and four-times increase in Associate in Science degrees.</p>\n<p>Faculty development occurred among members who joined monthly KS cohort meetings to share learnings and hear from experts about culturally responsive pedagogy (ESCALA, Inc.), and HSI-funding legislation (HACU), for example. All meetings and training webinars were recorded and posted for open viewing on the AZ STEM Network. KS tools like the STEM Assessment are expanding to include components that address the intentionality of an institution?s approach to equitably serving Latino students in STEM. Observing rural 2-yr HSIs in KS with additional challenges in STEM education and in gaining NSF support for proposals compared to their more urban peers gave rise to plans for a national conference that seeks to bring together rural HSIs to discuss their unique barriers and opportunities (DUE-1940949). Institutions that are working to accelerate Latino student success in STEM will continue benefiting from KS and its transformative set of activities and resources to develop compelling cases for change.</p>\n<p>VanIngen-Dunn, et.al., 'Community College STEM Pathways Guide: A Collaborative Online System for Design and Implementation of STEM Pathway Programs,'<em> International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and Systems</em>, 2016.</p>\n<p>Pickering, et.al.
