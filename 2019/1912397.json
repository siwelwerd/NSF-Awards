The project at Southern University and A&M College will enhance undergraduate education in the Department of Electrical Engineering by establishing the  Computer Engineering Research Lab (CERL) and preparing students to meet the needs of the workforce or advanced studies with industry-like research experiences.  \r\n\r\nThe project has the objectives to: establish the CERL; implement and develop web-based and mobile-based applications; provide research experiences for undergraduate students; and develop a summer research program for senior high school students and teachers. The CERL will provide undergraduate students with practical skills through industry based-courses and projects in areas such as robotics, the Internet of Things, and smart technologies. The lab experience will offer tools, research opportunities, lectures, and mentoring to undergraduate students. The project is guided by formative and summative evaluation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
