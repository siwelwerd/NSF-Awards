 "awd_abstract_narration": "Luck is a concept people regularly invoke to make sense of their own achievements or failures, as well as those of others. Despite these frequent attributions, there is scant empirical evidence about how people view the role of luck in their lives, and how these views vary across the population. This proposal will analyze how people define luck, their views about the influence of luck on individual outcomes, and the aspects of their lives, e.g., financial success, job status, health, personal relationships, to which they apply luck. A critical component of the research will evaluate the extent to which people attribute socioeconomic outcomes to luck as compared with individual talents and effort. A better understanding of these perceptions will shed new light on views about social inequality, the factors that lead to success and failure, and individual motivations. These findings will provide new information to help individuals in society reflect upon the relative roles of luck, talent, and effort as reasons for their own outcomes as well as the outcomes for others in society.    \r\n \r\n \r\nThis proposal will conduct in-depth, open-ended interviews with a broadly representative national sample of 100 U.S. adults. Data will include age, socioeconomic status, race, military experience, health history, political affiliation, and gender. Data analysis will be conducted using ATLAS.ti. Following the general principles of grounded theory and abductive analysis, all interviews will be coded for primary patterns of response identifying general themes and key variations among participant groups. These findings will lay the foundation for a better understanding of how people view the determinants of success in their own life trajectories as well as for others. The findings will inform a variety of sociological theories seeking to understand the origins of inequality and how these origins play out across the life course.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In particular, we explored whether people believed that chance events played a consequential role in their successes or failures, the areas of their social lives (e.g., education, work, health, relationships) to which they were more or less likely to apply luck, key examples of luck in their own lives, and how important they believed luck to be in comparison to factors such as hard work, education, wealth, talent, and ascribed characteristics.

First, the data show that when people describe their achievements and failures with no prompting about luck, they are very unlikely to cite luck as a factor in their social outcomes (less than 10% of respondents did so); importantly, this result held across class, race, gender, and political affiliation. Factors such as hard work, a good education, innate ability, and knowing the right people were far more central in these open narratives.

For instance, in response to a vignette included in the interview in which the main characters success story included many potential causes (e.g., hard work, network ties, talent, luck), luck was viewed as significant factor by only 10% of respondents in the pre-luck condition and 50% of respondents in the post-luck condition. This pattern was also clear in qualitative responses in which many respondents changed their narratives of success to include lucky events after they were asked to reflect about chance events. Third, on average, respondents were far more likely to recognize the role of luck in some realms of their lives (e.g., meeting a significant other, getting a good job, their health) than in others (e.g., financial success, getting an education, receiving a raise).
