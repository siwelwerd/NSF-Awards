 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will perform experiments under impact-type loading conditions on two of the most widely used ferroelectric ceramics, in order to further develop dynamic ferroelectric fracture theory.  Ferroelectric ceramics have widespread use in advanced technological applications and are considered smart materials due to their ability to provide an electrical signal when given a mechanical load. By exploiting this unique electromechanical effect, these materials can function as sensors and actuators, and are found in a broad spectrum of industrial and civil systems including: transportation fuel injectors, structural health monitoring devices, rocket engines and microvalves, to name a few.  One of the main issues with these materials is that they are brittle, and are susceptible to failure from cracking, or fracture.  While there is a great deal of theory to help describe how these materials may fracture under well-known loading conditions, very little experimental data and fracture analysis exists that explore ferroelectric ceramic fracture under impact-type loading conditions.  The newly gained knowledge will help engineers and designers understand how these smart materials break under complex dynamic loading conditions, which will in turn be used to exploit the smart electromechanical effect to mitigate damage, and consequently increase robustness and functionality in real applications. The faculty member will also host an experimental mechanics learning experience at Drexel's Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day and train undergraduate research scholars.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to determine the anisotropic, dynamic electromechanical response of ferroelectric ceramics under transient, mixed-mode loading conditions using full-field experimental measurement techniques. This goal will be achieved emphasizing experimental investigation, supported by existing dynamic fracture and piezoelectric field theory, finite element modeling and microscopy.  Impact fracture experiments will be conducted on poled and unpoled, doped and undoped lead zicronate titanate (PZT), and barium titanate (BaTiO3) with varying electrical and mechanical boundary conditions.   Full-field deformation measurements during tests from high-speed imaging will be used to extend a hybrid experimental-computational analysis that extracts relevant crack tip energetics to include coupled electromechanical response and explore meaningful fracture criterion for these unique electromechanical materials. To date, the theoretical fundamentals of linear piezoelectric fracture mechanics have been successfully established, as have important analytical aspects of electromechanical crack tip fields and the role of electric crack face boundary conditions.  At the same time, no body of dynamic fracture experiments is available to corroborate with the existing theory and challenge the physical basis (or lack thereof) of the analytical assumptions.  The outcome of the experiments and analysis in this work will fill that existing knowledge gap.",

They are unique in that they have a bulk electric dipole moment, meaning they have spontaneous electrical signals that are influenced by electrical fields and other external stimuli such as mechanical loads.  Ferroelectric ceramics are utilized in numerous electronic devices used by consumers, such as mobile phones, where they act as sensors or transducers.  As the same time, they have structural reliability concerns which call for a better understanding of the mechanisms during fracture when subjected to combined mechanical and electrical loading.  At this point, unexplained discrepancies exist between theory and experiments on ferroelectric ceramic fracture, and no basic fracture criterion is agreed upon in the community.  In other words, essentially scientists are not yet able to completely and reliably predict when and how these materials will fracture due to their unique properties. This is likely due to the electric nonlinearity effects at a crack tip which are neither well understood nor largely explored.  In addition, most laboratory scale fracture experiments are performed under quasi-static conditions, where the load the sample feels is roughly the same and increases relatively slowly over time. However, in real life, for example dropping a smart phone, loading is often dynamic (stress-wave driven) and transient in nature.  In order to address these needs, this project was the first to explore and successfully characterize the coupled electromechanical dynamic fracture behavior of ferroelectric ceramics.  Using lead zirconate titanate or PZT, one of the most commonly used ferroelectric ceramics, as a model material, our team created a unique experimental apparatus to study ferroelectric dynamic fracture under combined electromechanical loading.  We specifically examined the effect of the loading rate (how fast mechanical loading is applied), poling and poling direction (magnitude and orientation of the electric dipole moment) and direction of external electrical load with respect to the crack orientation on dynamic fracture.  Under quasi-static loading, poled and depoled specimens had no statistical difference in toughness.  However, under dynamic loading poled samples exhibited a 70% greater resistance to fracture than depoled.  While more extensive work is required, when an external electric field was applied opposite to the poling direction, the dynamic fracture toughness of poled PZT specimens was reduced; yet applying an electric field along the poling direction appeared to have little to no effect on dynamic fracture toughness.  These findings suggests that orientation of electric and mechanical loading signals matter and their coupled nature can effectively cancel out dominant influences.  At the same time, there is a possibility to enhance or retard crack growth depending on the external electrical, mechanical and internal dipole configuration.  These experimental results can now be used in existing ferroelectric fracture theory to validate assumptions and formulation, and consequently leveraged to optimize the design and structural integrity of ferroelectric ceramics used in consumer end products.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Leslie Lamberson"
