 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)\r\nproject is to make unique properties of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) widely available to\r\ndevelopers. In doing so, the company will empower developers to create novel distributed services with\r\ntrustworthy and consistent shared state operations that will lead to more transparent business\r\nand governance practices. In the Phase I tools will lead to new innovative meat\r\ndistribution businesses in Bozeman, MT. In the long term, we aim to build the fundamental tools\r\nfor the growing ranks of blockchain developers, who need powerful and easy-to-integrate tools\r\nthat access and manipulate DLT state. Ultimately, our suite of services will provide a unified\r\ninterface to multiple DLT implementations and facilitate the trustworthy exchange of shared\r\nstate among different applications to create a wide and consistent view of world state.\r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to create an ecosystem of tools to operate on shared\r\napplication state stored on DLTs and to roll out these tools as they mature. The ultimate goal is\r\nto provide a unified API much like that of leading cloud service providers, which consists of\r\nseveral incrementally introduced services.\r\nSpecifically, the services planned to provide are:\r\n1. Blocky Valve - A JavaScript API that simplifies DLT read and write access.\r\n2. Blocky Pipes - A DLT data delivery microservice based on message queues connected\r\nto Blocky Valve.\r\n3. Blocky Loading Ramp - A continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service\r\nof smart contracts.\r\n4. Blocky Cement - An oracle service for exchanging data across DLTs using\r\nconsensus-based provenance. Cement will also enable interaction between smart\r\ncontracts across different DLTs.\r\n5. Blocky Crates - A database-like query interface to data stored on DLTs. Crates will also\r\nenable smart contracts to interact with up-to-date shared application state stored on\r\nDLTs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
