 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. This project will design and develop a new K-12 classroom observation protocol for integrated STEM instruction (STEM-OP). The STEM-OP will be developed for use in K-12 STEM settings. While the importance of integrated STEM education is established, there remains disagreement on models and effective approaches for integrated STEM instruction. This issue is confounded by the lack of observation protocols sensitive to integrated STEM teaching and learning to inform research to the effectiveness of new models and strategies. Existing instruments were not developed for use in integrated STEM learning environments. The STEM-OP will be designed to be used effectively by multiple stakeholders in a variety of contexts. Researchers will benefit from having the STEM-OP available for them to carry out research and continue to improve STEM education in a variety of ways. Existing instruments were not developed for use in integrated STEM learning environments.  The STEM-OP and associated training materials will be available for use by other education stakeholders, such as K-12 teachers and district administrators, through a publicly available online platform. In brief, the STEM-OP will inform the instruction of integrated STEM in many contexts with the goal of improving integrated STEM education.\r\n\r\nThe primary product of this project is the new observation protocol called STEM-OP for K-12 classrooms implementing integrated STEM lessons. The project will use over 500 integrated STEM classroom videos to design the STEM-OP. Using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, the STEM-OP will be a valid and reliable instrument for use in a variety of educational contexts. The research will explore the different ways that elementary, middle, and high school science teachers enact integrated STEM instruction. This study will shed light on the nature of STEM instruction in each of these grade bands and provide information building towards an understanding of learning progressions for engineering practices across grade bands. Research exploring how the nature of STEM integration changes from day to day over the course of a unit will provide critical information about the different sequencing and trajectories of STEM units. Examining how integrated STEM instruction unfolds over a full unit of instruction will inform the understanding of integrated STEM practices at both micro- and macro- levels of analysis. The STEM-OP and associated training materials will be available for use by other education stakeholders, such as K-12 teachers and district administrators, through a publicly available, which will be distributed via a publicly available, online platform that includes a training manual and classroom video for practice scoring.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The project team included PIs from the University of Minnesota, Florida International University, St. Catherine University, and Michigan Technological University. Prior to the start of the pandemic, we partnered with schools from St. Paul, Owatonna, and Miami-Dade. We provided teacher professional development for over 100 K-12 teachers to support their learning and implementation of integrated STEM approaches to teaching science. Videos of these lessons were added to an existing video inventory totalling over 2000 integrated STEM lessons. This video inventory was used to support the development of the STEM Observation Protocol (STEM-OP) and to answer research questions about the nature of implementation of K-12 integrated STEM.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The Intellectual Merit of this project was grounded in the creation of the STEM-OP. The development of the STEM-OP occurred in phases (described in detail in Dare et al., 2021) : 1) establishment of an integrated STEM conceptual framework (Roehrig et al., 2021), 2) development and refinement of&nbsp; initial items, 3) external review and first pilot, 4) second pilot, review, and revisions, and 5) establishment inter-rater reliability. The final 10 observable items focus primarily on the teacher&rsquo;s actions and implementation. Each item includes a brief description and is scored on a 4-point Likert scale (scored 0-3) that details each scoring level. The items are as follows: Relating content to students&rsquo; lives, contextualizing student learning, developing multiple solutions, cognitive engagement in STEM, integrated STEM content, student agency, student collaboration, evidence-based reasoning, technology practices in STEM, and STEM career awareness. This instrument addresses the need for a classroom observation tool sensitive to teaching integrated STEM, making it the first of its kind to measure the degree of integrated STEM within K-12 science and engineering classrooms. The instrument was not only designed for research purposes, but as a formative tool to be used by teachers to reflect on and improve instruction. Further statistical analysis explored the dimensionality of the STEM-OP. Using Principal Component Analysis, the STEM-OP was found to include two dimensions: real-world problem solving and the nature of STEM integration (Roehrig et al., 2022).&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Access to the large video repository of integrated STEM classroom observations allowed us to use the instrument to gauge what components of integrated STEM as defined by the STEM-OP are currently being implemented. A comparison of science-focused vs. engineering-focused lessons found that eight of the STEM-OP items scored significantly higher during engineering lessons than science lessons (Roehrig et al., 2022). This suggests the benefits of the integration of engineering into science classrooms in terms of improving students&rsquo; engagement in science and engineering practices, as well as 21st century skills. Dare et al. (2022) found distinct patterns when considering different grade bands (elementary, middle, high) and science content (physical science, life science, and earth science). In particular, implementation of integrated STEM lessons in elementary grade bands tended to score higher than middle and high school implementations and physical science lessons consistently outscored earth and life science-focused lessons. Research involving a sample of teachers who participated in the early professional development demonstrated that while teachers are generally positive about integrated STEM in their science teaching, they are faced with practical barriers, but look to the STEM-OP as a guide for their curriculum and instruction, as well as a resource to share with colleagues interested in integrated STEM education (Dare et al., 2021; Dare et al., in prep).
