 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kansas State University (KSU) will partner with the University of Nebraska (UN-L) and Washington State University (WSU) to plan for the Engineering Research Center for ENgineered Solutions for rUral Resilience - ENSURE: Food, Energy, Environment, and Infrastructure. ENSURE seeks to create sustainable rural communities through engineering innovations and in partnership with rural stakeholders. Rural areas are distributed across the country, and their spread out nature can enable efficient distribution of food, clean energy, and healthy environments. This is particularly important since 80% of the U.S. population lives in cities that are vulnerable to climate change, such as rising sea levels, storm surges, and heat waves. Agriculture is a key economic driver in many states and, subsequently, at the heart of many rural communities. Some examples of ENSURE's research include sustainable and profitable food production, micro-grids which harness wind energy and use solid oxide fuel cells, and recovery of nutrients from animal waste. ERC planning activities include a Research Visioning Meeting hosted at WSU in the fall, three webinars focusing on research themes, and a Facilitated Workshop hosted at KSU in the spring; all meetings will bring together academia, industry, and rural stakeholders, such as small business owners and farmers.\r\n\r\nThis ERC planning grant fundamentally questions the societal assumption that the current migration towards cities is the ideal resource distribution; investment in infrastructure and systems in rural areas could create more resilient infrastructure overall (e.g., food systems, energy resources, healthy environments). The vision of the ERC ENSURE is to generate resilient, engineered systems in conjunction with rural stakeholders, creating sufficient capacity in rural communities - across the U.S. and worldwide - to adapt and respond to shocks and adverse conditions. Using this planning grant, the team will develop a more complete vision of the rural landscape including the differences in, and relationships between, the social, political, human, and cultural capitals in conjunction with the natural, built, and financial capitals. The proposed team includes engineering (i.e., bio/ag, civil, chemical, electrical, environmental, and mechanical), public health, sociology, agricultural economics, agronomy, extension agents, geography, and regional and community stakeholders. Through a convergent approach, the team will create new intellectual merit that would not exist through parallel, discipline-based studies and disparate connections to stakeholders. This project will capture a more complete understanding of the rural landscape as defined by a wide range of stakeholders, allowing the team to understand the challenges and create better engineered solutions.  Information gained through the facilitated discussions will be used to create a detailed database. This database will paint a contemporary picture of rural landscapes, highlighting the differences in human and natural capital, and providing the information needed to make informed decisions.  The database will be used to develop multi-criteria decision support models, planning and analysis tools, and a story map. Outcomes of planning activities include 1) asking convergent, fundamental research questions; 2) forming the team using Google?s Project Aristotle framework; 3) creating a consensus regarding ERC goals; and 4) generating an informational geospatial database to serve as the foundation of story maps to communicate the information.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The vision of this ERC is to create resilient, engineered systems in conjunction with rural stakeholders, creating sufficient capacity in rural communities, across the U.S. and worldwide, to adapt and respond to shocks and adversity.  \n\nThe ERC planning grant focused on activities to bring stakeholders and researchers together.  Data and information gained from the planning activities were used to establish an interdisciplinary vocabulary, identify gaps in the proposed research team, create a priority list of areas for convergent, engineered solutions and additional information required, and develop a geodatabase of information including a visualization dashboard for informed decisions.\n\nThe primary outcome from this planning grant was the completion of the geodatabase to assist with defining rural given different criteria and highlight how and where engineering solutions can have an impact.  There were three primary outputs derived from the geodatabase:\n\n1.)            A Storymap: What and Where is ?Rural? in the United States used to communicate rural to a wide range of users and stakeholders.\n\n2.)           A Dashboard: Rural Dashboard used to assist with understanding the current status of infrastructure in selected regions.\n\n3.)           An Interactive Map: Define your Rural that allows users to assess areas and view the full range of collected information for the selected area.\n\nThese products have been used to communicate information to a wide range of stakeholders including faculty for the development of interdisciplinary research teams, university administration for new economic development planning, and local and state governments to assist with planning and resource distribution.\n\nInformation was used for the submission of an ERC preliminary proposal with University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Langston University, and Purdue University.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/13/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stacy L Hutchinson"
