 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cybersecurity research experiments are frequently performed in ad hoc ways, which severely retards scientific progress. Most researchers use a combination of methods and infrastructure to conduct experiments using one-off, painstaking, and error-prone processes that are never shared for reuse and validation. The lack of repeatable, reproducible, and reusable processes and other artifacts limits one's ability to build upon the work of others or to compare solutions. Enabling the community to share and reuse experiment artifacts is crucial to transforming the way cybersecurity research is conducted. \r\n\r\nSEARCCH creates a collaborative, community-driven platform that lowers the barrier to sharing by aiding researchers in packaging, importing, locating, understanding, and reusing experiment artifacts.  The artifacts organized by the platform, including tools, methodologies, documentation, and data, can be deployed to community testbeds for performing new experiments. Concurrently, SEARCCH engages in outreach activities to build an active, diverse, online community around the hub to enable direct sharing of expertise and crowdsourcing research ideas and experiment design.  Through a process of continuous learning and improvement, the hub will grow over time to include collections of artifacts covering a broad range of cybersecurity research topics and add support for newly identified community needs. These activities together will transform the way cybersecurity research is conducted in the cybersecurity community, improving the overall scientific quality of cybersecurity research through validation, repeatable sharing and reuse, and a collective approach to building on research results.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This infrastructure, called the SEARCCH portal, is a web-accessible \"knowledge hub\" designed to support cybersecurity-related experimentation, testing, and education. In addition to establishing the new infrastructure, the project seeded a community of users around the SEARCCH portal through numerous outreach and engagement events. Together, the SEARCCH portal and outreach events increased awareness and raised the profile of experiment artifacts within the cybersecurity research community.<br /><br />The SEARCCH portal, publicly available at https://hub.cyberexperimentation.org/, is both a catalog and a community catalyst. As a catalog, it provides open access to a database of research artifacts, i.e., software and datasets associated with published research papers. The portal stores metadata about the artifacts; the artifacts themselves are stored at separate, archival Internet sites. The portal helps researchers to discover artifacts relevant to their work through structured and unstructured searches. It further aids discovery through a web of relationships between artifacts, papers, and other materials. As a community catalyst, the SEARCCH portal allows researchers to extend the site's database with new artifacts and discussion. Novel tools, created by the project, automatically extract metadata from imported artifacts to lower the barrier to extending the portal's catalog. The portal's online discussion features allow users to share information about their experiences with individual artifacts and also to rate them via a five-star system.<br /><br />Throughout the project, the participants organized a series of presentations and events to gather requirements and feedback from members of the cybersecurity community; to spread knowledge about the SEARCCH portal; and to discuss opportunities and challenges related to cybersecurity artifacts in general. Major events included \"birds of a feather\" sessions at the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (2020), the USENIX Security Symposium (2020), and the Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (2020 and 2021); breakout sessions at the NSF SaTC Town Hall Meeting (2021 and 2022); and two project-organized workshops on \"Improving the Quality and Reuse of Cybersecurity Datasets, Software, and Other Research Artifacts\" (2022) and \"Cybersecurity Experimentation\" (2022). Reports, slides, and other materials from these events are available from the project website, https://searcch.cyberexperimentation.org/.<br /><br />The intellectual merit of this project was found in the creation of the SEARCCH portal infrastructure. The project designed, created, and deployed the SEARCCH portal website, a freely available site that advances the state of the art in how artifacts are cataloged, discovered, and eventually reused within the cybersecurity research community. The project created a novel schema for representing artifacts and their relationships, and it created new tools for automatically extracting high-quality metadata from artifacts. The results of the project point to further transformations in the way that experimental knowledge is accessed, shared, and validated.<br /><br />The broader impacts of this project were realized through improved access to cybersecurity-related knowledge, community engagement efforts, open-source software, and educated students. The SEARCCH portal makes cybersecurity artifacts and other knowledge more widely available, which enables and encourages broader community participation. The community of users established during the project will grow as the creators of artifacts contribute to the portal's catalog in the future. The software infrastructure created by the project is open source, and is being used by other projects to establish communities in other fields of scientific research. Multiple students at the University of Southern California, the University of Illinois, and the University of Utah contributed to the design and implementation of the SEARCCH portal over the lifetime of the project.<br /><br />The SEARCCH portal is well positioned to support the cybersecurity community with minimal effort moving forward. USC-ISI is committed to host and maintain the portal well beyond the end of the project. USC-ISI will also adopt the portal to support the \"Security and Privacy Heterogeneous Environment for Reproducible Experimentation\" (SPHERE) project, a new project under the NSF Mid-scale Research Infrastructure-1 program.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/21/2024<br>\nModified by: Eric&nbsp;N&nbsp;Eide</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1925564/1925564_10638093_1705872561814_SEARCCH_Poster___Oct_2023--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1925564/1925564_10638093_1705872561814_SEARCCH_Poster___Oct_2023--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SEARCCH project poster\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1925564/1925564_10638093_1705872561814_SEARCCH_Poster___Oct_2023--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SEARCCH project poster\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Poster describing the SEARCCH project and SEARCCH community hub, presented at the 2023 NSF Cybersecurity Summit, October 2023.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Terry Benzel, Jelena Mirkovic, David Balenson, Laura Tinnel, Eric Eide, and David Emmerich</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Eric&nbsp;N&nbsp;Eide\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SEARCCH project poster</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
