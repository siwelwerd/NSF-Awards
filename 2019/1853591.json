 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a versatile model of a self-propelled microswimmer to understand the underlying swimming mechanisms of the complex hydrodynamics of flagellated bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. Bacterial motility is profoundly important in human health and medicine, as it results in the spread of infections, including those further complicated by biofilm formation. This project will focus on addressing unanswered biological questions about bacterial swimming and the chemotactic behavior in viscous fluids. For example: How do bacterial flagella actually bundle and unbundle? How is bacterial motility in shear flow near surfaces modified and related to bacterial pathogenesis? The goal of this project is twofold. First, mathematical models of bacterial swimmers that are true to biology shall be developed. Second, these models will be validated by comparing them to experimental data, and will be used to make predictions for further experiments. The results obtained from this research on free swimming bacteria in viscous fluids may provide new information about the spread of infections and biofilm formation, and may also help to design nanomachines that are self-propelled by flagella.\r\n\r\nThe mathematical method developed in this project enables to build a complete model of a bacterial swimmer that includes a rod-shaped cell body, rotary motors, and flagella (a compliant hook and a flexible helical filament) so that the model can deal simultaneously with all complex aspects of the fluid-mechanical interaction of the bacterial swimmer. In addition, the mathematical model organism will execute a three-dimensional unbiased random walk following Poisson process. This project will use an improved version of the regularized Stokes formulation combined with the nonstandard Kirchhoff rod theory and the neutrally buoyant rigid cell body dynamics in order to describe the fluid-mechanical interaction of the cell model.  This model will also be used to investigate positive rheotaxis near a surface, which can affect bacterial transport in biomedical settings such as the urinary tract and catheters. The methods and tools developed in this project will find many applications in biological fluids, where thin elastic structures together with rigid bodies interact with fluids, including sperm motility and bacterial pathogens such as H. pylori in the stomach.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Moreover, self-propelled bacteria have inspired the development of micro-robots for biomedical applications such as drug delivery. However, understanding the swimming mechanism of such bacteria is challenging because their hydrodynamics is complex and it is technically difficult to visualize the bacterial locomotion and obtain the detailed dynamics. Therefore, the goal of this project was to develop a comprehensive mathematical model of a self-propelled microswimmer that can address the underlying mechanisms of the complex hydrodynamics of bacteria.</p>\n<p>During the award period, the PI Lim and her collaborators developed a state-of-the-art 3D computational model of bacterial swimmers that can swim freely through a viscous fluid and this model can deal with a true fluid-structure interaction with flagella based on real bacteria. This mathematical model allows investigating the individual cell movement in a bulk fluid and near physical barriers such as a planar surface. In addition, the method developed in this work can be applied to any type of flagellated bacteria such as <em>Helicobacter pylori</em>, which infects human stomach, and <em>Campylobacter jejuni</em>, which is one of the most common causes of food poisoning in the US.</p>\n<p>Here are key findings from this project:</p>\n<p>(1) We classified four fundamental swimming modes of cells with a single polar flagellum, which are named by push (forward run), pull (backward run), wrapping (flagellum coiled around the cell body), and overwhirling (flagellum bending toward the cell body and rotating about the axis of the cell body). We found that there exist corresponding critical thresholds of the magnitude of applied torques that separate wrapping from pull in clockwise motor rotation, and overwhirling from push in counterclockwise motor rotation, respectively.</p>\n<p>(2) We investigated swimming dynamics of <em>E. coli</em>, which is a peritrichous bacterium with multiple flagella distributed over the cell body and swims by rotating its helical flagella and executes a 3D random walk by alternating runs (forward straight swimming propelled by a flagellar bundle) and tumbles (random reorientation by motor reversals from counterclockwise to clockwise).&nbsp; In a bulk fluid, we demonstrated that flagellar bundling is influenced by flagellar distribution and hence the number of flagella. Moreover, the reorientation of cells is affected by the number of flagella, how many flagella change their polymorphisms within a cell, the tumble timing, different combinations of polymorphic sequences, and random motor reversals. Our simulations also revealed that material properties of the hook (a universal joint that links the motor and flagellar filament) and the counterrotation of the cell body are important factors for efficient flagellar bundling and that longer hooks in mutant cell models create instability and disrupt the bundling process, resulting in a limited range of movement. In the presence of a physical barrier, represented as a planar surface in our model, we demonstrated that microswimmers can explore environment near surface by making various types of tumble events as they swim close to the surface. In particular, we showed that the variation of tumble duration can lead the microswimmer to run in a wide range of direction. However, we also found that cells near surface stay close to the surface even after tumbles, which suggests that the tumble motion may not promote cells' escape from the confinement but promote biofilm formation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/23/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Sookkyung&nbsp;Lim</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1853591/1853591_10617838_1692818986524_Run_tumble--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1853591/1853591_10617838_1692818986524_Run_tumble--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Run-and-tumble\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1853591/1853591_10617838_1692818986524_Run_tumble--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Run-and-tumble\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Exemplary run-and-tumble motion of E. coli cell.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Wanho Lee</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sookkyung&nbsp;Lim</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Run-and-tumble</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1853591/1853591_10617838_1692818688930_Model--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1853591/1853591_10617838_1692818688930_Model--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Computational model\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1853591/1853591_10617838_1692818688930_Model--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Computational model\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A schematic view of the computational model for an E.coli with four left-handed flagella that are distributed over the cell body.
