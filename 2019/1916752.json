 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference is to held at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan from June 10-June14, 2019 and it will highlight the pioneering works of junior and senior mathematicians in geometry, topology, and dynamics from diverse communities. The conference will also seed the development of a community, with particular emphasis on stimulating the growth of young mathematicians via networking, professional development opportunities, and exposure to state of the art scientific content. The scientific program is organized both to foster communication between mathematicians from a class of underrepresented groups and to bridge divides between adjacent subjects in and around the areas of geometry, topology and dynamics. There are strong ties between low-dimensional topology and both symplectic and hyperbolic geometry. These subjects are in turn tied to Teichmueller theory, dynamics, and algebra, and differential geometry and algebraic topology permeate all of these subfields. There are many deep relationships between these different fields, and the conference aims to explore these ties and create new connections.\r\n\r\nThe conference is devoted to new developments and interactions between low-dimensional topology, geometry, and dynamics. The program spans geometric and algebraic topology, hyperbolic and symplectic geometry, the geometry and topology of surfaces, Teichmueller theory, geometric group theory, and dynamics. Highlights of topics covered include: the relationship between the hyperbolic structures on 3-manifolds and the algebra of their fundamental groups; the relationship between 3- and 4-dimensional geometric topology and the algebra of cobordism and concordance; the influence of combinatorial structures such as the complex of curves on the geometry of Teichmueller space; the foundations and geometry of symplectic manifolds; the interaction of algebra, arithmetic, and analysis in dynamics. The conference web page is http://www.math.wisc.edu/~kent/LG&TBQ.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
