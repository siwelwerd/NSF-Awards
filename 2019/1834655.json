The CMBE field is experiencing exponential growth, with the subfield of mechanobiology being a significant driver.\r\n\r\nThe conference program includes podium sessions with keynote and topical invited speakers, including both women and members of underrepresented groups. The primary objective of the meeting is to broaden the boundaries of current capabilities in cell and molecular bioengineering through pursuit of fundamental research, development of novel techniques and biological models, and translation of these discoveries into real-world technology and medical applications. The conference will introduce and integrate a diverse group of engineers and basic scientists possessing clinical and/or entrepreneurial experience. Invited speakers and keynotes will discuss how they bridge the gap between fundamental research and translation in their specific fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
