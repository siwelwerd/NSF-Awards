District leads, teacher leaders, and project researchers collaboratively designed a culturally relevant computer science and digital literacy curriculum focused on creating apps for community and social good. Each district identified their own CS curriculum adoption models. Lowell and Methuen have chosen to integrate the CS curriculum as part of their 8th grade Civics and other core courses. Schenectady City Schools established a district-wide CS implementation, with all seventh-grade students learning a half-year CS Pathways course developed through the project, as part of their information technology curriculum requirements. The CS Pathways curriculum has been implemented in 11 middle schools to a total of 3198 students. <br /><br />The project established community-centered professional learning that supported 40 unique teachers in co-designing and adapting the CS Pathways curriculum into their home subjects. Building on the project-level professional network, a \"district liaison\" model was created to sustain the professional support, with a classroom teacher who was promoted to the district level to serve in a coordinating role in each district. The liaison led monthly professional learning activities, provided ongoing support, and coordinated data collections with the project researchers. <br /><br />Teachers integrated CS into Civics, ELA, Math, Science, and Technology classes. We documented and shared the project's multiple-pathway approach to developing curriculum, with two major parallel pathways for technology- and CS-focused teachers (the Tech Pathway) and teachers integrating CS with civics action instruction ( the Civics &amp; CS Pathway) on the curriculum website (https://sites.google.com/methuen.k12.ma.us/cspathways). Both pathways include the foundation of students developing computer science projects for community and social good. Taking the Tech Pathway means following a 'traditional' sequence of lesson plans to learn how to design and program apps. To spark students' interest, they make apps that connect them to their local communities. Students learn design and programming concepts as they make increasingly more 'complex' apps that can connect them to others. Taking the Civics &amp; CS Pathway means learning to create apps as tools to make a difference in their community or for a group of people that they are actively part of and have civic responsibility for. Students learn app development skills and knowledge to make apps to help them meet that responsibility.<br /><br />Students who participated in research activities reported increased confidence in coding, creating apps, and creating apps that serve their own communities. Students reported mixed results related to interest in computer science. Our findings show that students of different racial/ethnic groups indicated significantly different attitudes, especially the Southeast Asian, African American, and Hispanic groups. Both male and female students reported positive experiences in learning how to create real apps serving their community. However, male students reported stronger interest and more positive attitudes overall than female students. <br /><br />The project reported findings in 13 peer-reviewed articles and presentations at international, national and regional conferences. The CS Pathways curriculum was disseminated through multiple workshops and CS education conference presentations. The project supported two doctoral dissertations. One study, titled \"Equipping Middle School Teachers with Culturally Responsive Pedagogy in Teaching CS Through Professional Learning: A Longitudinal Case Study,\" focused on teachers' professional learning, conceptual changes and enactments of culturally responsive pedagogy in teaching computer science. The other dissertation, titled \"Organizing Computer Science Curriculum Co-Design with Collaborative One-On-Ones: Negotiating Politicized Trust, Mutuality, and Data Agency in Ill-Structured Domains,\" examined RPP models for developing and implementing computer science curriculum. <br /><br />The project received the President's Distinguished Public Engagement Award at University of Albany in 2024. The project has been nominated by the university for the Campus Compact's Excellence in Community-Engaged Partnerships Award (https://compact.org), a national organization which recognizes outstanding higher education programs and initiatives that make meaningful impact by partnering with communities to address complex social issues.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/20/2024<br>\nModified by: Fred&nbsp;G&nbsp;Martin</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1923452/1923452_10641056_1734730235363_cspathways_image1_zoom_mtg--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1923452/1923452_10641056_1734730235363_cspathways_image1_zoom_mtg--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"CS Pathways Team Zoom Meeting\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1923452/1923452_10641056_1734730235363_cspathways_image1_zoom_mtg--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"CS Pathways Team Zoom Meeting\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">CS Pathways Team Zoom Meeting</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">CS Pathways Team</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Fred&nbsp;G&nbsp;Martin\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">CS Pathways Team Zoom Meeting</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1923452/1923452_10641056_1734730146442_cspathways_image2_workshop--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1923452/1923452_10641056_1734730146442_cspathways_image2_workshop--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Professional Learning Workshop with CS Pathways Teachers\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1923452/1923452_10641056_1734730146442_cspathways_image2_workshop--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Professional Learning Workshop with CS Pathways Teachers\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Professional Learning Workshop with CS Pathways Teachers</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">CS Pathways Team</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Fred&nbsp;G&nbsp;Martin\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Professional Learning Workshop with CS Pathways Teachers</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
