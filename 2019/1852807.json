 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce), The project aims to serve the national need of advancing the development of highly effective science and mathematics teachers.  Te project is led by Bryn Mawr College on behalf of the Philadelphia Regional Noyce Partnership (PRNP), a collaboration of nine institutions of higher education (Arcadia University, Bryn Mawr College, Community College of Philadelphia, Drexel University, LaSalle University, Saint Joseph's University, Temple University, University of Pennsylvania, and West Chester University, and the Philadelphia Education Fund).    Through a series of five conferences over fourteen months, this cohesive, focused professional development series will convene approximately 100 Noyce pre- and in-service secondary STEM teachers, and other Philadelphia-area STEM teachers.  Through the conference activities, these participants will gain the understanding and skills needed to \"Integrate STEM in Everyday Life,\" the primary theme of the year-long work.  It is anticipated that implementing a \"STEM in Everyday Life\" approach will increase the success of students in STEM classes.\r\n\r\nThe conference series aims to partner pre-service and in-service teachers to develop non-traditional curriculum units that are both inquiry-based and place-based, using the students' cultural and physical environment as the source of student research and data collection.  Educators will be supported in thinking intentionally about areas of their students' lives in which learning STEM concepts would be highly motivating.  Examples of such areas include sports, food and nutrition, health and safety, music, and transportation.  The workshop participants will design and develop learning experiences that engage their students in exploring how STEM concepts and practices intersect with language arts, history, and fine arts, as well as how STEM affects their lives and influences their decisions.  In this conference series, teachers will be challenged to develop engaging place-based, project-based units that not only align with the Next Generation Science Standards and the Common Core State Standards, but also to place STEM teaching in socio-scientific and cultural contexts.  In addition to the member institutions of the PRNP, this project will reach out to institutions of higher education in the Philadelphia region who have not had Noyce programs and introduce students and faculty from these institutions to the Noyce network.  Furthermore, the project will disseminate what is learned through this work in publications and presentations at national professional meetings.  This project has the potential to advance instructional skills of teachers in developing and implementing placed-based curricular units that use the surrounding communities as their laboratories.  Thus, learning environments can be extended from inside school walls into the community, while simultaneously bringing cultural and community stakeholders into the world of schools.  This interchange has the potential to open new relationships within each community along STEM, cultural, and community lines.  The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Philadelphia Regional Pre- and In-Service Teacher Conference Series on Integrating STEM in Everyday Life brought together science, technology, engineering and math pre and in-service teachers to explore an instructional practice called the socio-scientific issues (SSI) approach. The project kicked off with a day long conference that was attended by approximately 100 educators.  29 teachers were then recruited to participate in a professional learning community and met in teams six times during the year to develop lessons, learn about SSI as well as how to implement it in their classrooms.  They met in between the workshops with their teammates and coaches to continue the learning, planning and reflection on the lessons they taught.  The project wrapped up with another day long conference where the participating teachers lead workshops for other teachers, sharing their knowledge and skills about SSI and spreading their enthusiasm for teaching STEM through an approach that both engages students and applies their subject content to real life challenges.  \n\nSSI is a unique and engaging approach to teaching focused on teaching subject areas through issues that are important to students and that could have an impact on their lives.  An example of a socio-scientific issue in the city of Philadelphia would be the soda tax.   How does having a soda tax impact your life? Most students like to drink soda.  Now that there is a tax, soda has become more expensive.  The goal of the soda tax was primarily to discourage people from drinking soda, but also to gain revenues.  Should government be telling people what is good for them or not?   Students are encouraged to find out about the tax through exploring media sources that are credible and are given criteria to determine how to distinguish between facts and opinions. The science (both biology and chemistry) and math part comes in as students study the chemical nature of sugar, how it impacts the human body, what kinds of diseases might it put people more at risk of getting? How big a risk is it and is the risk the same for all populations of people?  Students are then encouraged, once they have the facts and evidence to back them up,  to create an argument that they can share with others so that they can be heard and also can listen to others.  Learning about how to be open to multiple perspectives is a key part of the socio-scientific issues approach. Learning to be both critical thinkers as well as empathetic listeners are important skills to learn if we are to live in community.  Applying the STEM knowledge you learn in school to the decisions you make about your life makes learning STEM more meaningful and engaging.  \n\nThere are many such topics that connect to the SSI approach that students might be interested in that specifically impact their lives and the people in their community.  Many topics lead to questions about social justice like, \"why isn't there a supermarket in my neighborhood\" or \"why is it that in my school I can't drink from the water fountain?\",  etc.  Both students and teachers are invigorated by these types of questions and finding the answers to them in a systematic way that involves finding evidence that supports any claims you make and being able to listen fully to know when others are either doing the same or just sharing a misconceived opinion is a critical skill that all citizens should have if we are to live in a just, equitable and sustainable world.  Learning STEM should have a broader impact than having a head full of facts or formulas.  Learning STEM should make life more understandable, easier to navigate and the world a kinder, more respectful place to live for all.    \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/05/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Victor J Donnay"
