 "awd_abstract_narration": "As computing has become integral to the practice of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), the STEM+Computing program seeks to address emerging challenges in computational STEM areas through the applied integration of computational thinking and computing activities within STEM teaching and learning in early childhood education through high school (preK-12). This project is supported by the STEM+C program and will advance its mission by convening a capacity-building workshop to examine the relationships between computational thinking and the rapidly developing field of synthetic biology. The workshop and associated convenings will bring together key researchers, educators, curriculum developers, and education policy makers to discuss educational issues and priorities related to the interdisciplinary field of synthetic biology at the K-16 level. The project will pursue the following outcomes: (1) Identification of key issues relating to the teaching and learning of synthetic biology and computational thinking in K-16 education; (2) Examination of the potential ethical issues associated with synthetic biology; and (3) Development of a framework that will allow researchers to articulate possible interactions between biodesign in their future research, and applications. It is expected that these outcomes will provide a framework for student learning and teaching of biodesign, the design of learning tools and lab spaces, and discussion points around ethics.  The project will also host a conference panel that will be streamed online for public dissemination during and after the workshop. \r\n\r\nThe workshop will bring together for the first time science educators, learning scientists, computer science educators, biodesigners and artists, and science center and community laboratory directors who have expertise in biology, design, computing, and K-16 education to articulate key issues and topics that take into account the complex ways these different areas intersect. Based on recent commercial developments, it is clear that design and biology can be integrated and computational thinking can play a central role in linking them. So far, researchers and educators in computational thinking and synthetic biology have conducted research and development in isolation from one another, often publishing in different journals without the benefit of knowing how their work intersects. Likewise, biology education researchers have been subdivided into those focusing on synthetic biology applications and those focusing on attitudes about bioengineering in science education. This workshop will bridge the divides and promote discussions among these groups in order to determine how biology, design, and computational design can intersect in synthetic biology. The workshop is intended to promote a greater understanding of opportunities and challenges associated with computational thinking, synthetic biology and biodesign that will prepare student audiences for a world in which biology-based design solutions to problems in health, energy, and the environment will be a part of their 21st-century STEM education.  Among the issues to be discussed are the following: 1. Learning: What do we need to know about student prior understanding about biology and computational thinking at different age levels? What are promising instructional approaches? What tools could be used for assessment? How much do students need to know about biology and computational thinking before engaging with synthetic biology? 2. Teaching: What are appropriate activities that are accessible and feasible for K-16 students? What is the best way to engage teachers to broaden their participation in implementing synthetic biology education? What prior knowledge is needed for teachers to feel ready to teach synthetic biology? How can teachers connect with one another to share best practices? What are the main differences between a computational and synthetic approach to biology and traditional life sciences education? 3. Tools: What kind of laboratory, synthesis, analysis and simulation frameworks do we need to design to support synthetic biology activities? How much training or exposure to the tools is required for a teacher to feel empowered to use them in the classroom? How easy are the tools to access and use? What can be learned from the design of interfaces and coding environments to support computational thinking in synthetic biology? How can we lower tool costs so that more students can engage with synthetic biology? 4. Spaces: Where are the types of environments that can host learning opportunities for biodesign, whether classrooms, community labs or competitions? How can we create better connections between these learning spaces? What new spaces can be cultivated for synthetic biology activities that are not being considered now? 5. Ethics: What are the pressing critical issues in biodesign? How do these issues affect society, specific populations, and the environment? What are the best ways to engage students in these discussions? How can discourse around these topics be sustained? 6. Safety and Security: What are main safety and security concerns in biodesign, and what concerns can we expect to emerge over time? How best to engage students in discussions? What best practices need to be followed in the classroom to keep students and teachers safe? Are students empowered to be safety advocates after completing the activities? What kind of considerations are necessary when computational designs (i.e., DNA constructs, genetic circuits) move from software to wetware and realized with lab activities?\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
