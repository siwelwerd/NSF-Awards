 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly funded by the Chemical Instrumentation (CRIF) program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program. Professor Rory Waterman from the University of Vermont & State Agricultural College (UVT) and colleague Matthew Liptak are acquiring an X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer. This spectrometer is used in various fields including chemistry, biology, and physics. The spectrometer allows observation of transitions when electrons in a magnet field are irradiated with microwaves. The spectrum obtained gives valuable information about the composition of a sample. This information provides insight on the environment near the atom and the properties of the system. For example, the instrument is used to rapidly screen candidate materials for photovoltaic devices to optimize solar cell efficiency. The instrument is housed and managed at the University of Vermont. It provides service to researchers across Vermont as well as a broad swath of New England and upstate New York. The instrument is used to train undergraduate and graduate students in research and in lecture and laboratory courses preparing them for the modern workforce. It also impacts high school students since UVT has programs in place to foster this early STEM education interaction. \r\n\r\nThe project is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. The instrument is used in several research projects. The mechanism of heme oxygenation by iron enzymes is under investigation.  Electron-transfer reaction of transition metal complexes are currently being explored. The spectrometer is used to study vanadium oxidation catalysts and the mechanism of spin exchange in organic magnetic semiconductors. The redox behavior of selenium containing compounds is under investigation. Another research area is the discovering of new bond-forming catalysis for the main-group elements.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

EPR spectroscopy allow for the detailed understanding of molecules, materials, and biological samples with unpaired electrons, and this instrument, in particular, has an optical cavity to allow for photoexcitation of samples during collection of EPR spectra. Despite pandemic challenges, the instrument was delivered, installed, and commissioned in a timely fashion, and the supplier and UVM staff worked tirelessly to provide training to researchers and students. We look forward to welcoming more regional colleagues and local companies to use the instrument at no cost, expanding the research, workforce, and economic development benefits of this instrumentation well beyond UVM. Initial studies that have been enabled by this instrument include better understanding of factors that influence various illnesses in humans, degradation of toxic materials, more efficient use of limited phosphorus resources, catalysis, and biologically relevant molecular chemistry. The instrument both supports on-going projects in new ways as well as has enabled new reseach projects not perviously possible. Some aspects of the research that has been enabled by this instrument has appeared in peer-reviewed literature as well as dissemination in conferences and seminar presentations. Because the lifetime of this instrument is estimated at 12-15 years and UVM has an excellent track record of maintaining federally funded equipment beyond average lifetime, we anticipate many years of productive science and student training through hands-on experience with this EPR spectrometer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/24/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Rory&nbsp;Waterman</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1919417/1919417_10623809_1666592741462_20210614_082819--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1919417/1919417_10623809_1666592741462_20210614_082819--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"EPR spectrometer\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1919417/1919417_10623809_1666592741462_20210614_082819--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"EPR spectrometer\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Installed and operational EPR spectrometer</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Rory Waterman</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Rory&nbsp;Waterman</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">EPR spectrometer</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
