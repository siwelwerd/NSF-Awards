 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers have long sought to understand the emergence and development of the distinctive pastoral ways of life characteristic of central Eurasia. Many inhabitants of this enormous territory have been sustained for thousands of years by herding sheep, goats, cattle, and horses. The animal herds must be moved continually to fresh pastures in a pattern that often precludes the establishment of permanent residences. The relationship of such subsistence systems to sedentary agriculture or to highly mobile foraging for wild resources is poorly understood. The possibility that specialized herding may have developed directly from mobile foraging rather than as an adaptation complementary to sedentary farming is especially interesting and little investigated. Under the supervision of Dr. Robert Drennan and Dr. Loukas Barton, Jennifer Farquhar will investigate the role of hunter-gatherers in the development of mobile pastoralism in the desert-steppe region of Mongolia. The study focuses on patterns of mobility across the entire economic and social transition from small-scale egalitarian societies some 7000 years ago to the more complex larger-scale sociopolitical integration of the Bronze Age some 2500 years ago. Mobility is critical to both foraging and herding modes of production. Its study provides not only important insight into how settlement strategies changed with the addition of domestic animals, but also puts in context other aspects of social life including patterns of social interaction, hierarchy, and differential access to material wealth, prestige, production, and ritual. Models from evolutionary ecology will be used in the effort to understand better how hunters and, later on, herders distributed themselves within habitats, identifying changes in how, when, and why people moved. The evaluation of these models will contribute to our understanding of the nature of human decision making as well as of the mechanisms of behavioral change. Application of these models over the past two decades has led to advances in understanding a range of phenomena including the origins of agriculture and the emergence of institutional inequality.\r\n\r\nMs. Farquhar will carry out systematic regional-scale survey in the Ikh Nart Nature Reserve in southeastern Mongolia to identify locations where the ephemeral remains of highly mobile hunters and herders can be found, and to collect samples of these materials for study. The research is a central part of Ms. Farquhar's doctoral training and will provide field training and experience for both U.S. and Mongolian students. Cooperation among US and Mongolian team members in field work, laboratory analysis, and interpretation will encourage the exchange of people, ideas, and information in order to promote outcomes that reflect the goals and values of all participants. A collaborative approach to public outreach to local herding communities and the large urban center of Ulaanbaatar will contribute to the goals of Ikh Nart Nature Reserve and the national government to promote environmental management and resource conservation, topics of particular concern in light of recent declines in both natural and cultural resources in the face of unprecedented extraction.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Known primarily throughout parts of Eurasia, Africa, and South America, pastoralism is a migratory subsistence economy in which people make their living by tending herds of domesticated animals (e.g., sheep, goats, cattle, horses, donkeys, llamas, alpacas, camels, yaks, reindeer) to provide meat, milk, wool, hides, dung, and transportation. Pastoral economies are found in a range of environments where climate and topography set limits on agricultural production including deserts, desert-steppes, mountains, and tundra.</p>\n<p>For decades, research on the origins of pastoralism has been stymied by the \"steppe and sown\" dichotomy that preserves long held stereotypes of farmers and herders and assumes agriculture as a precondition for mobile pastoralism. Recent archaeological perspectives, however, have revealed more complex evolutionary processes, highlighting variability in environmental adaptation, economic organization, subsistence, and social interactions. These studies show the adaptive nature of pastoral societies as complex, flexible, and resilient social constructs that developed in response to dynamic and sometimes extreme climate conditions. These investigations have expanded our understanding of the role of non-agricultural traditions (e.g., hunter-gatherer societies) in the development of food producing economies.</p>\n<p>In Mongolia, research has started to generate important insight about the varied natural and social contexts of hunters and early herders though we still have little information about how foraging societies contributed to the development of herding, limiting our understanding of the causes significant social change.</p>\n<p>Under the supervision of Dr. Robert Drennan, Jennifer Farquhar (doctoral candidate) investigated the role of hunter-gatherers in the development of mobile pastoralism in Mongolia's desert-steppe. The study examined patterns of land use, residential mobility, technological organization, and environmental context prior to, during, and after the transition to food production (Bronze Age, ca. 4500 BP) to detect differences in how, when, and why people moved, illuminating how people make decisions about existing environments.</p>\n<p>Research was conducted at the Ikh Nartiin Chuluu Nature Reserve (Ikh Nart) located in the Dornogovi aimag in southeastern Mongolia. The project involved systematic survey of three distinct environmental zones (ancient lakebed, upland, and lowland zones) covering an area of 1,225.44 ha, and laboratory analysis of materials recovered from the survey and select excavations in the reserve. Artifacts collected from the survey and excavations represent 290 distinct habitation sites of highly mobile hunters and herder communities spanning the Neolithic-Kitan Periods (ca. 8000-800 BP), making it possible to compare adaptive strategies of mobile people across the Neolithic-Bronze Age transition when people are thought to have shifted from a foraging economy to one based on animal domestication.</p>\n<p>The study revealed that both Neolithic foragers and Bronze Age herders employed short-term residential mobility to target resources across upland and lowland settings, showing that foraging lifeways were amenable to early mobile pastoralists. By the Bronze Age, mobility was more constrained with increased recurrent site use and population consolidation in upland settings. Persistence of these patterns after the Bronze Age suggests that preferences of committed herding societies (Iron Age [ca. 3000-2300 BP]and beyond) were firmly established during the Bronze Age as people began to prioritize upland grasslands and productive wintertime vegetation. This shift coincided with the development of dry, cool conditions, a reversal of wetter, cool environments where prior foragers exploited a broad range of habitats, including wetlands.</p>\n<p>The study concludes that shifts in land use and mobility during this period were not the product of population pressure resulting from external forces (e.g., an influx of new people) but rather reflect an abrupt change in habitat choice of mobile people. Findings correspond to other regional research that suggests intensified human-environment interactions within the uplands during this period resulted in the enhancement of grassland habitats. Together, the data signal that these altered or constructed grassland habitats may have encouraged serial reuse by early herding populations. While heightened mobility may have discouraged the depletion of important pasture resources, population consolidation may have increased levels of unpredictability as people vied for scarce resources and contended with increasing rates of interaction and resource depletion. These conditions set stage for the development of adaptations that came to define mobile pastoralism across Eurasia including high residential mobility, long distance connections, social differentiation, and broadly adopted mortuary traditions.</p>\n<p>The project assembled a team of 24 highly qualified professionals, students and volunteers from all over the world including Mongolia, the US, China, Kazakhstan, the UK, and Australia. Importantly, the project provided an opportunity to strengthen an ongoing partnership with faculty and students from Mongolian education institutes.
