 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding how plants respond to pathogens is critical for maintaining a robust food supply.  Key to this response is the movement of RNA, a type of genetic information, from one part of the plant to another.  However, detailed understanding of how RNA moves in plants is not well understood due to the small amounts of transiting RNAs.  In addition, nearly all of our knowledge comes from research on short-lived plants and very little is known about long-lived trees due to the time it takes to grow and study them. The discovery of a novel virus-like RNA (called CYVaV) that infects virtually all citrus varieties provides an unparalleled opportunity to explore the biology of trees and the movement of RNA in plants.  CYVaV accumulates to high levels in tree veins and moves in the absence of specific virus-produced \"movement\" proteins.  Since CYVaV RNA must use the trees molecular machinery to move its RNA, it is an ideal system to study RNA movement.  This project uses CYVaV to develop technologies to understand the movement of RNAs in plants.  In addition, CYVaV may enable researchers to introduce genetic elements in trees.  An important broader impact is the possibility of using CYVaV as a vehicle to combat the bacterial disease Citrus Greening by targeting the bacteria and the insect depositing the bacteria.  This could help save the US citrus industry from Citrus Greening.\r\n\r\nRecent revelations that 50% of the companion cell (CC) transcriptome is moving long distances through sieve elements (SE) have elicited numerous questions concerning how and why this migration of mRNAs is occurring.  Answering key questions on intracellular and intercellular movement of mRNAs requires a model system consisting of an abundant mobile RNA, whose location can be traced in living tissue under different cellular conditions. The recently discovered Citrus yellow vein associated virus (CYVaV) is a highly unusual virus-like RNA that traffics bi-directionally through the phloem of all commercial varieties of citrus and laboratory host Nicotiana benthamiana in the absence of encoded movement proteins (MPs), coat protein or silencing suppressors.  This project develops CYVaV as a model for transiting mRNAs using MS2 CP and &lambda;N22 systems and as a VIGS vector to study effects of altered gene expression in citrus phloem.   CYVaV causes few if any symptoms on citrus although it accumulates to levels detectable on ethidium-stained gels in infected plants.  This should allow for high level expression of small RNAs, with the initial goal of down regulating CC callose synthase, which causes callose deposition in SE during stress or pathogen invasion.  Since CYVaV should have no host-MP specific incompatibility, it will also be examined for an extended host range in other woody plants and vines, which currently have no useable vectors.  By studying CYVaV movement and ability to serve as a VIGS vector, one broader impact of this work is using CYVaV to block the devastating effects of Citrus Greening.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSymptomless plant viruses have great potential as vehicles for delivery of therapeutics into long lived trees and vines as viruses can travel throughout a plant producing anti-pathogen agents where pathogens reside and insects feed.  All plant viruses to date code for proteins that allow them to migrate through plants, but these proteins limit the number of different plants that can be infected because they must interact with specific plant proteins that differ in different plants.  Developing virus delivery vehicles can take over a decade, and there are few, if any, for most trees and vines, despite a critical need as pathogens usher in the end of citrus trees, cacao trees, and possibly grapevine and many others within the next few decades, decimating industries in the US and economies of some developing countries.  This award was to study a novel virus-like agent that is unique in not requiring encoded movement proteins, but rather can use host proteins for movement.  This virus-like agent, known as CYVaV, is being developed into a delivery vehicle, and understanding how it is able to transit through plants in this unprecedented manner is critical for determining if it can be used to control pathogens in a wide range of trees and vines.  We discovered that CYVaV binds to host phloem protein 2 (PP2), which is a highly conserved protein in all plants and is known to help host mRNAs move through the vascular system (veins) of a plant.  We found that within minutes of adding CYVaV to sap containing PP2, small bundles appeared that protected CYVaV from harmful enzymes.  Surprisingly, this was very specific for CYVaV, which interacts with PP2 much more efficiently than do other viral RNAs.  CYVaV was found to infect an astonishingly broad number of plants, including (so far) citrus, grapevine, papaya, tomato, tobacco, and cucumber.   Virus-like RNAs that are closely related to CYVaV were also studied, which generate an additional protein that is likely a real movement protein.  In the absence of this additional protein, the relatives are still able to infect tobacco, but much less efficiently.  This result suggests that when CYVaV lost the ability to make this additional protein, it evolved to more efficiently use the host protein, a possibility that we continue to study.\n\n                While engaged in this work, we discovered that CYVaV infection of plants leads to the biogenesis of defective versions of itself that accumulate to extremely high levels within cells.  Preliminary results show that at least one defective RNA may be able to accumulate in the absence of CYVaV.  This is astonishing as the defective RNA can no longer generate the polymerase (replication enzyme) that it needs for replication, implying that it can also use a host enzyme for replication, which would be unpresidented.  These results are shedding light on the evolution of plant RNA viruses, which may have initially used host proteins for replication and movement before acquiring versions of these enzymes.  In the future, we will be examining what benefits these virus-like RNAs achieved from incorporating replication and movement proteins into their genomes, and for CYVaV, what was the benefit of losing the ability to make the movement protein.  In addition, CYVaV is currently being tested for its ability to control pathogens in citrus and grapevine as we develop it further into an exceptional pathogen-control agent.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/27/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anne E Simon"
