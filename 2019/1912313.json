 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Tennessee State University will enhance undergraduate education in the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) department to prepare students to meet the needs of the workforce related to the Internet of Things (IoT) or advanced studies in IoT. Undergraduate students are involved in the project as researchers. \r\n\r\nThe key goal of this project is the utilization of cyberlearning or technology tools to supplement and facilitate learning experiences to prepare students with the knowledge and skills required to meet the demand of the industry and the R&D community related to IoT. The project has the objectives to: improve the undergraduate curricula in several courses in the ECE program by integrating IoT theory and concepts; utilize technology tools to facilitate student IoT cyberlearning experiences to supplement curricular knowledge; and provide research experiences to undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
