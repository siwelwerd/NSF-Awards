 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fastest stars in the Galaxy are often referred to as hypervelocity stars (HVSs). These stars are excellent laboratories to study the extreme physics that accelerates stars. The stars are also key tracers of the Galaxy's elusive dark matter. Yet their origin and nature are still not well understood. With new data from the Gaia spacecraft, hundreds of these fast-moving elusive stars have been found. The investigator's primary goal to understand the origins and nature of HVSs. This project will also discover new HVSs using the next release of data from the Gaia mission. The chemical fingerprint of these fast-moving stars will also be measured to tag where they were born. The project will also measure the motions of these stars to constrain the mass of the Galaxy and determine the physics needed to accelerate stars to such high speeds. Each of these novel measurements will advance the field by providing key constraints of the origin of HVSs and use them to make inferences about the mass of the Milky Way and its dark matter halo. \r\n\r\nThe investigator will engage the public and train the next generation of our STEM workforce with an emphasis on under-represented minority students. The investigator will work with students from the TARUS program at the University of Texas. This program focuses on training minority students in various aspects of computer coding and research methods. This project, through TARUS, will provide underrepresented minority students technical expertise that can be transferable throughout STEM careers. The project will also advance public scientific literacy by creating an annual 'Stars on the Run' outreach night for Austin, TX area. This event will enable the public to learn about the fastest stars discovered by this project. It will also focus teaching the public about basic astronomical and physical principals. This will be done through an exciting set of lectures, demos, and night sky observing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These stars zipping through but largely unbound to the Galaxy contain vast information about its nature. Two of the key open questions behind these uniquely important and rare stars are: (1) how they are accelerated to their incredibly large velocities and (2) where do they originate from. The purpose of this proposal has been to search for and characterize the chemistry and dynamical properties of the fastest moving stars in the Galaxy in order to understand their origins. While theory predicts that these hypervelocity stars are created when binary star systems close to the supermassive black hole in the Galactic center are disrupted, it is unclear if the data supports this.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Intellectual Merit : Using the newest data from the Gaia spacecraft we have uncovered hundreds of candidate hypervelocity stars. This alone is an exciting result. However, our primary goal was not just to find them but identify where they have originated from and use that information to determine the physical mechanisms responsible for their high speeds. To achieve these aims, we used McDonald, Apache Point, and Las Campanas Observatories over the life of the grant to further constrain their properties and origins. Using one of the largest samples of high and hypervelocity stars characterized to-date, we derived the atmospheric parameters, chemical abundances for up to 22 elements, and orbital properties for these stars. Intriguingly, we find that the bulk of the solar-like hypervelocity stars are formed in either the stellar halo of the Galaxy or in other galaxies and accreted onto the Milky Way. Only minority of these fast moving stars are consistent with having been formed in the central region, as initially predicted by theory. The results enabled by this proposal highlight the importance of alternative theories for accelerating stars to high speeds. The results also illustrate how chemo-dynamic tagging as a technique can be used to answer astrophysical questions about a star&rsquo;s origin.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Broader Impacts: In addition to the exciting science conducted over the lifetime of the grant, there has been many educational opportunities for students that have been fully trained in astronomical data handling, computing, and astronomical observations. Additionally, the exciting results of this proposal were shared both in and outside of academia through conference talks, colloquia, and public lectures (e.g., the Aspen Center for Physics&rsquo; Heinz R.
