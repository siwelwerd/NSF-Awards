 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wind energy represents the largest growing energy source nationally and globally in terms of total added capacity; with an expected 8 GW coming online nationally in 2019 alone according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).  As the net penetration of wind energy increases, its random delivery of electricity makes it difficult to use as a demand-focused dispatchable resource within the electric power grid.  The proposed solution of the NSF ERC entitled Wind Integrated with Storage for Energy Resilience (WISER) is to integrate energy storage into the wind farm infrastructure to facilitate the economic delivery of energy on demand. The opportunity to address this challenge is enabled by recent emergent technologies, including the growing number of larger wind turbines, advances in autonomous control of wind energy, and, most importantly, new breakthroughs in chemistry, materials, thermodynamics, and energy economic analysis.  Developing and translating fundamental science in all these areas will allow more than 24 hours of average power to be stored in a single turbine.  Achieving this will require highly integrated multidisciplinary academic research and education as well as strong engagement with a wide host of industry partners, all of which will be considered in the planning grant for a new NSF ERC entitled Wind Integrated with Storage for Energy Resilience (WISER).  \r\n\r\nThe ERC planning grant for high penetration of wind energy integrated with storage will seek to uncover the key fundamental technical, economic, and societal questions using cross-pollination of ideas and concepts across these different fields.  These questions will set the stage for an ERC to develop a new generation of cost-effective wind storage by investigating compressed air energy storage, liquid metal batteries, and flow batteries directly integrated into extreme-scale turbines (10+ MW), wind farms, and the grid itself.  Achieving this will require new knowledge and breakthroughs in: a) the efficiency, formatting, and durability of storage and wind technology at extreme-scales, b) strategies to integrate and leverage storage with wind energy generation and grid infrastructure, c) effective use of autonomous power control for the integrated system dynamics, and d) market-based revenue design and adaptivity to optimize these systems for grid resilience and power demand.  The WISER planning grant will develop a globally- competitive diverse workforce through novel student internships, coursework, and pervasive engagement with the key industry alliances that will commercialize, manufacture, install and operate this technology. Through these profound impacts, the WISER ERC will provide a new generation of \"renewable energy on demand\" that will power increases in renewable energy penetration and enhance the resilience of the power grid.  More broadly, this will directly enhance the USA's energy independence, environment, infrastructure, workforce, and global manufacturing leadership.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe rapid global growth of wind energy offers extensive benefits to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  However, wind power intermittency (across multiple time scales) can introduce substantial mismatches with grid demand and associated grid reliability issues.  These issues are expected to be amplified as renewable energy penetration increases (as the grid is decarbonized).  Integrating energy storage with wind turbines provides a relatively low emissions technology approach to address the challenges of intermittency.  However, economic evaluations indicate that several proposed storage integrations are too expensive while others are not yet fully developed.  Moreover, community concerns (or even distrust) of installing local wind farms and energy storage systems have delayed or even halted such developments, highlighting another important barrier to consider.\n\nOur team developed a broadly defined co-design approach that considers wind energy and storage systems from a full socio-technical-economic-political viewpoint.  Such co-design can be used to address the coupled inter-related challenges of cost, technology readiness, system integration, as well as societal considerations of acceptance, adoption, and equity.  In particular, a successful design depends on the regional grid infrastructure and its demand variability, local and global grid decarbonization targets, available land and resources for system siting, policy and political constraints for energy development, as well as the projected regional and global impact on these systems on environment, jobs and communities.  A holistic socio-technical-economic-political co-design approach endeavors to consider all these aspects in concert to ensure wholesale benefits.  This approach concept can inform an iterative solution roadmap for the development of co-designed wind energy and storage. \n\n This work has been submitted as a journal manuscript and the team is working on integrating solar energy into this framework to broaden the impact.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/12/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric Loth"
