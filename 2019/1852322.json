 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rehabilitation engineering employs a systematic approach to the design, modification, customization and/or fabrication of assistive technology for persons with disabilities. Research efforts in rehabilitation engineering are focused on identifying and addressing problems critical to achieving and maintaining the highest possible level of function in areas related to mobility, communications, sensory (e.g., hearing, tactile, vision), and cognition and in activities associated with employment, independent living, and education. With a research focus on rehabilitation engineering, this ASPIRE REU program hosted by the Human Engineering Research Laboratories (HERL) in the University of Pittsburgh is to provide an exemplary mentoring and resourceful environment that enables undergraduate students to 1) transition from dependent to independent thinkers, 2) develop a sense of excitement about entering an engineering or technical field and 3) be well prepared for their future careers. \r\n\r\nIn this REU program, recruitment initiatives emphasize minorities and students with disabilities. Additionally, students who come from institutions with limited research opportunities will receive special consideration. Seminars, workshops, and field trips supplement the educational experience outside of the laboratories. Students in this REU Site are an active participant of a multi-disciplinary research team and acquire ownership of part of a larger-scale or pilot research project. Improving the quality of life for individuals with disabilities (Iw/D) is central to the mission of HERL, and this REU offers a unique and supportive environment for developing future research scientists and engineers. The REU experience allows participants to learn from experienced researchers and talented clinicians. These interactions will help them develop their own research skills and carry out future research topics that are important to the large population of Iw/D. HERL's research development objectives will deepen student's understanding related to rehabilitation robotics design, human-robot interaction, and technology transfer.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This program enables participants to engage in experiential learning within a world-class environment, collaborating with leading mentors in the field of rehabilitation engineering. Beyond the intrinsic societal contributions, the ASPIRE program serves as a dynamic platform for learning engineering and technology in a collaborative team setting, aiming to enhance the lives of individuals and foster inclusivity. ASPIRE's home within the Human Engineering Research Laboratories (HERL) exemplifies a convergence-based approach to research, development, and invention. The interdisciplinary team, comprising engineers, clinicians, scientists, and business professionals, creates a vibrant learning environment. Importantly, the inclusion of individuals with disabilities and veterans within the team enriches the ASPIRE experience, providing interns with valuable insights from lived experiences. The program not only lays the foundation for participants to evolve as leaders but also nurtures their passion and knowledge in their chosen fields, thereby influencing their professional trajectories. Students learned how to prepare and present - \"Elevator Pitch\", \"Scientific/Technical Paper\", and \"Scientific/Technical Poster\". All students presented their poster at the HERL \"Open House and Research Symposium\", which included members of the public, academic community, engineer/scientific community, and government leaders. HERL and the NSF-ASPIRE REU have gained recognition as leaders in rehabilitation technology, engineering, and accessibility. Over the years, ASPIRE has actively fostered partnerships with local and national organizations to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in engineering and health sciences.</p>\n<p>Some noteworthy achievements include:</p>\n<p>The ASPIRE Program has been used as a model to establish similar programs within the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Research and Development, leading to ten programs across the USA.</p>\n<p>Dr. Cooper, leader of ASPIRE, received the National Medal of Technology and Innovation from the U.S. President for his groundbreaking work in empowering millions of Americans through innovative wheelchair technologies and mobility devices.
