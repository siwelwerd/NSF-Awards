 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides participant support for the 41st Conference on Stochastic Processes and their Applications (SPA) to be held July 8-12, 2019 at Northwestern University in Evaston, IL. SPA is the largest research meeting in the field of probability and is considered as the premier and most prestigious international forum for the dissemination of new results in probability and random processes.  \r\n\r\nThe conference will feature a broad range of topics, bringing together both theoretical and applied researchers. In addition to plenary talks which include the most prestigious named lectures of the probability calendar, the meeting at Northwestern will feature several invited and contributed sessions. These will provide a platform for early career probabilists to present their work alongside the leading figures of the field. To encourage such important exchange, travel support for Ph.D students, junior researchers, women, and underrepresented minorities represents a large portion of the project. \r\n\r\nFull program details are available at the conference website: http://sites.math.northwestern.edu/SPA2019/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
