 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Molloy College to acquire a microscopy system with time-lapse, Z-stack and multichannel acquisition capability. The instrument will be a vital part of several research projects investigating a broad cross section of topics including molecular genetics, immunology, molecular biology, cell cycle biology, cellular physiology and developmental biology. Biology students participate in these research projects as part of their education and training at Molloy. High school students are incorporated into the research groups through a high school internship program allowing for undergraduates to gain valuable mentoring experience. The high school students enter local, regional and national science competitions in line with Molloy's mission-directed goal of assisting high school districts in promoting a keen interest in science among their student body. In addition to research activities, the equipment will be incorporated into several courses in the Biology, Chemistry and Environmental Studies Department which will expose a majority of the biology and environmental studies majors as well as the biology education majors of the College to the many cutting-edge imaging techniques it supports. The use of this equipment in these research and training activities directly addresses the NSF goal of increasing the use of modern state-of-the-art research equipment by scientists and undergraduate students. The STEM initiatives currently in place at Molloy such as the New York State Collegiate Science and Technology Entry Program (CSTEP), ASPIRE to Careers in Science project funded through the NSF S-STEM mechanism and the NSF-sponsored Molloy College Noyce Ambassadors program will be strengthened.  Students will receive advanced training in science that will ultimately make them more competitive for summer positions, research internships, civic engagement opportunities and careers in the biological sciences. \r\n\r\nThe acquisition of this equipment will improve the efficiency and productivity of ongoing and planned research projects that will further understanding of 1) mesenchymal stem cell function during immune responses 2) maintenance of genomic stability in multicellular organisms           3) epigenetic mechanisms in neuron formation 4) cytoskeletal organization during microglial phagocytosis 5) hepatocyte triglyceride storage 6) yeast models of neurodegeneration and, 7) morphological and molecular dynamics of stem cell differentiation into normal vertebrate tissues during development. Results of these projects will be disseminated in peer-reviewed publications and through presentations at regional and national scientific meetings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
