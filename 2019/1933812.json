 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Dryad Digital Repository (datadryad.org) is a popular general purpose repository for datasets predominantly, though not exclusively, from the biosciences. Since 2009, Dryad has published 28,000 research datasets that represent over 900 academic journals. By curating data from a broad diversity of scientific studies, quality research data are now available around the world. Dryad's open licensing of published research data promotes discover-ability and access of research findings, which enables the reuse and reproducibility of an ever-increasing collection of diverse and high-quality data to advance research and education. Datasets in Dryad are indexed for easy discovery, freely reusable, and cite-able. Dryad has been broadly adopted by the biological community with more than 3 million downloads. The data packages submitted to Dryad are diverse in format and scientific content. Two key distinguishing features of Dryad are: the ease with which researchers can deposit their datasets through the integrations Dryad has with over 140 journals, and the curation applied across all submitted datasets in accordance with the FAIR principles for data repositories (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). However, the reach and impact of Dryad goes far beyond the set of journals that have direct integrations. Over the past 10 years, Dryad has allowed hundreds of journals to give their data policies teeth and 96,000 researchers a resource for funder and publisher mandate compliance. \r\n\r\nDryad is a membership-based 501c3 non-profit and membership-led organization that provides transparent governance by the community of stakeholders (including scientific societies, publishers, institutions, and others) to ensure the continued free availability of the research data entrusted to it. Dryad is working in partnership with California Digital Library to build wider institutional support and a more robust longevity plan. This project will provide limited support for the curation, preservation, and access of research data at Dryad, with the goal of Dryad becoming a self sustaining service. With this support, Dryad is on track to reach sustainability within three years at which the operational costs of running the organization are fully funded by Data Publishing Charges and membership fees. The Dryad Digital Repository may be accessed at https://datadryad.org.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
