 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Enabling Discovery through Genomic Tools (EDGE) program was established in 2016 to provide tools, approaches and associated infrastructure that are critically needed to directly test gene function in diverse non-canonical model organisms.  Funds are provided to support the participation of the scientific leaders and key personnel of currently funded EDGE projects in a one-day EDGE awardee meeting to be held on April 29, 2019 in Alexandria, VA. This inaugural meeting offers opportunities for EDGE project personnel to network and discuss the progress, pitfalls and long-term scientific and societal implications of these important resource development projects. In addition, participants will learn about and discuss novel strategies and best practices related to rapid and efficient dissemination of resources and knowledge gained from their respective projects. As all these projects have the common theme of potentially catalyzing larger communities of investigators with new techniques, this meeting will also provide an opportunity for participants to discuss how best to engage with and communicate project outcomes between research communities and to a broader public audience. It is the hope that this meeting will initiate a long-term dialog about the consequences of the use of novel techniques in non-canonical model systems, both for greater scientific insight as well as potential broader impacts for society.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
