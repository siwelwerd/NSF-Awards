 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part 1\r\nThe workshop will support efforts to build diversity and inclusion in the geosciences? workforce, by facilitating the replication and success of URM STEM research internship programs. The workshop will also continue and support the effort to strengthen collaborations between HBCUs and the geosciences research community, notably including the six public and private science institutions in Woods Hole.\r\nFurther, the workshop will provide an important career-building opportunity for graduates of URM geosciences research internship programs who participate and present, showcasing their successes and strengthening their relationships with colleagues. The workshop will produce a clear summary of best practices and next steps in the effort to connect undergraduate research programs with HBCUs to provide a supportive internship experience in a research community that is new to the students and often new to the faculty and advisors as well.\r\n\r\nPart 2\r\nThe proposed workshop promises to articulate a new, clearer understanding of how undergraduate internships can serve individual students of talent and how these programs can be more closely coordinated with and be truly collaborative with institutions like HBCUs. The goal of the proposed workshop is to strengthen undergraduate programs that seek to increase diversity in the geoscience?s workforce. Specific workshop objectives are (1) to review experiences, outcomes, successes, and shortcomings over the past ten years of URM Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REUs) programs, and the Woods Hole Partnership Education Program (PEP); (2) to identify best practices from these programs, in order to support their sustained success and replication; (3) to summarize these best practices in a report that will provide guidance to academic and other research institutions that seek to establish similar programs; and (4) to engage and connect program alumni with each other, and with peers and professionals in the research community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn celebration of the tenth anniversary of the Partnership Education Program (PEP) in Woods Hole, a workshop was held on June 27 &ndash; 29, 2019 to discuss ways to increase diversity and inclusion in the geosciences workforce.  The Workshop brought together former interns, administrators of research internship programs, and the directors of scientific organizations to share perspectives on how well current research internship programs are working and what can be done to make them more supportive and more effective in encouraging members of under-represented minorities to follow careers in the geosciences.\n\nThe Workshop focused on two topics:  (1) identifying potential roadblocks that discourage minority students from entering the geosciences and (2) identifying steps that can be taken to help students overcome those roadblocks.  There are many such roadblocks.  Not all of them can be solved by the research institution, but there are often ways that an institution can structure a research internship program so that it is a positive experience. \n\nKey points raised during this Workshop are:\n\nA well-structured research internship can be an effective way to increase diversity in the geosciences.  Conducting research demystifies science and introduces students to the joy of pursuing new knowledge. Frequent interactions with faculty show that scientists are human and approachable.  Explaining one\u2019s research builds a student\u2019s confidence that they could succeed as a scientist. For many of the former students who attended the Workshop, the research internship was a turning point in their lives and the point at which they decided to become a scientist.\nMinority students who have chosen to pursue a career in the geosciences still often feel isolated and uncomfortable on predominantly white campuses. To gain the full benefit of diversity, it is not enough to have some persons of color on a campus.  They must also feel welcomed into the community. To accomplish this, institutions should seek not only to address the needs of minorities on campus, but should help majority staff members understand, welcome and feel comfortable with new members from different backgrounds. \nStatements not intended to be hurtful or exclusionary may nonetheless be perceived as such by someone who has regularly experienced discrimination.  To encourage minority participation in the geosciences, one must accept these perceptions as real and work to minimize actions and statements that are hurtful, even if those actions and statements are well intentioned.  Dismissing negative reactions by saying \"You are too sensitive\" is in itself insensitive and shows a lack of willingness to understand the minority perspective.\nUndergraduate intern research programs can play a role in changing the culture of the institution hosting the program. Programs are not simply a mechanism for providing students with opportunity; the programs also provide opportunity for the hosting institution to learn about itself and for staff at hosting institutions to develop cultural competency and to learn how to be inclusive in teaching, mentoring, and conducting professional relationships. The undergraduate intern research programs should not be viewed as ten-week summer programs, but rather as year-round programs that are active in providing training and programming for the year-round community at the hosting institution.  \nTeaching research techniques is necessary but not sufficient to build diversity within the geosciences.  Internship programs can help to prepare students for scientific careers by exposing them to career-enhancing skills like public speaking, grant and report writing, how to apply for jobs and other \"soft\" social skills that help any person get hired.  \nSome of the most basic challenges faced by minority students may not be obvious to a person who grew up in the mainstream culture.  \nIt is important not to attempt to be \"color blind\" but to acknowledge and learn about issues that affect students of color interning at predominantly white institutions. Progress is being made.  Some research internship programs for minority students have been operating for more than a decade.  There is now a cadre of former interns who have continued on in scientific fields to get Ph.D.s or Masters Degrees.  They can serve as role models for new interns. Mentors are beginning to request students from the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program.  Change could be faster, but it is taking place.\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/12/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark H Long"
