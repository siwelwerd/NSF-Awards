 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Description: Microelectronics, which has propelled modern technologies to unprecedented levels, has been severely hampered by the intense Joule heating generated by the motion of electrical charge carriers.  A new approach exploits pure spin currents in devices that use a minimum of electrical charge carriers, thus generating minimal heat in metals and virtually no heat in magnetic insulators, which are charge-carrier free.  The spin Seebeck effect (SSE) allows one to generate a pure spin current from a temperature gradient in a magnetic insulator. The SSE, experimentally discovered only a few years ago, has lead to a burgeoning new field known as spin caloritronics, which offers new strategies for the conversion of waste heat to electricity as well as thermal management in electronic devices. This project, through close theory/experiment interactions, will focus on the fundamental understanding of the SSE effect and will explore new ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic insulators for advancing spin caloritronic phenomena and devices. \r\n\r\nTechnical Description: The proposed project will combine theory, characterization, and materials synthesis efforts to better understand spin caloritronic phenomena and devices.  The effort will be built on three key and interlocking elements. These include a theoretical understanding of the physics and issues associated with the spin caloritronic phenomena, measurement of spin caloritonic properties of a broad variety of single crystals of magnetic and antiferromagnetic insulators, and the fabrication of spin caloritronic thin films devices exploiting materials with superior properties.  By extending the fruitful research on topological insulators where the spin-orbit coupling is a critical factor and the theory of phonon-magnon interaction, Fiete will develop a microscopic theory for understanding physics associated with spin caloritronic phenomena.  He will also develop computational tools for screening and designing new materials for fabrication of spin caloritronic devices. The simulation work will cover the materials for generating spin current and metallic materials to convert spin current into electric potential with a high efficiency as well as the interface design. The project will capitalize on the extensive experience and expertise of Zhou in growing a broad range of bulk single crystals including ferrimagnetic rare earth iron garnets, double perovskites, spinels, antiferromagnetic layered materials with peculiar magnetic properties like uniaxial, easy-plane, biskyrmion, and pyrochlores. Earth abundant elements are prioritized in the computational screening and design for the spin caloritronic devices. The most challenging problems in the material synthesis, especially with Earth abundant elements, could be overcome by high-pressure synthesis.  The procedures, the fabrication, and measurement techniques for spintronic devices developed in Chien's laboratory will be used to study the performance of spin caloritronic devices made from these new materials. The experimental results will be compared with the computational model and provide new inputs to further refine the model. An iterative feedback loop will be formed among the co-PIs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this NSF funded project, the three supported faculty members and their respective research teams (consisting of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows) made significant fundamental science advances in materials that convert heat into electricity using a current of magnetism.  Prior to the funding of this project, one material system dominated the global study in this area.  Our faculty team, consisting of a theoretical physicist, crystal grower, and device expert discovered a new material and fabricated a device from it that opens a next chapter in the study of such heat-to-electricity converters.  The breakthrough required close collaboration between all the team members working in an interative feedback loop in which each component alternately supports and leads the others.  The new device has functional capabilities not present in any known system and allows new technology applications.  Moreover, the team has shown that the new material is but one representative of a broader class of materials, of which others have been shown to exhibit similar promise.  The work thus lays down a road map for the full path from fundamental materials discovery to device fabrication and commercialization in the area of \"spin caloritronics\"--a goal of the Materials Genome Project.\n\nDuring the course of this project, a new generation of researchers were trained in all technical aspects of the science underpinning the study.  They will bring their knowledge to other universities and industry, and will help lead science in the future.   During the entire course of the study, regular public outreach efforts were done to target those from elementary school to adult, and included specific efforts at historically under represented groups.  A website was also established to keep the public informed of the most important developments in the project.  All major research results were pubished in peer-reviewed journals available to the public.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/07/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gregory Fiete"
