 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly funded by the Chemical Instrumentation (CRIF) program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program. Professor Seann Mulcahy from Providence College and colleagues Christopher Laperle, Christopher Reid (Bryant University), Maria Carroll and Chin Hin Leung (Rhode Island College) are acquiring a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer to replace an older one. In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. A typical use by a chemist is to analyze the mixture from a reaction to determine the products. This instrument is an integral element of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate students at Providence College and neighboring Rhode Island College and Bryant College. It is also used in lecture and laboratory courses to prepare students for their careers. \r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. A variety of research projects are being investigated. One project involves studying the organic synthesis of nitrogen-containing heterocycles and the stereosymmetric preparation of beta-carboline atropisomers (stereoisomers arising because of hindered rotation about a single bond) for chemical catalysis and medicinal chemistry applications. Electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide is studied for possible remediation of the compounds. Another project is investigating solvation effects on prototypical iron pentacarbonyl-catalyzed photoassisted reactions to improve this procedure in organic synthesis. Functionalizable and degradable polymers for possible medicinal use and environmental applications are being investigated. Small molecule inhibitors of bacterial N-acetylglucosaminidases are being synthesized to foster understanding of cell wall metabolism.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
