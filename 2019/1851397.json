 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will examine the role of the interactions and energy exchanges between mesoscale eddies, submesoscale currents, and near-inertial and tidal internal waves (IWs) in determining global dissipation and mixing patterns in the ocean. The focus of the research is on the fundamental physics that governs the interactions, with specific applications to the California Current System. The California Current System is an eddy-rich eastern boundary upwelling region where energetic near inertial waves (NIWs) and tidal IWs (internal tides) have been previously observed and that will likely be used for NASA's Surface Water & Ocean Topography (SWOT) calibration and validation experiment. The approach will be to conduct a hierarchy of idealized and realistic state of the art numerical simulations in conjecture with in situ mooring observations for testing the realism of the models. The analysis will be based on numerical experiments of variable resolutions that systematically include and exclude tides and wind-forced NIWs. The PIs will engage in standard avenues for scientific communication, namely papers, seminars and presentations at society meetings. In addition, the proposed work will promote the career development of an early career scientist and support one postdoc, one PhD student and one MS student. The project will also support two summers of undergraduate research and the travel to the Coastal Ocean Environment Summer School in Ghana (coessing.org). This school, founded by one of the project team members, provides an opportunity for students from African countries to learn about oceanography.\r\n\r\nThe general circulation of the ocean is strongly constrained by the pathways that kinetic and available potential energy take from the basin-scale forces that inject them to centimeter scales, where they are depleted. To determine the ocean's response to future climate scenarios, these energetic pathways, from forcing to dissipation, must be understood and quantified. Previous studies have established the importance of mesoscale and submesoscale circulations to the kinetic energy route to dissipation, and of near-inertial and tidal IWs to the available-potential energy route to mixing, but a comprehensive study of the coupling between the two routes and the role of the eddy-wave interactions has not been carried out. Here the realistic simulations together with idealized simulations that will methodically investigate the interactions under variable stratification, rotation, and forcing magnitudes, will greatly advance the understanding of present and future oceanic energy distributions. The work will advance current understanding of ocean energetics, and will guide the development of diffusive parameterizations that take into account the combined spatiotermporal contributions of the different phenomena to energy mixing and dissipation. These parameterizations can be implemented in climate models and improve climate projections. In addition, this work will greatly ameliorate the interpretability of present and future satellite sea-surface height observations, whose analysis will be complicated by incoherent internal wave signals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Ocean surface winds can also generate internal waves, referred to as near-inertial waves. These waves have inertial periods larger than 12 hours, which depend on the latitude where they are generated. Internal waves fill the world&rsquo;s oceans and are important for redistributing wind and tidal energy. For example, &ldquo;internal tides&rdquo; generated at Hawaii propagate all the way to the U.S. Westcoast. The dissipation of these internal waves contributes to water mass mixing and the dispersal of tracers, such as nutrients and sediments. This mixing also plays an important role in the upwelling of the deep cold water, sustaining the global overturning circulation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Regional model simulations of coastal systems have generally been forced with surface tides and subtidal flows at the model boundaries, thereby ignoring the important contribution from these remotely generated internal waves. To study the impacts of remote internal waves on the dynamics along the U.S. Westcoast, we forced Regional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS) simulations with remote internal waves from a realistically forced global Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) simulation, in addition to the canonical surface tidal, subtidal, and atmospheric forcing. To resolve smaller scale motions in the ocean, we conducted a series of one-way nested simulations, in which we gradually reduced the horizontal and vertical gridspacing of the nested simulations in a series of steps: 1) HYCOM 8 km and 41 layers, 2) ROMS nest 1 with 4 km and 60 layers, and 3) ROMS nest 2 with 2 km and 100 layers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this project we have worked on three main topics. In topic 1 (Siyanbola et al, 2023), we study the sensitivity of the ROMS model boundaries to the high-frequency internal wave forcing and we compare the 4-km ROMS simulations to mooring and satellite altimetry observations. We use spectral techniques in separating ingoing and outgoing internal tides at the open boundaries to quantify wave reflections. In a perfectly constructed model set up, the internal waves that propagate towards the open ocean should be completely absorbed by the viscous sponge layers along the outer boundaries. This, however, is not possible. Through a series of tests, in which we tune the sponge viscosity and sponge layer width, we can minimize the reflections to about 15%. When we include remote internal wave forcing, the internal wave energy and their spatial patterns become more in agreement with mooring and altimetry datasets. The results further confirm that the energy at smaller wave scales is increased in our ROMS simulations when we force them with remote internal waves.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the second topic (Siyanbola et al, 2024), we study the fate of the remotely generated internal tides as they interact with the topography and the eddies of the California Current System in the 2-km ROMS simulations. We separate the internal tide energy fluxes into onshore and offshore propagating components. Overall, about 20% of the remote semidiurnal internal tide energy reflects off the coastal margin, 40% is scattered to internal waves with shorter wavelengths, and 7% is transmitted onto the shelf while the remaining is dissipated on the continental slope. Furthermore, our results reveal that differences in stratification, slope criticality, topographic roughness and angle of incidence cause these fractions to vary spatially and temporally along the U.S. margin. However, there is no clear seasonal variability in these estimates. Remote internal waves enhance the advection and diffusion of heat in the continental margin, resulting in cooling at the surface and warming at depth, and a reduction in the thermocline stratification. These results suggest that internal tides can cause water mass transformations in continental margins that are far away from their generation sites.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The research for the third topic is still in progress. In the 2-km ROMS simulations, we further explore how the internal tides and near-inertial waves in the U.S. Westcoast continental margin interact with the eddies of the California Current System. We consider the terms in the coupled internal wave &ndash; eddy energy equations. Some key findings are as follows. Both internal tides and near-inertial waves with shorter wavelengths drain energy from the eddies. At the same time, the eddies facilitate energy transfers from the longer to the shorter internal waves. These transfers are stronger for wind generated internal waves than for internal tides, i.e., eddies play a more important role in dissipating near-inertial than tidal internal waves.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Buijsman and Siyanbola have also collaborated with Barkan and Arbic teams, this has resulted in additional publications on wind-internal tide and wave-eddy interactions (Delpech et al., 2023, 2024).&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Broader of impacts.</span> This grant supported Buijsman's PhD student Oladeji Siyanbola, originally from Nigeria.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sinyanbola, 2023: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2022.102154<br />Sinyanbola, 2024: https://doi.org/10.1029/2023JC020859<br />Delpech, 2023:&nbsp;<span>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-32909-6&nbsp;<br />Delpech, 2024:&nbsp;https://doi.org/10.1175/JPO-D-23-0181.1&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 08/16/2024<br>\nModified by: Maarten&nbsp;Buijsman</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1851397/1851397_10593760_1723849878465_fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1851397/1851397_10593760_1723849878465_fig2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Model-data comparison\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1851397/1851397_10593760_1723849878465_fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Model-data comparison\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Ratio of mean modeled variance to mean mooring data variance, for (a) the spectra and (b) the temperature spectra for HYCOM and the ROMS simulations without (FS800a) and with (FS800b) remote internal wave forcing for three frequency bands.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Oladeji Siyanbola</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Maarten&nbsp;Buijsman\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Model-data comparison</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1851397/1851397_10593760_1723850861392_fig4--rgov-214x142.PNG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1851397/1851397_10593760_1723850861392_fig4--rgov-800width.PNG\" title=\"Temperature changes due to remote internal waves\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1851397/1851397_10593760_1723850861392_fig4--rgov-66x44.PNG\" alt=\"Temperature changes due to remote internal waves\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(a) Time&#8208;mean (01 October 2011\ufffd30 September 2012) and along&#8208;shore averaged temperature &#952; for the simulation without remote internal waves (NRIT).
