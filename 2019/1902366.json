 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Conference on Biology and Medicine through Mathematics will take place on May 15-17, 2019, at Virginia Commonwealth University. The conference will feature recent developments in the broad areas of mathematical biology and medicine. The conference will: (1) be a regional mathematical biology conference that promotes junior investigators that range from students, postdoctoral fellows, to junior faculty; (2) give visibility to a wide range of applications and methods in mathematical biology; and (3) provide a stimulating environment for networking between junior and senior researchers, fostered by the size of the conference (approximately 100 attendees). Scientific research of the highest quality from four plenary speakers will be showcased. In addition, there will be a mix of plenary talks, break-out networking sessions, and a poster session. Travel support will be provided to junior researchers.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide an intimate conference environment with opportunities to present a poster or give a seminar talk to researchers at all levels. Junior researchers will directly benefit from these opportunities because the travel award funds will help promote attendance by junior presenters. Given the diversity of the research topics (that includes topics from Ecology, Evolution, Epidemiology, Medicine, Neuroscience and Fluid Dynamics), students relatively new to research will have the opportunity to attend talks from many subfields. Moreover, this conference is an excellent opportunity for undergraduate and master's students from VCU and other regional institutions. Participation of women and underrepresented minorities in mathematics and science will be especially encouraged and supported. More information about this conference can be found at https://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/bamm/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
