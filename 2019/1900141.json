 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemical Catalysis Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry is supporting the research of Professor Thaliyil RajanBabu of The Ohio State University. Professor RajanBabu is developing efficient and selective reactions that can offer practical approaches to the synthesis of organic molecules for medicinal, agricultural, or material applications.  In this context, new reactions involving the use of abundantly available and sustainable feedstock starting materials such as ethylene, butadiene, isoprene, methyl acrylate, earth-abundant metals such as cobalt and nickel, and ligands that bind to those metals are being examined.  This research is solving two significant challenges in this area, namely, activation of stable molecules and their subsequent selective incorporation into other molecules. It is also providing outstanding opportunities for fundamental discoveries in chemistry.  The interdisciplinary nature of this research, which covers the areas of organic, inorganic and organometallic chemistry, and employs the techniques from analytical, physical organic, and computational chemistry, also provides a useful platform for training undergraduate and graduate students.  The RajanBabu group is involved in outreach activities with Columbus public schools, the Ohio Science Olympiad, and the REEL (Research Experiences to Enhance Learning) program at OSU. The later is transforming the undergraduate laboratory experience by incorporating state of the art instrumentation and providing experience on the use of this instrumentation to solve challenging chemical problems.  Other outreach activities of Professor RajanBabu include giving lectures at universities including predominantly undergraduate institutions, industrial research centers, and conferences.\r\n\r\n1,3-Dienes and enynes are classes of readily accessible substrates that have been used only rarely as precursors in intermolecular asymmetric C-C and C-G (G = a main group element) bond-forming reactions.  The RajanBabu group recently reported the first examples of highly enantioselective cobalt(I)-catalyzed heterodimerization of a diene and an acrylate.  A study of the reaction mechanism points to a new highly reactive low-valent cationic cobalt (I) species as a possible catalyst for this reaction.  Preliminary results suggest that there are other reactions that could be catalyzed by a similar species.  The RajanBabu group is developing these reactions, including asymmetric hydroboration, hydrosilylation, and hydroacylation.  The proposed research is providing powerful tools for more efficient and selective synthesis of biologically relevant targets and their congeners, and adding to our repertoire of environmentally benign processes.  At a fundamental level, the scope and limitations of these reactions and their mechanistic studies are revealing new ways of achieving chemo-, regio- and stereoselectivities of important organic reactions. The REEL program at OSU is introducing an advanced kinetic experiment using in situ IR spectroscopy to the undergraduate laboratory.  The experiments are carefully chosen so that all students from a small class can collect data individually for a few minutes from an on-going reaction (borohydride reduction of a ketone, for example), and, do the kinetic analysis later, before submitting a full report for evaluation.  This is introducing them to kinetics and spectroscopy, two topics in which few of our students currently get practical training in their regular laboratory classes, even though these topics are mainstays in both physical and organic chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n(NSF CHE 1900141 Final Report Nov 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\nA recent analysis concluded that about a third of the compounds whose biological assays were analyzed had at least one chiral center. During the discovery phase, chemists need methods that are broadly applicable and tolerant of functional groups, allowing for maximum diversification of a newly discovered active compound. Practical aspects of manufacturing from readily available precursors using scalable, environmentally benign, and highly selective chemistry become important at later stages of development of a drug or an agrichemical. Thus, discovery of highly efficient and enantioselective (i.e., selectively making only one of the mirror-image forms) catalytic methods for the preparation various classes of organic compounds is among the most fruitful (and challenging) areas of research in modern organic synthesis. Successful outcome of such research, especially when it involves catalytic reactions between readily available, and sustainable starting materials and feedstock carbon sources, can greatly impact the design, synthesis and manufacture of molecules of interest from medicine to materials. Alkenes are among the most abundant starting materials for organic synthesis and hydrofunctionalization reactions of alkenes such as hydroformylation, hydrocyanation and Shell Higher Olefin Process (oligomerization of ethylene) form the basis of a very large segment of the chemical industry, and new such reactions are always in demand. During this project we discovered several new highly selective cobalt-catalyzed hydrofunctionalization reactions of dienes, alkenes and alkynes, in addition to reactions between these pi-systems. Major aims of this project have been the development of enantioselective versions of coupling reactions between stable reaction partners such as simple alkenes, 1,3-dienes, alkynes and readily available aromatic and aliphatic carbonyl derivatives. We are also interested in common hydrofunctionalization reagents such as a dialkoxy boranes and silanes for the synthesis of chiral intermediates from alkenes and 1,3-dienes. All these reactions present significant challenges on two fronts, activation of the relatively unreactive precursor molecules and selectivity (chemo- regio- and enantioselectivity) in the reactions between them. During the past NSF funding period, the reactions we discovered include ligand-dependent, regioselective hydroborations of 1,3-dienes, and, highly selective [4+2]- and [2+2]-cycloadditions between 1,3-dienes and alkynes. We also discovered new reactions between 1,6-enynes and feedstock carbon sources such as acrylates and aromatic carbonyl compounds for the synthesis of 5- and 6-membered carbo- and heterocyclic compounds in excellent overall yield and enantioselectivity. The enynes are involved in highly efficient multi-component reactions that include uncommon C-H activation processes that may have broader applications in synthesis. The products of these reactions should provide easy access to medicinally relevant class of compounds such as pyrrolidines, piperidines and tetrahydrofurans.\n\n\nIn addition to the value of this chemistry for the synthesis of highly versatile chemical intermediates, mechanistic information that we have uncovered during the course of these investigations can be expected to have broad implications in homogeneous catalysis, especially by complexes derived from earth-abundant cobalt salts. The interdisciplinary nature of this research has provided a very fertile ground for training students at all levels.\n\n\nSix PhD students (including two females) received full or partial support from the NSF funding. One postdoctoral fellow and one undergraduate student have also participated in this research, and one honors thesis was generated from the work performed in the area of Co-catalyzed [2+2]-cycloadditions. \n\n\nDuring the past 4 years, the results originating from this work have been disseminated through several invited or plenary lectures by the PI, and, through several contributed presentations by students at ACS meetings (5). Since 2020, 10 papers in top-tier journals (J. Am. Chem. Soc., Acc. Chem. Res., ACS Catalysis, Dalton Trans.) have acknowledged the current support by NSF.
