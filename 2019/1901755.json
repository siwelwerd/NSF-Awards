 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support selected U.S. computing science education researchers, practitioners, and graduate students to attend the Special Interest Group in Computer Science Education (SIGCSE) first Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) Global Computing Education Conference (CompEd 2019). CompEd 2019 is to be held May 17-19, 2019 in Chengdu, China. This support will make participation in CompEd 2019 more affordable. CompEd conferences will be held in developing countries in Asia, Africa, South America and other areas of the world in which few computing science education faculty members currently collaborate. Involvement in this conference will enable U.S. participants to learn from Asian colleagues, especially in the areas of cybersecurity education, virtual learning environments, and algorithm visualization, to share research results, and collaborate with new research partners. \r\n\r\nThe CompEd conference will be approximately 2.5-days long and include 120 ? 240 attendees. ComEd 2019 will be co-located with the ACM Turing Award Celebration in China (TURC) conference, a highly selective international forum on computer science research. The ACM SIGCSE China chapter has traditionally met at TURC but will instead participate in CompEd; breaks will be scheduled to enable CompEd conferees to attend the TURC keynote addresses.  CompEd 2019 will consist of paper, panel, working group, poster, and birds of a feather sessions that target computer science education researchers and practitioners. The ACM Computing Curriculum 2020 Task Force will be held immediately prior to CompEd in Chengdu. Fifty US participants will be selected to receive travel support based on criteria including acceptance of a paper or panel, or leader of a working group, followed in order of lessening importance, acceptance of a poster, lack of institutional or grant funds to cover the cost of attendance, absence of other faculty or graduate students at the applicant's university receiving funds from this project, and faculty ranking.  Assistant professors will have the highest priority, followed by associate professors, graduate students, lecturers, adjuncts, and part-time faculty.  The aim is to engage participants from a variety of US colleges and universities. In the case of multiple US-based authors on a paper, panel, or poster, only one author will receive priority. SIGCSE's annual Innovation and Technology in Computer Science (ITiCSE) conference and its working groups have enabled development of strong working relationships between faculty from US institutions and faculty from European institutions in the past. Those relationships have led to new and joint discoveries across several areas of computer science education. The CompEd project will provide an opportunity for U.S. computing science education researchers and practitioners to develop partnerships with Chinese and other academics that they are otherwise unlikely to meet. It will also provide opportunities to interact with, and develop future partnerships with, counterparts from institutions in the developing world. US computing education will potentially benefit from innovations adopted and adapted from these international exchanges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
