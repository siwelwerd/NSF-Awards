 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many low-income students attend institutions of higher education that do not have the infrastructure to support writing and submitting successful proposals to the federal government. This project will conduct a series of workshops and webinars to help 40 institutions of higher education to prepare and submit effective proposals to the NSF Scholarships in STEM program.  The proposed workshops address the need to support STEM faculty in designing support systems to meet the diverse needs of talented low-income students.  Faculty members in direct contact with students frequently have keen awareness of the challenges faced by talented low-income students in completing STEM degrees. This awareness is especially true for faculty at two-year colleges, teaching intensive institutions, and university branch campuses. Despite their familiarity with student needs, these faculty are often unfamiliar with current effective practices in curricular and co-curricular activities that support student success.  Such practices include: active learning in gateway courses; tutoring, study-groups, and supplemental instruction programs; effective incorporation of industry experiences, internship opportunities, and research participation; and the role community building and peer support in promoting retention and degree completion. The workshops will help faculty to identify critical areas in which their students need support and develop a project plan that unites local institutional needs and opportunities. In addition, the workshops will emphasize projects that both support students and generate knowledge to advance the understanding of factors that affect the success, retention, transfer, and graduation in STEM of low-income students.\r\n\r\nThe project will implement a workshop model that uses an asset-based approach to the professional development of STEM faculty members. The workshop's asset-based perspective acknowledges the faculty's awareness and insights into the challenges faced by talented low-income students at their institutions. Workshop activities will then seek to align existing faculty insights with effective evidence-based practices in STEM education and the requirements of the S-STEM funding program. The workshops will also provide faculty with guidance from a network of educators with experience in the NSF S-STEM program and in supporting academically talented low-income students. The workshops will utilize a regional focus will help to maximize participation by reducing transportation time and costs. This series of workshops and webinars aims to improve the quality of student support structures in proposals submitted to the NSF S-STEM program.  They also aim to advance the S-STEM program goals of increasing the number of academically talented low-income students who complete STEM degrees and enter the workforce, and to generate and disseminate new knowledge about effective practices in STEM education.  This project is funded by the NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically high-achieving students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future scientists, engineers, and technicians, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The project aimed to recruit participants from faculty at institutions that serve a significant population of low-income students, including two-year colleges, teaching-intensive institutions, and university branch campuses.\n\nFaculty members in direct contact with students frequently have a keen awareness of the challenges faced by talented low-income students in completing STEM degrees.  The project aimed to facilitate S-STEM proposal submission by these faculty who have considerable familiarity with low-income students but face challenges in accessing grant support for these students.  The project implemented a workshop model that uses an asset-based approach to the professional development of STEM faculty members.  The workshop's asset-based perspective acknowledges the faculty's awareness and insights into the difficulties faced by talented low-income students at their institutions.  A project goal was to assist faculty less experienced in preparing a proposal to find alignment between student needs and the expectations of the NSF S-STEM program.\n\nThe project developed an online distributed workshop format to facilitate faculty participation.  The initial offering of an in-person 2.5-day workshop was modified to a distributed workshop format using a series of weekly one-hour webinars over a twelve-week period.  The webinars helped participants to develop the major components of an NSF S-STEM proposal.  Participants were assigned individual team mentors with extensive expertise in the S-STEM program and familiarity with evidence-based practices to support student success.\n\nThe project significantly exceeded the original goal of supporting 40 faculty teams.  At the end of the project, a total of 79 teams participated, nearly double the original project goal.  A total of 82 percent of participants completed and submitted S-STEM proposals.  At the end of the project period, final results were available for 40 participant proposals, of which 12 or 30 percent were funded through the NSF merit review process.\n\nEvaluation indicated that the project was successful in meeting participant needs.  Seventy-seven percent of participants felt \"Very Well\" or \"Extremely Well\" prepared to align institutional needs with the goals of S-STEM.  A total of 73 percent of participants felt \"Very Well\" or \"Extremely Well\" prepared to create an overall narrative to unite proposal core topics.  Seventy-two percent of participants felt \"Very Well\" or \"Extremely Well\" prepared to develop a compelling proposal theme.\n\nParticipants rated mentor feedback as critical in increasing the quality of their proposals.  Participants also stated that the webinars provided an appropriate amount of structure to keep them engaged in the proposal submission process.  Two-thirds of the participants reported that the workshop helped them work more effectively as a team.  Two-thirds of the participants also reported that the workshop improved their grant-writing skills \"to a great extent.\" Ninety-seven percent of participants said they are \"Very Likely\" to recommend the program to others.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/30/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gary R Skuse"
