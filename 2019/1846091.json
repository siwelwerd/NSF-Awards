 "awd_abstract_narration": "Efficient wireless communication between energy harvesting sensor nodes can enable greater efficiency and productivity in emergency services, agriculture, smart cities, and defense applications, to name a few.  Enabling this heightened level of sensing has the potential to revolutionize greater understanding of the surrounding environment and the ability to further optimize efficient operation of homes and businesses.  It will also provide early detection of potentially hazardous situations and enable better quality of life for an aging population.  As the number and density of connected devices have increased, electromagnetic spectrum at widely used frequency bands of 5 GHz and below has become increasingly crowded and congested.  At the same time, reducing the power consumption and physical size of each individual sensor node is important to keep the network hardware unobtrusive and more easily deployable. This project seeks to bridge the power and size gap by enabling resource-aware wireless communication network with energy harvesting sensor nodes where available energy can have immense variation and utilize higher frequency spectrum at 24 GHz.  The reconfigurable transceivers of network sensor nodes will be capable of maintaining critical services when available power is scarce while taking advantage of higher power levels when power is abundant, with automatically adaptable roles within the greater network based upon how that available power is distributed.  This project also includes several educational activities such as STEM workshops for K-12 students, research experiences for undergraduates, and course development.  An entrepreneurial seminar and site visit series with local startup companies will provide real examples for undergraduate and graduate students to learn how to transform laboratory ideas to real-world applications while benefiting their local communities.\r\n\r\nThe project will investigate fundamental challenges at several layers in the hardware hierarchy of wireless sensor network.  These will range from link and network considerations, such as adapting the link requirements based on node- or network-level power availability, down to reconfigurable transceiver blocks that enable higher level functionality in physical layer.  These transceiver blocks include multi-mode receivers that can dynamically trade off power for data rate or sensitivity in real time as well as transmitters that are highly efficient even at significant back-off power levels.  Additionally, the project will push ultra-low power wireless operation to higher frequencies in K-band (e.g., 24 GHz), which alleviates the issue of limited spectrum at lower frequencies, while also allowing for drastically reduced antenna size with the same efficiency. The project will also advance the co-design between the radio electronics and the electromagnetics including impedance matching networks and antennas engineered for low-power, high-frequency, high-impedance conditions.  The fundamental studies and underlying design principles developed in this project will be demonstrated with proof-of-concept wireless sensor nodes.  This project will also advance the implementation of dynamically asymmetric links and role selection in a mesh network of symmetric wireless sensor nodes to optimize the network functionality based on available power.  The research has important impacts because it will bring together traditionally siloed design spaces, and leverage fundamental research within RF, ultra-low power circuits, and antenna design to address critical bottlenecks in deployment of future wireless sensor networks.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
