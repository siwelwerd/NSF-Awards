 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Instrumentation Programs. Professor Valerie Frerichs from SUNY at Buffalo and colleagues Luis Colon, Diana Aga and David Lacy are acquiring a high-resolution gas-chromatograph tandem mass spectrometer (Orbitrap). In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species embedded in complex samples. In a typical experiment, the components flow into a mass spectrometer where they are ionized into ions and the ions' masses are measured. This highly sensitive technique allows the structure of molecules in complex mixtures to be studied. An instrument with a gas chromatograph can separate mixtures of gaseous compounds before they reach the mass spectrometer. The tandem mass spectrometry capabilities increase the ability to identify molecules. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the University and regional area. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse groups of students in research and research training using this modern analytical technique. The number and range of enabled research projects generate and disseminate knowledge. Proficiency using contemporary instrumentation is pivotal to the training of future generations of researchers and students choosing non-scientific which is important in science policy and governance. Increasing early exposure to the process of scientific research is based on models from the NSF funded Center for Authentic Science Practice in Education (based at Purdue University) and from the NSF funded National Center for Case Study Teaching in Science (based at U. Buffalo). Advancement of scientific knowledge in environmental and other areas contributes to the achievement of societally-relevant outcomes.\r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts investigations on the fate, transport, effects, and mitigation of contaminants in the environment and the exploration of enzyme active site modeling, molecular energy science, and catalyst design The mass spectrometer is also used for the identification of synthetic di-oxygenase enzymes and for the study of small molecule activation and generation. The instrument is employed in other projects related to environmental toxins, metabolomics, and mechanistic synthetic studies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "The funding for this project allowed the University at Buffalo, State University of New York (UB), to extend and enable new research and offer new educational opportunity through the acquisition of a Thermo Scientific Q-ExactiveTM GC OrbitrapTM Mass Spectrometer (QE-GCMSMS).  The instrument is available and supported through the University at Buffalo Chemistry Instrument Center (UBCIC), a core analytical laboratory with established access and management policies.  As such, the QE-GCMSMS is available to researchers, students, and collaborators of our university community.  The project's principal investigators are from the Department of Chemistry, College of Arts &amp; Sciences (CAS).  In addition to the Department of Chemistry, researchers currently using the QEGCMSMS are from the Department of Biology, from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), and include collaborators from outside of UB. \n The project's primary impact is the broad availability and support of new analytical capability for research and education.  The instrument addressed an immediate need for non-targeted analysis of a broad range of identification to quantitation projects, high resolution/accurate mass (HRAM) targets, tandem mass spectral molecular structure identification, and analysis from broad, complex liquid and gas mixtures, with confident spectral library matching. The QE-GCMSMS is the best-equipped instrument available to meet these needs and propel forward impactful research. An added advantage of this instrument is its straightforward user interface, which makes it a superb fit for UBCIC's shared use management option and allowed incorporation into the teaching laboratory program. The regionally unmatched analytical capability not only allows new research, but also provides first-hand experience for undergraduate and graduate students relevant to their future careers. \n Current researchers using the QE-GCMSMS have projects that span multiple disciplines including chemistry, biology, engineering, materials science, environmental studies, medicine, metabolic studies, and new fuels, among others.  Targeted and non-targeted qualitative and quantitative analyses are possible, making this instrument applicable to many projects.  As such, newly developed workflows for one project are applicable to a broad range of other scientific work, expediting development for the next project.  Ten laboratories and twenty-one projects have utilized the QE-GCMSMS to some extent.  Advances have been realized for multiple projects.  For example, in Dr. Diana Aga's group the QE-GCMSMS is used to investigate the fate of volatile toxins in the environment, including per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and organophosphate flame retardants, with applications to wearable sample collection devices.  In another research group led by Dr. David Lacy, the QE-GCMSMS guides the development of E-selective alkyne semihydrogenation routes using MnCl3 reagents.  Dr. Timothy Cook's group uses the QE-GCMSMS in their studies of high-energy density hydrocarbons. The work aims to use biosynthetically accessible chemical feedstocks to synthesize sustainable, energy dense, liquid hydrocarbons for aviation-based applications.  And in another project, Dr. Zhen Wang's group uses the instrument to investigate compounds elucidated from modified plant species, including cardiac medicines.  Since structure elucidation and confirmation are key components to many of these research projects the included structure library and search engine is an important advantage. \n\n The number of students and researchers trained in the theory and use of the instrument continues to grow.  The instrument is integrated into the experiment curricula of four undergraduate teaching laboratories, providing hands-on experience and valuable preparation for these future chemistry professionals.  Graduate, undergraduate, and post-doctoral level researchers from multiple departments are fully trained operators.  These research laboratories span several departments, encouraging a growing userbase and new methods developed on the QE-GCMSMS.\n\n The intentional placement of the QE-GCMSMS in a university-wide core laboratory with a well-established infrastructure facilitates a broad impact for the training, development and research outcomes generated by a growing userbase.  Not only was the analytical technology new to UB, but the supportive data processing and expertise was non-existent prior to this project's funding.  The permanent staff of the UBCIC provide consistency in training, and those using the QE-GCMSMS are connected through an existing online course management platform with training and support resources.  The UBCIC continues to train new collaborative teams that produce knowledge and provide valuable learning experiences based on the use of the QE-GCMSMS.   The extension of these networks permeates through several research projects and teaching laboratory experiences.  The acquisition of the QE-GCMSMS addresses the need to expand and initiate a wide variety of multi-disciplinary work, providing tremendous potential to build a breadth of scientific knowledge and facilitate training at multiple levels.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/28/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Valerie Frerichs"
