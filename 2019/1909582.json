This project will extend the capabilities of the Southern Connecticut Stellar Interferometer (SCSI), a two-telescope instrument that can measure the sizes of bright stars. Because SCSI is based on a different method than most multi-telescope instruments in use today, the science that is enabled by the project will be different than what has been done in the field to date. For example, SCSI can easily observe in blue light, a wavelength range in which it is harder for other existing instruments to be efficient due to the effects of turbulence in the air. The project will also provide for the training of physics students and public observing events at Southern Connecticut State University.\r\n\r\nSCSI yields extremely high-resolution information about stars by precisely timing the arrival of photons at each telescope station and comparing the data streams after the fact, a technique known as intensity interferometry.  The project will yield three significant improvements to SCSI. First, it will increase the number of telescopes used from two to three, something that is necessary in order to go beyond measurements of stellar size and obtain a true imaging capability. Second, new electronics will be used to attempt to demonstrate that the instrument can be successfully used in a wireless mode. If this is achieved, then the distance between the three telescope stations can be increased dramatically, leading to the capability for obtaining much finer image detail. Third, the sensitivity of the instrument will be significantly improved by using more detectors and increasing the amount of light that can be collected. Fainter stars will therefore be successfully observed. The education and public outreach enabled by the award will help serve the need for highly-educated, research-capable science and engineering professionals in Connecticut and the Northeast and stimulate interest in science both among K-12 students and the general public in the New Haven community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
