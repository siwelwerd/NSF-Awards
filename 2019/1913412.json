 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase I project leverages node-pore sensing with multi-marker screening for viable, functionally-preserved isolation of single urothelial carcinoma of the bladder stem cells. This tool will help enable more comprehensive biomarker discovery and facilitate the development of targeted therapies. Ultimately, this solution will allow for clinical, academic, and industrial researchers to selectively isolate single cells from fragile primary bladder biopsy subpopulations for downstream analysis and personalized treatment development in the longer term. The ability to screen for numerous parameters and isolate target urothelial carcinoma of the bladder stem cells in a walk-up usable, accessible, and low-cost manner will enable downstream functional studies that will help lead to improved patient outcomes. In conjunction with the business opportunity here, there is projected to be a significant positive impact on research output and publications that will be enabled by the introduction of a low-cost urothelial carcinoma of the bladder stem cell isolation instrument to research, industrial/biopharma, and clinical facilities.\r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project involves a multi-parametric approach leveraging label-free node-pore sensing and low-shear microfluidics for viable single-cell sorting and dispensing while preserving viability and functional characteristics for downstream assays. Characterization and isolation of single, live functionally-preserved urothelial carcinoma of the bladder cancer stem cells is pivotal for the determination of universally accepted, clinically-accurate biomarkers for early cancer detection as well as optimized targeted therapy development. This project is aimed at delivering easy access to these cells without requiring extensive experimental design and tuning, enabling operation by untrained, non-expert users. Using the novel detection and isolation methodologies, the platform can be used to unveil masked heterogeneity and enable downstream functional studies (such as growth, invasion, and chemotherapeutic resistance) on individually isolated, viable, and functionally-preserved isolated urothelial carcinoma of the bladder stem cells.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
