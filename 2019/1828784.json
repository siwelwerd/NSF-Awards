 "awd_abstract_narration": "The concept of a radio telescope typically evokes imagery of giant dishes moving in unison, peering towards some small part of the sky. This notion is outdated - the Owens Valley Radio Observatory - Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA) combines the signals from hundreds of small, cheap antennas to image the entire sky instantaneously, representing a revolutionary new generation of radio telescope. The resulting data stream is enormous (12 Petabytes per day), but Moore's Law has finally made it possible to continuously process and distill these data. By imaging all the sky, all the time, the OVRO-LWA can deliver a number of key science goals simultaneously. It can scan thousands of nearby stellar systems for the radio signature of exoplanet magnetospheres, a key ingredient for planetary habitability. It can probe our Cosmic Dawn, the earliest stages of our Universe when the very first stars formed. It will search the sky on nanosecond timescales for evidence of the highest energy cosmic rays, and it will provide continuous monitoring of the Sun (which is relevant for space weather), and Jovian system.\r\n\r\nThis proposed program will progress the OVRO-LWA from a proof of concept to a continuously operational facility, and the most powerful radio telescope on the planet operating at low radio frequencies (<100 MHz). The addition of 64 antennas will extend maximum baselines from 1.5 km to 2.6 km and will improve the snapshot sensitivity of the array by a factor of 3. The telescope receiver electronics will be replaced with a new generation of electronics board that can maintain 80 dB isolation between each of the 704 signal paths (352 dual polarization antennas), an essential requirement for detecting the weak polarized signatures of exoplanets as well as the Cosmic Dawn signal buried within the bright contaminating radio emission of our own Galaxy. The digital backend will be the most versatile instrument ever built for radio astronomy, being able to simultaneously image the entire sky, form 12 high time resolution beams that can be instantaneously repointed in any direction on the sky, and search the raw data from the telescope for cosmic ray radio showers lasting a few nanoseconds in duration. The additional installation of a 4.4 PB storage system will allow the OVRO-LWA to continuously execute these modes of operation simultaneously.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It was about 250 million years after the Big Bang  or about 13.5 billion years ago. So far astronomers have very few observations of this era. With OVRO-LWA, we will look for the signature of neutral hydrogen in the gas between the first galaxies during Cosmic Dawn. The primary challenge for detecting the Cosmic Dawn signal is separating it from other astronomical radio sources in the foreground. There are many strong sources of radio waves in the sky. Our own Milky Way galaxy is the dominant radio emitter seen from Earth. It emits radio waves primarily through synchrotron radiation, which is created by electrons moving at relativistic speeds around magnetic fields in the Galaxy. This emission is more than 10,000 times stronger than the Cosmic Dawn signal. Fortunately, the synchrotron spectrum is well-known and should be distinct from the expected Cosmic Dawn signal.
