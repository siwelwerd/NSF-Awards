 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers have long recognized that population migration is a pivotal process of cultural and technological and ecological change that often has wide-ranging and sometimes cataclysmic consequences for societies. To better understand how human migration influences cultural change and its consequences, researchers have increasingly turned to the archaeological record where known prehistoric migrations were important in forming contemporary societies. The main goal of this project is to gain a better understanding of the catalysts, timing, nature, and consequences of one of the largest human migration events in prehistory - the expansion of Bantu-speaking farmers across Sub-Saharan Africa some 5,000 to 2,000 years ago. To investigate this poorly understood event, this research will focus on excavating Nangara-Komba Rock Shelter in the Central African Republic which spans the critical time period before and after the Bantu expansion. Information generated from this project will speak to broader issues about why populations migrate and the impact incoming populations with new technologies have on indigenous peoples and environments. This collaborative research project brings together researchers from the Central African Republic, a country underrepresented in the sciences, and the United States. The inclusion of American and Central African students in the research supports scholarly and cultural exchange. The project will build intellectual capacity for Central African graduate students who will receive training in archaeological methods that is unavailable in their country. Public outreach activities such as radio interviews, public lectures, blogs and digital media in Central Africa and the US will disseminate the findings and implications of this project to different audiences.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of Bantu-speaking farmers across Sub-Saharan Africa is widely recognized as having a significant and lasting impact on language, culture, demography and technology, as well as the trajectories of contemporary African peoples. Despite its importance, very little is known about the environmental catalysts, exact timing, nature and consequences of this event. Nangara-Komba Rock Shelter is one of the oldest rock shelters in this part of Central Africa with prehistoric occupations spanning from 5,600 years ago into the nineteenth century. Importantly, the site lies in the Sangha River Interval believed by many as an important natural corridor for Bantu migrations into Central African forests. Excavations  in the shelter will yield organic materials that can be used to construct an exact chronology of the site and date when ceramic and iron artifacts associated with Bantu-speaking populations appear. Analysis of artifacts and organic materials will provide crucial information on the lifeways of pre-Bantu indigenous hunter-gatherers and early Bantu-speakers. Comparative analyses of these materials over time will provide information on changes in prehistoric lifeways associated with the expansion of Bantu peoples. Geochemical analyses of sediment from the site and adjacent areas will be used to reconstruct vegetation and climate changes spanning the period before and after the migration. Cumulatively, information from this project will significantly enhance current understanding of migration and Central African prehistory.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The results of this investigation have important implications for current understanding of how prehistoric populations adapted to humid tropical environments, especially forested regions of the Congo Basin. The Central African forest has long been considered a challenging and impenetrable biome for human occupation. Traditional scholarship suggests that tropical rainforests were unable to support permanent human occupation until after the appearance of domesticated foods and iron tools (metallurgy). In Central Africa, the earliest domesticated foods and metallurgy likely appeared with migration of prehistoric Bantu-speakers, who entered the forests some 2000 to 2500 years ago (so-called Bantu migrations). But the timing of these migrations and routes that the Bantu speakers took to enter and spread into the forest remains largely unknown. Current scholarship identifies the Sangha River Interval (SRI), a wooded savanna zone that links savanna's north and south of forested areas, as a potential corridor for Bantu migrations into Central Africa some 2000 to 2500 years ago. Many scholars further believe that the Bantu migration was facilitated by prehistoric climate change some 2500 years ago, which reduced precipitation and created openings in the forest cover. However, these ideas remain largely unevaluated because the past is currently very poorly documented in Central Africa, where archaeological research is generally very limited. This project was focused on gathering prehistoric evidence to evaluate these ideas from Nangara-Komba, a large sheltered archaeological site in Central Africa.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Nangara-Komba is rock shelter measuring some 1800 m<sup>2</sup> and is one of the few known sites situated in the SRI. Previous test excavations showed that the site held great potential for yielding important artifactual and paleoenvironmental evidence that could speak to the timing and nature of the Bantu migration. Archeological evidence from the site collected during this project demonstrates that hunter-gatherers occupied the site by at least 7000 years ago. At that time, this area was likely surrounded by rainforest and very different from the current vegetation that surrounds the site, which is largely a wooded savanna. Thus, the site shows that forested regions were occupied by hunter-gatherers before the advent of domesticated foods and metal tools. Paleoenvironmental evidence from the site also shows surprisingly very little ecological change over time and demonstrates the existence of stable biomes within the Sangha River Interval that did not change in response to climate change. Finally, the site shows evidence for very early ceramics (2500-3000 years BP) that are usually associated with the Bantu migration. This is much earlier than previous estimates for the appearance of ceramics in this area.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As part of this research, we engaged in educational activities aimed at the public by giving lectures about prehistory and archeology to local villages. To reach a broader audience, we gave interviews discussing African prehistory and the project to local radio and television stations in the Central African Republic. In the United States, we have organized at least two public lectures through Southern Methodist University and the University of Nevada (Reno) discussing the results of the project and its importance of African prehistory. Although this project is limited in scope, we helped build local research capacity by training a Central African MA student from the Universit? de Bangui in field and laboratory methods.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/01/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Karen&nbsp;D&nbsp;Lupo</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1838500/1838500_10585165_1575233946492_N-Kfig3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1838500/1838500_10585165_1575233946492_N-Kfig3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Rock art at Nangara-Komba\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1838500/1838500_10585165_1575233946492_N-Kfig3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Rock art at Nangara-Komba\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A sample of the rock art panels associated with Nangara-Komba</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Karen Lupo</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Karen&nbsp;D&nbsp;Lupo</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Rock art at Nangara-Komba</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1838500/1838500_10585165_1575233811578_N-Kfig2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1838500/1838500_10585165_1575233811578_N-Kfig2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Nangara-Komba\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1838500/1838500_10585165_1575233811578_N-Kfig2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Nangara-Komba\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Overview of the site</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jean-Paul Ndanga</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Karen&nbsp;D&nbsp;Lupo</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Nangara-Komba</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
