 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry is funding Dr. Qin Yang from University of New Mexico to develop conjugated polymers that contain carbon-carbon double and triple bonds.  The double and triple bonds enable conjugated polymers to conduct electricity.  Since conjugated polymers contain tens of thousands of double and triple bonds, the polymer's conductivity can sometimes surpass that of common metals such as copper or aluminum.  In this research, conductive polymers are constructed that contain not only carbon-carbon double bonds and triple bonds as well as other chemical elements such as boron, sulfur and phosphorous, among others.  Professor Yang's strategy creates a new class of polymeric materials that have never been prepared before to improve the next generation of optoelectronic devices such as solar cells and light emitting diodes.  The broader impacts also include the involvement of Native American and Hispanic communities in research and education.  Students are trained in synthetic chemistry and polymer science and have the opportunity to participate in the renewable energy industries. \r\n\r\nThis project focuses on the synthesis of polymeric carbyne mimics and main-group element-containing conjugated polymers derived from trans-enediyne monomers.  The research activities are centered on the design of unconventional conjugated polymers that target limitations in conventional materials.  A new synthetic methodology is also developed to systematically produce poly(heteroarylene vinylene)s containing various main-group elements.  Such materials possess unique properties originating from the heteroatoms that are  not found in conventional hydrocarbon materials.  The synthetic methodology significantly differs from conventional metal coupling reactions that yield conjugated polymers with only aromatic fused rings.  Research activities resulting from this award are expected to  impact the fields of polymer synthesis and optoelectronics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
