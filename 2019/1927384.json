 "awd_abstract_narration": "While longevity is often described as a uniquely human trait, other apes like chimpanzees also have extended lifespans, living twice as long as monkeys or lemurs. However, we don't fully understand the effects of aging on apes in the wild or which aspects of human longevity are unique. This doctoral research project will investigate how wild male chimpanzees age physiologically and behaviorally with a focus on how aging impacts foraging ability, which may reveal how frailty impacts fitness. The findings will help clarify whether chimpanzees' feeding behavior and performance change with age, and whether foraging could play an important role in shaping their patterns of senescence. This research will fill gaps in our knowledge on the senescence of male primate skeletal biology and may help to clarify whether fertility maintained late in life contributes to the evolution of extended lifespan. The investigators will engage in educational activities in the United States and near the research site in rural Uganda, and foster international research collaborations and capacity building. In addition, the continued presence of researchers in Kibale National Park helps protect one of the last tropical rainforests in all of East Africa, which is notably one of the principal strongholds of chimpanzees in this area.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will investigate aging in male chimpanzees living in an exceptionally large community at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda. The investigators will assess the physiological traits of adult male chimpanzees at various ages to assess how bone density, body mass, chewing ability, and energetic status may decrease in old age. To this end, the research will non-invasively collect and analyze fecal samples to assess chewing efficiency as well as urine samples to measure insulin biomarkers (an indicator of energetic status) and collagen biomarkers to investigate decreases in bone density. Behavioral observations will also be carried out to assess how these physical changes may impact movement, food selection, ingestion rates, mating effort, and sociality. Through a systematic study of aging male chimpanzees' physiology and behavior, this research aims to elucidate the processes of aging and its impact on fitness in wild animals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Humans lived long lives well before the advent of modern medicine. Yet our long lifespans are not unique in the animal kingdom. Our closest relatives, other apes like chimpanzees, live twice as long as monkeys or lemurs.

Yet laboratory conditions are different from those experienced by wild animals, whose environments alter both the nature and magnitudes of the forces that result in aging. This project provides important data on functional senescence in the wild where limited resources constrain and affect behavior. Without direct observational studies of wild populations, it is unclear how aging physiologies translate into declines in fitness. To understand the evolution and ecology of senescence, our project explored how senescence manifests in a natural system.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>We carried out this project on aging in male chimpanzees at Ngogo in Kibale National Park, Uganda from August 2018 through August 2019. In subsequent laboratory analyses, we examined the properties of chimpanzee fecal samples to assess food processing, and also urine samples to assay for biomarkers of energetics and the hormone testosterone. We produced three main findings: First, foraging performance declines with age due to decreases in food processing, so old age chimpanzees may face new energetic challenges; Second, old male chimpanzees are able to maintain physiological condition, perhaps by decreasing particularly costly energetic behaviors like traveling; Third, old male chimpanzees are more social with other adult males, even during poor food periods.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Foraging senescence in chimpanzees</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>We investigated foraging behavior because declines in foraging proficiency with age, or foraging senescence, have been documented across animal taxa, but evidence from primates is limited.

Our findings support the idea that organisms' ability to extract energy from their environments could play an important role in shaping late-life fitness. We show that foraging declines signal senescence, but it remains to be seen whether they represent a driver that precipitates further deteriorations under new time or resource limitations in old age.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Trade-offs in old age</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>In a food-abundant environment, we found that old male chimpanzees showed no declines in either energetic status or testosterone as measured by urinary assays.

As in earlier findings, we do not see evidence for frailty in old chimpanzees as experienced in humans, yet declines in certain behavior may indicate that late-life behavior is still constrained by senescence.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Social aging</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Because prior work found that old male chimpanzees are more social, but also more likely to be solitary, we examined whether these changes in foraging performance and activity were linked to sociality. Older chimpanzees were indeed more social: they were less likely to be alone and spent more time in proximity to more conspecifics, particularly other adult males from whom they received more grooming. In contrast to our hypothesis, during poor quality food seasons when chimpanzees spent more time foraging, old chimpanzees were more social, especially with adult females. This was surprising because increased sociality should be more costly to old males, especially during poor quality food seasons. Thus, as male chimpanzees age, increased energetic costs particularly from foraging senescence may generate new trade offs, yet males manage to ?age-gracefully? by shifting their behaviors and potentially, reproductive tactics in the face of shifting payoffs.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Throughout the course of this research, we were engaged with members of the local community around Kibale National Park, Uganda.
