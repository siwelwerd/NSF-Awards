 "awd_abstract_narration": "This student travel grant will enhance the education of selected US graduate students in the research area of Logic Programming and Nonmonotonic Reasoning. This will be realized by enabling them to attend the 15th International Conference on Logic Programming and Nonmonotonic Reasoning (LPNMR19) and its Doctoral Consortium (LPNMR19-DC), which will include specially organized events for these students.  An important focus of the conference is to improve student education in the field of Logic Programming and Nonmonotonic Reasoning (LPNMR). The conference brings together prominent researchers in the area. Student participation in this conference will help develop the next generation of LPNMR researchers by enabling students to meet senior researchers at the conference and take part in face-to-face discussions with them.  \r\n\r\nThis activity furthers technological advancement in the area of LPNMR, which is currently seeing substantial industrial interest. In particular, this edition of the conference seeks to stimulate education opportunities and interdisciplinary collaborations between LPNMR researchers and researchers from both neighboring communities and areas that may yield fruitful collaborations, such as deep learning, robotics, cybersecurity, cyberanalytics, cyber-physical systems, and human-aware AI. This edition of the conference is organized under the Philadelphia Logic Week 2019 umbrella, which hosts not only LPNMR and its workshops but also the 3rd International Workshop on the Resurgence of Datalog in Academia and Industry (Datalog 2.0). Supporting the educational mission of the conference will bring long-term benefits to both industry and academia.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
