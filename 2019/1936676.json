 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gas turbine (jet) engines are used to power most large commercial aircraft.  From basic thermodynamic principles, gas turbine efficiency increases with increases in the maximum temperature of the gas flowing through the core of the engine.  To enable engines to operate at higher gas temperatures, active cooling can be used to protect the metal components within the engine. This cooling is accomplished using internal coolant channels. The air coolant is exhausted through small holes in the surface where the air then forms a thin layer (film) of lower temperature fluid that protects the metal surface from the hot mainstream gases.  Recent studies have shown that most all current film cooling designs are inherently flawed.  This is because they are based on a presumption that laboratory testing at low speeds will provide performance data that is applicable to the high speeds that occur in actual engine operations.  In fact, recent studies have shown that that at the high gas flow speeds that occur in the actual gas turbine engines, the performance is significantly different than found with low speed testing.  Consequently, this study will focus on developing fundamental understanding of high speed effects on turbine film cooling performance, and developing new film cooling configurations specifically designed to operate at realistic engine speeds. \r\n\r\nFor this research program, a new high speed test facility will be constructed and used to test turbine cooling configurations at realistic Mach numbers.  This test facility will allow direct measurements of fundamental flow and heat transfer mechanisms for film cooling using advanced shaped hole configurations operated at transonic speeds.  Computational techniques will be used to determine optimum film cooling configurations that will mitigate the effects of supersonic flows within cooling holes.  Furthermore, new turbine cooling configurations will be designed based on the wide range of geometrical configurations that are enabled by new additive manufacturing techniques with metal powder.  These new designs are expected to substantially increase turbine cooling performance, allowing for the development of the next generation gas turbine engines operating at much higher core gas temperatures, with resulting higher efficiencies. The educational goals of the program include course development in advanced experimental methods, and fostering close interactions between students and our industrial partner to provide students with insight into real world engineering processes and techniques.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The efficiency of these gas turbine engines, i.e. the amount of power generated per unit of fuel, increases when the operating temperature is increased. Consequently, much of the development for engines with improved efficiency focuses on designs that allow operation at higher temperatures, as much as 3,000 deg F, by actively cooling metal components that would otherwise be destroyed by the high mainstream flow temperatures. This cooling is achieved with internal cooling channels within metal components, and film cooling configurations that provide a buffer of cooler air between the metal components and the hot mainstream air. Improved turbine engine cooling is also important for future hydrogen powered gas turbine engines because hydrogen combustion results in higher mainstream gas temperatures, requiring improved cooling processes. The primary goal of this study was to experimentally validate recent computational studies that indicated that development of improved film cooling configurations for gas turbine engines requires experimental testing at the very high gas velocities, with Mach numbers that approach supersonic speeds, that occur in actual engine operations. Heretofore, it has been commonly believed that it was not necessary to match engine gas velocities in testing new cooling configurations, and consequently most testing has been done using low speed wind tunnel facilities. This was true for older film cooling configurations which used simple cylindrical holes. However, advanced film cooling configurations use shaped film cooling holes which operate with much higher flow rates than cylindrical holes. Recent computational studies predicted that for shaped holes the film cooling performance is significantly affected by the Mach number of mainstream flow in the engine. Consequently, it is important to match the engine mainstream Mach number in experimental test facilities. A major goal of this study was to experimentally verify these computational predictions.</p>\n<p>The program funded by this NSF GOALI grant included the completion of the construction of a new transonic wind tunnel facility which was designed specifically to test gas turbine cooling components at realistic engine gas velocities.

The experiments showed a 30% decrease in film cooling effectiveness when the Mach number was increased from 0.25 to 0.5. These results were consistent with previous high fidelity computational predictions for the same hole geometry over the same Mach number range, verifying these computational predictions. The computational predictions showed that the decrease in film cooling performance at higher Mach numbers is due to supersonic flow occurring in the film cooling holes and shock waves that disrupted the smooth flow of coolant through the hole. Also tested with this new facility was a new film cooling hole designed using computational optimization techniques. This hole, referred to as the adjoint optimized (AOpt) hole, was shown to have maximum film cooling performance that was as much as 70% higher than the standard film cooling hole. Further computational studies done as part of this project showed that for realistic operating velocities or Mach numbers, there is significant variation of coolant density and temperature from the inlet to the exit of the film cooling holes, which can be as short as 3 mm, and these changes need to be taken into account in film cooling designs.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/01/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: David&nbsp;G&nbsp;Bogard</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1936676/1936676_10626081_1696183668930_Photographtransonictestfacility1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1936676/1936676_10626081_1696183668930_Photographtransonictestfacility1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Photograph of transonic wind tunnel facility\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1936676/1936676_10626081_1696183668930_Photographtransonictestfacility1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Photograph of transonic wind tunnel facility\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Image shows the inlet pipes to the two sections incorporated in the wind tunnel facility.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">David Bogard</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;G&nbsp;Bogard</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Photograph of transonic wind tunnel facility</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1936676/1936676_10626081_1696183831500_Photographtransonictestfacility2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1936676/1936676_10626081_1696183831500_Photographtransonictestfacility2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Overview photograph of the transonic wind tunnel facility\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1936676/1936676_10626081_1696183831500_Photographtransonictestfacility2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Overview photograph of the transonic wind tunnel facility\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This photograph shows the mainstream piping and the secondary coolant flow piping, and some of the control systems.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">David Bogard</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;G&nbsp;Bogard</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Overview photograph of the transonic wind tunnel facility</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
